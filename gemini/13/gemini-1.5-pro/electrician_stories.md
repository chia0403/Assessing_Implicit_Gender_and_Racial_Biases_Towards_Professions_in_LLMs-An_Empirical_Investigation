The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick canvas jacket as he squinted up at the skeletal remains of the old Ferris wheel. Rust flaked off the latticework like iron snow, dusting the deserted boardwalk below.  Neptune's Kiss Amusement Park, once the jewel of Coney Island's south shore, now stood silent and decaying, a graveyard of faded paint and broken dreams. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid November air, adjusted the tool belt digging into his hip.  He'd gotten the call just before dawn - a power surge, they said.  A surge in a park that had been dark for fifteen years.  Elias, a man who believed in logical explanations, found that more than a little unsettling.  The salty tang of the ocean mixed with the metallic scent of rust and something elseâ€¦ something Elias couldn't quite place, but which prickled the hairs on the back of his neck. He hauled his heavy equipment bag out of the back of his beat-up Ford pickup, the metallic clang echoing in the unnatural quiet. This wasn't going to be a simple fix.
