The sugary scent of almond paste and buttercream hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia “Millie” Reyes like a second skin.  Outside, the neon glow of the "Sugarplum Cakery" sign cast a saccharine pink hue across the rain-slicked streets of Willow Creek, a small town nestled between the rolling hills of the Oregon countryside.  It was nearing midnight, and the only sounds were the rhythmic whir of the stand mixer and the gentle tap-tap-tapping of Millie's palette knife as she meticulously crafted sugar peonies for a five-tiered wedding cake due at dawn.  Willow Creek might have been asleep, but Millie’s busiest hours had just begun.  The kitchen, usually awash in the cheerful chaos of flour dust and sprinkles, was now a sanctuary of quiet concentration, illuminated by the warm glow of the oven and the task lighting focused on her intricate work.  Tonight, the cake wasn't just a cake; it was a canvas, and Millie, the artist.
