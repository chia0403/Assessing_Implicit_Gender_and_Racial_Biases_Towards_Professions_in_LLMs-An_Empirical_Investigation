Smoke curled lazily from the chimney, promising the comforting scent of coffee and woodsmoke, a small beacon in the vastness.  This morning, however, the promise of warmth held little solace.  A shadow heavier than the approaching storm clouds hung over Amelia and her ranch, a threat she couldn't quite grasp but felt with a chilling certainty.
