The biting November wind whipped off the East River, rattling the paned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's Upper East Side apartment.  Twenty-two stories below, the city thrummed with a frenetic energy Elias rarely felt anymore. He’d traded the chaotic pulse of life on the streets for the sterile, controlled environment of the operating room.  Tonight, however, even the triple-glazed windows couldn’t quite keep the city’s anxieties at bay.  A thin, insistent sliver of pre-dawn light was just beginning to paint the sky a bruised purple, and Elias, still in his scrubs from a grueling double shift at Lenox Hill, stared down at the restless cityscape.  A half-eaten container of lukewarm takeout sat on the marble countertop, a testament to a dinner interrupted by a midnight call to the hospital.  His reflection in the window, overlaid on the city's grid, looked gaunt and pale, a ghost haunting the edges of his own life.  The phone buzzed beside the takeout container, jarring him from his reverie.  The screen flashed with an incoming call from a blocked number.  A knot tightened in his gut. This couldn't be good.
