The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares filled the air, a symphony unique to the bustling port city of Aethelburg.  A thick, salty mist, a constant companion of this coastal metropolis, clung to the narrow, twisting streets, dimming the gaslights that flickered like hesitant fireflies.  Within a small, warmly lit shop tucked between a fishmonger and a bookshop, Elias Thorne, needle poised mid-stitch, worked diligently under the warm glow of an oil lamp. His shop, "Thorne & Thread," was a haven of quiet amidst the city's clamor, filled with the comforting scent of aged wood, beeswax, and the faintest whisper of lavender from the sachets Elias placed strategically amongst the bolts of fabric.  Rich velvets, shimmering silks, and sturdy wools lined the walls, a vibrant tapestry reflecting the diverse clientele that sought out Elias's renowned skills. Tonight, however, the shop was empty, save for Elias and the rhythmic whisper of his needle piercing the fine linen of a gentleman's waistcoat. The clock chimed eight times, and a gust of wind rattled the shopâ€™s front window, a prelude to the storm brewing just offshore.
