Rain lashed against the arched window of Penelope Ainsworthâ€™s design studio, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heartbeat.  Drops, fat and iridescent under the gaslight, raced each other down the panes, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon in London.  Her studio, tucked away on a cobbled mews just off Belgravia Square, was usually a sanctuary of plush velvets, carefully curated antique finds, and the comforting aroma of Earl Grey tea. Today, however, it felt like a gilded cage. The air crackled with unspoken tension, a stark contrast to the usual symphony of rustling fabric swatches and the gentle clinking of teacups.  A single crimson rose, delivered just an hour earlier, lay on her drafting table, a splash of vibrant colour against the parchment sketch of a grand ballroom.  It wasn't the beauty of the rose that unsettled Penelope; it was the absence of a card.
