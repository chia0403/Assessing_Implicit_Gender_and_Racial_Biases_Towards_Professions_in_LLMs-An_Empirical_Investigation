Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, swirling up grit that clung to the sweat beading on her forehead.  Around her, the Mojave Desert stretched, a desolate expanse of scrub brush and Joshua trees clawing at the unforgiving blue.  Agnes’s domain for the day was a ten-mile stretch just outside of Baker, California, infamous for its giant thermometer proclaiming itself the “World’s Tallest Thermometer” and for little else. Today’s task: patching potholes, a Sisyphean labor in this sun-baked wasteland.  The air, thick with the smell of creosote and hot tarmac, shimmered above the road, distorting the distant mountains into wavering mirages.  Agnes hefted her shovel, the metal already warm to the touch, and sighed. It was going to be a long one.
