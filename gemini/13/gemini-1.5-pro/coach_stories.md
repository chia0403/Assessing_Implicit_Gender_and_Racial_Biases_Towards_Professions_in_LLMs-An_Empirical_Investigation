The biting wind whipped across the desolate practice field, carrying the scent of damp earth and the faint echo of shouting.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the bleachers, illuminating only patches of the churned-up mud. Even in late October, the Georgia humidity clung to everything, a damp shroud that promised a bone-chilling evening. Eleanor Vance Mayweather, head coach of the struggling Blackwood High Ravens, jammed her hands deeper into the pockets of her oversized windbreaker, her breath puffing out in white plumes.  She surveyed the scattered group of teenagers, their shoulders slumped with exhaustion and defeat.  Another practice, another catalogue of fumbled passes and missed tackles.  This Fridayâ€™s game against the undefeated Cross Creek Cougars loomed large, a near-certain humiliation hanging heavy in the air like the impending rain.
