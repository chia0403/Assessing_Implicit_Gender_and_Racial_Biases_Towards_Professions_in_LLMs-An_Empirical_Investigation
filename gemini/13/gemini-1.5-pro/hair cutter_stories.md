The biting wind whipped off the Hudson, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes around the ankles of Elias Thorne as he unlocked the door to "Shear Perfection."  The rusty chime above the door announced his arrival with a mournful clang, a sound Elias had grown oddly fond of over the twenty years he’d owned the small barbershop tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller’s parlor in Yonkers, New York.  The shop was small, just three chairs and a cramped waiting area with a perpetually dog-eared copy of Sports Illustrated and a stack of vintage Mad Magazines.  The air always smelled faintly of talcum powder and Bay Rum aftershave, a comforting aroma Elias found himself craving even on his days off.  This morning, however, the familiar scent was tinged with something else, something acrid and unsettling, something like…burnt sugar.
