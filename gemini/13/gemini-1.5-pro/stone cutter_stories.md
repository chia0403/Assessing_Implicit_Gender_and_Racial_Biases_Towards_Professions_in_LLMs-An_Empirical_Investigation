The biting wind whipped down from the Greytooth Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne’s exposed cheeks and turning his breath into fleeting clouds of frost.  He hunched deeper into his thick woolen cloak, the rough fabric scratching against the calloused skin of his neck. Around him, the quarry was a symphony of percussive blows and the rasp of steel against granite.  The air, thick with the scent of dust and iron, clung to the valley floor, trapped by the towering cliffs that clawed at the bruised-plum sky. Nestled against the westernmost cliff face, Thorne’s workshop, little more than a timber-framed lean-to, offered scant protection from the elements. Inside, a single hearth struggled to banish the pervasive chill, casting flickering shadows across half-finished angels, gargoyles, and the occasional cherubic face, all frozen mid-expression in blocks of grey Dunstone. High in the eastern cliffs, the setting sun bled across the freshly fallen snow, painting the landscape in hues of blood orange and violet. This valley, known as the Carver’s Hollow, had been Thorne’s home and his prison for the past twenty years.
