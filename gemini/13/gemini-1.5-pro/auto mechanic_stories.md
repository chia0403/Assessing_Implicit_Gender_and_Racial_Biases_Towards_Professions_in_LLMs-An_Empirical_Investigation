The rusty tang of brake dust mingled with the sweet, greasy scent of WD-40, a perfume Eliza June Holloway knew better than any designer fragrance. Her garage, "Holloway's Hunks of Metal," wasn't much to look at.  Nestled between a laundromat with flickering neon and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada, it was a patchwork of corrugated iron, salvaged wood, and sheer stubbornness. The desert sun beat down on the cracked asphalt outside, baking the air to a shimmering haze. Inside, beneath the single, buzzing fluorescent light, Eliza, her dark hair pulled back in a greasy knot, wrestled with the rusted innards of a '57 Chevy pickup, its faded turquoise paint a ghostly echo of its glory days.  A wrench slipped, scraping her knuckles against the engine block. "Son of a..." she muttered, sucking on the bleeding skin, her eyes fixed on the stubborn bolt refusing to budge. Dustbowl might be a forgotten speck on the map, but in Holloway's Hunks of Metal, Eliza was queen, and she wouldn't be defeated by a piece of rusted metal.
