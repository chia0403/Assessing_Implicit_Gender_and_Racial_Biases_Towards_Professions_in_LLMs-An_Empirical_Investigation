The fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vivienne Moreau's Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the ornate Art Deco windows, blurring the view of the normally bustling Rue de Rivoli in Paris.  Elara, perched on her velvet-upholstered stool behind the sweeping mahogany reception desk, tapped a crimson-tipped nail against the polished surface.  The lobby, usually abuzz with the murmur of multilingual conversations and the click of designer heels, was eerily quiet.  Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional rumble of thunder punctuated the silence.  Elara glanced at the clock: 2:57 pm. Almost time for her break, almost time to escape the oppressive stillness that had settled over the Grand Majestic like a shroud.  She had a feeling, a prickle of unease at the base of her spine, that this peculiar quiet was a prelude to something... significant.
