The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Mart buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow across the aisles of discount candy and lukewarm soda.  Rain lashed against the single windowpane at the front of the store, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a hazy smear.  Elara Jane Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, sighed and leaned against the counter, its surface sticky with spilled cherry cola.  It was 11:57 pm on a Tuesday, and the only company she had was the rhythmic beep of the scanner and the persistent drumming of the rain.  Outside, the desolate stretch of Highway 17 stretched into the inky blackness, swallowed by the storm. The Quick Mart, a lonely beacon in the vast emptiness of the Nevada desert, was Elara's kingdom for the night.  And tonight, her kingdom felt particularly bleak.
