Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's studio, blurring the already fading London twilight.  Her Battersea flat, usually a haven of meticulously arranged colour palettes and tactile textures, felt besieged by the storm.  Raindrops traced erratic paths down the panes, mimicking the frantic scribbles Gen was making on a notepad overflowing with fabric swatches and paint chips.  The St. Giles Hotel renovation was proving to be a certifiable nightmare.  The client, a notoriously fickle Russian oligarch with a penchant for gold leaf and taxidermied peacocks, had changed his mind about the lobby’s colour scheme for the fifth time that week, leaving Gen feeling less like a respected interior decorator and more like a glorified crayon wrangler.  A sigh escaped her lips, the sound swallowed by the drumming rain and the mournful howl of the wind that snaked its way in through the slightly ajar window.  This was not how she envisioned spending her Friday evening.  She'd much rather be curled up with a good book and a glass of Merlot, but Mr. Abramovich’s millions, and the potential boost to her career, were a powerful motivator.
