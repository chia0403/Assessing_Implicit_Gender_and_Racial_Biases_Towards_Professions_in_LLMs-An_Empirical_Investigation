The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the grey November drizzle outside.  Rain lashed against the window, obscuring the view of the normally vibrant maple tree that dominated the courtyard of Ashwood High.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a pen against her blotter, the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* echoing the dull ache in her temples.  College application season was in full swing, which meant her office, usually a haven of quiet contemplation, had become a revolving door of anxieties, aspirations, and the faint, lingering scent of teenage desperation.  Today, however, felt different.  A stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and a premonition in Eleanor's gut that told her this particular Monday was about to become anything but ordinary.
