The aroma of bay rum and talcum powder hung thick in the air, a comforting, slightly medicinal perfume that permeated every inch of Alfie "The Blade" Higgins' barbershop.  Located on the corner of Bleecker and Mercer in Manhattan's West Village, "Higgins' High and Tight" wasn't much to look at from the outside. The paint on the brick facade was chipped, the awning faded to a ghostly whisper of its original red and white stripes, and the single, flickering neon "OPEN" sign buzzed with the erratic energy of a trapped wasp. Inside, however, was another story.  Leather chairs, worn smooth by generations of fidgeting backsides, lined the wall. Gleaming chrome and steel tools, meticulously arranged, winked under the warm glow of vintage barber lamps.  This wasn't just a place to get a haircut; it was a sanctuary, a confessional, a microcosm of the ever-evolving city that pulsed just outside its dusty windowpanes.  It was Tuesday morning, the slowest day of the week, and Alfie Higgins, his own salt and pepper hair slicked back with pomade, stood polishing a straight razor, his mind already anticipating the stories his customers would bring with them that day.
