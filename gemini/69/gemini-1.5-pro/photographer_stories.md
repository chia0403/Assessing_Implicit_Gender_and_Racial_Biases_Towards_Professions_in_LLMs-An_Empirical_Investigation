The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Reyes's dark hair across her face, stinging her cheeks as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of Cadwaladr Cliff.  Below, the churning Irish Sea gnawed at the rugged coastline of Anglesey, its slate-grey waves mirroring the brooding sky above.  Mia, bundled in a thick wool coat and fingerless gloves, ignored the cold, her focus entirely consumed by the dramatic vista unfolding before her.  Her Nikon D850, heavy in her hands, felt like an extension of her own vision, its lens capturing the raw, untamed beauty of this remote corner of Wales.  The setting sun, a bruised plum colour, cast long, skeletal shadows across the windswept landscape, painting the grassy headland in hues of lavender and deep green.  This was exactly the kind of melancholic beauty Mia sought, the kind that whispered stories of ancient lands and forgotten legends.  She’d travelled halfway across the world for this, leaving the bustling streets of New York City for the solitude of this windswept isle, driven by a single photograph she'd seen in a dusty antique shop – a faded image of Cadwaladr Cliff shrouded in mist, its secrets beckoning.
