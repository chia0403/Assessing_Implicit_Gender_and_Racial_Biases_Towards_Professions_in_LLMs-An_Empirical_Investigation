The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her worn, but beloved, tweed coat tighter around herself, the collar scratching against her throat.

The bulbs flickering around its edges sputtered a pale imitation of glamour, casting long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Bleak Harbour, a small, forgotten coastal town where hope, like the fishing industry, had long since dried up.  Eleanor, however, saw not decay, but possibility. This crumbling theatre, with its dusty velvet seats and the faint scent of forgotten performances clinging to the air, was her canvas, and the upcoming production of "The Tempest" her masterpiece waiting to be unveiled.
