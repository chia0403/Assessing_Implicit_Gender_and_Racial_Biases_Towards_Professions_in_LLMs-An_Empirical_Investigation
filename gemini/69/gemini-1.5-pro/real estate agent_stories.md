The crisp October air nipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheeks as she wrestled a "SOLD" sign into the frozen ground in front of a sprawling Victorian on Hemlock Lane.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt umber and rusty gold, swirled around her ankles. Ashton Falls, nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, was a picture postcard come to life, especially in autumn. But for Amelia, the vibrant foliage masked a simmering unease.  This sale, a magnificent property boasting stained-glass windows and a widow's walk with breathtaking views of the Green Mountains, should have been a triumph.  It was, after all, the biggest commission sheâ€™d landed since opening Hawthorne House Realty two years prior. Yet, the imposing house seemed to hold its breath, waiting, and a faint scent of woodsmoke, out of place on this windless day, clung to the air.
