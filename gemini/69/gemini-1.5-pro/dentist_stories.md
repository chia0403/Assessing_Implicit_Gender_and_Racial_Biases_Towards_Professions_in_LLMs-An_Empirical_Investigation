The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine.  The salty air, usually a comforting balm, felt like tiny needles against his cheeks.  His leather satchel, heavy with dental instruments, thumped against his hip in time with his brisk steps. Port Blossom, nestled between the granite cliffs and the churning Atlantic, was a town steeped in maritime tradition â€“ a place where lobster boats bobbed alongside yachts, and the scent of brine mingled with the sweet fragrance of baking blueberry pies. Elias, a recent transplant from the bustling city of Boston, had found the transition jarring, yet strangely appealing. The slower pace, the close-knit community, and the breathtaking coastal scenery had begun to weave their charm around him, even if the perpetually overcast sky and the near-constant wind still took some getting used to.  His destination, a quaint, clapboard building painted the color of a faded robin's egg, was just ahead:  Thorne Family Dentistry, established 1902, a legacy he was now tasked with upholding.
