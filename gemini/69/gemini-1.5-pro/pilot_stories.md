The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Petrova's parka as she prepped her De Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  The sun, a pale disc barely cresting the jagged peaks of the Wrangell Mountains, cast long, ethereal shadows across the frozen surface of McCarthy Creek.  The tiny airstrip, little more than a packed-down stretch of snow and gravel carved out of the wilderness, offered a precarious launching pad.  Amelia’s breath plumed white in the frigid air, mingling with the exhaust fumes from the Beaver’s single radial engine. This was no pleasure flight.  She had a crucial delivery to make to a remote geological survey camp nestled deep in the unforgiving heart of the Alaskan interior, a place where even satellite phones were unreliable and a wrong turn could mean the difference between life and death.  The cargo, secured under a thick tarp in the Beaver's float-equipped belly, was both delicate and desperately needed: medical supplies for a critically injured surveyor.  Time was a luxury Amelia didn't have.
