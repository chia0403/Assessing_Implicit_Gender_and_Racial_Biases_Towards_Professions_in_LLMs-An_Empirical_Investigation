The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, exhaling a gust of rain-chilled air and the scent of expensive perfume onto the polished marble floor.  Jasper Theodore Finch, barely seventeen and swimming in a uniform two sizes too big, straightened his pillbox hat and plastered a smile onto his face. It was Friday night, the start of the weekend rush, and the lobby was already a kaleidoscope of fur coats, flashing jewelry, and the clipped tones of affluent voices.  Built in 1928, the Grand Majestic was a monument to art deco extravagance, all gleaming brass fixtures, geometric patterns, and soaring ceilings adorned with frescoes depicting scenes of improbable opulence.  Tonight, the air crackled with an almost palpable energy, a blend of anticipation and barely-concealed secrets that whispered from the plush velvet chairs and echoed in the tinkling of champagne flutes from the Peacock Lounge.  Jasper, clutching a luggage cart with white-knuckled hands, knew from experience that weekends at the Majestic meant anything could happen.
