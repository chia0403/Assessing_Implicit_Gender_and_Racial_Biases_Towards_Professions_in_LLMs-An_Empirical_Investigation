The flickering neon sign of the Stardust Diner cast a lurid, cherry-red glow across Amelia Reyes's face as she leaned against the chipped Formica counter, polishing a coffee mug with a practiced hand.  Grease clung to the air, a thick, shimmering haze perfumed with the scent of frying onions and stale coffee.  It was 2:17 am, the graveyard shift, and the Stardust, a beacon of faded glory on the desolate stretch of Highway 17 just outside of Harmony Creek, Nevada, was almost empty.  The only other occupants were a trucker nursing a lukewarm cup of joe in a booth by the window and two teenagers giggling conspiratorially over a shared plate of fries in the back corner. The desert wind howled outside, rattling the dusty windows and making the diner's ancient air conditioner shudder in protest.  Amelia sighed, the mug gleaming in the dim light. Another slow night.  Another night spent chasing the ghost of a paycheck.
