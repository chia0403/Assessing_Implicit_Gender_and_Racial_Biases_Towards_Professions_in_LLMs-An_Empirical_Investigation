The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford. Gargoyles leered down from the medieval stonework, their granite faces slick with rain.  A thin film of ice crusted the puddles reflecting the warm, inviting glow emanating from the arched windows of the library. Alistair clutched a leather-bound volume of Chaucer under his arm, the scent of old paper and woodsmoke clinging to its pages, a comforting counterpoint to the raw chill in the air.  Inside the library, a fire roared in the hearth, promising warmth and the hushed sanctuary of academia. But Alistair felt a distinct unease, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the cold. Tonight, he was meeting a benefactor, a man shrouded in mystery who had promised a substantial donation to the college's dwindling coffers. A man Alistair instinctively knew would bring more than just money to St. Jude's.
