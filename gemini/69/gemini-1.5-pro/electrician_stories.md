The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, stinging her cheeks and making the thin material of her work gloves feel useless.  Perched precariously on the second-story scaffolding, she squinted at the tangled mess of wiring that snaked across the brick facade of the Grand Majestic Theatre.  Built in 1928, the theatre was a decaying beauty, its ornate terracotta details crumbling, the once-vibrant marquee now a patchwork of rusting metal and flickering, mismatched bulbs.  Amy’s job was to bring the old lady's electrical system, a fire hazard by any modern standard, screaming into the 21st century.  Below her, the normally bustling streets of Alder's Point, Oregon, were deserted, swallowed by the early evening gloom.  The only sound besides the wind was the faint, melancholic howl of a distant foghorn, a constant reminder of the town’s precarious position clinging to the edge of the Pacific.
