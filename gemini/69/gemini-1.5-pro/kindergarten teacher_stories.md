The buttery scent of crayons hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, sweet aroma of Elmer's glue and the slightly less pleasant tang of disinfectant wipes.  Miss Eleanor Ainsworth surveyed her kingdom: brightly colored rugs scattered across the polished wooden floor, miniature chairs clustered around tiny tables, and walls plastered with finger-painted masterpieces.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows of Room 3, illuminating a kaleidoscope of glitter and construction paper.  The kindergarten classroom at Maplewood Elementary was usually a hive of buzzing energy, a symphony of childish chatter and playful squeals.  But today, an unusual stillness settled over the room.  It was the first day back after summer break, and the twenty wide-eyed children perched on their designated spots looked less like boisterous kindergartners and more like a collection of wary, brightly-plumaged birds.  Eleanor, her heart swelling with a familiar mix of anticipation and affection, offered them a warm, welcoming smile.
