The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Blackwood’s face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a battered but beloved ferry boat chugging its way towards Incra Isle.  The Isle, a jagged shard of rock thrusting out of the turquoise Tyrrhenian Sea, shimmered in the afternoon sun, a hazy mirage against the clear Italian sky.  Amelia, her auburn hair braided tight against the wind, adjusted the microphone clipped to her coral-colored linen shirt.  Incra Isle wasn't exactly a tourist hotspot; its appeal lay not in sandy beaches or luxury resorts, but in the crumbling ruins of a monastery said to have once housed an order of prophetic monks. It was Amelia's job, as the island's sole tour guide and de facto historian, to weave those whispers of prophecy and forgotten rituals into a compelling narrative for the handful of adventurous souls who made the journey. Today’s group, a motley collection of backpackers, history buffs, and one suspiciously enthusiastic conspiracy theorist, huddled at the back of the boat, their faces a mixture of anticipation and seasickness.  The air hummed with the promise of a story yet untold, one whispered on the winds and etched in the stones of Incra Isle.
