The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson oak leaves he was raking into a neat pile.  Frost crunched beneath his boots, a stark counterpoint to the rustling of the remaining foliage. He surveyed Mrs. Abernathy's sprawling estate with a practiced eye, noting the skeletal branches reaching towards the iron-grey sky and the browning patches on the normally emerald lawn.  The grand Victorian house, perched atop a hill overlooking the Hudson River in Sleepy Hollow, New York, looked particularly imposing this morning, almost swallowed by the encroaching shadows cast by the dense woods at the edge of the property.  Elias pulled his thick wool scarf higher over his nose, the scent of woodsmoke from a nearby chimney clinging to the crisp air.  Winter was coming, and with it, the end of another landscaping season. He hoped this last job, preparing the Abernathy estate for the cold months, wouldn't unearth any more of the strange whispers that haunted this historic town.
