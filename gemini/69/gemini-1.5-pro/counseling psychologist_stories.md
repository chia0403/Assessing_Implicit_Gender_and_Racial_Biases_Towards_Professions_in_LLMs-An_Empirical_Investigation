His mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in a world of chaos, was littered with half-empty teacups and scattered notes on grief management.

The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from his grandmother, usually a comforting presence, tonight only served to amplify the silence that had settled after his last patient, a young woman wrestling with the recent loss of her father, had left. Elias rubbed his temples, the tension behind his eyes a familiar ache. He knew empathetic listening was a cornerstone of his profession, but some days, the weight of other people's sorrow seemed to seep into his very bones.  This was one of those days.
