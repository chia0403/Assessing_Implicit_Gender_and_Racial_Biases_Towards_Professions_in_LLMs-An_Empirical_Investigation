Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already hazy Seattle skyline into a watercolor of greys and blues.  The twenty-seventh floor offered a spectacular view on clearer days, showcasing the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains beyond, but tonight, the city lights reflected back in the streaming glass, creating a distorted, shimmering cage.  Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering glow of Elias's multiple monitors, casting his sharp features in a stark, electronic light. Empty takeout containers littered the surface of his sleek, black desk, a testament to another marathon coding session.  A half-finished mug of lukewarm coffee sat beside a tangle of charging cables, a forgotten casualty of his intense focus.  Elias, hunched over his keyboard, his fingers flying across the keys, was oblivious to the storm raging outside and the growing mess around him.  He was lost in a world of code, chasing a bug that had been plaguing him for days, a digital phantom haunting the intricate architecture of his latest project.
