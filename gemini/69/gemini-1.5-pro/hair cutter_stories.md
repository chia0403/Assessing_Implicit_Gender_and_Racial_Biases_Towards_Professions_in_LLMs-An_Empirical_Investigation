The rusty scissors, "Snippy" as Elias Thorne affectionately called them, snicked rhythmically, punctuated by the soft hiss of Elias's breath through his teeth. The air in Thorne's Tonsorial Emporium hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting aroma that hadn't changed in the thirty years Elias had been clipping, trimming, and styling the heads of the residents of Harmony Creek. The Emporium itself, nestled between Mrs. Higgins' bakery and old man Hemlock's perpetually dusty antique shop, was a testament to a bygone era. Faded photographs of impossibly coiffed men and women adorned the wood-paneled walls, interspersed with framed newspaper clippings celebrating Elias's various haircutting competition victories (1988 Regional Champion, 1992 State Finalist, a particularly proud moment).  The worn leather chairs, each with its own unique creak and groan, had borne witness to countless whispered secrets, local gossip, and the steady, reliable rhythm of Elias's shears.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Harmony Creek's sleepy main street, hinting at the impending close of another uneventful day. But Elias had a feeling that this day, just like his trusty Snippy, held a sharp surprise.
