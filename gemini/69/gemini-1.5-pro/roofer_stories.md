The tar shimmered, a black mirror reflecting the distorted image of Matthias "Matty" Kowalski. Sweat beaded on his forehead, mingling with the grime already clinging to his skin. July in Cincinnati was a furnace, and the slanted roof of the three-story Victorian on Sycamore Street was absorbing every bit of the sun's wrath.  Shingles crackled under Matty's weight as he shifted his position, the Ohio River a hazy ribbon in the distance, barely visible through the shimmering heat haze rising from the city below.  Heâ€™d been replacing the rotten slate tiles of the Mansard roof for three days now, and the sheer scale of the job was starting to wear him down.  The house, a grand old dame with peeling paint and boarded-up windows, seemed to sigh under the weight of the heat and its own decaying grandeur.  A lonely crow perched on the chimney, cawing into the oppressive silence.  Matty wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of black across his cheek.  He had a feeling this job was going to be more trouble than it was worth.
