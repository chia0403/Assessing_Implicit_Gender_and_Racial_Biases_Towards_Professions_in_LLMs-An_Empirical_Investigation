The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of O'Malley's Auto Repair, stinging the exposed skin of Elias Vance as he wrestled a rusty exhaust pipe from the belly of a '72 Ford pickup.  Grease smeared his knuckles, reflecting the weak, grey light filtering through the grimy windows of the shop. O'Malley's wasn't much – a single bay tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Oregon – but it was Elias's, and within its oil-stained walls, he felt more at home than anywhere else in the world. The scent of gasoline, metal, and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that signaled the start of another day of coaxing life back into broken-down machines.  Harmony Creek itself was a town clinging to the edge of the Cascade foothills, a place where secrets festered beneath the veneer of small-town charm, and the rumble of logging trucks was the town's heartbeat.
