Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Darrow & Wilde Legal Offices, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Boston.  Inside, Amelia Hayes, a paralegal with a penchant for cashmere sweaters and a talent for finding misplaced commas in thousand-page contracts, tapped a restless rhythm on her mahogany desk.  The opulent, if slightly outdated, office usually hummed with activity, but tonight, a pre-Thanksgiving lull had settled, leaving only Amelia and the insistent drumming of the rain for company.  Her boss, the formidable Mr. Darrow, had departed hours ago, promising a return after the holiday with "a case that will make or break us, Hayes." Amelia, perpetually fueled by lukewarm coffee and a pragmatic outlook, doubted any single case could truly break the esteemed firm, but the ominous promise had left a prickle of unease beneath her otherwise placid exterior.  The red light on her phone blinked, indicating a voicemail.  With a sigh, she pressed play, already suspecting it wouldn't be a message wishing her a happy Thanksgiving.
