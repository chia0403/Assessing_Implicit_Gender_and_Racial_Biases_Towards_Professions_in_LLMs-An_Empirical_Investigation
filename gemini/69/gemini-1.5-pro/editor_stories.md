Rain lashed against the attic window of Amelia "Mia" Thorne's Edinburgh flat, a frantic tattoo against the glass that mirrored the frantic tapping of her fingers on the worn keys of her laptop.  Plaster dust, disturbed by the gale, sifted down from the cracked ceiling like a melancholic snow.  Outside, the November wind howled through the narrow wynds and closes of the Old Town, a mournful bagpipe lament echoing the emptiness Mia felt inside.  Her flat, perched atop a crumbling tenement building on Victoria Street, usually offered a breathtaking view of the castle, but tonight, all she saw was a swirling grey curtain of rain.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm tea sat beside her, a testament to the hours she'd spent hunched over the manuscript, the glow of the screen painting her face in an eerie light.  She was, after all, on deadline, and Elias Thorne, renowned fantasy author and Mia's notoriously difficult father, expected his editor, even if she was also his daughter, to deliver perfection.
