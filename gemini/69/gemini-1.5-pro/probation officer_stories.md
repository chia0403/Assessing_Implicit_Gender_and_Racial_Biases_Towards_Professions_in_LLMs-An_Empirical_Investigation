The stale, recirculated air of the Franklin County Courthouse hummed a low, monotonous tune.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the grimy windows, illuminating chipped paint and water stains on the walls.  Eleanor Vance, her badge clipped to the lapel of her sensible navy blazer, tapped a pen against her legal pad, the rhythmic click echoing in the otherwise silent hallway.  It was a Tuesday morning, the kind that dragged on forever, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the low thrum of bureaucratic machinery. Eleanor, a Franklin County probation officer for the last seven years, was waiting outside Judge Mallory's chambers, a stack of files clutched in her hand, each representing a life teetering on the precarious balance of the justice system.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor.  Outside, the oppressive humidity of a Missouri summer hung heavy in the air, promising a thunderstorm later in the day.  Eleanor just hoped it would break before she had to make her rounds.
