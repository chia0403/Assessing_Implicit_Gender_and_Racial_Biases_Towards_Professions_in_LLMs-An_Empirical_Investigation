Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, which seemed fitting given the clientele of The Rusty Mug.  The bar, nestled in the heart of Foghaven, a perpetually mist-shrouded town on the Oregon coast, was more than just a place to get a drink; it was a sanctuary for the broken, the dreamers, and those simply passing through on their way to nowhere in particular.  Tonight, however, even the regulars seemed subdued, their usual boisterous chatter dampened by the relentless downpour.  Behind the worn mahogany bar, Elias Thorne, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back, polished glasses with a practiced hand, his gaze distant, lost somewhere in the swirling grey outside. The scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to everything in Foghaven like the ever-present mist.
