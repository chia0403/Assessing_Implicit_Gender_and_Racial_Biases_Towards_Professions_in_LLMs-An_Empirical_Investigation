The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Blackwood's ankles as she wrestled the heavy oak door of Bracknell Manor closed.  Dead leaves, the colour of rust and bruised plums, swirled around her sturdy brown boots.  Bracknell Manor, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded windows, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning slate-grey waters of the North Sea.  It had been Agnes's domain, her prison and her sanctuary, for the past fifteen years.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of beeswax and woodsmoke, a familiar comfort against the howling gale outside.  The grand hall, with its cavernous ceiling and faded portraits of stern-faced Bracknells, was shrouded in twilight.  Only the flickering embers in the enormous fireplace offered any real warmth.  Agnes, her greying hair pulled back in a tight bun, sighed. Another day, another dusting of secrets within these ancient walls.
