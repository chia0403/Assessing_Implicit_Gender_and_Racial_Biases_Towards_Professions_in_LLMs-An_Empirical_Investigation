Rain lashed against the window of Dr. Elias Thorne’s office, blurring the neon glow of the "Healthy Habits Nutrition Clinic" sign across the street.  Inside, the scent of stale coffee and lemon disinfectant battled for dominance. Elias, his tie loosened and his normally pristine white coat speckled with droplets of rain from his hurried dash inside, tapped a pen against his cluttered desk.  He was surrounded by stacks of patient files, nutritional charts, and half-eaten protein bars – the detritus of a long, frustrating Tuesday.  Greyhaven, Oregon, a town perpetually draped in mist and drizzle, seemed to mirror the persistent gloom that had settled over Elias's practice in recent months.  The once-thriving clinic, a testament to his dedication and passion for holistic nutrition, was slowly but surely losing clients to the trendy new ketogenic diet craze sweeping the nation.  And frankly, Elias, with his focus on balanced meals and sustainable lifestyle changes, felt like a relic in a world obsessed with quick fixes and Instagrammable food.  He sighed, rubbing his tired eyes, and wondered if he'd made a mistake putting down roots in this damp, dreary corner of the Pacific Northwest.
