The late October wind, sharp and smelling of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne as she hurried across the blacktop of Maplewood Elementary. Her sensible brown loafers crunched on stray acorns, a familiar autumnal soundtrack. Maplewood, nestled in the heart of Vermont's Green Mountains, was a splash of vibrant color against the encroaching grey of the approaching winter. Crimson and gold leaves clung desperately to branches, mirroring the bright crayon drawings plastered across Amy's classroom windows. The low, rambling building, built from local stone and wood, hummed with the quiet energy of a Friday afternoon, a collective exhale before the weekend's reprieve. Inside, the muffled thrum of second graders practicing their recorder recital echoed faintly, a melody both charming and slightly off-key.  Amy, juggling a stack of graded spelling tests and a thermos of lukewarm chamomile tea, pulled her knitted scarf tighter around her neck.  This was her fifth year teaching at Maplewood, and despite the long hours and occasional crayon-related disasters, she couldn't imagine being anywhere else. This small school, with its mismatched desks and overflowing library, felt more like home than any place sheâ€™d ever known. But something felt different today, a prickle of unease beneath the familiar comfort.  A black crow perched on the edge of the playground swing set, its obsidian eyes seeming to follow her every move.
