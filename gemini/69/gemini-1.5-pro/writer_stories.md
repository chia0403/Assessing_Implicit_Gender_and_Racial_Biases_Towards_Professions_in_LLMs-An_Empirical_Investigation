The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Zephyr's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the grey expanse of the Atlantic stretching out before her like a wrinkled sheet.  Her cottage, perched precariously on the cliffs of Monhegan Island, Maine, was a tiny, cedar-shingled box, clinging to the edge of the world.  October had arrived, painting the island in shades of rust and gold, and the summer tourists had long since departed, leaving Mia in the company of the resident artists, the stoic lobstermen, and the ever-present wind that howled like a banshee through the narrow, winding lanes.  Inside, a half-finished manuscript lay open on her desk, the words blurring in her mind as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn plot point.  The story, a gothic mystery set in a crumbling Victorian mansion, felt miles away from the raw, untamed beauty that surrounded her.  She needed inspiration, a jolt of something to kickstart her creativity, but the island, usually her muse, felt strangely silent this year.
