The pungent scent of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Genevieve "Gen" Dubois had grown accustomed to.  It mingled with the sweet notes of hairspray and the earthy undertones of henna, creating a unique olfactory cocktail that identified "Gen's Glamorama" from a block away. Nestled between a laundromat perpetually exhaling the scent of hot detergent and a bakery whose sugary emanations fought a losing battle against the chemical onslaught, Gen's salon was a vibrant splash of fuchsia and teal on a otherwise drab stretch of Elm Street in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Louisiana.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and obscuring the view of the deserted street outside.  Inside, however, the atmosphere buzzed with the low hum of hairdryers and the rhythmic snip of Gen's shears as she put the finishing touches on Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s weekly blue rinse.
