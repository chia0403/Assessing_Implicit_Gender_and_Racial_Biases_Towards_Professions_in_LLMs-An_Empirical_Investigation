The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and damp earth through the open window of Amelia Reyes’s Subaru. She shivered, pulling her fleece tighter around her as she navigated the winding, tree-lined roads of Bainbridge Island.  Rain hammered against the windshield, blurring the already fading light of the November afternoon.  Amelia squinted, trying to make out the house number tacked onto a weathered mailbox half-hidden behind a tangle of overgrown ivy. 786. This was it.  Her new client, Mr. Silas Blackwood, lived at the end of this long, lonely drive, in a house that, from what she could glimpse through the dripping branches, appeared to have been swallowed whole by the encroaching forest.  Amelia, a recently licensed occupational therapist specializing in geriatrics, had been warned by her supervisor that Mr. Blackwood was…difficult.  A recluse.  A curmudgeon.  But Amelia, ever the optimist, believed everyone had a story to tell, a life worth engaging with, even if hidden behind layers of prickliness and pain.  She took a deep breath, the damp air filling her lungs, and switched off the ignition. The silence that descended was thick and heavy, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  This was the beginning.
