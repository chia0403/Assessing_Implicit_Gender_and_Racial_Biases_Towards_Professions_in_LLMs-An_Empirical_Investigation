The biting wind whipped across the frost-kissed fields of Hemlock Hollow, tugging at the brim of Jedediah Finch's worn leather hat. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky a bruised purple, but Jedediah was already out, his breath clouding the frigid air as he surveyed his land.  Hemlock Hollow nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, a secluded valley carved out by generations of Finches, and Jedediah, the latest in a long line, knew every dip and swell of the land as intimately as the lines on his own calloused hands. This year, winter had arrived early, clinging to the valley with an icy grip that threatened the meager harvest he'd managed to scrape together.  The old farmhouse, perched on a gentle rise overlooking the fields, offered a small beacon of warmth, smoke curling lazily from its chimney, a promise of hot coffee and a crackling fire.  But Jedediah lingered, a gnawing unease settling in his gut. Something felt different this year, something beyond the early frost and the dwindling stores. The silence, broken only by the whisper of the wind, felt heavy, expectant.  It was the kind of silence that spoke of secrets held close by the ancient mountains.
