The biting wind whipped off the East River, stinging Amelia “Amy” Chen’s cheeks as she leaned precariously out the open back doors of the ambulance.  Manhattan’s skyline, usually a glittering spectacle, was blurred by a persistent, icy drizzle. Below, the flashing red and blue lights of their rig painted the slick asphalt a lurid, strobing purple.  It was 2:17 AM, a Wednesday, and a particularly brutal January was showing New York City no mercy.  Amy, an Emergency Medical Technician with Station 47 in the Lower East Side, pulled her thermal beanie further down over her ears, the wool scratching against the plastic of her headset. The dispatcher's voice crackled through, "…possible cardiac event, male, approximately 60 years old, unresponsive, family performing CPR. Address confirmed, 17 Orchard Street, apartment 4B.  Nearest cross street, Ludlow. Unit 47, respond Code 3."
