The rusted Ford Econoline, affectionately nicknamed "The Kraken" by its owner, Jeremiah Silas Finch, rattled down Juniper Creek Lane, spitting gravel as it went.  Jeremiah winced; The Kraken’s muffler was on its last gasp, just like most of the plumbing in the ramshackle houses lining the street. Juniper Creek Lane was the kind of place where dreams went to rust, clinging to the Louisiana humidity like the Spanish moss draping the ancient oaks. The air, thick and heavy with the scent of magnolia and impending rain, pressed down on the tin roofs and the spirits of the residents. It was a Thursday, the kind of day where the heat made time slow to a crawl, and Jeremiah, despite being accustomed to the oppressive Southern climate, found himself wiping a sheen of sweat from his brow.  His call-out today was to Mrs. Gable’s, whose toilet, according to her frantic phone call, was “possessed by demons.” Jeremiah suspected a less supernatural, and more sewage-related, culprit.
