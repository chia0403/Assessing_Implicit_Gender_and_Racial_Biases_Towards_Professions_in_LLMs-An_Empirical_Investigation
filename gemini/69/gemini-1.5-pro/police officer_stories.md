The relentless Louisiana humidity clung to Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz like a second skin, plastering her dark hair to the back of her neck.

It was just past midnight on a Tuesday, and while most tourists were tucked safely in their hotel rooms, Izzy knew the real New Orleans was just waking up.  Her gaze, sharp and unwavering, scanned the narrow alleyway, searching for any sign of the missing antique dealer, a man whose disappearance had sent ripples of unease through the city’s tightly-knit antique community.
