The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the Sitka spruce, whistling a mournful tune that echoed through the Cascade foothills.  Frost crunched under Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's heavy boots as he surveyed the stand of timber marked for felling. Dawn hadn't yet broken, but a faint pearlescent light bled through the eastern sky, painting the snow-dusted peaks a ghostly lavender.  Jed, his breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted the thick wool cap pulled low over his ears and rubbed his gloved hands together. The air, sharp and clean, smelled of pine resin and damp earth.  This part of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, a rugged and isolated expanse just outside Darrington, Washington, felt like his own private kingdom.  He knew every ridge, every creek, every game trail. He had spent twenty years of his life felling giants in these woods, and the forest, in its own silent way, had shaped him.  Today, however, something felt different.  A strange unease settled in his gut, a premonition he couldn't quite shake off, like the stillness in the air before a storm.
