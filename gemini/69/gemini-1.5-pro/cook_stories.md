Grease splattered across the worn, metal countertops, catching the flickering gaslight and shimmering like misplaced stars. Outside, the crimson sun dipped below a churning sea of clouds, painting the endless expanse of sky in hues of bruised plum and fiery orange.

The Albatross, a luxury liner for the affluent and adventurous, expected nothing less.

He was cooking for a way back home.
