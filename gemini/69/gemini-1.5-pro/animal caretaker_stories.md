The biting wind whipped Elara Thistlewick's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the sprawling grounds of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, stung her lungs with each breath. Elara, bundled in a thick parka and sturdy boots, pulled her woolly hat further down over her ears. The sanctuary, usually a symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves, was hushed beneath the heavy blanket of fresh snow.  Only the rhythmic crunch of her boots and the faint, worried chirping of a lone chickadee broke the silence. The pre-dawn darkness, punctuated only by the distant glow from the main lodge, painted long, skeletal shadows from the towering oaks that gave the sanctuary its name.  This was Elara's favourite time of day, the quiet solitude before the vibrant chaos of the animal kingdom erupted.  Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  JoJo, the sanctuary's elderly orangutan, hadn't been himself lately, and Elara feared the worst.
