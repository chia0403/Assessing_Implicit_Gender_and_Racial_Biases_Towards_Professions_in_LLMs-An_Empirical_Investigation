Rain lashed against the ornate, bay windows of Beatrice "Bea" Hemlock's office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Glasgow.  The rhythmic drumming of water against the glass, usually a soothing sound, only amplified the tension coiled in Bea's shoulders.  Her office, perched on the fifth floor of a sandstone building overlooking George Square, was usually a haven of order.  Ledgers balanced, files neatly stacked, pens aligned in a chrome holder.  Today, however, the meticulously organized space reflected none of its usual serenity.  A half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned on a floral china plate, papers were strewn across her mahogany desk like fallen leaves, and a single, flickering fluorescent light cast long, unsettling shadows across the room. Bea, a chartered accountant known for her unflappable nature and meticulous attention to detail, was staring at a figure on her computer screen, a figure that simply didn't add up.
