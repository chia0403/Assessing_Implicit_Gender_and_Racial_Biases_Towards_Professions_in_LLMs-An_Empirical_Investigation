The flickering fluorescent lights of the Carter & Davies Drafting Office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of pencils on vellum.  Dust motes danced in the pale light that spilled across the long, steel-topped tables, illuminating the meticulously rendered blueprints spread before each draftsman. The air, thick with the smell of graphite and aging paper, hung heavy and still despite the whirring overhead fans struggling to circulate the summer's oppressive humidity. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, leaned closer to his drawing board, a magnifying glass clutched in his left hand. He meticulously inked in the final details of a cross-section of the new Northwood Bridge, each precise line a testament to years of painstaking practice. Outside, the clamor of Philadelphia in 1957 – the blare of car horns, the rumble of trolleys, the distant cries of street vendors – faded to a muted hum, swallowed by the thick brick walls of the building. Inside, the only sounds were the rustle of paper, the click of drafting tools, and the occasional exasperated sigh of a draftsman wrestling with a particularly challenging perspective.  Elias, however, remained oblivious to the distractions, lost in a world of precise measurements and calculated angles, a world built not of steel and concrete, but of lines and shadows.
