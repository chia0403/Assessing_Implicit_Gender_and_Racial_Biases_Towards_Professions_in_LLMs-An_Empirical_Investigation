The salt spray kissed Eliza Vivienne Holloway's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her easel braced against a gust of wind that threatened to send her tumbling into the turquoise waters below.  The rugged coastline of Cornwall, England, stretched out before her, a tapestry of jagged granite cliffs, hidden coves, and crashing waves.  The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange orb dipping towards the horizon, painted the sky in shades of apricot and rose, reflecting brilliantly on the wet sand exposed by the retreating tide. Eliza’s fingers, stained with cobalt and crimson, tightened around her palette knife. This was it. The view she’d travelled across the country for, the inspiration that had haunted her dreams for months.  This untamed beauty, this raw power – she had to capture it, translate it onto canvas before the light shifted and the magic faded.
