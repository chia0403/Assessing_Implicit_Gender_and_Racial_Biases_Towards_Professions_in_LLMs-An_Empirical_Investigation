The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, the sharp sting of antiseptic, and the underlying, pervasive scent of fear. Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for another onslaught of patients.  Tonight, the desert wind howled like a banshee outside, a fitting soundtrack for whatever chaos awaited her within the ER's swinging doors.
