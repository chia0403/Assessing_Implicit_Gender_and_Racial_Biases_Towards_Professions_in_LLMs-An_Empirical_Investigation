The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing ache in his own lower back.  The clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down fish and chip shop on the outskirts of the small, perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually hummed with the quiet murmur of adjustments and the rustling of medical charts. But not tonight. Tonight, only the relentless downpour and the flickering neon sign that proclaimed "Thorne Chiropractic - Spine in Line!" broke the oppressive silence.  Elias, a man whose own posture ironically betrayed his profession, slumped in his worn leather office chair, staring out at the deserted Main Street.  The clock on the wall ticked towards 9 pm, an hour past closing, but he couldnâ€™t bring himself to leave.  Not tonight. Tonight, he was waiting.
