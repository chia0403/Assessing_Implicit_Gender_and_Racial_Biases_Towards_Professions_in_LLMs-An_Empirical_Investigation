The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he trudged across the cobbled lane.  The salt spray, thick as mist, clung to his spectacles, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.

The houses, huddled together against the elements, were built of dark grey stone, their roofs heavy with slate.  From the harbour below, the mournful cries of gulls mingled with the rhythmic clang of boat masts against metal moorings.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholic symphony of the sea was overlaid with a different sound â€“ the insistent, frantic peal of the church bell.  And Elias knew, with a cold dread settling in his stomach, that it meant trouble.
