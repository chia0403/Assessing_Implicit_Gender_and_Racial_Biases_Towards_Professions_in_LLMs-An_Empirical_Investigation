Rain lashed against the grimy window of Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his temples.  Neon light from the Chinese takeout place across the street painted the rain-slicked asphalt in greasy hues of red and green. Elias, his full name Elias Vance Thorne, sat hunched over his desk, the cheap veneer peeling back like sunburnt skin.  His office, nestled above a laundromat on the less glamorous end of Bleecker Street in Manhattan, wasn't exactly the stuff of detective novels. It was small, cramped, and smelled perpetually of stale coffee and Mrs. Rodriguez's industrial-strength lavender detergent from downstairs.  A single bare bulb cast harsh shadows, highlighting the overflowing ashtrays, stacks of unpaid bills, and the half-eaten container of lo mein that constituted his dinner.  The city howled outside, a symphony of sirens and screeching tires, but inside, the only sound was the rhythmic tapping of Elias's finger against a faded photograph of a woman with eyes as blue as the Aegean Sea.
