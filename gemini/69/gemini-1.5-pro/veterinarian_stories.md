The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, carrying the scent of brine and distant sheep.  Rain lashed against the windows of the Dunsandle Veterinary Clinic, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  Inside, Dr. Fiona Moira Oâ€™Malley, her auburn hair escaping its braid and plastered to her cheek, wrestled with a particularly stubborn ewe.  The animal, a prize-winning specimen named Penelope according to its agitated owner, bleated in protest as Fiona attempted to palpate its swollen abdomen.  The clinic, a small, single-story building perched on the edge of the dramatic Connemara coastline in western Ireland, was usually a haven of calm, but lambing season brought a chaotic energy that even Fiona, with her years of experience, found challenging.  Beyond the examination room window, the jagged silhouettes of the Twelve Bens mountains were barely visible through the driving rain, a stark and beautiful backdrop to the drama unfolding within.
