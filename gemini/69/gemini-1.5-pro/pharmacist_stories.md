The incessant dripping from the pharmacy's ancient air conditioning unit was a metronome counting down the seconds until closing time.  Eleanor Vance, Pharm.D., sighed, massaging the bridge of her nose.  The sickly sweet scent of cherry cough syrup hung heavy in the air, a cloying reminder of the relentless parade of sniffles and sneezes that had marched through Vance Family Pharmacy all day. Located in the sleepy, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, the pharmacy was a relic of a bygone era, its shelves lined with vintage apothecary jars and its floorboards creaking with the weight of generations. Outside, the fog was rolling in, thick and grey, swallowing the last vestiges of the setting sun and clinging to the salt-laced air. Eleanor glanced at the clock â€“ 5:58 pm.  Two more minutes until she could lock the doors, silence the dripping, and escape the lingering aroma of cherry. Two minutes, and then something shifted.  The bell above the door chimed, its cheerful jingle jarring in the sudden quiet.  Eleanor looked up, expecting to see Mrs. Henderson, perpetually in need of another refill for her arthritis medication. Instead, a man stood silhouetted against the fog, his features obscured by the deepening gloom.  He carried no prescription, no shopping basket, only a small, leather-bound book clutched tightly in his hand.
