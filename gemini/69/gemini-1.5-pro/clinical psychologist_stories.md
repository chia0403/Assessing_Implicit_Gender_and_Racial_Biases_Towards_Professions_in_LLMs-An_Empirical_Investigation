Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her newest patient. The room, nestled in a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in Ashborough, Massachusetts, usually exuded a sense of calm with its warm, ochre walls, strategically placed potted plants, and the comforting aroma of vanilla emanating from a perpetually lit diffuser. Today, however, the tension was palpable, thick enough to choke on. A young man, barely out of his teens, sat rigidly on the plush velvet armchair, his knuckles white as he gripped the worn wooden arms, his gaze fixed on a swirling pattern in the Persian rug. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, watched him with a practiced eye, her expression a careful blend of empathy and professional detachment. The grandfather clock in the corner chimed five times, its resonant tones swallowed by the insistent drumming of the rain. This was their first session, and Eleanor already knew it would be far from ordinary.
