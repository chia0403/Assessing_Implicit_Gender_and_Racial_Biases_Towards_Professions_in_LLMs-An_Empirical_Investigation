The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research facility hummed a lonely tune for Elias Thorne.  It was 3:17 am, the deepest part of the graveyard shift, and the echoing silence of the usually bustling labs pressed in around him. Outside, a thin, icy rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the distant skyline into a shimmering, ethereal landscape. Elias, clad in his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket across the polished floor of Lab 42, the subtle squeak of the wheels a counterpoint to the humming lights. This lab, dedicated to experimental botany, was usually a riot of controlled chaos – vines creeping across trellises, strange fungi blooming in illuminated tanks, and the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something vaguely… metallic.  Tonight, however, it was eerily still. Even the Venus flytrap near the window seemed to be holding its breath. Something was different.
