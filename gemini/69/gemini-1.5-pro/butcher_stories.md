The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat, swirling snowflakes into miniature tornadoes that danced across the cobblestones of Grimshaw Market.  Elias, his breath clouding the air, surveyed his stall, "Thorne's Fine Meats," with a critical eye.  The gas lamps, hissing softly, cast a warm glow over the rows of sausages hanging like festive garlands, the plump chickens nestled in their icy beds, and the crimson slabs of beef, meticulously arranged to showcase their marbling.  Grimshaw, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Whispering Moors, was a place where superstition thrived alongside the trade in everyday necessities, and this morning, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, heavier than the anticipated Christmas Eve snowfall.  Even the usual cacophony of the market – the fishmongers' cries, the bartering housewives, the rumble of carts – seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet that pricked at Elias's usually unflappable composure.  He had a bad feeling about the day, a feeling colder than the December air.
