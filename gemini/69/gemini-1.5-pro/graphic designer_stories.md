The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chin, and hurried across the cobbled courtyard of the converted textile mill that housed both her tiny apartment and her even tinier design studio, "Ink & Pixel."  The mill, a hulking brick behemoth named "The Loom," dominated the skyline of the small, artsy town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Salt spray hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the restless Atlantic just a few blocks away.  Inside the Loom, the air was thick with the scent of aged brick, turpentine, and the faint ghost of machine oil, a testament to the building's industrious past.  Tonight, however, another aroma competed for dominance: woodsmoke and the tantalizing promise of spiced cider, emanating from the communal bonfire blazing in the center of the courtyard. Eleanor, despite the cold seeping into her bones, felt a flicker of warmth at the sight of her neighbors gathered around the flames, their faces illuminated by the flickering orange glow.  This was her community, her chosen family, and tonight, they were celebrating the annual Port Blossom Harvest Festival.  A festival Eleanor had been tasked with designing the poster for, a poster that was currently the subject of much heated debate in the town council.
