The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks as she wrestled with the recalcitrant antenna atop the North Ness lighthouse.  Rust, the colour of dried blood, clung to the metal latticework, and the rhythmic clang of the foghorn, a mournful bass note against the shrieking wind, did nothing to soothe her fraying nerves.  Below, the slate-grey waves clawed at the rocky outcrop on which the lighthouse stood, a lonely sentinel against the encroaching darkness.  The Isle of Ailsa, ten miles off the coast of Scotland and accessible only by a twice-weekly ferry (weather permitting), wasn't exactly a bustling hub, but the radio silence emanating from the mainland was unsettling.  For three days, Amy had been unable to raise even a crackle from the mainland coast guard, and the island's sole other resident, old Mr. MacIntyre the lighthouse keeper, was getting increasingly agitated.  His arthritis flared up in bad weather, he claimed, and the silence meant he couldn’t get his daily dose of shipping forecasts, leaving him in a perpetual state of meteorological anxiety.
