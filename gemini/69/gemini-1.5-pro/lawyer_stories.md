Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Grace Holloway’s office, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy grey.  The Chicago skyline, usually a jagged, glittering beast, was reduced to a handful of smeared orange lights swallowed by the storm. Amelia, her chestnut hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a restless rhythm against the mahogany surface of her desk. The scent of old books and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in the imposing silence of Holloway & Davies, Attorneys at Law.  The opulent, wood-panelled office, a relic of a bygone era of legal practice, was empty save for her.  Her partners were long gone, enjoying the kind of Friday night revelry Amelia had traded for a stack of case files and the lukewarm dregs of her second pot of coffee.  Tonight, the case of Peterson v. Sterling, a particularly thorny intellectual property dispute, held her captive.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, mirroring the growing unease in Amelia’s gut. Something about this case felt…off.
