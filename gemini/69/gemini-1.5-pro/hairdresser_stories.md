The aroma of burnt sugar and scorched hair hung heavy in the air, a familiar and not entirely unpleasant perfume that clung to Henrietta "Etta" Dubois like a second skin. Her salon, "Shear Radiance," nestled between Mrs. O'Malley's perpetually wilting flower shop and Big Tony's Pizzeria on Sycamore Street, was a riot of vibrant colour.  Marigold yellow walls were adorned with framed photographs of Etta's most extravagant creations: gravity-defying beehives, iridescent peacock feather mohawks, and even a bouffant sculpted to resemble the Eiffel Tower.  Outside, the Louisiana sun beat down on the cracked pavement, baking the small town of Magnolia Springs into a drowsy stupor.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically slow, but today, Etta had a feeling something was about to change.  A low rumble, like distant thunder, vibrated through the floorboards, and the wind chimes above the door tinkled nervously, as if anticipating a storm.
