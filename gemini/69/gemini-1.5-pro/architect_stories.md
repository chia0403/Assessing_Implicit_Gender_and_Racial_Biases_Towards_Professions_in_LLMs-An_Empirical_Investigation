The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau, plastering strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her crimson scarf tighter, the vibrant colour a stark contrast to the greyscale world around her. Towering cranes etched skeletal silhouettes against the steel-grey sky above Glasgow, their long arms reaching towards the perpetual drizzle. Below, the Clyde, a churning, muddy serpent, snaked its way through the city, reflecting the grim light back up at the imposing Victorian buildings that lined its banks. Cassie stood on the south bank, her breath clouding in the frigid air, gazing at the derelict Finnieston Sugar Refinery. Its crumbling brick facade, stained with the ghosts of molasses and industry, stood as a stark reminder of a bygone era.  This was her canvas, her challenge, her obsession.  This was where she would build the future.
