The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital outpatient lab hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes had grown accustomed to over the past five years.  It was 6:45 am, the pre-dawn quiet broken only by the rhythmic whir of centrifuges and the gentle clinking of glass vials. Outside, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, the small town of Oakhaven, West Virginia, was still shrouded in a blueish pre-dawn mist. Amelia, in her crisp white lab coat, adjusted her purple nitrile gloves, the color a small rebellion against the sterile environment.  Today, like every other day, she prepared to be the first point of contact for a stream of patients, a silent interpreter of the stories their blood would tell.  But something felt different in the air this morning, a subtle shift in the familiar stillness, a prickle of anticipation that had nothing to do with the usual Monday morning rush.
