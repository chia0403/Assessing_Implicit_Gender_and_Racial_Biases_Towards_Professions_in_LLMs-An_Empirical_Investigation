The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a lurid, beer-tinged glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes, cheap coffee, and desperation.  Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Grace Holloway.  Her kelly green Ford Fiesta, affectionately nicknamed "The Pickle," sat half-submerged in a pothole just outside, its passenger seat piled high with sample cases of "Miracle Shine" all-purpose cleaner. Amelia, her usually immaculate auburn hair plastered to her forehead, stared at the scene with the weary resignation of a seasoned saleswoman facing yet another rejection.  Pine Ridge, Wyoming, population 483, had not proven to be the fertile ground for cleaning product sales that she'd hoped.  In fact, the last three hours had yielded nothing but slammed doors and suspicious glares.  This was not how she envisioned her triumphant return to the sales game after a two-year hiatus.  The rusty chime above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival, and Amelia plastered on her brightest, most winning smile.  It was time to make a sale.
