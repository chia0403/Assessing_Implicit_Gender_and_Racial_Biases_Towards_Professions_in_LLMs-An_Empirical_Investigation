Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's forty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The cityscape of Chicago, normally a glittering tapestry of lights, was smeared into an indistinguishable grey blur.  Elias, his tie loosened and his normally impeccable dark hair dishevelled, stared out at the storm. His reflection, a ghost in the darkened glass, showed a man on the precipice.  He was thirty-two, with the kind of sharp features and intense blue eyes that could inspire both trust and unease.  His office, a monument to success in polished mahogany and brushed steel, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a gilded cage.  The blinking red numbers on the stock ticker scrolling across his oversized computer monitor reflected the plummeting value of his latest investment, a biotech company he’d staked his reputation – and a significant portion of his client’s portfolios – on.  The constant, low hum of the air conditioning was the only sound besides the drumming rain, amplifying the silence of his ringing phone, a silence he was too afraid to break.  This was it. This was the day it all came crashing down.
