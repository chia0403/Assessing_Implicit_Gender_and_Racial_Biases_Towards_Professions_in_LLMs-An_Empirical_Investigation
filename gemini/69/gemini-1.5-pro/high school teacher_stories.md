The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the meticulously organized rows of desks in Room 304 of Northwood High.  October in Ashwood, Oregon brought a damp chill that seeped through the ill-fitting windows, clinging to the faded world map tacked above the whiteboard. Outside, the sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the sunrise struggling to break through the evergreen-clad hills that ringed the small logging town. Elias, his breath fogging slightly in the cool air, carefully arranged a stack of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* on his desk.  He had a feeling this year's seniors were going to find the play particularly challenging, and he wanted to be prepared.  He just hoped they'd see past the archaic language and connect with the timeless themes of grief, betrayal, and the ever-present weight of indecision.  This year, more than any other, he needed them to understand.
