The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 am, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a damp towel.  Palm fronds swayed rhythmically in the pre-dawn breeze, casting long, dancing shadows across the Art Deco facade of the Solara Fitness Center. Inside, the polished wooden floors gleamed under the fluorescent lights, reflecting the empty rows of stationary bikes and the pristine, unused yoga mats.  Amy, dressed in vibrant turquoise leggings and a matching sports bra, meticulously adjusted the microphone on her headset.  A playlist of high-energy Latin pop pulsed softly through the sound system, a precursor to the sweat-drenched Zumba class that was about to erupt within these walls.  Outside, the sun began to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of pink and orange, mirroring the nervous excitement fluttering in Amy's stomach. This was the launch of her new, high-intensity "Sunrise Salsa" class, and its success could make or break her fledgling career.
