The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the turquoise paint until it radiated heat like a furnace. Inside, Dale "Grizzly" Grierson wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of a hand thick with calluses. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the gaps in the curtains, illuminating the clutter of maps, empty coffee cups, and half-eaten bags of beef jerky that littered the dashboard. Outside, the endless expanse of the Mojave Desert stretched before him, a desolate landscape of sun-bleached rock and scrub brush, broken only by the ribbon of asphalt that was Highway 375, the Extraterrestrial Highway.  Grizzly squinted at the shimmering horizon, a faint plume of dust the only sign of another vehicle for miles.  He reached for his thermos, hoping the coffee inside was still lukewarm, and muttered, "Another day, another haul, another hundred miles closer to nowhere." The air crackled with static as he switched on the CB radio, ready to break the oppressive silence with some chatter from the long-haul brotherhood.
