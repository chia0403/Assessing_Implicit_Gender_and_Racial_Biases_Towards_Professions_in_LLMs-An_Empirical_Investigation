The insistent Florida humidity clung to Amelia Reyes like a damp towel, even inside the sanctuary of Tranquility Within Massage & Bodywork.  The scent of lemongrass and lavender battled the faint, metallic tang of the approaching thunderstorm. Outside, on Palm Coast Parkway, the fronds of the palm trees thrashed against the darkening sky, their silhouettes stark against the bruised purple clouds.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, adjusted the bolster beneath the empty massage table, her fingers lingering on the crisp, white sheet.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 5:57 pm.  Mr. Henderson, her last client of the day, was three minutes late, a rarity for the punctual retiree.  A low rumble of thunder vibrated through the floor, and Amelia felt a prickle of unease, a sensation entirely unrelated to the weather.
