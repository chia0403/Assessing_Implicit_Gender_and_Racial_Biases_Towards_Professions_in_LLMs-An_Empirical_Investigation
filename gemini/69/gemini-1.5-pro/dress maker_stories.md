The year is 1923.  Gaslight flickered across cobbled streets still slick from a recent rain, casting long, distorted shadows that danced around Amelia Thorne's ankles.  Amelia, her full name Amelia Rose Thorne, hummed a forgotten tune as she hurried along, the scent of coal smoke and brewing coffee thick in the air. Her destination: "Thorne & Daughters," a small but respectable dressmaking shop nestled between a bustling bakery and a rather sombre-looking undertaker's on Lavender Lane, in the heart of London's Spitalfields. The shop, with its faded gold lettering on the window and a display of mannequins dressed in the latest flapper fashions, was Amelia's haven, a world of shimmering silks, intricate beadwork, and the quiet whisper of sewing machines. It was here, amidst bolts of fabric and the comforting presence of her aging mother and boisterous younger sister, that Amelia truly felt at home. The chill November air couldn't penetrate the warmth radiating from within, a warmth born not just from the crackling fireplace in the back room, but from the passion that ignited in Amelia's heart every time she brought needle and thread to cloth.
