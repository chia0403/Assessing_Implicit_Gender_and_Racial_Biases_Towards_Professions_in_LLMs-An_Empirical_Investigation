The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the icy breath of the Chugach Mountains rattling the single-engine plane like a skeleton shaking its bones.  Below, the vast, snow-covered expanse of the Kenai Peninsula stretched out like a crumpled white sheet, broken only by the inky black ribbon of the Kenai River snaking its way towards the turbulent waters of Cook Inlet.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the landscape, painting the snow-dusted spruce trees in shades of bruised purple and deep orange.  Evie, her face partially obscured by a thick woolen scarf, squinted through the frosted cockpit window, her gaze fixed on a distant, barely visible speck â€“ a signal flare, a desperate plea against the darkening, unforgiving wilderness.
