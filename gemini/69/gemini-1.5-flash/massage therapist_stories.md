The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the leaded glass windows of Serenity Spa.  Rain hammered a steady rhythm on the slate roof, a counterpoint to the soft, rhythmic squeak of Elias Thorne’s chair as he adjusted the height of the massage table.  Elias, a man whose hands possessed the uncanny ability to coax tension from even the most rigidly stressed shoulders, sighed contentedly.  He liked the quiet solitude of the spa before the rush of afternoon appointments began, a time for him to center himself and prepare for the physical and emotional demands of his day. The flickering candlelight cast dancing shadows on the walls, illuminating the shelves lined with bottles of essential oils – each one a promise of relaxation, of escape.  Tonight, however, the familiar tranquility felt strangely fragile, a thin veneer over a simmering unease that Elias couldn't quite shake.
