The salt spray stung Elias Thorneâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He hunched deeper into his worn sheepskin coat, the biting November wind whistling a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the wind-twisted pines that clung precariously to the cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea.  The lighthouse, a stoic sentinel against the encroaching darkness, pulsed a lonely beam across the turbulent waters. Elias, a writer by trade and hermit by inclination, found solace only in this desolate corner of Cornwall, perched on the ragged edge of the world, where the relentless ocean roared its ancient, timeless stories.  His small, stone cottage, barely visible from the clifftop path, was a refuge, a sanctuary where the only sounds louder than the wind were the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his typewriter keys and the occasional mournful cry of a gull.  This was where he wrote, far from the distractions of London, far from the ghosts of his past, hoping to capture, in ink and paper, the wild, untamed spirit of the place, and perhaps, a little of his own.
