The scent of lavender and aged linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the timbered windows of "The Needle's Eye."  Inside, Elias Thorne, a tailor whose name was whispered with reverence amongst the discerning clientele of Blackwood, meticulously adjusted the fall of a velvet doublet.  The shop itself was a testament to Elias's meticulous nature â€“ every tool, from the gleaming shears to the tarnished thimbles, had its designated place on the polished mahogany counter.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass panes depicting scenes from forgotten folklore, illuminated dust motes dancing in the quiet space, casting long shadows that stretched and shrunk with the passing clouds.  Blackwood, a town perched precariously on the edge of the whispering moors, was a place of ancient secrets and simmering tensions, a fitting backdrop for the intricate lives Elias Thorne so skillfully stitched together, both in fabric and in whispered confidences.
