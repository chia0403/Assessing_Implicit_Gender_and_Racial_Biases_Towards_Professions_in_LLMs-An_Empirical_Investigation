The wind, a rasping sculptor itself, gnawed at Elias Thorne’s exposed cheeks as he wrestled with the stubborn granite.  Dust, the fine grey powder of a thousand years, clung to his beard like a second skin, mingling with the sweat beading on his brow.  The quarry, a gaping maw in the cliff face overlooking the churning grey sea, was Elias’s kingdom.  Granite, in its myriad shades of pearl and pewter, was his canvas.  For forty years, he’d chipped and shaped it, coaxing forth angels and gargoyles, crosses and crests, each stroke a whisper of his life's quiet dedication.  Today, however, the stone seemed to fight back with unusual ferocity, mirroring the tempest brewing within Elias's own soul. The rhythmic clang of his hammer against the chisel, usually a comforting soundtrack to his work, felt jarring, discordant against the mournful cry of the gulls overhead. The salty air, usually bracing, felt heavy, pregnant with unspoken grief.
