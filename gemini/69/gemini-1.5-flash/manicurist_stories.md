The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails flaked like forgotten dreams under the harsh glare of the midday Florida sun.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic soundtrack to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Esmeralda “Esme” Valencia’s nail clippers.  Esme, with her impossibly long, perfectly manicured fingers stained a deep ruby red – a shade she’d painstakingly mixed herself and named “Boca Sunset” –  hummed along to the tinny radio playing salsa music, completely oblivious to the humidity clinging to her like a second skin.  The air inside the tiny salon, tucked between a laundromat and a struggling taco truck, smelled strongly of acetone, lavender cuticle oil, and the faint, sweet scent of desperation clinging to the hopes and anxieties of her clientele.  Today, however, the desperation seemed thicker than usual.  A storm was brewing, not just in the sky, but in the heart of Serenity Nails itself.
