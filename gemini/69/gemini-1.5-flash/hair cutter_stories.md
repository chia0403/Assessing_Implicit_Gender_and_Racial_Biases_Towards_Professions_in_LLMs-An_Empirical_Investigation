The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to "Shear Perfection,"  a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient town of  Auberon.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall, arched windows, illuminating the intricate, almost gothic, detailing of the ornate mirrors.  Elias Thorne, his fingers nimble and precise, worked with the practiced ease of a surgeon, snipping a stray strand of auburn hair from his client's elaborate updo.  Outside, the midday bustle of Auberon – the clatter of horse-drawn carts, the murmur of conversations in the market square – faded into a distant hum, swallowed by the quiet concentration within Shear Perfection.  Elias, however, was far from tranquil.  The weight of a secret, heavy as a blacksmith's hammer, pressed down on his chest, threatening to unravel the carefully constructed calm he projected to his clientele.
