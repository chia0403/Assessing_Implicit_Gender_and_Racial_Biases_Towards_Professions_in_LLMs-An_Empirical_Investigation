The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a perfume uniquely Amelia Hernandez’s own.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass peacock perched above her desk, dappled the worn wooden floorboards of her travel agency, “Wanderlust & Co.”  Dust motes, illuminated in the golden rays, danced in the quiet afternoon stillness.  Outside, the bustling sounds of New York City – a cacophony of honking taxis and chattering pedestrians – were muffled by the thick, soundproofed walls, creating a sanctuary of calm within the urban maelstrom.  Amelia, surrounded by a chaotic yet comforting collection of travel brochures, maps spilling onto the floor, and miniature globes of varying sizes, sighed contentedly.  This was her kingdom, her escape, and the place where dreams took flight.
