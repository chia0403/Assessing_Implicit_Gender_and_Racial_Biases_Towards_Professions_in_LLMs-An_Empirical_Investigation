The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The scent that greeted her was a familiar, pungent cocktail: antiseptic, pine needles, and something indefinably… feral.  Alder Creek itself, a tiny hamlet nestled deep in the Oregon Cascades, was draped in a shroud of mist, the mountains looming like brooding giants on either side of the narrow valley.  Snow dusted the already leafless branches of the ancient Douglas firs, their skeletal arms reaching towards the perpetually grey sky. The clinic, a converted barn with mismatched windows and a sagging roofline, looked more like a haven for stray animals than a place of professional healing, which, Eleanor mused, wasn't far from the truth.  Inside, the comforting warmth of the wood stove battled valiantly against the encroaching chill, a battle Eleanor suspected she’d be fighting all winter.
