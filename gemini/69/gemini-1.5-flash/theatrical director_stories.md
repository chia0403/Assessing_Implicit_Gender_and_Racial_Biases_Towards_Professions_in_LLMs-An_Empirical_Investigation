The chipped paint of the Rialto Theatre's backstage door flaked onto the worn Persian rug beneath Elias Thorne's feet, a miniature snowdrift accumulating around his polished oxfords.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the stagnant air, a ghostly ballet mirroring the chaotic waltz of emotions churning within him.  The air hung thick with the scent of aged wood, mothballs, and something indefinably theatrical â€“ a perfume of impending performance, mingled with the lingering ghost of a thousand forgotten plays.  Outside, the neon glow of a pizza parlor bled through the grime-coated windowpanes, a stark contrast to the crumbling grandeur of the Rialto, a once-magnificent theatre now clinging precariously to life, much like Elias's latest, and possibly final, production.
