The air hung thick with the scent of coconut and something faintly floral – a testament to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather’s eclectic clientele.  Sera, a cosmetologist with a penchant for vibrant colours and even more vibrant personalities, surveyed her salon, "Shear Genius," from behind the meticulously organised counter.  Shear Genius wasn't your typical suburban salon; nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town, its walls were adorned with vintage movie posters, mismatched antique mirrors reflecting the flickering gaslight glow from the street outside, and a perpetually overflowing bowl of brightly coloured lollipops.  The rhythmic clang of the ancient tram rattling past punctuated the quiet hum of the hair dryers, a constant soundtrack to Sera's bustling day.  Today, however, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, broken only by the frantic ticking of an ornate grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a tiny hammer blow against the growing sense of foreboding that settled over Sera's usually effervescent spirit.
