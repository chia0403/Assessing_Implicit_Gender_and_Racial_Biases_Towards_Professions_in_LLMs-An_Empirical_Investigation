The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft, apricot-hued light of the Bellagio’s lobby:  *Aurelian “Reli”  DeLuca, Concierge*.  Reli adjusted his impeccably knotted silk tie, the faint scent of sandalwood clinging to the expensive fabric. Outside, the Las Vegas Strip pulsed with a feverish energy, a kaleidoscope of neon and flashing lights reflecting in the polished granite floor.  But inside the Bellagio, a hushed reverence reigned, a sanctuary of opulent calm amidst the city’s chaotic heart.  The air hummed with the quiet efficiency of a well-oiled machine, a symphony of hushed voices and the discreet click of high heels on marble.  Tonight, however, the usual hum was punctuated by a low, insistent thrum of something… unsettling. A tension hung heavier than the cloying scent of lilies from the nearby floral display, a feeling that even the Bellagio’s legendary tranquility couldn’t quite mask.  Reli, with his years of experience reading the subtle nuances of human behavior, knew something was about to break.
