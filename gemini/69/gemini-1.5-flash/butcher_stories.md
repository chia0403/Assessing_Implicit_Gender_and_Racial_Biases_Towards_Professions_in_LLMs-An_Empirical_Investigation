The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of iron and woodsmoke, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  It clung to him like a second skin, a testament to his years spent behind the blood-slicked counter of Butterfield's Prime Meats, a shop that had stood on the cobbled corner of Butcher Row for three generations.  The year was 1888, and a biting November wind rattled the frost-laden panes of the shop window, blurring the already dim gaslight spilling onto the rain-slicked streets of Whitechapel.  Inside, the warmth was deceptive, a thin shield against the creeping chill that seemed to seep from the very stones of the ancient building.  Barty, his hands stained crimson despite the meticulous scrubbing, sharpened his cleaver with practiced ease, the rhythmic screech a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation drifting in from the dimly lit pub across the alley.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm felt off-key, a disquiet settling in his gut as thick as the fog rolling in from the Thames.
