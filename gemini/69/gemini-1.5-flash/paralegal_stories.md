The stale scent of printer toner and lukewarm coffee clung to the air in the cramped, windowless office of Miller & Zois.  Amelia Katherine Hayes, paralegal extraordinaire (at least, that's what she told herself on particularly grueling days), meticulously filed a stack of subpoenas, her nimble fingers a blur against the crisp, legal paper. Rain lashed against the grimy window of the adjacent hallway, a relentless percussion against the otherwise muted hum of fluorescent lights and the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards.  The city of Chicago roared outside, a symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens, a world Amelia could only glimpse through the smeared glass of the break room, a world she rarely had time to experience.  Tonight, however, the storm felt particularly ominous, mirroring the weight of the case looming over her: the impending trial of Silas Blackwood, a case that threatened to unravel not only Blackwood's life but Amelia's carefully constructed sense of order as well.
