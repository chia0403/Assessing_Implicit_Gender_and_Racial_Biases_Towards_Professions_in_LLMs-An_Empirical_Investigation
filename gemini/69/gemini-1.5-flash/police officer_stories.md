The salt spray stung Officer Amelia Hernandez's face as she braced against the howling wind.  The November gale ripped at her uniform, the thin fabric offering little protection against the icy breath of the North Atlantic.  Rain lashed down, blurring the already hazy outlines of the craggy cliffs that guarded the tiny, windswept village of Port Blossom, clinging precariously to the rugged coastline of Maine.  The only sounds louder than the storm were the mournful cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks below.  Tonight, however, even the relentless fury of the ocean seemed subdued, overshadowed by the chilling silence that had settled over the village since the distress call had crackled across her radio â€“ a silence that spoke of something far more terrifying than a storm.
