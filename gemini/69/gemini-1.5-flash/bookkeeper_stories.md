The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hathaway’s fingers, the lukewarm tea doing little to dispel the chill that had settled deep in her bones.  It wasn’t the November air creeping through the gaps in the old sash window of her office – though that certainly contributed – but a deeper, more pervasive coldness emanating from the ledgers spread across her desk.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the gloom of Hathaway & Sons Accounting, a business as aged and creaky as the Victorian building it occupied on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, dried ink, and a faint, underlying perfume of mothballs – a testament to the generations of family records meticulously stored within the firm’s archives, records Amelia was now tasked with auditing.  Outside, the grey Grimsborough sky threatened snow, mirroring the icy dread creeping into Amelia's heart.  This wasn't just any audit; this was the final accounting of Blackwood Manor, and the whispers surrounding its late owner, Lord Ashworth, were far more chilling than any winter wind.
