The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine “Amy” Finch’s hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay into the goat pen.  The air hung thick with the smells of damp earth, pine needles, and something distinctly…goaty.  The sprawling grounds of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, usually a haven of bucolic charm, were now a landscape of wind-battered trees and sodden grass under a bruised, grey sky.  Amy, bundled in layers of worn wool and practical waterproofs, didn't mind the weather; she’d faced worse tending to the sanctuary's eclectic collection of rescued animals for the past five years.  The real challenge tonight wasn't the weather, but the increasingly erratic behaviour of old Barnaby, the prize-winning llama whose stubbornness rivalled the granite cliffs overlooking the sanctuary.
