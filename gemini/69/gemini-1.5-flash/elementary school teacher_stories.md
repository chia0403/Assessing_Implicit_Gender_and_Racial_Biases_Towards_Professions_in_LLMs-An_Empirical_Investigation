The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow, steady erosion of Eleanor Vance's patience.  It was 7:15 AM, a full forty-five minutes before the bell, and already the air in Room 207 of Crestwood Elementary hung thick with the scent of impending chaos – a heady mix of sugary cereal, slightly damp gym socks, and the faint, unsettling aroma of something vaguely resembling burnt toast.  Sunlight, weak and hesitant even at this late hour of a perpetually overcast autumn, struggled to penetrate the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the still air like miniature, mischievous spirits.  Outside, the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the playground creaked mournfully in the breeze, a sound that seemed to echo Eleanor's own inner weariness.  Today, however, felt particularly heavy, even for a Monday.  The whispers about Mr. Henderson’s sudden absence had already begun to ripple through the staff room, and a knot of apprehension tightened in Eleanor's stomach.  This was going to be a long day.
