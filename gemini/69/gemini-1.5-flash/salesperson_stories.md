The fluorescent lights of the Galleria hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine “Amy” Holloway’s increasingly frantic pacing.  It wasn’t the usual frantic of a Saturday afternoon rush; this was a different kind of frantic, the low thrum of impending doom vibrating in the polished marble floor beneath her heels.  Amy, a junior associate at Sterling & Royce, purveyor of exquisitely overpriced hand-crafted pens, had just realized, with the gut-wrenching clarity that only a missed deadline could provide, that the most important client of her career was arriving in fifteen minutes, and her presentation – a meticulously crafted showcase of the new "Emperor's Quill" collection – was still a chaotic pile of scattered ink samples and crumpled presentation boards in the back room.  The air, usually thick with the scent of expensive leather and polished wood, now carried the sharp, metallic tang of panic.  The Galleria, normally a glittering temple of consumerism, felt suddenly claustrophobic, a gilded cage trapping her in her impending failure.
