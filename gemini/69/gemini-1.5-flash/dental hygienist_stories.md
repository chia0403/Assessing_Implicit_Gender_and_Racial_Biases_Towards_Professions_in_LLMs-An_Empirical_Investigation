The fluorescent lights of the Aspen Dental clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's otherwise silent Tuesday morning.  The sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a familiar cocktail – hung in the air. Amelia, her petite frame clad in crisp teal scrubs, meticulously organized her tray of instruments.  The small, square mirror, the curved scaler, the explorer – each tool felt like an extension of her own deft fingers, honed by years of precise work.  Outside, the Colorado sun glinted off the snow-dusted Rockies, a breathtaking panorama completely unseen from her windowless cubicle.  But Amelia was unfazed; her focus was entirely on the patient chart in her hand: Mr. Henderson, 72, a history of periodontal disease, and possibly, according to the cryptic note, a rather impressive collection of novelty dentures.  Today promised to be interesting.
