The wind, a rasping, relentless beast, clawed at the edges of Elias Thorne's weathered Stetson, threatening to rip it from his head and send it tumbling across the parched expanse of the Diamond Bar Ranch.  Dust, the color of burnt umber, swirled around his worn leather boots, clinging to the creases of his calloused hands.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down mercilessly on the seemingly endless acres of sun-baked earth, baking the already cracked soil even further.  The air hung thick and heavy, tasting of dust and the faint, acrid scent of sagebrush, a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the distant, storm-laden mountains that promised only temporary reprieve from the relentless heat.  This was the high desert of Arizona, a land of brutal beauty, a land that tested the mettle of even the hardiest souls, and Elias Thorne, a man carved from the same granite as the surrounding mesas, was one such soul.
