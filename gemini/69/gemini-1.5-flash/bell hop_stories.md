The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Crystal Palace Hotel lobby, reflecting the anxious sheen on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's brow.  It was a sheen not born of exertion, for Barty was remarkably nimble for a man his age (thirty-two, though he often felt closer to eighty after a particularly busy weekend), but of a nervous anticipation that clung to him like the faint scent of stale cigars and overripe bananas.  The Crystal Palace, once the jewel of Ashwood Springs, was now showing its age – the gilt was flaking, the plush carpets worn thin in places, and the once-proud peacock feathers in the lobby vase were reduced to dust-laden remnants.  But tonight, the air crackled with a different kind of energy, a nervous electricity that vibrated from the polished mahogany desk to the chipped marble columns and even seemed to seep from the very cracks in the terrazzo floor.  For tonight, Mr. Silas Blackwood, the notorious recluse and rumored owner of half the town’s fortune, was expected to arrive.
