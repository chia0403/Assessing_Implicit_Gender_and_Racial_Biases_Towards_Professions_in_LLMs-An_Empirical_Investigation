The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher into the back of the ambulance.  Sirens wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the helicopter overhead.  Rain, a freezing drizzle that instantly soaked through her already damp uniform, plastered her dark eyelashes to her cheeks.  The scene before her was a chaotic tableau of flashing red and blue lights illuminating the slick, rain-swept asphalt of the Route 17 overpass.  Twisted metal, the skeletal remains of a silver sedan, groaned under the weight of the emergency personnel swarming around it.  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid bite of burnt rubber.  This wasn't Amy's first major accident, but tonight, the raw, visceral energy of the scene felt different, charged with a palpable sense of dread that settled deep in her stomach, a premonition that chilled her more than the relentless November rain.
