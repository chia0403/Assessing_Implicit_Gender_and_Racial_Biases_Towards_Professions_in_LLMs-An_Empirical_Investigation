The only other sound besides the scanner and the occasional sputtering of the ancient coffee machine was the low murmur of the evening news droning from a tiny, crackly radio tucked away on a shelf behind her. This was Amelia's domain, her nightly purgatory, and another Tuesday was slowly, relentlessly, unfolding.
