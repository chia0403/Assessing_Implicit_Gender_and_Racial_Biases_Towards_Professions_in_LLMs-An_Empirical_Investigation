The rusty swing set creaked a mournful tune in the wind, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of Elias Thorne’s axe biting into the stubborn oak.  Elias, a man etched by sun and toil into the landscape he farmed, stood knee-deep in the fallen leaves of his orchard.  October’s chill bit at his exposed skin, a stark contrast to the warmth still clinging to the decaying fruit scattered beneath the gnarled branches.  Thorne’s Orchard, a sprawling testament to generations of family sweat and stubborn determination, stretched before him, a patchwork quilt of fading greens and russets nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  A thin veil of mist clung to the valley below, blurring the distant peaks into ethereal silhouettes.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, held the promise of a long, hard winter, a winter Elias wasn't sure Thorne’s Orchard could weather.
