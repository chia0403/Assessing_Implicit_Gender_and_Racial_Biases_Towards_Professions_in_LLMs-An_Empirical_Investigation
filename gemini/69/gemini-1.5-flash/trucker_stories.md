The diesel engine of the eighteen-wheeler rumbled, a low, guttural growl that vibrated through the worn leather of Jasper "Jax" Riley's seat.  Rain lashed against the windshield of his rig, blurring the already fading light of the late October sunset into streaks of bruised purple and angry orange.  Jax gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles bone-white, as he navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  The road, a scar etched into the flank of the Rockies, twisted and turned like a drunken serpent, its asphalt slick with the relentless downpour.  Ahead, the peaks loomed, dark and ominous against the bruised sky, their snow-capped summits disappearing into a swirling veil of mist. The only sound louder than the engine was the rhythmic whisper of the wipers battling the storm, a frantic counterpoint to the chilling silence of the unforgiving wilderness.  He was miles from anywhere, the nearest town a ghost whispered on the wind, and the weight of the cargo – and a secret he carried – pressed down on him as heavily as the snow on the mountaintops.
