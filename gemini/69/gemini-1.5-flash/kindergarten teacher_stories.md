The chipped paint of the "Happy Hippo Playground" glinted under the relentless July sun.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, high-pitched chorus, a soundtrack to the sticky, humid air hanging heavy over the small, underfunded public school in Oakhaven, Georgia.  Inside, Ms. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines spoke of years spent wiping noses and soothing scraped knees, surveyed the chaos with a weary but fond amusement.  Crayon dust motes danced in the sunbeams slanting through the classroom window, illuminating a scene of controlled pandemonium: a miniature tower of blocks teetering precariously, a spirited argument over a particularly coveted purple crayon, and little Timmy Jenkins attempting, with admirable, if unsuccessful, determination, to fit a square block into a round hole.  The scent of glue, finger paint, and slightly overripe bananas hung in the air, a familiar and comforting aroma to Eleanor, the queen of her own tiny, brightly coloured kingdom.
