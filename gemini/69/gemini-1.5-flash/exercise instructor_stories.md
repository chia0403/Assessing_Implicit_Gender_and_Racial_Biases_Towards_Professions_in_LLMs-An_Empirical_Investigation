Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling city streets of Miami, a world entirely separate from the focused intensity within Body & Soul’s mirrored walls.  Tonight, however, Amelia sensed a disquiet, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with lactic acid build-up. Something felt…off.
