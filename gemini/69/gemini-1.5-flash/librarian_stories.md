The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that seeped through the warped windowpanes of the Blackwood Public Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, wavering shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, danced in the quiet stillness.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose life was as meticulously ordered as the Dewey Decimal System itself, adjusted the spectacles perched precariously on her nose.  Her fingers, stained faintly sepia from years of handling antique books, traced the spine of a particularly fragile volume –  a first edition of Edgar Allan Poe’s “Tales of Mystery and Imagination,” its cover adorned with a chilling raven etched in faded gold.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, a fitting soundtrack to the mysteries held within these hallowed walls.
