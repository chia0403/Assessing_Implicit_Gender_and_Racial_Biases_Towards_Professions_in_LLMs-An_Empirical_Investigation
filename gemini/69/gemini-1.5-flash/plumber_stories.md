The biting November wind howled a mournful tune through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the abandoned Victorian mansion, rattling the loose panes like skeletal fingers.  Rain, icy and relentless, lashed against the crumbling brickwork, turning the overgrown garden into a muddy swamp.

This was where Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber whose hands were as rough as cobblestones and whose heart was surprisingly tender, huddled over a blueprint spread across a rickety kitchen table.  Barty wasn't admiring the architecture; he was tracing the labyrinthine network of ancient pipes that snaked through the house like metal veins, a challenge he’d eagerly accepted – or rather, had been reluctantly roped into – that promised a hefty payday and a truly unique plumbing puzzle.
