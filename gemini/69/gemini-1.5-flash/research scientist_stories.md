The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s parka, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the diesel generator humming inside the Halley VI Research Station.  Eleanor, bundled in layers of thermal gear that felt more like a spacesuit than practical clothing, squinted at the churning, grey expanse of the Weddell Sea.  The endless white of the ice shelf stretched to the horizon, a vast, unforgiving landscape sculpted by millennia of ice and wind.  Above, the sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a pale, pre-dawn pink, held a chilling beauty that did little to mitigate the bone-deep cold that gnawed at her extremities.  This was her fourth year at Halley, studying the subtle shifts in the ice sheet's behavior, a task that felt increasingly urgent as the global temperature creeped upwards.  Tonight, however, her research was the furthest thing from her mind.  A strange signal, unlike anything she'd ever encountered, pulsed from the depths of the ice, a rhythmic beat that seemed to echo the wind's lament.
