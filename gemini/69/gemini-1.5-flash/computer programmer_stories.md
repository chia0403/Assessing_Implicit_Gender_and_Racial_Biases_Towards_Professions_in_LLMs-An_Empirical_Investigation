The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon Noodle House" cast an oily, orange glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked trench coat.  Rain hammered against the awning above her, mimicking the frantic rhythm of the code scrolling across her laptop screen.

Elara, a woman whose dedication to debugging rivaled her caffeine addiction, hunched deeper into the cramped booth, the dim light reflecting in her tired but sharp hazel eyes.  Outside, the city of Neo-Kyoto hummed with a chaotic energy – a symphony of honking vehicles, chattering crowds, and the rhythmic whirring of automated delivery drones – a perfect counterpoint to the intense focus required to wrestle this particularly stubborn piece of code into submission.  Tonight, however, the deadline wasn't for some faceless corporation; tonight, it was personal.
