The greasy smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, Master Electrician.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned power station, each gust a mournful howl echoing through the cavernous, echoing space.  Rust, like a creeping vine, snaked its way across exposed metalwork, while the skeletal remains of machinery cast long, distorted shadows in the flickering beam of Elias's headlamp.  Water trickled down the walls, leaving trails of grime that mirrored the intricate pathways of the wiring he was tasked with untangling – a task far more complicated than it seemed, considering this was no ordinary power station.  This was Blackwood Falls, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a place where the power wasn't just electricity, but something… else.
