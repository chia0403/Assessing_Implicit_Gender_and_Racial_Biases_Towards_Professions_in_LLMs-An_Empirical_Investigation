The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.

He was perched on the edge of the world, quite literally, at Land's End, waiting for the light. The light, the elusive heart of his art, was the only thing that mattered right now.  This shot, this precise moment of sunrise over the churning sea, could make or break his upcoming exhibition.  The pressure, like the wind, threatened to overwhelm him.
