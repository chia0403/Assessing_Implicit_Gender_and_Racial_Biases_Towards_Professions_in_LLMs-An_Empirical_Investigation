The humid air hung thick and heavy in the Bangkok kitchen, a clinging dampness that clung to Chef Arisara "Ari" Chaowalit's skin like a second layer.  The scent of lemongrass, galangal, and fiery chilies warred with the metallic tang of blood – not human, Ari thankfully noted, but from the freshly-slaughtered duck hanging, still faintly twitching, from a meat hook.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, their harsh glow reflecting off the stainless steel counters slick with spilled fish sauce and the sweat beading on the foreheads of her kitchen staff.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of tuk-tuks and the cacophony of the city throbbed, a relentless soundtrack to the controlled chaos of her restaurant, "Serene Spice."  Tonight, however, serene felt a world away.  A particularly important guest was arriving, one who could make or break Ari’s meticulously built reputation.
