The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, a comforting weight against the chill November air that seeped into Thorne's Auto Repair.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the sycamore trees clawed at the bruised twilight sky, mirroring the rusted carcass of a '78 Ford pickup that dominated the far corner of the workshop.  The air inside, however, was thick with the familiar scent of engine oil, burnt coffee, and something faintly sweet â€“ Elias suspected it was the lingering aroma of the cherry pie his wife, Clara, had packed him for lunch, now sadly long devoured.  The rhythmic whir of a power drill provided a counterpoint to the low hum of the fluorescent lights, creating a symphony of sounds Elias had grown intimately familiar with over the twenty years he'd owned the shop.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm felt discordant, punctuated by a nervous flutter in his stomach that had nothing to do with the impending deadline on Mr. Henderson's carburetor.
