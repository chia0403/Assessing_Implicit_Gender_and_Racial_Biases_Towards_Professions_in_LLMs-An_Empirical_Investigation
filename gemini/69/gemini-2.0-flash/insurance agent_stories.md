## Opening & Setting:

The relentless Florida sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, radiating heat that shimmered in the humid air. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, a man whose polyester blend suit was clinging to him like a second, unwelcome skin, squinted at the garish neon sign above his workplace: "Sunshine State Insurance - Your Umbrella in the Storm."

Bart ran a weary hand through his thinning comb-over, the slicked-back remnants sticking uncomfortably to his forehead. It was Thursday, late afternoon, and the promise of a weekend spent watching golf reruns on his aging La-Z-Boy offered the only respite from the daily grind of convincing oblivious tourists and sun-baked retirees that their dilapidated mobile homes were worth insuring.

Bart's office, nestled within a strip mall squeezed between a bait shop and a tanning salon, was a monument to beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, beige filing cabinets overflowing with paperwork detailing hurricane damage and alligator-related incidents. The only pop of color came from the lurid promotional posters showcasing smiling families frolicking on pristine beaches â€“ beaches Bart knew were usually choked with seaweed and discarded beer cans.

He took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Today, though, felt different. There was a tremor in the air, a low hum of unease that settled just beneath his skin. Bart, Bartholomew Finch, insurance agent extraordinaire (at least, that's what he told himself), had a feeling this wasn't going to be just another Thursday in paradise.
