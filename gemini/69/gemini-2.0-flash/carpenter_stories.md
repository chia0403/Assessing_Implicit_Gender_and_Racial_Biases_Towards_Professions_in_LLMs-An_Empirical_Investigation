The smell of pine sap and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Johnathan Tiberius Blackwood like a second skin. Sunlight, already waning in the late afternoon, streamed through the wide, open door of his workshop, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the beams. Outside, the small, weathered sign read: "Blackwood's Fine Woodwork - Custom Creations & Repairs."

The workshop itself was a testament to Johnathan's life's work. Tools, lovingly cared for and meticulously organized, lined the walls. Saws hung perfectly spaced, chisels gleamed in their rack, and planes rested on shelves, each a trusted companion in his craft. The floor was a patchwork of wood scraps, shavings, and the occasional errant nail, evidence of countless projects brought to life within its four walls.

The setting was the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven, nestled in the crook of the Northern California coast. Oakhaven was a place where the ocean breeze carried the scent of salt and redwood, where the rhythms of life were dictated by the tides, and where the generations had built their lives around the sea and the forest. Johnathan had inherited the workshop, and the reputation that came with it, from his grandfather, and he felt a deep responsibility to uphold the legacy of craftsmanship and integrity that was woven into the very fabric of Oakhaven. Right now, however, that legacy felt heavier than a redwood beam.
