## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Urgent Care Clinic hummed a monotonous lullaby, a sound that usually soothed Eloise Bernadette Ramirez after a long shift. Tonight, however, the hum grated on her nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard. She stared at the discarded gauze pad in her gloved hand, speckled crimson like a macabre Jackson Pollock painting. Mrs. Henderson’s veins had been especially stubborn tonight, rolling away from the needle with the tenacity of a cornered raccoon. Eloise sighed, tugging off the gloves and tossing them into the biohazard bin. It was the last draw of the night, and she desperately needed a cup of coffee – strong, black, and capable of reviving the dead.

The air conditioning kicked on with a sudden, forceful whoosh, further highlighting the clinic’s sterile, almost oppressive atmosphere. Eloise leaned against the counter, the cool, smooth laminate a welcome contrast to the persistent warmth of the lab coat plastered to her back. Outside, the Los Angeles night glittered with a promise she wasn't sure she believed in anymore.

## Setting:

**St. Jude's Urgent Care Clinic, Los Angeles, California.**

The clinic is located in a busy, slightly rundown strip mall in the heart of East Los Angeles. While meticulously clean, it retains a utilitarian feel, with its off-white walls, worn linoleum flooring, and rows of identical plastic chairs in the waiting room. Posters promoting flu shots and healthy eating habits are tacked to the bulletin board, slightly curling at the edges. The phlebotomy room is small and functional, dominated by a padded examination chair and a stainless steel countertop cluttered with vials, needles, tourniquets, and antiseptic wipes. A narrow window overlooks the parking lot, offering a glimpse of the bustling city beyond. The ever-present hum of the air conditioning and the faint murmur of conversations from the waiting room provide a constant, low-level soundtrack to the clinic's operations.
