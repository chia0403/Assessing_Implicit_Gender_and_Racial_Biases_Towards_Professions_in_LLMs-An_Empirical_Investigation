The sickly sweet scent of hairspray and desperation hung heavy in the air backstage at "The Emerald Siren," a notorious dive bar clinging to the edge of the French Quarter. Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that threatened to drown out the muffled buzz of conversation and the pre-show jitters. Isabella "Izzy" Moreau, a name whispered with a mix of reverence and pity amongst the other performers, meticulously traced the outline of her lips with a blood-red liner. She hummed a low, bluesy melody, a personal mantra against the rising tide of anxiety. Tonight was different. Tonight wasn't just another Tuesday night crooning for drunk tourists and lonely locals. Tonight, Ms. Delphine Dubois, the legendary blues singer, was in the audience. Tonight, Isabella Moreau was singing for her survival.
