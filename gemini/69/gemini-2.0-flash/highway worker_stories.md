## Story Opening:

The whine of the sander, a persistent, metallic mosquito, was the soundtrack to Walter Archibald Finch's existence. He leaned into the machine, muscles screaming a protest he ignored, the late afternoon sun baking the back of his neck. Dust, a gritty orange-brown, coated everything: his sweat-stained hard hat, the faded blue denim of his uniform, even the lines etched around his eyes â€“ wrinkles earned not from laughter, but from squinting into endless stretches of asphalt. Today, he was patching potholes on County Road 32, a desolate ribbon of highway that cut through the flat, unforgiving landscape of southeastern Colorado.

## Setting:

The setting is early September in southeastern Colorado. The days are still relentlessly hot, hovering around 90 degrees, but the nights are starting to offer a whisper of coolness, a promise of the coming autumn. The land is predominantly dry and dusty, punctuated by sparse clumps of sagebrush and the occasional skeletal cottonwood tree clinging precariously to life. The sky is a vast, unforgiving blue, stretching endlessly to the horizon in every direction. The air is thick with the smell of asphalt, exhaust fumes, and the faint, acrid scent of dried grass. County Road 32 is a two-lane highway, cracked and worn from years of neglect and heavy truck traffic, barely visible in the heat haze shimmering above the asphalt. A rusty barbed wire fence runs parallel to the road, separating the highway from vast, empty fields that stretch into the hazy distance. The only signs of civilization are the occasional dilapidated farmhouse, miles apart, their paint peeling and their windows dark, and the distant, shimmering silhouette of the Raton Mesa on the southern horizon. The feeling is one of isolation, of being swallowed by the immense, unforgiving landscape.
