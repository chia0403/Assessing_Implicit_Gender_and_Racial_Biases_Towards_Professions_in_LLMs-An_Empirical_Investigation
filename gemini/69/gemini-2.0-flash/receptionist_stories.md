## Story Opening:

The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Josephine Davies' acrylic nails against the keyboard was the only sound louder than the incessant hum of the fluorescent lights in the lobby. She hadn't seen a single client all morning. Not a soul had even stumbled in looking lost. Honestly, she was starting to suspect the building had been swallowed whole by a sinkhole and she just hadnâ€™t noticed.

## Setting:

Amelia worked at the reception desk of "Synergy Solutions," a multi-level office building that was supposed to be a beacon of modern business but felt more like a concrete mausoleum painted in varying shades of beige. The lobby was dominated by an enormous abstract sculpture that resembled a tangled heap of chrome spaghetti. It was intended to inspire innovation, or so the plaque insisted, but mostly it just collected dust and bird droppings.

Her desk, a semi-circular monstrosity made of fake wood veneer, faced a set of glass double doors that offered a view of a perpetually overcast sky. Behind her, a wall-sized directory listed the names of countless companies, most of which she'd never heard of, interspersed with motivational posters featuring smiling stock photos and platitudes like "Teamwork Makes the Dream Work" and "Think Outside the Box." The only personal touch she was allowed was a small, slightly wilting spider plant she'd christened "Barry," which sat precariously on the edge of her desk, offering silent solidarity against the soul-crushing monotony.
