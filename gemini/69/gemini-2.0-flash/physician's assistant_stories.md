## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering fluorescent lights of the Urgent Care hummed a monotonous tune, a symphony of discomfort that perfectly mirrored the atmosphere. Outside, a relentless January wind howled, rattling the windows and whipping snow against the glass. Inside, the air was thick with the smells of antiseptic cleaner, stale coffee, and fear – the latter a scent easily picked up after years in the trenches.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Abigail Hayes, PA-C, barely registered the rhythmic squeak of the automatic door. She was too busy mentally bracing herself for the next wave. The whiteboard in the hallway – a testament to the day's patient load – was a depressing tapestry of names and complaints, a never-ending scroll of coughs, aches, and anxieties. She took a deep breath, the familiar scent of the Urgent Care momentarily grounding her. Six hours into a twelve-hour shift, and she already felt like she'd run a marathon. The winter months in Havenwood, Maine, were always brutal, a breeding ground for respiratory viruses and an endless parade of skiers with more audacity than skill. Eleanor tugged at the collar of her worn-out Patagonia fleece, the fabric smelling faintly of lavender from the dryer sheets she'd hastily used that morning. "Hayes, to room three," Brenda, the perpetually harried receptionist, barked over the intercom, her voice as cheerful as a tax audit. Eleanor sighed. Just another day at the front lines. Just another battle in the war against winter. Just another chance to make a difference, even if it was just one person at a time. She grabbed a fresh tongue depressor and a pair of gloves, and with a practiced hand, she pushed open the door to room three, ready to face whatever awaited her. The scent of pine needles and something vaguely metallic hung in the air, a peculiar combination that made her immediately uneasy. This was going to be interesting.
