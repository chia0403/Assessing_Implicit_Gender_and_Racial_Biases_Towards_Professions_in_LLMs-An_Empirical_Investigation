## The Butcher's Lament

**Setting:** The biting October wind whipped through the narrow, cobbled streets of Whitby, England. The salty tang of the North Sea mingled with the richer, more primal scent emanating from the open doorway of "Thompson's Family Butchers," a small, unassuming shop tucked between a purveyor of antique jet jewelry and a pub overflowing with boisterous laughter. Rain, fine as spindrift, slicked the pavement, reflecting the warm, inviting glow of the shop's single gas lamp and the crimson sheen of the freshly cut meats displayed in the window.

**Opening:** Percival Archibald "Percy" Plumtree sighed, a sound like air escaping a punctured sausage. He leaned heavily against the counter, the smooth, well-worn wood offering little comfort against the ache in his back. He'd been on his feet since five, wrestling sides of beef, coaxing flavour from stubborn cuts of lamb, and meticulously arranging the award-winning Cumberland sausages into a tempting spiral. He rubbed a gloved hand across his brow, wiping away a bead of sweat that had stubbornly clung to his hairline. It wasn't the physical labour that weighed him down, not anymore. He'd been born into this life, practically raised on the scent of blood and bone. It was the loneliness. The relentless, gnawing loneliness that seemed to settle in his bones like the dampness of the Whitby fogs. He gazed out at the bustling street, watching tourists and locals alike scurry past, their faces obscured by umbrellas and hastily drawn scarves. He wondered, not for the first time, if anyone truly saw him, Percival Archibald Plumtree, the butcher of Whitby, not just the provider of their Sunday roasts.
