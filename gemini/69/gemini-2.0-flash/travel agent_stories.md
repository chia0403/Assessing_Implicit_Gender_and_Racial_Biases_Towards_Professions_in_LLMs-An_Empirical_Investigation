The biting wind whipped around Amelia Josephine Hawthorne, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the corners of her bright yellow scarf. Not exactly the kind of weather that inspired dreams of sun-drenched beaches or snow-capped mountains, but then again, Amelia wasn’t relying on the weather for inspiration. She was, after all, a travel agent, and conjuring wanderlust in the greyest of climates was practically in her job description.

Amelia plastered a cheerful smile on her face as she pushed open the door to "Global Getaways," her small, independent agency nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Providence, Rhode Island. The bell above the door, a tinkling symphony of miniature brass globes, announced her arrival. Inside, the warmth of the radiator battled valiantly against the chill seeping in from outside. The scent of aged paper, old maps, and vaguely exotic potpourri hung in the air, a carefully curated aroma designed to whisk clients away to faraway lands before they’d even seen a brochure. Posters showcasing the turquoise waters of Bora Bora, the vibrant markets of Marrakech, and the majestic glaciers of Patagonia adorned the walls, a kaleidoscope of possibility waiting to be unlocked.

Amelia sighed contentedly. This was her haven, her little corner of the world dedicated to helping others find theirs. Now, all she needed was a client brave enough to venture out in this blustery November afternoon and entrust their travel dreams to her capable hands.
