The flickering fluorescent lights of Klein & Associates buzzed a monotonous dirge, a soundtrack Elias Thorne had come to associate with existential dread and the smell of stale coffee. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint, rattling the single-paned windows of his cramped office on the 14th floor. Elias leaned back in his worn, vinyl chair, the springs groaning in protest, and rubbed his tired eyes. Another tax season was in full swing, and another mountain of receipts threatened to bury him alive.

He was a meticulous man, Elias Thorne, a senior accountant with a penchant for order and a horror of stray decimals. His desk was a testament to this, a carefully curated chaos of spreadsheets, filing cabinets meticulously labelled, and a pen holder brimming with perfectly sharpened pencils. Even the small cactus on his windowsill, affectionately named Kevin, was positioned precisely three inches from the edge to maximize its sunlight exposure. 

The setting was the quintessential accountant's lair: a small, boxy office overlooking the concrete jungle of downtown Chicago. The walls were painted a drab, institutional beige, adorned only with a motivational poster featuring a picture of soaring eagles and the words "Reach for the Sky!" - a sentiment that felt particularly ironic given Elias's current predicament. The air was thick with the scent of paper, printer toner, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Henderson’s tuna salad sandwich from the lunchroom downstairs. A single, ancient computer hummed on his desk, its screen filled with the unforgiving columns of numbers that governed Elias's life. And tonight, those numbers were stubbornly refusing to add up. Something was off. Something felt…wrong.
