Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a pilot as the main character, including their full name:

**Setting:** The sprawling, sun-baked Airbase "Dust Devil" in the Nevada desert. It's 1953, the height of the Korean War, although the war itself feels a world away from the constant drone of jet engines and the shimmering heat haze rising from the tarmac. Barracks are corrugated steel baking in the sun, a stark contrast to the gleaming chrome and swept wings of the F-86 Sabre jets parked in neat rows. The air smells of jet fuel, dust, and simmering ambition.

**Story Opening:**

"Damn it all to hell," Lieutenant Eleanor "Ellie" Vance muttered, wiping grease from her brow with the back of her hand, smearing it across her cheek in the process. The afternoon sun beat down mercilessly on the engine of her F-86, nicknamed "Sweet Lorraine," turning the metal into a scorching torture device. Another blown fuel line. That made three this week. Ellie knew, deep down, it wasn't just shoddy maintenance, although that was certainly a factor. It was sabotage. Someone, likely one of the older, more entrenched mechanics who saw a woman in the cockpit as an affront to God and country, was determined to ground her. She could feel their eyes on her now, the sidelong glances, the whispers that faded into silence as she turned around. Ellie straightened, pushing a stray lock of her auburn hair behind her ear. They wanted her to quit, to crawl back to whatever domestic existence they deemed suitable. But Eleanor Vance wasn't built to quit. Not now. Not ever. She was a Vance, damn it, and Vances didnâ€™t break. They flew.
