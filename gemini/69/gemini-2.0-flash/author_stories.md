Okay, here's a story opening with setting and a main character who is an author:

**Opening:**

The insistent chirp of the smoke alarm, a sound usually associated with burnt toast and a Tuesday morning haze, was instead piercing the thick silence of midnight. Alistair Finch, usually a man of meticulous habits and unwavering focus, bolted upright in bed, his heart hammering against his ribs. He’d been dreaming of whispering forests and shadowed figures, fragments of the next chapter he was desperately trying to wrestle onto the page. Now, however, reality was a far less romantic, and significantly more alarming, prospect. He coughed, a rasping sound in the smoky air.

"Damn it," he muttered, fumbling for his glasses on the nightstand. "Not again."

**Setting:**

Alistair’s home was a converted Victorian-era lighthouse, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic. The whitewashed exterior stood in stark contrast to the warmly cluttered interior. Books lined every wall, stacked on overflowing shelves and spilling onto tables. Maps with faded ink and compass roses graced the walls between the books, next to framed original illustrations from his novels. A large, scarred oak desk sat beneath the lighthouse's lantern room, bathed in the perpetual glow of his computer screen and, tonight, the flashing red light of the smoke alarm. The air, usually redolent with the scent of aged paper, leather-bound books, and freshly brewed coffee, now carried the acrid tang of smoke.

**Main Character:**

**Alistair Finch:** A celebrated, yet somewhat reclusive, author of historical fantasy novels known for their intricate plots and vividly realized worlds. He is in his late forties, with a perpetually rumpled appearance, perpetually tired eyes framed by reading glasses, and a tendency to lose himself in his own thoughts. He is known to be a little disorganized but a loyal friend.
