The clatter of pans and the sizzle of garlic in olive oil were the first sounds that greeted the dawn in the small, seaside town of Port Blossom. They emanated, as they always did, from the kitchen of "The Salty Crab," a restaurant perched right on the edge of the harbor, its timbers weathered and salty-smelling. Inside, under the warm, yellow glow of the overhead lights, stood Isabella Lucia Rossi, a whirlwind of perpetual motion and culinary passion. At twenty-eight, Isabella was the heart and soul of The Salty Crab, its head chef and, in many ways, its protector. She was fiercely protective of her recipes, passed down through generations of Rossi women, and even more fiercely protective of the local fishermen who supplied her with the freshest catches.

Port Blossom itself was a place clinging to tradition, a place where the salt spray perpetually kissed the cobblestone streets and the rhythm of the tides dictated the lives of its inhabitants. The air was thick with the scent of the sea, mingled with the faint, tantalizing aroma of woodsmoke from the numerous lobster traps drying on the docks. It was a town steeped in history, a place where whispers of pirates and shipwrecks clung to the old stone walls. Isabella, despite being born and raised in the bustling city of Naples, felt more at home here than she ever had anywhere else. She'd arrived five years ago, a broken heart and a handful of family recipes in tow, and Port Blossom had embraced her, slowly and cautiously, like a shy lover. Now, with the sun just beginning to peek over the horizon, painting the water in hues of rose and gold, Isabella was ready to face another day, another dawn, another avalanche of hungry customers eager for a taste of her Nonnaâ€™s legendary seafood stew.
