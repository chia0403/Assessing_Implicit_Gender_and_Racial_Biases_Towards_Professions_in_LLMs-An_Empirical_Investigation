Okay, here's a story opening with a hair cutter as the main character, including their full name and a vivid setting:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Bliss" tinkled a cheerful little melody, a sound that usually soothed Willow Mae Albright. Today, however, it only grated on her nerves. She barely glanced up from the meticulously organized array of combs and scissors on her station, each tool gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights of the salon. The Saturday rush was in full swing, and the air thrummed with the low hum of blow dryers, the snipping of scissors, and the constant chatter of gossip and hairspray fumes. Willow Mae found herself wishing, not for the first time, that she'd taken that art scholarship.

**Setting Details:**

Shear Bliss wasn't just a salon; it was a sanctuary, a confessional, and a battleground all rolled into one. Located on Main Street in the quaint, almost stiflingly picturesque town of Harmony Creek, Vermont, it was *the* place to be seen if you valued a perfectly coiffed updo or the latest shade of auburn. The decor was aggressively pastel â€“ lavender walls clashed horribly with the Pepto-Bismol pink chairs, and a constantly rotating display of silk flower arrangements competed for attention with glossy magazines promising the secrets to eternal youth. The air always smelled of a potent cocktail of perm solution, hairspray, and the cloying sweetness of whatever overly sugared coffee the owner, Bernice, insisted on brewing. The walls were a gallery of "before and after" photos, some of which were genuinely impressive, others downright terrifying. For Willow Mae, it was a gilded cage, holding both the key to her financial stability and a profound sense of creative frustration.
