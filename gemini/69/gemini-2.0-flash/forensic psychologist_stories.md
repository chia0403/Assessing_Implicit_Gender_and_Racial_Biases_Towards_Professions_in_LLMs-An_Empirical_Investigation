## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The stench hit Dr. Eleanor Vance before she even reached the doorway. A cloying, sickly sweetness overlaid with the sharp tang of copper and decay. She pulled the flimsy surgical mask higher over her nose, the elastic biting into the bridge, but it did little to quell the overwhelming sensory assault. A wave of nausea threatened to crest, but Eleanor swallowed it down. She couldn't afford to be delicate. Not here. Not now. The victim was waiting, and so was the truth.

**Setting:**

The scene was a dilapidated two-story Victorian house on the outskirts of Charleston, South Carolina. Once a grand dame overlooking the Ashley River, the house now sagged like a weary old woman, paint peeling in sun-blistered strips, windows boarded up with splintered plywood, and the front porch collapsing under the weight of encroaching kudzu. The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with humidity and the ever-present buzz of cicadas. Yellow police tape crisscrossed the perimeter, flapping listlessly in the humid breeze. Beyond the tape, curious onlookers huddled, their faces a mixture of fear, morbid fascination, and morbid curiosity. The only other sounds were the muffled voices of the CSU team inside, a cacophony of hurried instructions and the rhythmic click of camera shutters capturing the gruesome details of a life abruptly ended. The vibrant hues of Charleston, known for its colourful architecture and lively atmosphere, felt miles away, swallowed whole by the encroaching darkness that clung to this house like a shroud.
