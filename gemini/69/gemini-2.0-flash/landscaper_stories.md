The late afternoon sun, a bruised orange against the emerald green of perfectly manicured lawns, cast long shadows across the manicured landscape of Willow Creek Estates. Dust motes danced in the fading light, swirling around the muscular arms of Theodore "Theo" Finch, a landscape architect and owner of "Finchscapes," as he meticulously pruned a rhododendron. He held the branch, considering its angle, a silent conversation between man and plant. Sweat beaded on his brow, mirroring the dewdrops that would soon settle on the freshly laid sod. Willow Creek Estates, a gated community nestled in the heart of the Pennsylvania countryside, was Theo's bread and butter â€“ a testament to his skill, his eye for detail, and his uncanny ability to coax beauty out of the earth. But beneath the placid surface of perfectly symmetrical flowerbeds and meticulously sculpted hedges, Theo felt a growing unease. The air here, always subtly perfumed with privilege and the faint scent of freshly cut grass, felt heavier lately, charged with something he couldn't quite define.
