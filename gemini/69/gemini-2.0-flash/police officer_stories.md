## Opening:

The rain hammered against the windshield of the Crown Victoria, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the diner across the street. Sergeant Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi leaned forward, squinting, the fluorescent lights reflecting in her tired, hazel eyes. Another stakeout, another night inhaling stale coffee fumes and the ghost of desperation hanging heavy in the air. The case was colder than the November wind whistling through the cracks in the aging car, and Izzy, usually a furnace of relentless energy, felt the chill settling deep in her bones. She took a long swig of the lukewarm coffee, the bitterness doing little to dispel the premonition that gnawed at her gut. Tonight, something was going to break. She could feel it, a low thrumming anxiety that resonated with the rhythmic splash of the wipers against the glass.

## Setting:

The setting is present-day **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**, specifically the gritty, working-class neighborhood of **Kensington**. The area is a patchwork of faded brick row houses, auto body shops, and the ubiquitous corner stores selling everything from lottery tickets to last-minute diapers. The diner across from Izzy, a greasy spoon establishment called **"The Liberty Bell Diner,"** is a beacon of questionable hygiene and lukewarm comfort in the otherwise bleak landscape. It’s the kind of place where secrets are whispered over chipped mugs and deals are brokered in dimly lit booths. The diner is surrounded by the oppressive atmosphere of a city struggling with poverty, addiction, and the constant hum of police sirens in the distance. The time is **late November, around 11:00 PM.** The air is damp and heavy, promising a long, miserable winter.
