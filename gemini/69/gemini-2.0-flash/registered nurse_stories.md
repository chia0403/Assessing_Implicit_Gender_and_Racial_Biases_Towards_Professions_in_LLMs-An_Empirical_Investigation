## Opening:

The scent of antiseptic was almost cloying tonight, a thick, familiar blanket Amelia Grace Davies couldn't seem to shake. It clung to her scrubs, permeated her skin, and even seemed to seep into the lukewarm coffee she nursed, a pathetic attempt to stay awake. At 3:17 AM, her shift was grinding towards its inevitable, slow-motion conclusion.

Amelia rubbed the bridge of her nose, the ghost of a headache thrumming behind her eyes. Another code blue, another near miss, another life hanging precariously in the balance. Tonight, it was Mrs. Petrocelli, a sweet, frail woman who always insisted on calling Amelia "Angel." The image of Mrs. Petrocelli's blue-tinged lips and the frantic scramble to find a vein still played on repeat in her mind.

She glanced across the brightly lit nurses' station, a haven of organized chaos amidst the swirling currents of the hospital. Papers overflowed from the filing system, monitors blinked with a disconcerting rhythm, and the hushed murmurs of her colleagues mingled with the distant, unsettling beep of a heart monitor somewhere down the hall. It was a symphony of sickness, a constant reminder of the fragility of life.

## Setting:

Amelia works on the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) of St. Jude's Hospital in downtown Philadelphia. The CCU is located on the third floor, a warren of interconnected rooms constantly buzzing with activity. The walls are painted a soothing, if somewhat institutional, shade of pale green, intended to calm both patients and staff. However, the constant influx of patients, the urgent calls for help, and the general high-stress environment often renders the calming paint job entirely ineffective.

The unit is equipped with state-of-the-art monitoring equipment, from EKG machines to ventilators, each humming a different, unnerving tune. Portable defibrillators stand ready in each hallway, a stark reminder of the critical care provided within these walls. The nurses' station, located in the center of the unit, is a hub of frantic activity, where nurses chart, coordinate with doctors, and comfort anxious family members. Outside the windows, the city sleeps, oblivious to the battles being fought within.
