The sterile scent of rubbing alcohol clung to the air, a stark contrast to the comforting aroma Beatrice Eleanor Sterling usually associated with her work. This wasn't her brightly lit, meticulously organized office at the prestigious Sterling Wellness Clinic in downtown Chicago. No, this was the cramped, dimly lit, and unsettlingly silent kitchen of what could charitably be described as a crack house.

Beatrice, whose pristine white coat felt absurdly out of place against the grime-coated walls, squinted at the sticky, oil-splattered stove. The flickering fluorescent bulb above did little to illuminate the questionable contents bubbling in a dented aluminum pot. Beatrice, armed with her trusty clipboard and a healthy dose of trepidation, had been summoned here by the intervention team. A plea to help Mr. Johnson – they hadn't specified a first name – reclaim his health, and hopefully, his life.

The air hung thick with a miasma of stale cigarette smoke, unwashed laundry, and something vaguely metallic that made Beatrice's stomach churn. She adjusted her spectacles, her normally optimistic blue eyes betraying a flicker of fear. This wasn't the kind of dietary challenge she usually faced, not the intricate balancing acts of gluten-free and low-carb for her affluent clientele. This was survival, plain and simple. And Beatrice Eleanor Sterling, Registered Dietitian, had a sneaking suspicion that she was about to face the biggest nutritional puzzle of her career.
