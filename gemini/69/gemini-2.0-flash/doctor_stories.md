The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestone street, painting a grim portrait of 1888 Whitechapel. Rain, a constant companion in this forgotten corner of London, slicked the uneven stones and reflected the sickly yellow glow in watery puddles. The air hung thick and heavy with the stench of coal smoke, refuse, and something else…something metallic and unsettling that tugged at the pit of Dr. Alistair Humphrey Blackwood’s stomach.

He tugged his tweed overcoat tighter around himself, the damp chill seeping into his bones despite the layers. The wind howled through the narrow alleyways, carrying with it whispers of dread and the frantic cries of street vendors hawking their wares – rotting vegetables and cheap gin, mostly. Alistair, a man of science and reason, tried to ignore the prickling unease that crawled up his spine as he hurried down Goulston Street, his leather doctor's bag bumping rhythmically against his thigh. He had a house call to make. A difficult one, judging by the frantic message he'd received from a distraught Mrs. Davies. And in this part of town, difficult often meant something far more sinister than a simple ailment.
