The fluorescent lights of the Eldridge Observatory hummed a discordant tune, a familiar lullaby to Elias Bartholomew Finch. He was, at 62, the building's only janitor, a silent, almost invisible fixture in a place dedicated to seeing the impossible. Dust motes danced in the single ray of morning sun that knifed through the observation deck's immense, open window, illuminating the swirling chaos he was trying to contain.

Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space. The observatory, perched precariously on the windswept peak of Mount Silvanus, felt more like a cathedral than a scientific institution. Its concrete walls were etched with intricate diagrams of constellations, and the air always tasted of ozone and somethingâ€¦ something vast and unnameable that seeped in from the endless canvas above. He pushed his wire-rimmed glasses up his nose and resumed his war against the ubiquitous dust, the rhythmic swish of his broom a lonely counterpoint to the whirring gears of the dormant telescope, a metallic leviathan waiting to be awakened. Today, like every other day for the past fifteen years, Elias Bartholomew Finch was tasked with keeping the cosmos at bay, at least within the four walls of the Eldridge Observatory.
