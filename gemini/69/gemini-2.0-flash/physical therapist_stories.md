## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The pungent scent of liniment hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Amelia Josephine Hawthorne. It mingled with the more subtle, less inviting aroma of stale sweat and overworked rubber matting, creating the signature perfume of Hawthorne Rehabilitation. Amelia sighed, tightening the Velcro strap on Mrs. Gable's ankle brace. "Alright, Mrs. Gable," she said, her voice warm and encouraging despite the throbbing ache in her own lower back, "let's see you take a few steps. Nice and slow, just like we practiced."

Mrs. Gable, a wisp of a woman with perpetually trembling hands, shuffled forward, her face a mask of concentration. Amelia's practiced eyes scanned Mrs. Gable's gait, noting the slight hitch in her left hip, the way she favored her right leg. It was a small improvement from yesterday, but an improvement nonetheless. Each tiny victory, each hesitant step, was a testament to the slow, grueling process of healing. A process Amelia knew intimately.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds primarily within Hawthorne Rehabilitation, a small, privately-owned physical therapy clinic nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a charming but quietly fading coastal town in Maine. The clinic itself occupies the ground floor of a renovated Victorian house, painted a cheerful shade of robin's egg blue that clashes mildly with the rust-colored shingles of the surrounding homes.

Inside, the clinic is divided into several areas. A bright, airy reception area, decorated with framed anatomical charts and landscape prints of local beaches, greets patients upon arrival. Beyond the reception, a large, open gymnasium houses various pieces of equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, and a cluttered corner dedicated to balance and agility exercises. Several smaller, private treatment rooms, each equipped with a padded examination table and various therapeutic tools, provide space for one-on-one consultations and treatments.

The overall atmosphere is one of quiet determination and gentle encouragement. Sunlight streams through the large windows, reflecting off the polished hardwood floors and creating a sense of hopefulness that often seems to defy the aches and pains of the patients who frequent it. But beneath the surface of this seemingly idyllic setting, Amelia is beginning to sense a growing unease, a subtle shift in the town's atmosphere that mirrors the precarious state of her own career and the future of Hawthorne Rehabilitation.
