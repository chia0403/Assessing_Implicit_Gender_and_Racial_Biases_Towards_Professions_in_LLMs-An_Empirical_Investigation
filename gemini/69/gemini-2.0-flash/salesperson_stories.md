Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a salesperson named Archibald Finch:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of "Office Oasis," a sprawling office supply store on the edge of a dying industrial park in Scranton, Pennsylvania, buzzed with a restless energy. The air, thick with the scent of cheap paper and stale coffee, hung heavy with the weight of unfulfilled quotas and the quiet desperation of its inhabitants. Rain lashed against the enormous windows, mirroring the dreary mood inside.

**Story Opening:**

Archibald Finch adjusted his tie, the knot feeling like a noose slowly tightening around his throat. He checked his reflection in the display case crammed with novelty staplers shaped like farm animals. His thinning hair was plastered to his forehead, damp with nervous sweat, and the dark circles under his eyes were more pronounced than usual. He needed this sale. He *desperately* needed this sale. It wasn't just about the measly commission â€“ it was about proving to himself, to his wife Mildred, and especially to his condescending manager, Mr. Henderson, that he wasn't a complete failure. He took a deep breath, forcing a smile that felt as genuine as a plastic fern. "Right, Archibald," he muttered to himself, "Showtime." He picked up the bulky demonstration model of the "Executive Ergonomic Task Chair 3000," a chair he secretly hated, and headed towards the reception desk, where a gruff-looking woman with a perm the color of burnt sugar was manning the phones. This was it. His last shot of the day. And if Mrs. Deborah Krantz, from Krantz & Sons Plumbing, didn't buy at least ten of these monstrosities...well, Archibald didn't even want to think about what Mr. Henderson would say.
