## Story Opening and Setting:

The air in "Strands of Serenity" was a heady cocktail of chamomile lotion, lemon-verbena candle, and just a hint of hairspray. Outside, a blustery November wind rattled the frosted windows, painting shifting patterns of light on the plush, lavender-colored carpet. Inside, it was a haven, a pocket of calm carved out from the chaos of Maplewood, Ohio.

Serenity was what **Gwendolyn Evelyn Hawthorne** aspired to offer. As the sole owner and operator of Strands of Serenity, Gwen poured her heart and soul into the small salon nestled between the bustling bakery and the antique shop on Maplewood's quaint Main Street. She believed everyone deserved a moment of tranquility, even if just for the length of a hair appointment.

This morning, however, tranquility was proving elusive. Gwen frantically patted the pockets of her embroidered smock, a delicate blush blooming on her already rosy cheeks. “Where are they? Where are they?!” she muttered under her breath, rummaging through the carefully organized trays of bobby pins and elastic bands. Her first client of the day, the formidable Mrs. Eleanor Plumtree, was due in five minutes, and Gwen was nowhere near ready. The calming chamomile lotion was doing absolutely nothing.

The culprit, as it often was these days, was a simple set of car keys. And without them, Gwen knew, she was stranded. Stranded in a salon, ironically dedicated to serenity, with a looming appointment and a rapidly escalating panic attack. This was not how she envisioned starting her Tuesday. Not at all.
