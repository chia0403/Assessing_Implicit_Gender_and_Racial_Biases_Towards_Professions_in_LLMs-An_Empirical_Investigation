The wind howled a mournful dirge outside, rattling the ancient windows of the clinic. Inside, the air smelled of antiseptic, wet dog, and a faint, lingering aroma of the herbal tea Dr. Eliza Grace Harding swore kept her sane. Eliza, her face etched with worry lines that belied her early forties, scrubbed her hands with a frantic energy, the rhythmic swish of the disinfectant a counterpoint to the tempestuous weather.

The setting was the Sea Haven Veterinary Clinic, a rambling, two-story building nestled on the rocky coast of Maine. Sea Haven, a small town clinging precariously to the edge of the Atlantic, was known for its stubborn resilience and even more stubborn inhabitants. The clinic, as weathered and seasoned as the town itself, had been in Elizaâ€™s family for three generations, since her great-grandfather, a gruff but brilliant surgeon, had swapped his city practice for the quieter, more predictable lives of lobsters and livestock. Now, Eliza carried the torch, treating everything from pampered Persian cats with anxiety to stubborn sheep with foot rot. Tonight, though, it was something far more urgent.

The power flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the room. Eliza glanced at the surgical table, where a limp, sodden form lay shrouded in a thick blanket. A young harbor seal, barely weaned, had been dragged ashore earlier that day, its body battered and bruised by the relentless waves. Eliza had been fighting to save it ever since, her heart aching with a fierce protectiveness that transcended species. The storm raged on, mirroring the turbulent uncertainty within her. She knew, with a sinking feeling, that this was a battle she might very well lose.
