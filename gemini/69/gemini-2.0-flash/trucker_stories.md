## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The CB radio crackled to life, spitting out a garbled warning about black ice on I-80 West near Evanston. Jebediah "Jeb" Riley, his brow furrowed like a plowed field, reached out and adjusted the squelch, but the warning was already fading into static. He glanced at the road ahead, a shimmering obsidian ribbon under the predatory glare of his truck's headlights. The snow wasn't falling now, but the air hung heavy with the threat of it. He’d learned to trust his gut on these runs, and his gut was screaming, louder than the rattling of the empty flatbed behind him. It wasn't just the ice, though. It was… something else. Something colder, something heavier, than just the bite of the Wyoming winter.

**Setting:**

The year is 1987. The scene is a stretch of Interstate 80 West, winding its way through the vast, desolate landscape of southwestern Wyoming in mid-December. Snow-dusted sagebrush clings stubbornly to the frozen ground on either side of the highway, illuminated only by the occasional passing headlights and the faint glow of the moon hidden behind a thick layer of clouds. The air is frigid, biting at any exposed skin. The rumble of Jebediah's eighteen-wheeler, a well-worn but lovingly maintained Kenworth W900, is a lonely sound in the vast silence, punctuated only by the mournful howl of the wind. The truck's cab is a haven of sorts, smelling of leather, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering aroma of Jeb's pipe tobacco. It's cluttered with maps, logbooks, and a well-worn copy of Louis L'Amour's "Heller With a Gun," but undeniably cozy, a small island of order in the chaotic wilderness.
