The fluorescent lights of "Accountable Affairs" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the lives lived within its grey-walled cubicles. Agatha Beatrice Plummett, a woman whose own name sounded like a particularly dense chapter in a Victorian novel, adjusted her spectacles, perched precariously on the bridge of her nose. Outside, a late afternoon drizzle slicked the grimy windows, blurring the already unremarkable view of the industrial park in the distance.

Agatha, a bookkeeper by trade and a creature of habit by nature, was wrestling with a particularly recalcitrant spreadsheet. The numbers, normally her obedient servants, seemed to have staged a rebellion, refusing to add up with any semblance of logic. This was not unheard of. Small businesses, especially the kind that "Accountable Affairs" catered to - plumbing companies with mysteriously high supply bills, construction firms with suspiciously low labor costs - tended to play fast and loose with their finances.

She sighed, the sound barely audible above the clatter of keyboards and the low murmur of office gossip. Agatha longed for the satisfying crack of a spine, the comforting scent of aged paper, the quiet company of fictional worlds. Instead, she was surrounded by invoices, ledgers, and the nagging suspicion that Mr. Henderson of "Henderson's Hot Water Heaters" was skimming a little more than hot water off the top. Tonight, she resolved, after battling this digital demon, she would treat herself to a Dickens novel and a generous slice of Battenberg cake. Until then, the numbers held her captive, in the grey, humming purgatory that was "Accountable Affairs."
