The ice clinked a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of conversation and the mournful sax solo leaking from the corner jukebox. Outside, the Seattle rain was doing its usual impression of the apocalypse, a relentless, grey curtain blurring the neon glow of the "Neptune's Kiss" sign. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of spilled whiskey, regret, and the lingering ghost of cheap perfume.

Standing behind the mahogany bar, polishing a highball glass until it shone under the dim, amber lighting, was Bartholomew "Barty" Nightingale. He ran a hand through his perpetually messy, salt-and-pepper hair, a weary sigh escaping his lips. It was a Tuesday night, which meant the usual suspects: lonely sailors, college students nursing their ramen-fueled wallets, and the occasional heartbroken poet scribbling away in the darkest booth. Bartholomew knew them all, their stories etching themselves into the worn wood of his bar like rings on a tree, each one a testament to the ebb and flow of human drama. Tonight, however, felt different. An unsettling quiet hung in the air, heavier than the usual Seattle gloom, and Bartholomew Nightingale had a feeling that something, somewhere, was about to break.
