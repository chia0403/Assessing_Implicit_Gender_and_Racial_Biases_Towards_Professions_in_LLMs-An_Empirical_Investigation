Delphine adjusted the strap of her worn, floral-print apron and surveyed her kingdom. The towering columns, painted a pristine white that was constantly under siege by mildew, rose majestically towards the fading light. The rhythmic chirp of cicadas was a constant soundtrack, punctuated by the occasional mournful wail of a distant train. Inside, the house was a labyrinth of shadowed hallways and rooms filled with the ghosts of generations past. Tonight, she would tackle the library, a room that smelled of leather-bound books and quiet despair. It was a daunting task, but Delphine Marie Broussard had cleaned worse. After all, she had a house – and a history – of her own to tend to.
