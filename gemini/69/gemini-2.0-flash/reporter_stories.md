## Story Opening:

The smell of stale coffee and burnt toast clung to Amelia Stone like a second skin. It was the scent of deadlines missed and stories chased, the aroma of The City Echo's newsroom, and Amelia knew, with a bone-deep certainty that had nothing to do with logic and everything to do with journalistic intuition, that today was going to be a day. A *big* day.

She took a fortifying gulp of the aforementioned coffee – strong enough to jumpstart a dead horse – and surveyed the battlefield. Desks overflowed with paper, half-eaten bagels, and discarded newspapers. The air hummed with the low, persistent drone of keyboard clicks and hushed phone calls. Across the room, veteran crime reporter, Tony "The Hammer" Hamilton, was bellowing into his receiver, punctuating his sentences with furious jabs at his desk with a ballpoint pen.

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It was 7:15 AM, barely light outside, and already the city was clamoring for stories. Stories she needed to find.

## Setting:

**The City Echo Newsroom, Downtown Metropolis**

The newsroom of The City Echo was a sprawling, chaotic space located on the third floor of a pre-war building in the heart of Downtown Metropolis. Once a grand ballroom, the high ceilings and ornate plasterwork were now masked by layers of fluorescent lighting and haphazardly placed cubicles. Sunlight, when it managed to break through the towering skyscrapers, filtered weakly through the dusty, arched windows, illuminating motes of paper dust dancing in the air.

The walls were plastered with clippings, maps of the city, and motivational posters that had long since lost their motivational power. The floor, a once elegant parquet, was now covered in worn, stained carpet that had seen better decades. The air perpetually thrummed with the energy of overworked reporters, stressed editors, and the constant, insistent rhythm of the city just outside its walls.
