The acrid smell of burnt clutch hung thick in the air, clinging to everything in Danny's Garage like a persistent ghost. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom of the open bay door, illuminating the grime coating Daniel Alexander Riley, better known to everyone as Danny. He straightened up, wiping a greasy hand across his brow, leaving a dark smudge on his already soot-stained forehead. He stretched, his back popping in protest after hours hunched under the rusted chassis of a 1967 Mustang.

Danny's Garage was a testament to a life lived elbow-deep in engines and oil. Located just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, it was a single-story cinderblock building, painted a faded, peeling blue that had probably been vibrant sometime around the Nixon administration. Inside, tools hung from pegboards like organized weaponry, their gleam dulled by years of use. A calendar showcasing vintage cars hung crookedly on the wall, perpetually stuck on July 1978. The radio, perpetually tuned to a classic rock station, crackled static in between songs, providing the soundtrack to Danny's solitary world. This was his sanctuary, his kingdom, and the Mustang, with its stubborn transmission and years of neglect, was his latest conquest.
