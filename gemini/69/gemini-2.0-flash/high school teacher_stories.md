The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed with a low, incessant hum, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Anne Pritchardâ€™s growing dread. It was 6:58 AM, and the pale light of a late October morning barely pierced the grimy windows of her classroom. Room 204, "Ancient World History," smelled faintly of dust, old textbooks, and the lingering ghost of teenage sweat. Eleanor, a woman whose carefully coiffed brown hair and tailored tweed jackets screamed "order," hated Mondays. Especially Mondays that followed a weekend spent grading a particularly atrocious batch of student essays on the Punic Wars. The essays, much like the buzzing lights, had been a relentless, mind-numbing drone. This Monday, however, felt heavier than usual. There was a tension in the air, a strange stillness that went beyond the usual pre-bell quiet. Eleanor felt it prickling at the back of her neck as she meticulously arranged her neatly stacked textbooks, a tiny island of control in the impending storm of hormonal chaos that was about to flood her room. She just hoped this day wouldn't be the one that finally made her snap and run screaming into the parking lot, never to return.
