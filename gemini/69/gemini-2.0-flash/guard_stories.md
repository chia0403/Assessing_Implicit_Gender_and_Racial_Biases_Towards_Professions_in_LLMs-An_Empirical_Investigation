Okay, here's a story opening with setting and a main character, Marcus Aurelius Thorne, a guard:

**Opening:**

The rhythmic clang of Marcus Aurelius Thorne's halberd against the cobblestones was the only sound that dared challenge the biting wind. He'd grown so accustomed to it, the metallic 'thunk' a constant companion in the long hours of watch, that he barely registered it anymore. He was more keenly aware of the gnawing ache in his bones, a familiar protest against the damp chill that seeped up from the stone and into his marrow. Tonight, however, the familiar comfort was shattered as a sudden, ear-piercing scream ripped through the air. It sounded very close and very panicked.

**Setting:**

The city of Veridia clings precariously to the edge of the whispering woods, a final beacon of civilization before the wilderness takes over. Forged upon a strategic trade route centuries ago, it has grown into a bustling hub of merchants, artisans, and travellers. But that very trade route also makes it a target.

The walls of Veridia, built from grey granite quarried from the nearby mountains, stand tall and imposing, a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk beyond the city's borders. Towers, each topped with crenellations and manned by guards like Marcus, punctuate the wall's length, offering a watchful gaze over the surrounding landscape.

The section of the wall where Marcus currently stands overlooks the Blackwater Gate, the city's primary entrance to the North, and an area known for occasional bandit activity. It was a strategic and fairly busy post, not the most desirable location for a quiet shift, which tonight did not seem to be.

**(Further context you can use for writing the rest of the story)**

*   Marcus is a veteran guard, perhaps a bit jaded but fundamentally decent. He's seen his share of troubles and isn't easily startled, but the scream rattled him.
*   Veridia is prosperous, but the shadow of unrest is growing. Tensions simmer between the established merchant class and the growing number of impoverished refugees who have fled the encroaching wilderness.
*   The whispering woods are not just a forest; they are rumored to be haunted, or worse, infested with creatures long thought to be myth. The woods are a source of fear and superstition for the people of Veridia.
*   Marcus is about 40 years old. He is of average height, but is powerfully built. He has grey streaks in his close cropped dark brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard.

I hope this is helpful to get you started. Good luck!
