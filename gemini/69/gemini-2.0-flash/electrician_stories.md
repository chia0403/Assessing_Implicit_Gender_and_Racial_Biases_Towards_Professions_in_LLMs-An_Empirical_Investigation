The flickering fluorescent tubes in the "Bargain Basement Bonanza" buzzed like angry wasps, each flicker threatening to plunge the crammed aisles into complete darkness. For Eleanor Marie Rossi, an electrician with calloused hands and a knack for troubleshooting wiring problems most folks wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole, it was just another Tuesday.

The Bonanza, a sprawling warehouse on the outskirts of Oakhaven, Nebraska, was a haven for bargain hunters, a monument to slightly damaged goods, and Eleanor's current nemesis. The owner, a Mr. Cecil P. Higgins, a man whose comb-over seemed to defy the laws of physics and static electricity, had summoned her with a desperate, almost theatrical, cry of, “Electricity be gone!”

Eleanor adjusted her tool belt, the weight of her necessities a comforting presence against her hip. The air hung thick with the scent of mothballs, cheap plastic, and a lingering hint of desperation. Racks overflowed with mismatched socks, chipped teacups, and obsolete electronics. Strings of faded Christmas lights draped haphazardly from the ceiling, looking more like strangled vines than festive decorations. Eleanor sighed. This wasn't going to be a simple burnt-out bulb. This was going to be a whole mess of potential code violations and Mr. Higgins' increasingly frantic pronouncements about "electromagnetic gremlins."

Oakhaven, Nebraska, itself was a town stuck in a perpetual state of "nearly flourishing." The promise of progress always seemed just out of reach, like a horizon that constantly recedes. Eleanor had grown up in Oakhaven, wiring her first shed with her grandfather when she was ten. Leaving had never crossed her mind; the familiar routines, the friendly faces (and even the occasional eccentric, like Mr. Higgins), were comforting. But sometimes, standing in the middle of a fluorescent-lit wasteland like the Bargain Basement Bonanza, she wondered if she was truly charging enough.
