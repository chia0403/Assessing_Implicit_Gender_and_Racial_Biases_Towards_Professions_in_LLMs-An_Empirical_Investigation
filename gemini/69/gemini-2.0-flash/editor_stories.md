## Story Opening:

The aroma of burnt coffee, usually a comforting presence in Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne's cramped office, was today a testament to a day already gone wrong. Outside, the relentless January rain hammered against the grimy window of Hawthorne Literary Agency, mimicking the drumming anxiety in Beatrice’s chest. A manuscript, rejected so vehemently she could practically taste the author’s fury, lay crumpled in her wastepaper basket. 

Beatrice, a woman whose entire professional life revolved around taming unruly sentences and coaxing brilliance from raw ideas, felt utterly, frustratingly out of control. Her phone buzzed – another email from Mr. Finch, demanding a status update on the Peterson biography. He was becoming less subtle with his threats to "re-evaluate her performance." 

She sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic thrum of the rain. This wasn't how she envisioned her Tuesday. This wasn't how she envisioned her career, dammit. At 38, Beatrice Hawthorne was starting to suspect that her lifelong passion for words was slowly strangling her.

## Setting:

**Hawthorne Literary Agency, London, 2024.**

The agency occupied the third floor of a dilapidated Victorian building in Bloomsbury, just a stone's throw from the British Museum. The building, with its peeling paint and eternally creaking staircase, had a certain faded grandeur that Beatrice found both charming and depressing.

Her office, a shoebox-sized room overlooking a narrow, perpetually damp alley, was crammed with overflowing bookshelves, teetering piles of manuscripts, and an assortment of half-empty coffee cups. The walls were plastered with book covers, author photographs, and inspirational quotes hastily scrawled on sticky notes – a chaotic tapestry reflecting Beatrice's own perpetually overloaded mind. The air hung thick with the smell of old paper, cheap ink, and the lingering scent of stale biscuits. It was a space that breathed books, a sanctuary of sorts, but one that was starting to feel increasingly suffocating.
