## Story Opening:

The rasp of steel on granite was a familiar song to Elias Thorne. Each strike sent a fine, grey dust dancing in the morning light, coating his beard, his calloused hands, and the rough canvas apron tied tight around his waist. He barely noticed it anymore, the dust having become as integral to his being as the granite he wrestled with each day. He worked with a deliberate, rhythmic precision, a symphony of controlled force and patient artistry, coaxing beauty from the unyielding stone.

Today, however, the song felt discordant. His hammer blows lacked their usual conviction, landing with a dull thud rather than a ringing echo. Doubts, like insidious weeds, had taken root in his mind, threatening to choke the joy he usually found in his craft. Doubts about the commission, doubts about his skill, but most of all, doubts about the patron who had commissioned it.

## Setting:

Elias's workshop clung precariously to the side of the Silverpeak Mountain, a rugged, windswept landscape dotted with hardy pines and the occasional, stubborn wildflower. The structure itself was a ramshackle affair, built from scavenged timber and the very stone Elias carved. One side was open to the elements, offering a breathtaking, albeit somewhat terrifying, view of the valley far below. On clear days, he could see the shimmering ribbon of the River Serpentine snaking its way towards the distant coast.

Inside, the workshop was a chaotic testament to his craft. Slabs of granite in varying sizes leaned against the walls, their surfaces etched with the preliminary lines of future sculptures. Chisels, hammers, and mallets of all shapes and sizes lay scattered on workbenches, alongside sketches scribbled on scraps of parchment. The air was thick with the scent of stone dust and the faint, underlying fragrance of pine. A small, pot-bellied stove in the corner offered meager warmth on even the warmest days, and a half-finished tankard of ale sat precariously on a nearby crate, evidence of Elias's interrupted lunch. It was a space both beautiful and unforgiving, a reflection of the man who called it home.
