The harsh, pre-dawn air bit at the exposed skin on Dale Everett Peterson's face as he climbed into the cab of the Komatsu PC360LC-11 excavator. His breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the already murky view through the grimy windshield. The seat groaned under his weight, a familiar sound he barely registered anymore. This machine, nicknamed "The Beast" by the other operators, was his domain.

The setting was a scar on the face of the Appalachian Mountains, a ravaged section of land near the small, forgotten town of Harmony Creek, Kentucky. The air, thick with the smell of diesel and freshly churned earth, hung heavy over the site. The company, 'Appalachian Coal & Reclamation, LLC', promised to bring jobs and prosperity back to the struggling community, but Dale knew better. He'd seen promises like that broken more times than he'd changed the oil on this beast of a machine.

Above him, the silhouette of Black Mountain loomed, a constant, silent witness to the relentless grind of progress, or what passed for it in these parts. The mountainâ€™s peak was barely visible through the low-lying fog, adding an eerie, almost ethereal quality to the otherwise brutal landscape of flattened trees and raw earth. This was the end of his shift, but the sun, sluggish and reluctant, was barely thinking about rising. Another day, another mountain slowly disappearing, one scoop at a time. Dale flipped on the ignition, the engine roaring to life like a slumbering giant awakened, and another day began.
