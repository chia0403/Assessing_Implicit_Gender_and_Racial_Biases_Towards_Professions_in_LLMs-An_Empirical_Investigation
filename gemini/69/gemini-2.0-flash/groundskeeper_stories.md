## The Whispering Grove

**Opening:**

The damp chill of a late October morning clung to the air like a shroud, seeping into Barnaby Finch's bones as he pushed the wheelbarrow along the serpentine path. Mist, thick as cotton, clung to the gnarled branches of the ancient oak trees, their leaves, tinged crimson and gold, dropping with mournful sighs. Barnaby paused, the metal of the wheelbarrow handle biting into his calloused palms, and listened. He could hear it, a low, susurrant whisper weaving through the rustling leaves, a voice that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the grove. He'd heard it before, many times, these past twenty years he'd tended the grounds, but it never failed to send a shiver crawling down his spine. He was a practical man, Barnaby Finch, a man of the earth and the seasons, but even he couldn't deny the strange energy that permeated this place.

**Setting:**

The setting is the grounds of Blackwood Manor, a vast, overgrown estate situated in the heart of the Somerset countryside, England. The manor itself is a gothic behemoth, its grey stone walls riddled with ivy and its numerous windows staring out like vacant eyes. But it is the surrounding grounds that are truly remarkable, particularly "The Whispering Grove," a dense cluster of ancient oak trees, rumored to be hundreds of years old. Within the grove, the air is still and heavy, the sunlight filtered into dappled patterns on the moss-covered ground. Twisted roots, like slumbering serpents, wind their way across the earth, and an eerie silence hangs, broken only by the rustling leaves and, of course, that ever-present whisper. The rest of the grounds consist of sprawling, neglected gardens, overgrown with weeds and wildflowers, a crumbling stone wall that encircles the property, and a small, dilapidated greenhouse, its glass panes cracked and missing. Blackwood Manor, and its grounds, are shrouded in a sense of history, mystery, and a lingering melancholy. They are a place where secrets sleep, waiting to be unearthed.
