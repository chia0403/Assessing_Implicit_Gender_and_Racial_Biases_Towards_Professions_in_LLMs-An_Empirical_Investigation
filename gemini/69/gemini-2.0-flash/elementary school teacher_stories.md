The biting November wind clawed at the frosted windows of Mrs. Elara Meadowbrook's classroom, scattering motes of chalk dust that hung in the air like miniature, defiant stars. Elara, all five-foot-two of her, stood on tiptoe, painstakingly taping construction paper turkeys to the top of the blackboard. Each one, meticulously decorated with googly eyes and glitter glue, represented a student in her third-grade class at Maplewood Elementary School.

Maplewood, a squat brick building smelling perpetually of floor wax and lukewarm cafeteria chili, sat nestled in the sleepy, leafy suburb of Oakhaven. In Elara's opinion, Oakhaven was a town perpetually stuck in a Norman Rockwell painting, a place where the biggest excitement was the annual pumpkin carving contest and the loudest sound, the distant rumble of the commuter train heading to the city. It was safe, predictable, and, honestly, a little bit boring.

Elara, however, was anything but boring. Underneath her cardigan sweaters and sensible shoes, simmered a quiet energy, a longing for something more than predictable Parent-Teacher conferences and the annual Thanksgiving play. She yearned for adventure, for a mystery to unravel, something to break the mundane rhythm of spelling tests and multiplication tables. And as she smoothed down the last turkey's tail feathers, she had a nagging feeling that something, somewhere, was about to give her exactly what she wished for. A feeling that felt a lot like the electric static that always preceded a particularly fierce Oakhaven thunderstorm.
