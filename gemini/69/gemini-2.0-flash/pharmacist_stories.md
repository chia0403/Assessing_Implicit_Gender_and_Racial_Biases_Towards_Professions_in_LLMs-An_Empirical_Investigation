## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "The Corner Cure" jingled a familiar, lonely tune, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had heard more times than she could count in her forty-two years. It was a Tuesday evening, past eight o'clock, and the last vestiges of daylight were bleeding away beyond the dusty windows. Beatrice, perched on a stool behind the mahogany counter, meticulously arranging bottles of cough syrup by expiry date, sighed softly. She should have locked up ten minutes ago, but the familiar ache of anticipation, the hope that someone, *anyone*, would need her expertise, kept her tethered to her post.

The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous counterpoint to the jingle, amplifying the silence that usually suffocated her on these late nights. Outside, the rain started again, a dismal drumbeat against the already dilapidated awning, promising another slow, melancholic evening in Havenwood. Beatrice adjusted her spectacles, the chain clinking softly against her starched white coat, and waited. Perhaps it would be Mrs. Gable needing her blood pressure checked, or young Timmy Henderson with another rash that required calamine lotion. Or, perhaps, just perhaps, it would be someone who truly needed something more than medicine.

## Setting:

Havenwood, Pennsylvania, was a town that time seemed to have forgotten. Once a thriving hub for the local lumber industry, the forests had been stripped bare decades ago, leaving behind a skeletal landscape and a dying economy. The town square, dominated by a chipped and weathered statue of a local war hero, boasted a single, struggling grocery store, a perpetually closed bakery, and Beatrice's pharmacy, "The Corner Cure," the last bastion of hope, or at least aspirin, for its dwindling population. The buildings were mostly Victorian in style, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin, and a pervasive sense of resignation hung in the air, thick as the fog that often rolled in from the nearby mountains.

"The Corner Cure" was a reflection of Havenwood itself â€“ a place clinging to the past. The shelves, overflowing with remedies both modern and antiquated, creaked under the weight of jars filled with tinctures Beatrice had learned to make from her grandmother. The scent of dried herbs and medicinal alcohol permeated the air, mingling with the faint aroma of beeswax polish that Beatrice religiously applied to the counter every Sunday. A faded photograph of her grandfather, the pharmacy's founder, hung proudly behind the till, a silent reminder of a time when Havenwood, and "The Corner Cure," were thriving. The only modern concession was the computer terminal nestled amongst the cluttered shelves, a necessary evil in a world increasingly driven by digital records. It felt out of place, like a sleek, futuristic spacecraft landed in a dusty, forgotten antique shop.
