The rain, a relentless, horizontal sheet driven by a November gale, hammered against the window of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s small office above the bustling Pike Place Market. Seattle in November was a study in grey, a mood that often mirrored her caseload. The rhythmic drumming against the glass, however, was a welcome distraction tonight. Eleanor, a woman whose own life often felt as tangled and unpredictable as the fishing nets hanging in the stalls below, found a strange solace in its constancy.

Eleanor adjusted the warm, woolen shawl draped over her shoulders and took another sip of lukewarm tea. The mug, a chipped ceramic masterpiece gifted to her by a particularly grateful, if slightly eccentric, client, read "Keep Calm and Meditate Like a Squirrel." It was a fitting mantra, she thought, for someone tasked with untangling the anxieties and traumas of the human psyche.

Her office, "The Vance Counseling Collective," was a reflection of Eleanor herself: cluttered but comfortable, professional yet undeniably personal. Books lined the walls, ranging from well-worn copies of Freud to dog-eared paperbacks on mindfulness. A small, battered armchair sat opposite her own, currently unoccupied, waiting for the next soul seeking refuge from the storm brewing within. The air hummed with the low thrum of the building and the promise of another long evening helping others navigate their inner landscapes. Tonight, she suspected, would be no different.
