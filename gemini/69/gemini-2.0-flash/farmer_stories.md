The biting wind, smelling sharply of turned earth and the promise of snow, whipped around Silas Bartholomew Abernathy's weathered face as he surveyed his fields. He pulled his worn, wool cap lower, its brim barely shielding his eyes from the harsh glare of the late afternoon sun. The sun, a pale and watery disc, hung low in the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows of the skeletal trees that lined the western edge of his property.

Silas's farm, "Abernathy Acres," was nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia. For three generations, the Abernathy family had coaxed life from this particular patch of earth, their lives inextricably intertwined with the cyclical rhythms of the land. It was a beautiful, demanding place, framed by the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, whose jagged peaks were already dusted with the first tentative snows of winter. The farmhouse, a sturdy, two-story structure built from local stone, stood as a testament to their resilience, its aged timbers creaking a familiar song in the wind. Now, however, a disquiet hung in the air, thicker than the damp November fog that often clung to the valley floor. The fields lay barren, waiting, and Silas, his heart heavy, feared they would be waiting a very long time.
