The air in Mrs. Penelope Primrose’s kindergarten classroom, Room 4B, perpetually smelled of Elmer’s glue, Play-Doh, and slightly sweaty, five-year-old exuberance. Sunlight, filtered through paper snowflakes clinging precariously to the window, dappled across the linoleum floor, a vibrant mosaic of spilled glitter and crayon shards. It was a Friday afternoon, that glorious cusp between a week of sticky-fingered chaos and the sweet, sweet promise of a weekend. Penelope, her auburn hair threatening to escape its tidy bun, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye, mentally cataloging the casualties of finger-painting: a rogue smear of crimson on Barnaby’s cheek, a suspicious glob of purple clinging to Clementine’s eyebrow, and a small, but undeniable, crater in a tub of glitter. She sighed, a sound that was both weary and fond. This was her world. This was her beautiful, chaotic, five-year-old kingdom. And today, it was about to get a whole lot more interesting.
