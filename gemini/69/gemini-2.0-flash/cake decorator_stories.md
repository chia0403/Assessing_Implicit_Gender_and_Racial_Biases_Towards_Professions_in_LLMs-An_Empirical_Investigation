The scent of vanilla and buttercream hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket that clung to everything in "A Sweet Surrender Bakery." Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun escaping wisps framing her face, hummed along to the Ella Fitzgerald playing softly on the antique radio perched on a shelf overflowing with sprinkles and piping bags. Outside, a blustery November wind rattled the windows of the small shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina. The flickering gas lamps lining the street cast long, dancing shadows that only added to the bakery's cozy, almost enchanted, atmosphere. 

Beatrice, normally serene and focused when crafting her edible masterpieces, was currently wrestling with a particularly stubborn fondant rose, its petals stubbornly refusing to cooperate. She muttered under her breath, a stream of gentle curses usually reserved for when her cat, a fluffy Persian named Prince Albert, decided the counter was a suitable place for a nap. Today, however, the fondant was the primary antagonist. This cake, a towering six-tiered affair decorated with intricate sugar lace and hand-painted magnolias, was for the wedding of Savannah Delacroix, a socialite whose extravagant taste was only matched by her reputation for being utterly impossible to please. Beatrice knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that one slightly off-kilter rose could unravel all her hard work and potentially tarnish the reputation of "A Sweet Surrender," a reputation she'd painstakingly built, one perfectly frosted cupcake at a time.
