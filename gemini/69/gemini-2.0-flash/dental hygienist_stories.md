The fluorescent lights of "Smile Brite Dental" hummed a low, irritating tune, a song Amelia Grace Harding knew as intimately as her own reflection. She pressed the back of her hand to her forehead, feeling the familiar prickle of stress rising beneath her skin. The waiting room, decorated in an aggressively cheerful blue, was packed tighter than a wisdom tooth extraction on a Friday afternoon. Outside, a typical Seattle drizzle painted the windows a blurry grey, mirroring the feeling of being perpetually waterlogged she often experienced these days.

Amelia, a dental hygienist with seven years under her belt and a growing collection of ergonomic back supports, sighed and glanced at the clock. It was 8:58 AM. Only two minutes until Mrs. Higgins, a notorious gossip and prolific spit-producer, was due for her cleaning. And after Mrs. Higgins, Mr. Henderson, who invariably spent the entire appointment complaining about the price of tea. Amelia loved her job, truly she did, but some days it felt like she was more of a therapist and amateur comedienne than a professional teeth cleaner.
