The biting wind, a common companion to anyone who dared scale the heights of the Windy City, ripped at Arthur Penhaligon's worn Carhartt jacket. Chicago spread out beneath him, a jagged tapestry of brick and steel, softened only by the hazy, pre-dawn glow licking at the horizon. The air tasted of exhaust fumes and the sweet, yeasty tang of baking bread from the Gold Coast bakeries far below. Arthur, his calloused fingers gripping the weathered shingles, wasn't concerned with the view, though. Not this morning. He was too busy wrestling with the remnants of the previous night's storm, a particularly nasty squall that had left a trail of destruction across the aging Victorian mansions lining Lake Shore Drive.

He was perched precariously on the steeply-pitched roof of the "Beaumont Residence," a stately, if somewhat dilapidated, three-story brownstone. The house, with its intricate gargoyles and wrought iron balconies, had seen better days. Like Arthur, it carried the scars of time, each cracked shingle and crumbling brick a testament to the relentless march of the Chicago seasons. The slate tiles, loosened by the storm, lay scattered like fallen leaves, a dangerous obstacle course between Arthur and the gaping hole that threatened to expose the Beaumont family's prized antiques to the elements. He just hoped Mrs. Beaumont had remembered to call her insurance company. Arthur Penhaligon certainly didn't want to be the one explaining why a priceless Qing Dynasty vase was currently serving as a birdbath.
