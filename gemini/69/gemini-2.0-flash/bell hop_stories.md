Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a bellhop named Bartholomew “Barty” Finch:

**Setting:** The Grand Zenith Hotel, a sprawling Art Deco masterpiece that dominated the skyline of the fictional city of Aethelburg. Its gilded eagles perched on every cornice, and the revolving doors were perpetually gleaming from the constant attention of a uniformed doorman. Inside, the lobby shimmered with polished marble floors, crystal chandeliers that dripped with light, and the subtle murmur of hushed conversations in a dozen different languages. The air smelled perpetually of lilies and old money.

**Opening:**

Bartholomew “Barty” Finch hated Wednesdays. Not because of any inherent dread associated with the day itself, but because Wednesdays at the Grand Zenith Hotel were invariably chaotic. It was the day the shipping magnates arrived, the day the opera singers checked in, the day the vaguely suspicious men in dark suits lingered in the lobby, their eyes darting from face to face. Barty, with his starched uniform, his perpetually apologetic smile, and his uncanny ability to balance towers of luggage, was the fulcrum upon which much of this controlled chaos rested.

Today was no exception. As he wrestled a particularly unwieldy trunk, plastered with labels from exotic ports, towards the elevators, Barty overheard a snippet of a particularly heated conversation. A woman, dripping in diamonds that looked like solidified starlight, was berating a man whose face was rapidly turning the color of a well-worn plum.

"…absolutely unacceptable, Reginald! I booked the Imperial Suite six months in advance! Six months!" Her voice, though refined, could cut glass. Barty swallowed, hoping his proximity wouldn't draw her wrath.

Just another Wednesday at the Zenith. He just hoped he wouldn't have to deliver any disgruntled divas to their rooms before his afternoon break. He desperately needed a strong cup of Earl Grey and a quiet corner to escape the gilded cage of the Grand Zenith for a few precious minutes.
