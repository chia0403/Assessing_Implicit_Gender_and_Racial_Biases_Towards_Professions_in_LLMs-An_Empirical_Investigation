**Setting:** The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient redwood forest in Northern California, near Klamath. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, clung to everything. A perpetual twilight reigned under the canopy, even at midday, the sun only managing to filter through in fragmented shards of light. Giant ferns, their fronds heavy with moisture, lined the forest floor, a carpet of green swallowing fallen branches and decaying leaves. The whine of a chainsaw, a jarring intrusion against the primeval silence, echoed across the valley.

**Opening:** Silas Ebenezer Blackwood spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the damp earth, the brown juice dissolving amongst the fallen needles. He wiped his gloved hand across his weathered brow, leaving a streak of grime on the already dirty leather. The redwood before him, a titan that had stood watch over these woods for centuries, seemed to sigh in the face of its impending doom. Silas wasn't oblivious to the grandeur, the sheer majesty of the tree. He just had a job to do. A family to feed. And the bills, damn them, never stopped coming. He adjusted the safety goggles perched on his nose and gripped the chainsaw tighter. Today, another giant fell.
