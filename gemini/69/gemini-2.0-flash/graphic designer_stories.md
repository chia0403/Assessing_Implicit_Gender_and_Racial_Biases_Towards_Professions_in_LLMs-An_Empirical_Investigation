Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a graphic designer:

**Setting:** A bustling, slightly chaotic, co-working space called "The Hive" in the trendy Shoreditch area of London. Sunlight streams (or at least attempts to, given London's propensity for cloud cover) through large, industrial windows, illuminating exposed brick walls plastered with motivational posters and quirky artwork. The air is thick with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the clatter of keyboards, and snippets of conversations ranging from app development to the best vegan sushi place nearby.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Rose Ainsworth stared blankly at the vibrant mock-up on her 27-inch iMac, the neon pink and electric blue clashing in a way that made her teeth ache. The client, a "revolutionary" dating app called "Spark," wanted bold, edgy, and unapologetically Gen Z. Eleanor, frankly, felt about as Gen Z as a Victorian teapot. She sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic thump of techno emanating from the DJ station in the corner of The Hive.

"Spark's" brief had been simple enough: "Make us pop, make us relevant, make us the Tinder-killer!" Except, "popping" in the context of online dating seemed to involve an alarming amount of glittery unicorns, suggestive emojis, and fonts that looked like they'd been designed by a hyperactive toddler on a sugar rush. Eleanor, whose personal design aesthetic leaned more towards Bauhaus minimalism and muted earth tones, felt like she was slowly losing her grip on reality. Maybe she should have stuck to designing book covers for historical romances. At least those only required tastefully arranged corsets and windswept hair.
