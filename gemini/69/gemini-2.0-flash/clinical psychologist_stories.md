## The Story Opening:

The rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Evelyn Grace Albright's office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. The city lights of Seattle blurred into streaks of amber and white, offering little comfort against the oppressive silence. Evelyn swiveled in her ergonomic chair, the leather squeaking a protest against the sudden movement. Her fingers, adorned with a simple silver band, drummed a restless rhythm against the mahogany desk.

The file in front of her, stark white against the dark wood, held the key to a mystery that was slowly unraveling, thread by agonizing thread. Sarah, a young woman with eyes as deep and turbulent as the Puget Sound on a stormy day, was convinced she was being haunted. Not by ghosts, Evelyn suspected, but by something far more insidious: the whispers of a past she couldn’t quite grasp, a trauma buried so deep it threatened to consume her.

Evelyn sighed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the storm outside. She’d dedicated her life to understanding the intricacies of the human mind, to helping people navigate the labyrinthine corridors of their memories. But Sarah’s case was different. It felt…wrong. As if something else, something external, was at play. The hairs on the back of Evelyn's neck prickled, a cold wave washing over her despite the warm hum of the office's climate control. She just hoped she could unlock the truth before Sarah, and possibly Evelyn herself, were irrevocably lost.

## The Setting:

Dr. Evelyn Grace Albright's private practice, "Inner Harbor Psychology," occupied the entire 27th floor of the iconic Rainier Tower in downtown Seattle. The space was designed to be both sophisticated and calming, a haven from the city's frenetic energy.

**Key features:**

*   **Panoramic View:** Floor-to-ceiling windows offered breathtaking views of the Seattle skyline, Puget Sound, and the Olympic Mountains on clear days. Today, however, the view was obscured by a deluge.
*   **Modern Aesthetic:** The office boasted a clean, contemporary design with minimalist furniture, soft lighting, and muted colors. Think shades of grey, cream, and soft blues, accented by natural wood.
*   **Thoughtful Details:** Evelyn had incorporated elements of biophilic design, with strategically placed plants and natural materials to create a sense of peace and connection to nature.
*   **Secure Environment:** A state-of-the-art security system, including keycard access and discreet surveillance, ensured the privacy and safety of both Evelyn and her clients.
*   **Evelyn's Personal Touch:** Despite the modern design, personal touches were evident throughout. Shelves held carefully curated books on psychology, art, and philosophy. A vibrant abstract painting, done by her late mother, hung above the couch in the waiting room. And in her own office, a small framed photograph of Evelyn hiking in the Cascade Mountains sat on her desk, a reminder of the peace she found in nature.
