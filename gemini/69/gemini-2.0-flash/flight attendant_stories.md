## Story Opening & Setting

**Story Opening:**

The turbulence hit as fiercely as a jilted lover's slap, sending Amelia Josephine Bell against the galley wall with a muted thud. Coffee, freshly brewed and meant to be a comforting pick-me-up for weary travelers, sloshed over the stainless steel counter, forming a bitter, brown puddle. Amelia winced, a sharp pain blooming in her shoulder, and gripped the edge of the counter, her knuckles bone-white. Above the roar of the straining engines and the terrified cries of passengers, she could hear the chilling crackle of the intercom. This was it, she thought, the moment all the drills had prepared her for, the moment that separated the professionals from the panic-stricken. "Ladies and gentlemen," the captain's voice, strained but steady, finally cut through the chaos, "we are experiencing some unexpected turbulence. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. We will be through this shortly."

Amelia swallowed, trying to ignore the frantic pounding in her chest. "Shortly," he said. "Right." She peeled herself off the galley wall, ignoring the spreading stain on her crisp blue uniform, and forced a smile. Time to earn her wings.

**Setting:**

The setting is the interior of a Boeing 777-300ER, specifically the main galley located near the center of the aircraft, somewhere between business class and the first few rows of economy. The flight, designated Flight AZ84 from Rome (FCO) to Los Angeles (LAX), is about seven hours into the twelve-hour journey, placing them somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean. The plane is relatively new, with modern, mood lighting and sleek, Italian-designed interiors. However, the current lighting has flickered to a harsh, fluorescent white due to the sudden turbulence.

The galley itself is a compact but efficient space, crammed with ovens, coffee makers, refrigerators stocked with drinks, and neatly organized trays of snacks and meals. It is typically a bustling hub of activity, but now is a scene of controlled chaos. Empty cups and spilled liquids litter the surfaces, and the usually immaculate space is a mess of jostled equipment and nervous energy. Outside the galley, through the small doorway, the sounds of distressed passengers and the rhythmic creaking of the plane are a constant, unsettling reminder of the precarious situation. The air is thick with a mix of anxiety, the lingering scent of coffee, and the subtle, sterile smell of aircraft disinfectant.
