## Story Opening:

The predawn air clung to the cobblestones of Rue de la Lune like a damp, woolly blanket. A lone streetlamp, flickering with a hesitant glow, cast long, dancing shadows that swallowed the few sleeping cats and the overflowing bins. Within the warm, amber heart of "Le Croissant Lunaire," however, the morning was already in full swing.

Flour dusted every surface, clinging to the rough-hewn wooden shelves laden with wicker baskets and even coating the spectacles perched precariously on the nose of **Genevieve Antoinette Dubois**. She hummed a tuneless melody, a habit she'd picked up from her grandmother, as she wrestled with a stubborn blob of croissant dough, coaxing it into submission with practiced hands. The yeasty scent, mingled with the sweet perfume of almond and vanilla, filled the small bakery, a comforting aroma that promised warmth and satisfaction to the sleepy patrons who would soon be shuffling through her door. Today, though, something felt… different. A restless energy buzzed beneath her skin, a prickling anticipation that had nothing to do with the usual rush of the morning trade.

## Setting:

**Le Croissant Lunaire** is a small, family-run bakery tucked away on the aforementioned Rue de la Lune in the charming, if slightly faded, Saint-Germain-des-Prés district of Paris. The building itself is centuries old, with exposed beams and slightly crooked floors that Genevieve lovingly calls "character." The exterior boasts a weathered, yet lovingly maintained, teal façade, adorned with a hand-painted sign featuring a crescent moon cradling a croissant.

Inside, the bakery is a symphony of textures and scents. Worn wooden counters display an array of freshly baked goods: pain au chocolat, delicate madeleines, crusty baguettes, and Genevieve's signature creation, the Lune Bleue - a blueberry-filled brioche shaped like a crescent moon. Antique copper pots hang from the ceiling, reflecting the warm glow of the overhead lamps, and a vintage chalkboard behind the counter showcases the daily specials in elegant cursive. A small seating area, consisting of a few mismatched tables and chairs, offers a cozy spot for customers to enjoy their treats and strong, black coffee. Despite its age and the ever-changing landscape of Paris, Le Croissant Lunaire has remained a constant, a comforting haven in a city that never truly sleeps.
