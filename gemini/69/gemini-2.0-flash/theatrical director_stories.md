**Story Opening:**

The air in the auditorium hung thick with anticipation, a cocktail of dust motes dancing in the single spotlight illuminating the center stage. Reginald Bartholomew Thorne, III, gripped his program a little tighter, the thin paper crinkling softly under the pressure. He could feel the sweat gathering at his temples, a familiar sensation that always accompanied the premiere of a new play. Not that he was nervous. Nervous was for amateurs. Reginald was a maestro, a conductor of emotions, a puppeteer of souls. He had poured his heart, soul, and a frankly obscene amount of the theatre's already depleted budget into this production of "The Tempest," and by God, it was going to be magnificent. He just needed them to see it. He needed them to *feel* it.

He straightened his impeccably tailored suit, a midnight blue velvet number he'd specifically chosen for the occasion. It was dramatic, yet understated. Just like him. He glanced at his reflection in the dimly lit glass of the prompter's box. Yes, perfect. He smoothed an imaginary wrinkle from his perfectly coiffed silver hair, and with a theatrical sigh, turned his attention back to the stage, where the expectant silence was starting to hum with an almost tangible energy.

**Setting:**

The setting is the "Grand Majestic Theatre," a grand but slightly dilapidated theatre in the heart of a once-thriving, now slightly-down-on-its-luck city called "Asteria." The theatre itself is a relic of a bygone era, with ornate gilded ceilings, faded velvet seats, and a labyrinthine backstage area filled with forgotten props, tattered costumes, and the lingering ghosts of theatrical triumphs and failures. The air always smells faintly of dust, old wood, and the slightly overwhelming fragrance of stage makeup. Despite its age and slightly worn appearance, the Grand Majestic still holds an undeniable charm, a sense of history and magic that clings to its walls and whispers through its corridors. Tonight, it is filled with a mixture of local theatre enthusiasts, socialites hoping to be seen, and the occasional skeptical critic sharpening their pen for what they suspect will be another mediocre production.
