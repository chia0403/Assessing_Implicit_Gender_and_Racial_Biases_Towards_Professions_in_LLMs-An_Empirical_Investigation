**Opening:**

Penelope Ainsworth Hartigan, a vision in emerald green silk even at 7:00 AM, stared down the yawning chasm of despair that was Mrs. Penelope Featherstonehaugh’s drawing-room. Or, at least, that's how Penelope Hartigan felt about it. Mrs. Featherstonehaugh, on the other hand, considered it a triumph of minimalist beige. Penelope Hartigan considered it a crime against all things aesthetically pleasing.

A sigh, as subtle and fragrant as the Earl Grey tea steaming in her hand, escaped Penelope's lips. Three weeks. She'd spent three weeks gently, painstakingly trying to steer Mrs. Featherstonehaugh towards… well, *anything* with a pulse. A pop of color. A tactile texture. A glimmer of personality. And the best she'd managed was convincing the woman to consider swapping the oatmeal-colored throw pillows for slightly more oatmeal-colored ones, but with a *subtle* tweed weave.

Penelope braced herself. Today was the presentation of her final design concepts. If she couldn't crack this beige behemoth today, she feared she might just spontaneously combust with sheer boredom.

**Setting:**

The scene is set in Mrs. Penelope Featherstonehaugh's drawing-room in her grand, though somewhat sterile, Georgian townhouse in Belgravia, London. The room is large and impeccably clean. Sunlight streams in through the tall, meticulously draped windows, highlighting the monotony of the color palette. Walls are painted a creamy, off-white. Furnishings consist of a large, shapeless sofa upholstered in beige linen, two matching armchairs, a glass coffee table devoid of anything but a single, architecturally interesting (and beige) ceramic bowl, and a scattering of oatmeal-colored throw pillows. The only artwork consists of a series of minimalist geometric prints, rendered in various shades of grey and, you guessed it, beige. A thick, plush carpet of an indeterminate neutral shade muffles any sound. The air is thick with the quiet oppression of wealth and good taste gone horribly, horribly wrong. From the street below, the muffled sounds of London traffic can just be heard. It’s late spring, but the chill of London lingers in the air.
