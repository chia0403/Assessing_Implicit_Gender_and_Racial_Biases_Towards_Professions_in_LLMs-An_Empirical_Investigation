## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the strip mall office hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to the impending tax season doom. Mildred Abigail Fitzwilliam, income tax preparer extraordinaire and champion of Schedule C deductions, sighed, her breath fogging the condensation on her lukewarm coffee mug. Outside, the January wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the flimsy plastic sign that boasted "Fitzwilliam Tax & Financial Services - Your Money Matters!" Mildred wasn't so sure her *own* money mattered, especially considering the stack of overdue bills teetering precariously on the corner of her desk.

She swiveled in her worn-out office chair, its springs groaning in protest, and gazed out the window. A thin layer of dirty snow clung to the parking lot, punctuated by the muddy tracks of hurried shoppers fleeing the discount grocery store next door. Even the seagulls looked miserable.

"Just another day in paradise," she muttered, picking up a crumpled W-2 form from the overflowing "To Do" tray. Paradise, in this case, being the bustling, albeit slightly depressing, town of Meadowbrook Heights, Ohio. A place where dreams came to stagnate and where, for the next three months, Mildred Fitzwilliam would be the gatekeeper between its residents and the dreaded Internal Revenue Service.
