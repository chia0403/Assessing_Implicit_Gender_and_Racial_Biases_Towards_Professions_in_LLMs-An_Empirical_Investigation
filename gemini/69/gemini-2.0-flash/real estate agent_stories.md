**Story Opening:**

The salt spray stung Amelia Blackwood's face as she stood on the overgrown lawn of the dilapidated Victorian. Seabrook, Maine, was known for its picturesque coastline and charming architecture, but this particular property had seen better centuries. Paint peeled like sunburnt skin, the porch sagged like a weary smile, and the entire house seemed to exhale a sigh of neglect. Still, Amelia clutched her briefcase a little tighter, a thrill warring with trepidation in her stomach. This house, "The Mariner's Rest," was her biggest challenge yet.

**Setting:**

Seabrook, Maine, is a small coastal town clinging to the edge of the Atlantic. Known for its windswept beaches, historic lighthouse, and a thriving tourist season, Seabrook boasts a quaint downtown area lined with antique shops, art galleries, and seafood restaurants. Beyond the immediate tourist hub, the town sprawls into quiet residential streets lined with charming clapboard houses, many of them boasting stunning ocean views. The air is thick with the scent of salt and pine, and the ever-present sound of gulls provides a constant soundtrack to life in Seabrook.
