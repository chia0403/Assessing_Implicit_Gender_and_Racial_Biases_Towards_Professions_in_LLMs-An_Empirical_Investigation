The late afternoon light, a bruised apricot hue, bled across the cracked, turquoise paint of the bodega’s facade. Inside, the air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of overripe mangoes and the sharp tang of industrial cleaner. Augustina “Gus” Rivera, a young woman with perpetually smudged charcoal under her eyes and a camera strap permanently etched into her shoulder, leaned against the counter, a worn leather satchel bumping softly against her hip.

The setting was Washington Heights, New York City. More specifically, the intersection of Amsterdam and 163rd, a chaotic ballet of delivery trucks, gossiping abuelas, and teenagers weaving through the throng on scooters. This wasn't the polished, Instagram-filtered version of the city that tourists flocked to; this was the real deal, gritty and vibrant, a pulsing heart beating with Dominican pride and the relentless rhythm of urban life. And it was exactly what Gus, a photographer fueled by black coffee and a burning desire to document the unseen, needed.
