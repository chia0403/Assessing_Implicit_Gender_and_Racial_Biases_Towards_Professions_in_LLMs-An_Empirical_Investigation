Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and main character, an emergency medical care provider:

**Setting:**

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, even at 3 AM. Spanish moss dripped like ghostly tears from the ancient oak trees lining River Road, casting elongated shadows that danced with the flashing lights of the ambulance. The smell of the bayou – a mix of decaying vegetation, salt water, and something indefinably wild – permeated everything. They were pulled up to a sprawling, two-story plantation house, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The porch lights were shattered, casting an eerie orange glow that barely penetrated the darkness.  Sirens wailed in the distance, drawing closer, a discordant symphony to the cacophony of crickets chirping in the overgrown gardens.

**Opening:**

The screen of her watch flashed 3:17 AM. Dr. Evelyn Grace Broussard cursed under her breath as she unbuckled herself from the ambulance. Sweat already beaded on her brow, plastering stray strands of her dark, curly hair to her forehead.  She grabbed her medical bag, the worn leather a comforting weight in her hands, and glanced at her partner, young Miguel, who looked green even in the flashing red and blue.

"Buckle up, Miguel," Evelyn said, her voice gravelly from lack of sleep. "Looks like we're about to have a *very* bad morning at Belle Reve."
