The biting wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth, stinging her cheeks a vibrant red as she wrestled with the clinic door. “Come on, you stubborn beast,” she muttered, shoving her shoulder against the aged oak. The hinges groaned in protest, finally giving way with a reluctant screech that echoed down the deserted main street.

The setting was Redemption, Montana, a town that clung to the edge of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness like a stubborn burr. Thanksgiving week had hit hard, leaving the town draped in a blanket of pre-holiday silence, punctuated only by the occasional rumble of a pickup truck barreling through, likely heading for some far-flung hunting ground.

Ellie’s practice, "Redemption Chiropractic," was housed in a building that had seen better days, a two-story structure built from rough-hewn timbers that spoke of the town's logging heyday. Inside, the scent of liniment and wintergreen battled with the musty odor of aged wood and dust motes dancing in the weak sunlight filtering through the frosted windows. While she'd tried to brighten the place with cheerful sunflowers and landscape prints of Montana's stunning vistas, a certain sense of weary history still permeated the air. Redemption Chiropractic, like the town itself, was a little worn, a little forgotten, but stubbornly enduring.
