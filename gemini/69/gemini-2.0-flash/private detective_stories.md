## Story Opening:

The stale cigarette smoke clung to the cracked leather of Reginald Hawthorne's armchair like a lovesick widow. He swirled the amber liquid in his glass, the ice clinking a mournful counterpoint to the incessant drip, drip, drip from the leaky faucet in the bathroom. Outside, the San Francisco foghorn groaned, a lonely sentinel in a city perpetually shrouded in grey. Reginald Hawthorne, private investigator, had seen brighter days. And fewer cases involving missing Persian cats.

He took a long swallow of bourbon, the fiery liquid doing little to thaw the chill that had settled deep in his bones, a chill that had nothing to do with the coastal weather. It was the chill of failure, the bitter taste of a job not done, a promise broken. He’d sworn he’d find Mr. Fluffernutter, the pampered Persian belonging to the eccentric millionaire, Bartholomew Butterfield. Now, after a week of dead-end leads and suspicious alley cats, Reginald was beginning to suspect Mr. Fluffernutter had taken the ultimate walkabout.

His phone, a rotary dial relic from a bygone era, buzzed on the cluttered desk beside him. He knew, before he even picked it up, who it would be. And he knew, with a sinking feeling, that it wasn't going to be good news. Bartholomew Butterfield was not a man known for his patience, especially when it came to his beloved feline companion.

## Setting:

**Reginald Hawthorne's office is located on the third floor of a dilapidated building on Geary Street in San Francisco.** The building itself is a crumbling Victorian, its once-grand façade now weathered and peeling. The interior is no better. The hallways are dimly lit, smelling faintly of mildew and despair.

Reginald's office is small and cramped, overflowing with the detritus of his profession. Stacks of files teeter precariously on every available surface. Yellowed newspapers with sensational headlines are scattered across the floor. A half-eaten pastrami on rye sits hardening on a greasy paper plate. The air is thick with the aroma of stale tobacco, cheap whiskey, and the lingering scent of forgotten dreams. The only source of light comes from a single desk lamp with a flickering bulb and the diffused glow filtering through the grimy window overlooking the fog-shrouded street below. It’s a place that perfectly reflects the current state of its occupant: worn down, slightly broken, but still stubbornly holding on.
