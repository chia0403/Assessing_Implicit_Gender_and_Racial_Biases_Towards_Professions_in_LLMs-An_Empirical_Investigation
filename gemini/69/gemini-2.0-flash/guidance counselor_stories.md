Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a guidance counselor:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Josephine Hayes's sensible, but undeniably scuffed, loafers echoed through the mostly deserted hallway of Northwood High. It was almost 6 PM, the kind of dusky, end-of-Tuesday gloom that seemed to settle deep into your bones. Amelia, usually fueled by a potent combination of instant coffee and unwavering optimism, felt the weight of the day dragging at her shoulders. Three college application essays needing edits, two emergency parent-teacher conferences, and a deeply disturbing conversation with young Timothy Higgins about his sudden, passionate obsession with taxidermied squirrels â€“ it had all taken its toll. She reached her office, Room 108, the door adorned with a faded poster of a soaring eagle under the motivational banner: "Your Future Starts Here!" Amelia sighed. Sometimes, looking at that poster, she felt more like a zookeeper than a futurist.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set within **Northwood High School**, a public school located in the fictional, semi-rural town of **Maple Creek, Connecticut.** The school itself is a sprawling, slightly outdated brick building, smelling faintly of floor wax and adolescent angst. It's a place of mismatched furniture, overflowing bulletin boards plastered with college brochures, and the constant hum of fluorescent lights. Specific locations within the school that will likely feature prominently:

*   **Room 108:** Amelia Hayes's guidance counselor office. It's a small, cluttered space filled with student artwork, stacks of brochures, a perpetually overflowing inbox, and a collection of quirky stress balls.
*   **The Main Hallway:** The central artery of the school, connecting classrooms, the cafeteria, and the administrative offices. A space filled with lockers, student artwork and event posters.
*   **The Cafeteria:** A large, echoing room that transforms from a boisterous hub of activity during lunch to a silent, slightly eerie space in the late afternoon.

Other potential locations might include:

*   **The Library:** A quiet, dimly lit sanctuary offering a reprieve from the bustling school environment.
*   **The Football Field/Track:** A space reflecting the town's spirit and community engagement.
*   **Local Businesses and Parks in Maple Creek:** To provide a sense of the town itself and its community.

I hope this is a good start for your story! Let me know if you'd like more details on any aspect.
