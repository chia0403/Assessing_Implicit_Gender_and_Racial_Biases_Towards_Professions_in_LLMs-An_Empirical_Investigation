The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of damp fur and something vaguely floral, probably emanating from the overgrown honeysuckle that snaked around the ramshackle administration building. Elara Meadowsweet, her dark braid plastered to the back of her sweat-soaked t-shirt, wiped a stray strand of hair from her forehead with the back of her hand. She squinted against the harsh glare of the midday sun beating down on the sun-baked clay of the enclosure.

The setting was the Forgotten Corners Wildlife Sanctuary, a sprawling, underfunded refuge tucked away in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. It wasn't a zoo, exactly, though it housed a menagerie of orphaned, injured, or otherwise displaced creatures, ranging from a grumpy three-legged raccoon named Bandit to a majestic but blind bald eagle called Athena. Elara had grown up practically inside the Sanctuary, her mother, Evelyn Meadowsweet, having dedicated her life to its upkeep. It was a wild, beautiful, and often frustrating place, full of as much heartache as it was wonder. And for Elara, it was home.
