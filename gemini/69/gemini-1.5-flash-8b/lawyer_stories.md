The biting wind whipped Amelia Charlotte Blackwood's crimson coat around her, stinging her cheeks with icy shards.  Grey, slate-coloured clouds hung low over the cobbled streets of Spitalfields, mirroring the gloom that had settled over her.  Rain, the relentless, insistent kind that hammered against the gutters and seeped into the crevices of the ancient buildings, mirrored the turmoil churning within her.  London, 1888, felt heavy, oppressive, not just with the damp, but with the weight of unspoken truths and simmering injustices. Amelia, a barrister of some renown, though still young in the eyes of the law – barely twenty-eight –  was no stranger to the shadows that danced in the corners of courtrooms, but this case…this case felt different.  It felt…personal.  Her client, a young seamstress named Eliza, accused of theft from a wealthy merchant, seemed more victim than culprit.  And Amelia, despite the mounting pressure and the growing hostility from the prosecution, felt an inexplicable pull towards the woman trapped in the web of deceit.  The scent of coal smoke and damp wool clung to the air, a familiar perfume of London's underbelly, a scent that whispered stories of secrets and whispered lies, and Amelia felt certain that this case held a truth buried deep beneath the surface, a truth she was determined to uncover.
