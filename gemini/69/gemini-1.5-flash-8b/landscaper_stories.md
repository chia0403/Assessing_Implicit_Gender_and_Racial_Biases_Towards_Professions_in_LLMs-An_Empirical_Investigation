The biting wind whipped Amelia Juniper's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket, the scent of pine needles and damp earth clinging to the crisp October air.  The overgrown rhododendron bushes, normally a riot of vibrant pink, were now skeletal silhouettes against the bruised twilight sky.  Amelia, a landscaper with hands calloused from years of wielding shears and spades, surveyed the neglected estate sprawled before her.  Greystone walls, crumbling in places, mirrored the oppressive mood settling over the sprawling gardens.  A single, flickering porch light cast long, dancing shadows across the overgrown lawn, highlighting the stark contrast between the neglected beauty and the potential for rebirth she, Amelia Juniper, was charged with unleashing.

**Setting:** A grand, but neglected, estate in the English countryside, late October. The landscape is a mix of overgrown gardens, decaying stone walls, and skeletal trees against a moody twilight sky.  A single porch light illuminates the immediate area, casting dramatic shadows.  The air is crisp and biting.
