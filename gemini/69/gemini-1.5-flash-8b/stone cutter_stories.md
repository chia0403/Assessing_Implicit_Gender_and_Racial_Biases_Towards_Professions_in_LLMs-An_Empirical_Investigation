The chill of the early morning seeped into Elara Stonehand's bones, a familiar companion as she stepped out onto the cobbled courtyard of the Sunstone Quarry.  Dust motes danced in the pale, filtered sunlight, illuminating the glistening, grey-veined stone that was the very essence of this place.  Elara, a woman whose hands, roughened and calloused from years of relentless work, were nonetheless surprisingly delicate when handling the fine tools, adjusted the leather strap of her apron.  The quarry, nestled high in the Aethelgard Mountains, was a place of both brutal beauty and quiet solitude, a world carved from the earth itself.  Her breath fogged in the frigid air, a tiny cloud against the vast, sculpted backdrop of the mountain range.  Today, the task before her was the most daunting yet.  A magnificent obelisk, commissioned by the High Priestess of Aerilon, was to be carved from a single, impossibly dense piece of obsidian, a black monolith radiating an unsettling energy.
