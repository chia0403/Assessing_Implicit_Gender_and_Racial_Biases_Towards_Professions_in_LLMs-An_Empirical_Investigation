The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Nightingale's face, highlighting the faint lines etched around her eyes – lines carved by late nights, whispered secrets, and the endless stream of stories poured into her, and, occasionally, out of her.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the grime-coated window of the dimly lit pub, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink where Amelia meticulously cleaned a glass, each movement precise, practiced.  The scent of stale beer, old wood, and simmering spices hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting fog in the heart of the forgotten alleyway where The Rusty Mug resided.

The year was 1943.  London was a city shrouded in wartime shadows, its vibrant heart muffled by the roar of distant explosions and the hushed anxieties of a nation on the brink.  The Rusty Mug, tucked away on a side street off Drury Lane, was a haven, a sanctuary of sorts, a refuge from the relentless grey of the outside world.  It was a place where whispers of wartime rumours mingled with the clinking of glasses and the hushed laughter of regulars. Tonight, however, the usual murmur of conversation was muted, overshadowed by an almost palpable tension.  Amelia, despite her calm exterior, felt it too – a chill in the air, a sense that something momentous was about to happen.
