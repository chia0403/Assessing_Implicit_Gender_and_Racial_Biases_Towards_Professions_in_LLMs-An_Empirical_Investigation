The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, sickly yellow from years of unloved scrubbing, reflected Dr. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's tired face.  The fluorescent lights of the small, cluttered dentist's office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her instruments.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window, illuminating a single, wilted sunflower in a chipped ceramic vase on the reception desk.  Outside, the relentless clamor of the city – car horns, distant sirens, and the ever-present rumble of construction – assaulted her ears, a constant reminder of the world beyond the sterile, antiseptic walls of her practice.  Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and a tangle of dark brown hair pulled back from her face in a loose bun, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another barrage of cavities and chipped molars, of anxious whispers and the metallic tang of fear.  The phone, a relic of an earlier era, vibrated impatiently on the cluttered counter.  It was probably just another insurance company, another tedious bureaucratic hurdle in the endless quest to keep her small practice afloat.
