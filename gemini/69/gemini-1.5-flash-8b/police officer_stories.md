The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees lining Elmwood Avenue, rattling the chipped paint of the Victorian houses clinging to the hillside.  A lone figure, Detective Sergeant Elias Thorne, hunched deeper into his trench coat, his breath fogging in the frigid air.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, plastered his dark hair to his forehead.  The faint, metallic tang of blood hung heavy in the still, pre-dawn air, a grim counterpoint to the mournful hooting of an owl.  Elmwood, a once-proud neighborhood, now felt like a forgotten graveyard, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Thorne's boots on the wet pavement.  He was on the hunt for answers, for a clue buried somewhere in the silent streets, and a sense of dread settled into his gut, a familiar companion on nights like these. The case of the "Elmwood Enigma," as the local papers had dubbed it, was more than just a missing person.  It was about a city grappling with its own darkness, and Thorne felt he was the only one who could stop the creeping shadow from swallowing it whole.
