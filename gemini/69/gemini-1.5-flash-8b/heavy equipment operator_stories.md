The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Badlands, stinging Amelia "Milly" Petrova's cheeks.  Dust, a fine, ochre powder, swirled around her, coating everything in a hazy, sun-drenched ochre.  The vast emptiness stretched out before her, a sea of eroded hills and cracked earth, broken only by the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned mine and the monstrous, iron behemoth that was Milly's life: a Caterpillar 990H, gleaming faintly in the fading light.  She adjusted her heavy gloves, the leather stiffening with the cold, and wrestled with the cumbersome controls of the massive machine.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine was the only sound other than the relentless howl of the wind.  Milly, a heavy equipment operator for the Northern Plains Reclamation Company, was alone, miles from civilization, but not entirely alone.  The earth, the old mine, the machineâ€”they all seemed to hold a history of their own, a shared silence that spoke volumes of the struggles of the land and its past inhabitants.
