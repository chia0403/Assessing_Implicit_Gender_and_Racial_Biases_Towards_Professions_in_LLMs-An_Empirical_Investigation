Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of "Numbers & Nuggets," a tiny accounting firm tucked away on a side street in the heart of the perpetually overcast city of Greyhaven.

Today, the puzzle pieces seemed particularly resistant to forming a coherent whole.

Towering, skeletal factory buildings, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the perpetually grey sky, lined the avenues.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless symphony of the city's discontent. The air itself felt heavy, thick with the smell of damp concrete and exhaust fumes.  Amelia, with her crisp, dark suit and perfectly styled, but unnaturally pale, hair, felt like an outsider, a fragile bloom in a concrete jungle.
