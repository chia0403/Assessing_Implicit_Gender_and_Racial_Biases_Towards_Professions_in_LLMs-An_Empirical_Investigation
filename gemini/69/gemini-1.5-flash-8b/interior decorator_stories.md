The scent of aged oak and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that belied the tremor in Amelia Nightingale’s hands.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the vast, empty drawing room.  A room Amelia, with her precise, almost surgically sharp eye for detail, had been meticulously, agonizingly, preparing for the past three months.  This was it.  The culmination of countless late nights poring over swatches, the whisper-quiet negotiations with antique dealers, the endless consultations with the notoriously demanding Lord Ashworth.  The house, once a symphony of faded grandeur, was now a blank canvas, a testament to the power – and the pressure – of her craft.

Amelia Nightingale, interior decorator extraordinaire, felt the weight of expectation crush her.  Lord Ashworth, a man sculpted from granite and encased in a patrician indifference, had entrusted her with the restoration of his ancestral estate, Ashworth Manor, a brooding gothic pile perched atop a windswept heath in the Yorkshire Dales.  The manor, steeped in history and haunted by whispers of past tragedies, seemed to breathe a palpable melancholy, a stark contrast to Amelia’s energetic, almost frenetic, approach to design.  The vastness of the space, the echoing silence, and the oppressive sense of history threatened to swallow her whole.
