The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, muddy grey from years of lukewarm water and spilled fabric scraps, glistened under the single, flickering gaslight.  Elias Thorne, a tailor of impeccable reputation in the shadowed alleys of Old Southwark, leaned over it, his wrinkled hands meticulously brushing a threadbare crimson velvet.  The scent of lavender and beeswax, a comforting balm against the pervasive stench of the Thames, filled the cramped workshop.  He sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic thump of his heart.  Elias was fifty years his prime, and the steady decline of his craft, the fading vibrancy of the city, were weighing heavily on him.  Tonight, however, a new challenge, a new commission, lay before him: a commission that might, just might, ignite the dying embers of his passion.

The setting:  A cramped, dimly lit tailor shop nestled amongst the shadowed alleys and towering warehouses of Old Southwark, London, 1888.  The air hung thick with the smells of brine, coal smoke, and the rich, earthy scent of the river Thames.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the city into a muted watercolor.  The muffled cries of street vendors and the distant rumble of carriages served as a constant soundtrack to Elias's world.
