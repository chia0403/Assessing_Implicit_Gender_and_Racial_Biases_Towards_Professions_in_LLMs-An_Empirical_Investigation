The biting wind whipped across the frozen expanse of the boreal forest, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and biting into the thick wool of his parka.  Sunlight, a pale ghost in the leaden sky, barely pierced the dense canopy of evergreens.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of blood, a scent Elias knew all too well.  He wasn't a hunter, not in the traditional sense.  Elias Thorne, logger extraordinaire, was a scavenger, a whisperer of the forest, and today, the forest was whispering secrets he desperately hoped to ignore.

Setting:

The remote, windswept wilderness of the northern Yukon, Canada, late winter.  The forest, a labyrinth of towering pines, ancient spruces, and tangled undergrowth, was a place of both breathtaking beauty and brutal unforgivingness.  The frozen rivers snaked through the landscape like silver ribbons, and the snow, thick and heavy, muffled all sound but the wind's howl.  Elias's small, battered cabin, nestled deep within the woods, was a haven of warmth and meager comfort against the encroaching cold, a testament to his tenacity and hard-won independence.   The pervasive, silent dread of the untouched wilderness pressed in on Elias, a pressure he'd learned to live with but never quite forget.
