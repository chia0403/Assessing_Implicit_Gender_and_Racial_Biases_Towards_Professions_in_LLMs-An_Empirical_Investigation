Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned factory, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayes's heart.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and decaying wood, hung heavy in the oppressive silence.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a scene that would haunt her nightmares long after the last of the rain subsided.  Forensic Psychologist Amelia Hayes, a woman whose sharp gaze had seen the darkest corners of the human psyche, found herself utterly unprepared for the macabre spectacle unfolding before her.

The setting:  An old, derelict factory complex nestled on the edge of Blackwood, a town clinging precariously to the outskirts of the city.  Its rusted machinery and boarded-up windows whispered tales of forgotten industries and even more forgotten lives.  The surrounding woods, choked with undergrowth and twisting trees, seemed to suffocate the already claustrophobic atmosphere.  Amelia, her trench coat damp and clinging, adjusted the flashlight beam, illuminating the skeletal remains of a once-vibrant workspace.  Cadavers – or rather, what remained of them – were positioned in stark, unnatural arrangements around a scarred, metallic table, each a frozen tableau of a life tragically cut short.  The air, thick with the lingering scent of pine disinfectant and something far more sinister – something that made her stomach churn – was thick with the unspoken story that these victims desperately sought to reveal.
