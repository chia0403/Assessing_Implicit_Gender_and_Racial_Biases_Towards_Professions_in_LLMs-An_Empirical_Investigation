The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s crimson coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and something acrid, almost metallic, hung heavy in the valley.  Below, nestled amongst the skeletal branches of ancient redwoods, lay the Blackwood Veterinary Clinic, a small, weathered building clinging precariously to the mountainside like a barnacle on a ship's hull.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Blackwood, shivered, not just from the cold but from a growing sense of unease.  It was the third day of the strange, unrelenting fog, a phenomenon that had plagued the valley for a week, obscuring the normally vibrant hues of autumn with a pallid, suffocating grey.  Strange, almost unnatural sounds echoed through the valleys, something neither the coyotes nor the barred owls could account for. And the animals... they were acting strangely.  Even the normally placid deer seemed restless, their eyes wide with a fear she couldn't quite place. This was more than just a weather anomaly.  This was a mystery, and Amelia felt a prickle of dread, a sense that something terrible was brewing, just beyond the veil of fog.
