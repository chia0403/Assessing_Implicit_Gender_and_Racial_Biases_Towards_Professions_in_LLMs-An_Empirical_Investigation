The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the bustling streets of Old Havana.  Dust motes danced in the golden afternoon sun, illuminating the faded pastel hues of the colonial buildings that crowded the narrow Calle Obispo.  Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez, physician's assistant at the Clinica San Juan, squinted against the glare, the scent of roasted coffee beans and sea salt mingling with the ubiquitous aroma of diesel fumes.  Her worn leather satchel, overflowing with medical supplies and patient files, felt heavy against her shoulder.  A persistent rhythmic thumping echoed from within the building, a relentless heartbeat in the otherwise quiet street.  Today, it was a relentless pounding in Izzyâ€™s chest, too. The case was urgent. A young woman, Elena Diaz,  a renowned seamstress, was exhibiting symptoms unlike anything Izzy had encountered.  The clinic's courtyard, usually alive with the chatter of patients and the rhythmic clinking of instruments, was strangely silent, a stark contrast to the frenetic energy of the city outside.  The thumping, which had begun subtly, had intensified, a throbbing crescendo against the backdrop of the city's simmering pulse.  Izzy had a feeling this visit would be far from routine.
