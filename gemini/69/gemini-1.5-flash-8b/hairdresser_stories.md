The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, murky green from years of spilled chamomile tea and the inevitable bleach splashes, reflected Amelia Nightingale's tired face.  Her fingers, stained a similar, though slightly brighter, shade of orange from the latest batch of vibrant crimson highlights, traced the contour of a chipped mug.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of the tram, a constant, insistent metronome in the city's heart, echoed through the tiny salon, "The Whispering Scissors."  The scent of freshly cut hair, lavender conditioner, and something faintly metallic – old fashioned hairspray, perhaps – clung to the air, a familiar, comforting fog. Amelia,  thirty-two years old,  owned and operated the salon, a small, but beloved haven tucked away on a cobbled side street in the bustling, gothic heart of Prague.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, highlighting the intricate, swirling patterns on the chipped wallpaper.  A half-finished braid lay haphazardly on a nearby stool, a silent testament to the day's demands.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's fingers against the sink continued, a counterpoint to the city's relentless hum.
