Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the third-floor law office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy"  Carter's thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and legal documents, hung heavy in the room, reflecting the oppressive weight of the case.  Amy, a paralegal with a sharp mind and even sharper fingernails, hunched over a mountain of paperwork, her gaze flitting from the legal briefs to the perpetually blinking fluorescent lights.  This wasn't your typical Tuesday.  This was the day the infamous "Willow Creek Water Works" case took a pivotal turn.  The building, a decaying monument to forgotten grandeur, stood as a silent observer to the relentless legal battle unfolding within.  The city, a labyrinth of grey concrete and perpetually damp cobblestones, seemed to mirror the bleak atmosphere in the sterile office.
