Today, a new project, a residential tower planned for the heart of the Aether district, was her primary focus.  Her pencils, each a familiar extension of her hand, danced across the pristine drawing board, translating her sketches into reality. The air in the drafting room hung heavy, a mix of anticipation and the faint, metallic scent of fresh metal.
