The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled streets of  Oldport, painting the bakery, "The Golden Crust," in a warm, inviting glow.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the corrugated tin roof, a constant, drumming counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the old-fashioned bread machine.  Inside, nestled amidst the fragrant aroma of freshly baked sourdough and cinnamon rolls, stood Elara Nightingale, a baker with hands as nimble and warm as the hearth itself.  Her brow, usually smooth and serene, was furrowed in concentration as she carefully sculpted a complex, intricate swirl of marzipan onto a towering  custard tart.  Tonight, a chill deeper than the rain seemed to permeate the air, a feeling that went beyond the dampness of the season. This was no ordinary Tuesday night.
