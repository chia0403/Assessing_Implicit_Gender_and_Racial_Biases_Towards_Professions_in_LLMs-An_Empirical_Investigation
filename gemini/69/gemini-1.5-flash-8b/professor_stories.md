Professor Eleanor Vance, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the fine, grey particles of forgotten theorems and unproven hypotheses, stared out the rain-streaked window of her cramped Bloomsbury flat.  The rhythmic drumming of the downpour against the single, ancient pane mirrored the relentless drumbeat of her thoughts.  Rain lashed against the cobblestones of the narrow street below, a symphony of muted greys and muted anxieties.  The year was 1937, and a chill wind, sharp and biting, whispered through the gaps in the aged brickwork of the surrounding houses.  Dust motes, caught in the wavering light filtering through the gloom, danced in a silent waltz around the room.  Her study, crammed with overflowing bookshelves, a half-finished manuscript propped precariously on a worn oak desk, and a multitude of objects – antique maps, chipped porcelain figurines, a faded sepia photograph –  seemed to hum with the ghosts of past discoveries and unanswered questions.  Eleanor, her mind wrestling with the enigmatic fragments of a forgotten alchemical text, felt a disquieting sense of unease, a premonition of something approaching.
