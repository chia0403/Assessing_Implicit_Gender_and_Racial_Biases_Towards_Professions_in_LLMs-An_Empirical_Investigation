The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Specialists" office hummed, a constant, irritating drone that seemed to amplify the rhythmic tapping of Amelia Hamilton's fingers on the keyboard.  Filing season was in full swing, a blizzard of tax forms, W-2s, and spreadsheets swirling around her like snowflakes in a frantic dance.

The stale coffee aroma, a familiar fixture of the office, was only slightly more comforting than the looming deadline hanging over her like a guillotine.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune against the grimy brick facade of the building, echoing the frustrated sighs Amelia occasionally let slip from her lips.  Her office, cubicle 17, was a miniature microcosm of the chaos, crammed with overflowing file folders, half-eaten takeout containers, and the ghosts of past tax nightmares.  Ameliaâ€™s name, prominently printed on her name tag, was the only tangible sign of her presence.
