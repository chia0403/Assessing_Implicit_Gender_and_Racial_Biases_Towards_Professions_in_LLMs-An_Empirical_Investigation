The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Tally Ho" accounting firm hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Nightingaleâ€™s meticulously ordered life.  Stacks of invoices, meticulously categorized and alphabetized by client, towered over her desk, a silent testament to the quiet precision that was her calling.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the metallic tang of photocopying, was punctuated only by the rhythmic *click* of her keyboard and the occasional exasperated sigh escaping her lips.  Elara, a bookkeeper with an almost unnerving dedication to spreadsheets and balance sheets, was drowning in a sea of numbers.  The year was 1987.  The meticulously organized, almost sterile, office space, complete with beige walls and matching furniture, reflected the structured nature of her life. A single, unassuming window overlooking a bustling, urban intersection offered a fleeting glimpse of chaos, a stark contrast to the controlled environment she inhabited within the four walls of Tally Ho.
