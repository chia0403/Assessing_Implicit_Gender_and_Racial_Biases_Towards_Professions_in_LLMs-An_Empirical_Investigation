The scent of sandalwood and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Razor's Edge," a barber shop nestled on the cobbled street of Old Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the narrow, arched windows, mimicking the tempest brewing within Elias Thorne, a young barber with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands that moved with the precision of a seasoned craftsman.  Elias, whose name echoed the sharp edge of his shears, hunched over the mahogany basin, meticulously trimming the unruly beard of a burly merchant, Mr. Grimshaw.  The rhythmic snips of the clippers, punctuated by the occasional groan from Mr. Grimshaw, were the only sounds breaking the oppressive silence, save for the insistent drumming of the rain against the roof.

Old Oakhaven, a city choked by whispers of discontent and shadowed by the looming presence of the Grand Fortress, was a place of contrasts.  Wealth flowed freely through the fortress's opulent gates, yet poverty clung to the narrow alleys and winding streets like a shroud.  The constant rain, a near-constant companion, seemed to mirror the city's ever-present melancholy.  The aroma of woodsmoke and damp earth hung thick in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of the sea that kissed the city walls.  A shiver ran down Elias's spine, not just from the cold, but from the unease that had been settling in his gut for weeks, a foreboding he couldn't quite place.
