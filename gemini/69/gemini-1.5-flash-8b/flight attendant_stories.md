The salt spray stung Amelia "Em"  Charleston's face as the small, propeller-driven plane bucked violently, threatening to throw her against the corrugated metal of the tiny, windowless cargo hold.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Andes, sharp against the bruised twilight sky, seemed to lean in to devour the plane.  Em squeezed her eyes shut, bracing herself against the inevitable lurch. This was the Cordillera, after all.  A place of unforgiving beauty and whispered dangers.  This particular flight, a fragile lifeline for a remote village nestled in the Andean valley, was, as always, a gamble.  

Her current assignment, a lifeline for the people of the remote village of Laguna Azul, was not the typical trans-continental luxury fare her training had prepared her for.  Em worked for a small, almost-uncharted, airline, connecting remote communities across the South American continent. The planes were rickety, the routes perilous, the passengers, often, more than a little eccentric.  The cargo hold held not electronics or clothing, but precious medicine, desperately needed seedlings, and the occasional small shipment of community-grown llama wool. But above all else, the air of the mountains was filled with the constant, almost tangible hum of expectation.

This time, the hum was charged with something more.  Whispers of a rare bloom, a legendary flower said to hold the secret to healing the land, circulated among the villagers. A bloom that only bloomed under a particular alignment of stars.  This flight was the only way it could be delivered.  Em had to get it there, and get it there safely. And somehow, she knew, the destiny of the bloom rested, at least in part, in her hands.
