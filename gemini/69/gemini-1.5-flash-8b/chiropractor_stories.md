The rhythmic *click-clack* of Dr. Amelia Hayesâ€™s heels echoed through the nearly empty hallway of her practice, a stark contrast to the usual symphony of groans and sighs that filled the space.  The midday sun streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, casting long shadows that stretched and warped the sterile white walls.  Amelia, with her neatly pulled-back auburn hair and the faint scent of lavender emanating from her crisp white scrubs, felt an unusual stillness in the air.  It wasn't the quiet before a busy afternoon; this was a preternatural hush, a silence that felt heavy, pregnant with something unseen.  Her practice, "The Aligned Spine," nestled in a quiet, leafy suburb of Austin, Texas, was usually bustling with patients seeking relief from back pain, neck stiffness, or the myriad aches and pains of modern life. Today, however, not a single appointment had been scheduled.
