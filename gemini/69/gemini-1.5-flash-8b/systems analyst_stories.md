The fluorescent hum of the server room, a relentless drone punctuated only by the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Petrovaâ€™s keyboard, was the soundtrack to her life.  Rows upon rows of gleaming metal cabinets, blinking lights like a constellation of restless fireflies, housed the digital heart of GlobalCom's sprawling network. Amelia, a systems analyst with a penchant for meticulously organized spreadsheets and the unwavering logic of a well-oiled machine, felt a familiar prickle of unease.

The setting was the cavernous, air-conditioned server farm beneath the sprawling GlobalCom headquarters in Silicon Valley.  Dust motes danced in the beam of her desk lamp, illuminating a tangle of cables and wires, a miniature jungle of interconnected systems.  The precise temperature, the sterile white walls, and the almost palpable hum of the machinery all contributed to a feeling of isolation.  She had been working late, as usual, battling a persistent error code that stubbornly refused to yield to her analysis.  Her neatly-organized notes, meticulously annotated, filled a half-dozen digital documents, yet the code remained elusive, a phantom in the machine's vast digital wilderness.  Tonight, the usual rhythm of the server farm seemed...off.  A faint, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the system,  a shudder that echoed in the hollow space.  And Amelia felt it too, a deep, gut-wrenching sense of foreboding.
