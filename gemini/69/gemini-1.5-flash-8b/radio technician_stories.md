The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio telescope hummed, casting long, distorted shadows across the cracked concrete floor.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, mimicking the frantic, almost frantic, movements of Elias Thorne, a Radio Technician extraordinaire, though that was more a whisper of his past than a current reality.  Elias Thorne,  32, his once-bright eyes now shadowed with a weariness that etched itself into the very lines of his face, meticulously checked the archaic wiring of the telescope's antiquated control panel.  The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and something vaguely metallic, a constant reminder of the strange, almost spectral energy that pulsed through the colossal antenna. This wasn't the cutting-edge facility of his youth; this was the desolate relic of a forgotten era, the "Silent Sentinel," a sprawling, almost gothic structure perched atop a windswept plateau, miles from the nearest town.  It was here, in the eerie silence broken only by the whirring of aging machinery and the whisper of the wind across the desolate plains, that Elias wrestled with the ghost of a signal and the secrets buried within the stars.
