The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's threadbare jacket around her legs as she surveyed the overgrown expanse of Oakhaven Manor.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling the fallen autumn leaves into miniature tornadoes.  Twisted branches, skeletal against the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the fading light.  A single, skeletal oak, its gnarled roots exposed like ancient, skeletal fingers, dominated the vista.  This was Amelia's domain, the neglected landscape mirroring the neglected state of her own life.

Oakhaven Manor, once a stately residence, now stood as a monument to forgotten grandeur.  Rain-streaked windows stared blankly out at the encroaching wilderness, their once-bright frames now dull with age and neglect.  Ivy, a tenacious green serpent, had devoured the stonework, its tendrils reaching out like grasping hands.  Amelia, a groundskeeper for the manor for the past ten years, was used to the decaying elegance, to the mournful whispers of the wind through the empty halls.  Yet, tonight, a tremor of something… else… ran through the air, a premonition that stirred something deep within her bones. The decaying grandeur felt... different tonight.
