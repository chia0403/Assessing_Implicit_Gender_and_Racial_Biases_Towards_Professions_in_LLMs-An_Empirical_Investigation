The fluorescent lights of the brokerage roared, a relentless white symphony that seemed to vibrate through Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's very bones.  He hunched over his terminal, the rhythmic click-clack of the keyboard a counterpoint to the low, insistent hum of the trading floor.  Outside, the city of Neo-Veridian thrummed with the energy of a colossal machine; within, the pressure cooker of high-stakes finance exerted a constant, suffocating pressure.  Barty, a stockbroker with a prematurely greying mop of hair and eyes that darted around the screen like startled birds, felt the weight of it all.

The setting:  The opulent, yet somehow sterile, trading floor of "Apex Securities" on the 77th floor of the Neo-Veridian Spire.  Towering glass walls offered panoramic views of the sprawling metropolis, a kaleidoscope of lights and chrome.  Yet, the air within the trading pit was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of impending disaster.  Today, the Dow was teetering on the edge of a precipice, and Barty felt the tremor in his own gut.  He knew the slightest misstep could send him tumbling into the abyss.  His name was etched into the floorplan, not as a title or prestige, but as a small, almost invisible footnote amongst a multitude of flashing ticker symbols.
