The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Stubborn Pipe Solutions" storefront cast long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked street.  It was a Tuesday evening, the kind that smelled of damp earth and impending winter.  A chill wind, carrying the scent of pine needles and something faintly metallic, whipped through the alleyways, rattling the awnings of the surrounding buildings.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, master plumber and, according to his perpetually grumbling, but surprisingly loyal, assistant,  "the only man who could coax a stubborn drain to sing."

Barty, a man built like a sturdy oak – broad shoulders, hands calloused to the point of poetry – stared at the overflowing sink.  The water, a murky brown, had crested the porcelain rim, threatening to engulf the already waterlogged basement beneath the Victorian home.  Inside, a frantic woman’s voice, Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a renowned opera singer, echoed through the pipes, a soprano lament in the midst of the rising tide.  Barty knew, with an unnerving certainty, that this wasn't just a clogged drain. This was a symphony of plumbing terror, and he was the conductor.
