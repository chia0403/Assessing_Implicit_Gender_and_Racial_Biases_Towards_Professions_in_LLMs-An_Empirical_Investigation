The biting wind whipped at the eaves of the dilapidated clinic, rattling the chipped paint and sending a flurry of snow swirling around Dr. Eleanor Vance's ankles.  The frosted windows of the tiny building, perched precariously on the edge of the Whispering Woods, offered little warmth, reflecting only the pale, bruised sky.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long, dancing shadows across the sterile, but sparsely furnished, waiting room.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and pine needles, a peculiar blend that had become a familiar comfort – or perhaps just a dull ache – to Eleanor.

Winter had always held a strange grip on the village of Oakhaven, a grip that mirrored the isolation that clung to Dr. Vance.  The woods, shrouded in their spectral white embrace, seemed to whisper secrets only the wind could carry.  Oakhaven itself, nestled amongst the towering pines and frozen streams, felt ancient, almost forgotten.  Few ventured out in this season, preferring the safety of their hearth fires and the predictable rhythm of their lives.  But Eleanor, despite the chilling loneliness, had a duty to keep the flickering flame of her clinic alive.
