Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated vocational school, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and sawdust, hung heavy in the cramped wood shop, a stark contrast to the vibrant, sun-drenched classrooms she usually inhabited.  Amy, a history teacher at the perpetually struggling Northwood High, found herself in this unusual location, not for a scheduled lesson, but to help a student repair a broken piece of machinery.  This was not part of her curriculum.  This was a desperate measure.  

The setting was the dilapidated vocational department of Northwood High School, a crumbling edifice clinging to the edge of the city.  Its once-proud metalwork now bore the scars of neglect and age, the very air carrying the ghosts of countless projects and dreams left unfinished.  Inside, the worn-out tools, stacked haphazardly, seemed to whisper tales of bygone generations of students, their ambitions now lost to the indifference of time.  A single flickering fluorescent bulb cast long, distorted shadows across the workshop floor, illuminating the tangled mess of metal scraps and the determined figure of 16-year-old Leo Hernandez hunched over a broken lathe.  The rhythmic, metallic clang of the falling rain was the only other sound other than Leo's frustrated sighs.
