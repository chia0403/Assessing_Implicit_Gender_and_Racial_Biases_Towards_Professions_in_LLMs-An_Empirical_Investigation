The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel girders of the abandoned factory, stinging Amelia Petrova's cheeks.  Dust, stirred up by the relentless gale, swirled in a gritty haze, obscuring the skeletal remains of machinery and the looming silhouette of the rusted smokestack.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and something acrid, something metallic, hung heavy, a constant reminder of the factory’s tragic history.  Amelia, a seasoned firefighter with the Granite City Department, adjusted her heavy turnout gear, the familiar weight a comforting ballast in this desolate landscape.  This was no routine call.  This was a forgotten place, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the old-timers, a place where rumours of something more than just an abandoned building danced on the periphery of the city’s collective consciousness.
