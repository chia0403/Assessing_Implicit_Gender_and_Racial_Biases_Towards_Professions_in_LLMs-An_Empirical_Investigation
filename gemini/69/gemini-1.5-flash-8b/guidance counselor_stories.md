Eleanor, a woman perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown, sighed, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic click-clack of the aging computer keyboard.  It was another day wrestling with the complexities of adolescence in the shadow of a rapidly changing world.  Her office, nestled deep within the cavernous halls of Northwood High, was a quiet battlefield, where the future of her students hung precariously in the balance.
