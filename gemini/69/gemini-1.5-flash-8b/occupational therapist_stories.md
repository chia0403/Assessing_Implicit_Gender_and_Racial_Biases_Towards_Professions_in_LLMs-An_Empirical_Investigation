Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the hospice, a relentless drumming that mirrored the steady, rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood’s heart.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and decaying leaves, hung heavy in the small, sun-drenched room.  Sunlight, fractured and muted by the storm, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the chipped paint on the walls and the worn, floral wallpaper.  Amelia, an occupational therapist at St. Jude’s Hospice, adjusted the frayed edges of a faded patchwork quilt, tracing the intricate patterns with a finger stained with the lingering scent of lavender hand cream.  Across the small, wooden table, sat Edgar Finch, a frail man with eyes that held the weight of a lifetime.  He stared at the quilt, his breath shallow, his hands trembling slightly as he reached out to touch a faded blue flower.


Setting: St. Jude's Hospice, a small, privately funded facility nestled in a quiet suburb on the outskirts of a bustling city.  The hospice is more reminiscent of a cozy, old Victorian home than a modern healthcare facility, with its quaint architecture, overgrown gardens, and a sense of quiet dignity in the air.  The particular room where Amelia works is a calming space, designed for quiet therapy sessions.
