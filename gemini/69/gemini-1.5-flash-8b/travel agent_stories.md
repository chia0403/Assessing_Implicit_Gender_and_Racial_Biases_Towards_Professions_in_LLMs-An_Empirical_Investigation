Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Peabody’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The scent of damp earth and ozone hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual floral perfume and subtle citrus of the brightly lit travel agency, “Wanderlust Voyages.”  Amelia, a travel agent with a passion for far-flung destinations and a meticulously organized mind, stared at the swirling grey outside.  A single, defiant hibiscus flower pressed against the windowpane, its vibrant crimson a defiant splash of colour against the relentless gloom.  Outside, the city of  Evergreen, nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the deluge to subside.

Amelia, a petite woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a perpetually tangled braid of raven hair, traced the itinerary for the upcoming "Himalayan Highlands Adventure" with a frustrated sigh.  The itinerary, meticulously typed, triple-checked, and meticulously presented, was now, inexplicably, a tangled web of logistical nightmares.  Phone calls had gone unanswered, flights had been cancelled, and the hotel in Kathmandu, their supposed base camp for the intrepid climbers, was now incommunicado.  Her client, renowned mountaineer and Everest veteran,  Professor Alistair Finch, was due to depart for his expedition tomorrow.  And Amelia, who prided herself on seamless travel arrangements, felt utterly, hopelessly lost.
