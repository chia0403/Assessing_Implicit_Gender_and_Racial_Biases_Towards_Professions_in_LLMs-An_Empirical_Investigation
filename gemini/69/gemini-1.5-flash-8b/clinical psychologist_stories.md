The fluorescent hum of the waiting room was a constant, low thrum against Dr. Eleanor Vance's frayed nerves.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of the Northwood Community Clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Another Tuesday.  Another avalanche of anxiety, depression, and the quiet desperation of ordinary lives, all colliding in this cramped, beige-walled space.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with a practiced calmness that often masked the underlying turmoil, adjusted her glasses, tracing the condensation patterns on the frosted glass.  Today's patient, a young man named Leo Blackwood, was slated to be a particularly difficult case.  The paperwork, grim as ever, indicated a history of complex trauma and a fervent resistance to therapy.  The setting sun outside painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and angry orange, mirroring the storm within Eleanor's own heart.  She was exhausted, both professionally and personally.  The relentless cycle of helping others heal while struggling to maintain her own equilibrium felt like a cruel and exhausting game.
