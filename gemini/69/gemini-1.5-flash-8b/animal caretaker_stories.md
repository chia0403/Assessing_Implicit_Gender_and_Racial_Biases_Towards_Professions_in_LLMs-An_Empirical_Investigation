The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  She squinted, her breath clouding the frigid air, as she surveyed the sprawling, snow-covered enclosure.  The Keeper's Quarters, a ramshackle structure perched precariously on the edge of the Whispering Woods, offered little protection from the elements.  Inside, the rhythmic, low-pitched snorts of the slumbering snow leopards were the only sounds that broke the eerie silence.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker at the Blackwood Preserve, was used to the solitude, the harsh beauty, and the unpredictable nature of the mountain wilderness. Tonight, however, a strange feeling gnawed at her, a sense of unease that had nothing to do with the bone-chilling wind.

The Blackwood Preserve, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, was a haven for creatures both majestic and elusive.  Giant sequoias, their branches draped with thick, icy garlands, framed the winding pathways that snaked through the property.  A symphony of chirps and trills, muffled by the heavy snowfall, still resonated through the stillness.  Ancient stone walls, weathered and crumbling, marked the boundaries of the various enclosures, housing everything from the gentle giants of the elk herd to the mischievous antics of the playful otters.  The air itself seemed thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a potent aroma that often calmed Amelia, but tonight it just amplified her anxieties.  She felt a prickling dread, a whisper of something amiss, a feeling that went beyond the typical discomfort of a mountain winter night.
