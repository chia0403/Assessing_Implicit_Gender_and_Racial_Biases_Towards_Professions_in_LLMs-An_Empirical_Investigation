Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Rusty Mug," a greasy spoon diner clinging precariously to the side of Highway 66.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating chipped Formica tables and the perpetually stained linoleum floor.  Elara Bellweather, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hair the shade of burnt umber, wiped down a sticky counter.  The air hung thick with the smell of frying bacon, stale coffee, and desperation.  Outside, the endless desert stretched out, a vast expanse of ochre and grey, mirroring the weariness that clung to the town and everyone in it.  Elara, barely sixteen, was already seasoned with the cynicism of a woman twice her age.  Another Tuesday. Another empty diner.  Another heart-wrenching story she would have to witness, perhaps even contribute to, from behind her chipped enamel tray.
