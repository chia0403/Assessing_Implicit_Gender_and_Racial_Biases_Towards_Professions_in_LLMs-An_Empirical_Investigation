The greasy air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and something vaguely floral, probably a stray sprig of jasmine clinging to the rusted window frame.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny garage nestled between a bakery with a perpetually overflowing display case and a vintage clothing shop whose owner preferred to remain shrouded in mystery.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a self-proclaimed master auto mechanic with hands as calloused as the leather of his worn leather apron.  Barty, a man whose face bore the map of countless late nights and engine rebuilds, hunched over a sputtering 1972 Volkswagen Beetle, its once vibrant crimson now faded to a dull, maroon shade.  The little car, christened "The Ladybug" by its previous owner, lay on its back, its innards exposed like a dissected specimen.  Barty's brow furrowed in concentration, a single stray lock of black hair falling across his forehead, obscuring his gaze.  The garage was a symphony of quiet, punctuated only by the rhythmic drip of water and the occasional whir of the air compressor. The faint, almost imperceptible, hum of a distant train mingled with the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Barty's own heart, a silent companion in his solitary work.
