The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a relentless drone that mirrored the anxiety thrumming in Dr. Amelia Rodriguez's chest.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the chipped paint of the psychologist's office, a room more beige than neutral, more muted than comforting.  A single potted fern, stubbornly clinging to life in a cracked terracotta pot, was the only splash of green in the sterile space.  Outside, the crisp autumn air whipped through the bare branches of the ancient oaks lining the school grounds, a stark contrast to the suffocating silence within the room.  Amelia, her name a whispered promise of solace, sat at her desk, the chipped wooden surface a stark reminder of the fractured lives she sought to mend.  A half-eaten granola bar and a crumpled note – "I just… can't," scrawled in a frantic hand – lay abandoned on the surface.  This was just another Tuesday.
