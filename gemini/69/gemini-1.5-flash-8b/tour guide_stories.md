The biting wind whipped Amelia Ashworth's scarf around her neck, a futile attempt at warmth against the encroaching chill of the Scottish Highlands.  A sliver of pale moonlight, filtered through the ancient, gnarled branches of a thousand-year-old oak, cast long, dancing shadows across the glen.  She shivered, not just from the cold, but from a creeping unease that had settled in her stomach like a lead weight.  Tonight, she was leading a small group on a guided tour of the legendary Loch Ness, a tour she’d been meticulously preparing for, a tour that felt, somehow, profoundly wrong.  The air hummed with a low, unsettling thrum, a sound amplified by the desolate emptiness of the valley.  Her group, a gaggle of tourists chattering excitedly about their anticipation for Nessie, seemed oblivious to the unsettling atmosphere.  Amelia, a seasoned tour guide known for her calm demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of the region, forced a smile, attempting to project the confidence she desperately lacked.  This wasn't just another tour of the picturesque loch; tonight, something felt different.  Something…dangerous.
