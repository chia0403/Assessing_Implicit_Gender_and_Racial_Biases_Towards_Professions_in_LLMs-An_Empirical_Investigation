The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose, reflected the pale, bruised light filtering through the grime-coated window of Amelia Blackwood's studio apartment.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sun, illuminating a canvas, nearly swallowed by a tangle of paint tubes and brushes, which sprawled across the worn oak table.  Amelia Blackwood, a young artist with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a spirit as fiery as the charcoal smudges on her fingertips, stared at the chaotic scene.  The painting, a swirling vortex of blues and greys,  seemed to pulse with an inner life, an energy that mirrored the restless turmoil within her.  It was a self-portrait, or at least, that's what she intended.  But today, the canvas felt like a mirror reflecting not her, but something far more elusive, something deeper and more frightening.  The city of Ashwood, with its towering skyscrapers and hidden alleyways, seemed to have seeped into the painting itself, its concrete canyons and whispering rumours mingling with the raw emotion of her unfinished masterpiece.
