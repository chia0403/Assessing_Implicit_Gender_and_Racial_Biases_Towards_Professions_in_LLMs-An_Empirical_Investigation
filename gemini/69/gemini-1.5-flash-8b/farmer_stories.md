The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face.  He hunched deeper into his threadbare sheepskin coat, the coarse wool offering little solace against the encroaching chill.  The sprawling, windswept fields of the Blackwood Valley, usually a tapestry of emerald and gold, were now a monochrome landscape of grey and white.  Snow, relentless and unforgiving, blanketed every blade of grass, every gnarled oak, every jagged peak of the distant mountains. This was the worst winter in living memory.  Elias, a farmer of the Blackwood Valley for forty years, felt the weight of the season, not just on his bones, but on his soul.  His crops were decimated, his livestock struggling to survive, and the looming prospect of another hard winter stretched before him like a forbidding, snow-covered road.  The valley itself seemed to hold its breath, as if bracing for the inevitable.
