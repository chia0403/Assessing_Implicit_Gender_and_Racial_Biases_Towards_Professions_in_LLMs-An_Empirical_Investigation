The fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym buzzed, a relentless hum that vibrated through Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam’s sneakers.  Sweat beaded on her brow, not from exertion – though her usual brisk pace had noticeably picked up – but from the sheer, simmering tension in the air.  It wasn't the usual pre-workout jitters. This was something more… electric.

Setting: The Ironclad Fitness gym was a sprawling, industrial-chic space, bathed in the harsh, yet strangely motivating glow of fluorescent tubes.  Heavy machinery – treadmills that seemed to swallow runners whole, weights stacked like monuments – dominated the cavernous interior.  The air smelled faintly of ozone and stale protein powder.  Today, however, an unusual scent hung in the air, a sharp, metallic tang that seemed to emanate from the center of the room.  A small, shadowy figure hunched over a workbench, shrouded in a cloak that swallowed all but sharp, piercing eyes.  The figure was the source of Sparky's unease, as the energy in the gym crackled with barely suppressed anticipation.
