## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air hung thick and humid over Charleston, South Carolina, even as the morning sun struggled to pierce the pre-dawn gloom. Spanish moss draped like ghostly lace from the ancient live oaks that lined Battery Park, their gnarled branches reaching out towards the gray, choppy waters of the harbor. The cobblestone streets, usually bustling with tourists and early-rising merchants, were eerily silent save for the rhythmic clang of the Liberty Bell replica marking the hour.

**Opening:** Agnes Lucille Dubois carefully unlocked the imposing wrought-iron gates of the Ravenwood Mansion. The metal felt slick and cold beneath her gloved hand, a sensation that always gave her a slight shiver, even on the warmest of days. She pushed the heavy gates inward, the rusty hinges groaning in protest, a sound Agnes knew she'd have to oil soon, along with a hundred other things. Before her stretched the long, oyster-shell driveway, leading to the grand, three-story antebellum house, its white columns looming like skeletal fingers in the dim light. It was a magnificent house, no doubt about it, but Agnes often felt a weight settling on her shoulders the moment she stepped onto the property. A weight that wasn't just the burden of keeping the place clean, but something far heavier, something that clung to the walls and whispered in the shadows. And today, that weight felt particularly oppressive.
