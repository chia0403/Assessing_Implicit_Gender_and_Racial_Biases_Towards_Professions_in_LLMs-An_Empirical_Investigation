Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop named Arthur Reginald Plumtree:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Grand Majestic shimmered under the relentless Miami sun. Its Art Deco facade, a symphony of clean lines and stylized ornamentation in shades of cream and flamingo pink, spoke of a bygone era of glamour and extravagance. Palm trees, perfectly manicured, lined the wide avenue leading up to the revolving doors, their fronds rustling in the humid breeze. Inside, the lobby was a haven of cool, marble floors reflecting the light from massive crystal chandeliers. The air was thick with the scent of lilies, expensive cologne, and the distant murmur of hushed conversations. This wasn't just a hotel; it was an institution, a landmark, a place where fortunes were made and broken, and where secrets whispered amongst the impeccably dressed staff.

**Story Opening:**

Arthur Reginald Plumtree adjusted the epaulets on his neatly pressed uniform, the gold braid catching the light. His reflection stared back at him from the polished brass of the luggage cart. He’d been a bellhop at the Hotel Grand Majestic for fifteen years, and in those fifteen years, he’d seen everything. Divorces played out in hushed tones in the cocktail lounge. Celebrities smuggling exotic animals in oversized luggage. Politicians accepting suspiciously large envelopes. He'd learned to observe, to listen, but most importantly, to keep his mouth shut. Today, however, felt different. There was a palpable tension in the air, a subtle shift in the usual rhythm of the Grand Majestic. He could sense it in the hurried gait of the manager, Mr. Abernathy, and in the nervous glances exchanged between the concierge and the doorman. And then, the Rolls Royce, the size of a small boat, pulled up to the curb. From it emerged a woman cloaked in shadows, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, but her presence radiating an undeniable, almost oppressive, power. Arthur knew, with a certainty that settled like a stone in his stomach, that his quiet routine was about to be irrevocably disrupted.
