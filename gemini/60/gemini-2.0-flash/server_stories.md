## Story Opening and Setting

**Opening:**

The clatter of cheap silverware against chipped china was a familiar symphony to Persephone "Percy" Ambrosia Bellweather. It was the soundtrack of her life, a discordant melody that underscored the endless cycle of refills, requests for extra napkins, and the occasional spilled glass of sweet tea. Tonight, however, the music felt particularly grating. The air in the diner hung thick with the humid heat of a late July evening, sticky enough to coat your skin, and the fluorescent lights buzzed with a frantic energy that seemed to mirror Percy's own inner agitation. Another table flagged her down, their faces etched with the impatient hunger of a family five hours into a cross-country road trip. Percy plastered on her best practiced smile, a maneuver she'd perfected over years of dealing with cranky customers, and braced herself for the inevitable onslaught of demands. Little did she know, the night was about to get a whole lot louder than just the silverware.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the *Starlight Diner*, a roadside establishment located just outside of Harmony, Tennessee. Harmony, a town aptly named for its (mostly superficial) sense of community, boasts a population of just under five thousand souls, clinging to the edge of the Smoky Mountains. The Starlight Diner, with its vintage neon sign flickering intermittently, has been a local landmark for over sixty years. Its red vinyl booths are worn smooth from countless weary travelers and generations of Harmony residents. The menu is classic diner fare: burgers, fries, milkshakes, and, of course, Percy's nemesis, sweet tea. The walls are adorned with faded photographs of local baseball teams and beauty queens from decades past, offering a glimpse into Harmony's unchanging history. Outside, the vast, inky sky is peppered with stars, a stark contrast to the harsh artificial light within. The air is thick with the scent of frying grease and simmering coffee, a comforting aroma to some, but a constant reminder of the relentless grind to Percy. The Starlight Diner isn't just a place to eat; it's a crossroads where dreams are fueled and disappointments are swallowed, a stage where the ordinary dramas of life play out under the watchful gaze of the neon stars.
