## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of burnt beeswax hung heavy in the air, a casualty of Beatrice Eleanor Sterling's insistence on burning hand-poured candles during her client consultations. Usually, the subtle, honeyed fragrance was conducive to thoughtful design discussions. Today, however, it only added to the atmosphere of utter, silent desperation. Beatrice watched, chin propped on her hand, as Mrs. Agatha Featherstone stared forlornly at the swatches of fabric spread across the mahogany dining table.

"Perhaps," Beatrice ventured, her voice carefully neutral, "we should revisit the color palette? The celadon green *is* quite… assertive."

Mrs. Featherstone dabbed delicately at the corner of her eye with a lace handkerchief. "Assertive? Dear Beatrice, assertive is precisely what I do *not* want. I want serenity. I want…I want to feel like I'm floating in a cloud of lavender and chamomile."

Beatrice suppressed a sigh. Lavender and chamomile, indeed. This was turning out to be more challenging than redecorating the ancestral home of a pack of feral chinchillas.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolds in the opulent, yet undeniably dated, dining room of *Featherstone Manor*, a rambling Victorian estate perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning waters of the English Channel. The manor, owned by the wealthy, recently widowed Mrs. Agatha Featherstone, is located in the quaint, but isolated, village of Port Blossom, a place known for its dramatic coastline, its award-winning marmalade, and its unsettling habit of attracting rumors and whispers like barnacles to a ship's hull. The room itself is a testament to a bygone era, furnished with heavy, dark wood furniture, elaborate floral wallpaper (which Beatrice was desperately trying to convince Mrs. Featherstone to replace), and a collection of rather unsettling taxidermied birds arranged on shelves that lined one wall. Despite the grand proportions, the room felt oddly claustrophobic, as if the weight of generations and the echoes of countless dinner parties past were pressing down on the occupants.
