The echoing clang of Mrs. Higgins' brass bell still reverberated through the empty halls of St. Augustine's Academy for Young Ladies, a sound Beatrice Bellweather had come to loathe with a singular passion. Not because she disliked Mrs. Higgins, the ancient and surprisingly sprightly headmistress, but because that bell signaled the end of another day of shrieking laughter, dropped textbooks, andâ€¦ well, frankly, a surprising amount of glitter inexplicably coating every surface.

Beatrice Bellweather, at thirty-seven years old, was hardly the picture of a glamorous janitor. Her grey-streaked brown hair was perpetually tied back in a practical bun, stray strands escaping to frame a face etched with a mixture of weariness and wry amusement. Her uniform, a faded blue jumpsuit with the St. Augustine's crest embroidered unevenly on the breast pocket, did little to flatter her sturdy build. She preferred comfortable work boots to anything remotely fashionable, and her hands, though strong, bore the telltale marks of endless scrubbing.

St. Augustine's Academy was a fortress of Victorian grandeur nestled in the heart of Cedarwood, Massachusetts. Its ivy-covered stone walls housed a labyrinth of classrooms, a sprawling library smelling of aged paper and lemon polish, a surprisingly modern science lab, and a cavernous auditorium where Beatrice had, on more than one occasion, caught glimpses of the drama club practicing scenes that made her blush. The air, thick with the scent of floor wax, old wood, and the lingering perfume of wealthy teenagers, felt both familiar and suffocating. Tonight, though, an unusual stillness clung to the building, a palpable hush that prickled at the back of Beatrice's neck. She wasn't usually one for superstitions, but tonight, even the squeak of her mop against the polished floors sounded amplified, unnervingly loud in the expectant silence.
