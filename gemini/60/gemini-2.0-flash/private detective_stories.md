## The Story Opening:

The cigarette smoke hung thick in the air, a hazy halo around the single, dim bulb sputtering above my desk. It clung to the worn leather of my armchair, the cheap linoleum floor, even the dust motes dancing in the meager light. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windowpanes like bony fingers tapping for entry. Another night, another dame, another problem walking through the door of "Dashiell Blackwood, Private Investigations," expecting miracles for a handful of crumpled bills. I stubbed out my cigarette in the overflowing ashtray, the acrid smell doing little to mask the lingering scent of stale coffee and desperation that always permeated the office. Tonight, though, the desperation felt different. Sharper. More… personal. The knock was light, almost hesitant. More a plea than an announcement. I knew, before I even opened the door, that this wasn't going to be a simple missing husband case. This one smelled of trouble, the kind that sticks to you like tar and ruins your best suit.

## The Setting:

**Location:** A cramped, second-floor office in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago. The building itself is a crumbling brick edifice, scarred with graffiti and bearing the faint ghost of a long-gone sign for "O’Malley’s Haberdashery."

**Description:** The office is sparsely furnished and perpetually cluttered. The walls are painted a sickly shade of green, peeling in places and marred by water stains. A battered wooden desk dominates the room, piled high with files, newspapers, and half-eaten sandwiches. An overflowing ashtray sits precariously close to a stack of precarious-looking documents. A single, worn leather armchair provides the only seating for clients. A rusty filing cabinet stands in the corner, its contents more aspirational than organized. A flickering neon sign reading "INVESTIGATIONS" hangs precariously in the window, its buzzing a constant, irritating companion.

**Time:** Late evening, sometime in late November, 1948. The air is bone-chillingly cold, and the city is shrouded in a fog that hangs heavy and damp.
