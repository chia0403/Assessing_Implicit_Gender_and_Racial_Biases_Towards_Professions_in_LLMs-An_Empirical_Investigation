The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color, bled across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Rue des Rosiers. A lone street musician, his face shadowed beneath a newsboy cap, wheezed a melancholic tune from his accordion, the notes barely audible over the Parisian traffic. For Elara Beatrice Sterling, the symphony of city sounds – the screech of brakes, the impatient honking of a taxi, the murmur of conversations in a language she only partially understood – was normally a comfort, a reminder of her independence. But today, it felt like a cacophony, a relentless assault on her already frayed nerves.

Elara, a journalist for the *International Herald Tribune*, stood huddled deeper into the doorway of a boulangerie, the scent of warm bread doing little to alleviate the gnawing unease in her stomach. She clutched her phone, its screen reflecting the nervous twitch of her eye, waiting for the call that she was starting to believe would never come. The bakery's neon sign flickered erratically above her head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the damp pavement and on the faces of passersby hurrying home to escape the impending twilight. This wasn't how she'd envisioned her first solo assignment in Paris: cold, alone, and beginning to seriously doubt her sanity.
