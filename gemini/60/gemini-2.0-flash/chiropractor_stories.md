## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Mae Harding sighed, the sound a low, weary rumble that barely registered over the soothing New Age music piped through Harding Chiropractic & Wellness. Another cancellation. It was the third this week, and a particularly egregious one, given Mrs. Higgins had been complaining about sciatica for the past month. Eleanor rubbed the small indent on the bridge of her nose, a telltale sign of mounting stress, and glanced at the rain lashing against the windowpane. Maybe it was just the weather. Maybe people were preferring to huddle at home with a cup of tea than face the deluge, even if it meant living with a persistent lower back ache. Maybe...

She cut off the spiraling negativity. Negativity, she knew from her own experience, was the quickest route to a slipped disc in the mind.

**Setting:**

Harding Chiropractic & Wellness was nestled on the ground floor of a renovated Victorian house in the heart of Oak Haven, Vermont. The town itself was picture-postcard perfect: quaint shops with overflowing window boxes, a town square dominated by a white-steepled church, and a palpable sense of community that permeated every corner.

Eleanor had painstakingly crafted a welcoming and calming atmosphere inside her practice. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the polished hardwood floors and the calming shades of green and blue that adorned the walls. The waiting area featured comfortable armchairs, a selection of natural health magazines, and a small bubbling fountain, its gentle murmur designed to ease pre-adjustment jitters. Beyond the waiting area were two treatment rooms, each equipped with state-of-the-art chiropractic tables and the aroma of eucalyptus and lavender that Eleanor religiously diffused throughout the day.

However, despite the idyllic setting and carefully cultivated ambiance, Harding Chiropractic & Wellness wasn't exactly thriving. Eleanor was constantly battling the perception of chiropractors as "back crackers" and struggling to convince the skeptical, often health-food-averse population of Oak Haven that her holistic approach to wellness could truly make a difference.
