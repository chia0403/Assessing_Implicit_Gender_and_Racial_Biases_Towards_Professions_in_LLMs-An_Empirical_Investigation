Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is an editor:

**Setting:**

The setting is a small, independent publishing house called "Inkwell Press," nestled in the heart of Portland, Oregon’s Hawthorne District. The office space is a converted Victorian house, charmingly cluttered with overflowing bookshelves, stacks of manuscripts teetering on every surface, and the constant aroma of stale coffee and aged paper. Sunlight filters through the stained-glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the worn Persian rugs. The ambiance is a unique blend of chaotic creativity and quiet intellectualism. Outside, the sounds of the bustling street – the clatter of the streetcar, the distant hum of traffic, and the chatter of passersby – create a constant, low-level hum.

**Story Opening:**

Rain lashed against the leaded glass of the window, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth. She’d been staring at the same paragraph for the better part of an hour, and the only thing that had changed was the growing sense of dread pooling in her stomach. “Purple prose,” she muttered, circling the offending sentence in red ink with such force that she nearly tore the page. Eleanor hated purple prose. It was the literary equivalent of wearing a velvet suit to a picnic – ostentatious, unnecessary, and ultimately, irritating.

The manuscript in question, *The Obsidian Mirror*, was supposed to be Inkwell Press’s breakout novel. A sweeping fantasy epic with intricate world-building and a supposed feminist slant, it was written by a debut author, one Reginald Thornton the Third. Reginald, it turned out, had a passion for adverbs that bordered on the pathological and a penchant for describing his heroines' bosoms with an enthusiasm that made Eleanor deeply uncomfortable.

She leaned back in her creaky oak chair, rubbing the bridge of her nose. This wasn’t the first time she’d wrestled with Reginald’s…enthusiasms. He'd bristled at every suggestion, every cut, every attempt to reign in his florid language. He considered himself a genius, and Eleanor, apparently, was just a pedantic nuisance.

A sigh escaped her lips, misting the lenses of her vintage spectacles. Another day, another battle. At least the coffee was still hot. Maybe. She reached for the chipped ceramic mug on her desk, hoping for a caffeine-fueled burst of clarity. She needed it. *The Obsidian Mirror* was due to go to print in two weeks, and Eleanor Ainsworth was starting to feel like she was drowning in a sea of superfluous adjectives.
