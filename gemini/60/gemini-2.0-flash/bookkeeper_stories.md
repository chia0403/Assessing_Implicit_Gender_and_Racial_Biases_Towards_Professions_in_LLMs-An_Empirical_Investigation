**Opening:**

Beatrice Penelope Bellweather, bookkeeper extraordinaire and lover of all things neat and tidy, discovered the discrepancy on a Tuesday. Not just any Tuesday, mind you, but the Tuesday after she'd finally managed to alphabetize all the sticky notes in her office (a feat she considered nearly on par with landing on the moon). She was humming a jaunty tune, "The Pennsylvania Polka," a surprising earworm that had taken root since overhearing it in the breakroom the week before, and sipping lukewarm chamomile tea from her chipped mug emblazoned with the phrase, "I'd Rather Be Balancing." The world, for once, felt balanced too. Then she scrolled to page 37 of the quarterly ledger for the "Jolly Jester Toy Emporium," a client whose chaotic inventory always gave Beatrice a mild existential crisis, and the music screeched to a halt in her head. A missing five thousand dollars. Just like that, Beatrice's Tuesday, and possibly her entire meticulously organized life, was about to unravel.

**Setting:**

The year is 1987. Beatrice's office is a small, windowless space on the third floor of "Sterling & Finch Accountants," a decidedly un-Sterling and rather drab building in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stacks of manila folders threatening to topple from every available surface. The air is thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint metallic tang of the adding machine that sits, a trusty and noisy companion, on her desk. The desk itself is a testament to Beatrice's dedication to order. Everything has its place: a precisely aligned row of pens, a ruler laid perfectly parallel to the desk's edge, and a "World's Best Bookkeeper" paperweight (a gift from her equally meticulous, though slightly less personable, brother, Bartholomew). A corkboard on the wall above the desk displays a meticulously arranged collection of inspirational quotes clipped from newspapers and magazines, all advocating for the virtues of diligence, accuracy, and the undeniable beauty of a balanced ledger. Despite the organized chaos, the office is undeniably *Beatrice's*. Itâ€™s a sanctuary of numbers and order in a world she often finds bewilderingly messy.
