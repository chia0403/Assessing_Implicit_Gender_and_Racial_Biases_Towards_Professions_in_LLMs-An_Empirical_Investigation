## Story Opening:

The stale, recycled air of the Boeing 777 did little to soothe Amelia Josephine Carter. She plastered on a professional smile, the kind she’d perfected after five years of service with Global Airways, and greeted the stream of passengers boarding Flight 417 to Buenos Aires. Outside, the Miami sun beat down with relentless intensity, a stark contrast to the cool, metallic chill of the aircraft.

Amelia carefully scanned each face – the honeymooners clutching hands a little too tightly, the businessman with a harried expression and a phone glued to his ear, the elderly woman with a worried frown etched into the lines around her eyes. Years of experience had taught her to spot the potential trouble before it brewed. She looked for the nervous fidgets, the averted gazes, the too-bright smiles that masked something darker. Today, however, everyone seemed remarkably ordinary.

Except, perhaps, for the man in seat 24B. He was unremarkable in appearance – a neatly trimmed beard, a nondescript grey suit, a laptop bag slung over his shoulder. But there was something in the way he held himself, an unnatural stillness, that prickled the back of Amelia’s neck. He didn't meet her eye, and his hand trembled almost imperceptibly as he stowed his bag in the overhead compartment. Amelia made a mental note. Seat 24B. Keep an eye on him.

## Setting:

**Inside a Boeing 777, Flight 417 of Global Airways, preparing for departure from Miami International Airport (MIA).**

The interior of the plane is a familiar landscape of beige and grey. Overhead bins are being crammed with carry-ons, the muffled sounds of rolling suitcases and snippets of hurried conversations filling the air. The air is thick with the faint aroma of disinfectant and jet fuel. Sunlight streams through the oval windows, creating harsh shadows on the plush, yet slightly worn, seats. The flight attendants, clad in Global Airways' navy blue uniforms, move with practiced efficiency, offering assistance and silently assessing the passengers. The electronic safety demonstration plays on the overhead monitors, a repetitive reminder of the potential dangers that lie ahead.
