The chipped mug warmed Eleanor Vance's hands, but not her spirit. Outside, the November drizzle was a relentless curtain, mirroring the bleak outlook of her business, "Wanderlust Whispers," nestled in the perpetually-under-construction corner of Harmony Creek. Harmony Creek, population 3,842 and perpetually two seasons behind the trending aesthetic, was, ironically, the last place one would expect to find a travel agency. Especially one struggling as fiercely as hers.

Inside, Wanderlust Whispers was a riot of color, a defiant splash of sunshine against the grey. Posters depicting azure Grecian waters, bustling Moroccan marketplaces, and snow-dusted Swiss chalets plastered the walls. Miniature Eiffel Towers and ceramic llamas jostled for space on dusty shelves, alongside brochures boasting "Unbeatable Deals to Paradise!" and "Adventure Awaits!" The scent of potpourri, meant to evoke exotic spice markets, mostly just smelled like cinnamon and damp cardboard. Eleanor, with her perpetually tangled auburn hair and perpetually optimistic smile (that was starting to feel more like a rictus these days), was the only constant source of genuine warmth in the place. But even her smile faltered as she stared at the calendar, another month ticking away towards Christmas, and the looming threat of closing her dream, one that, just five years ago, had felt as solid and vibrant as the images plastered on her walls.
