## Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn air hung heavy over the French Quarter of New Orleans, clinging to the wrought-iron balconies and the chipped paint of the centuries-old buildings. The scent of stale beer, spilled beignets, and something vaguely floral, perhaps jasmine struggling to survive the urban grit, permeated the narrow streets. The sounds of last night’s revelry were fading, replaced by the rumble of sanitation trucks and the murmur of early risers.

**Opening:** Detective Inspector Annelise Moreau squinted against the faint glow of the rising sun, which was barely strong enough to penetrate the perpetual twilight of Bourbon Street. Her boots echoed on the wet cobblestones, the only sound competing with the distant wail of a saxophone bleeding out from a late-night jazz club. She pulled her worn leather jacket tighter around her, the chill a stark contrast to the muggy air. The call had come in just an hour ago - another body, another overdose, another tragedy that whispered of a city slowly drowning in its own despair. But this one… this one felt different. The address wasn’t some dimly lit alleyway or a cheap hotel room. This was Madame Esmeralda’s Tarot Parlor, a place where fortunes were read, not lives forfeited. Annelise felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach. This was going to be a long day.
