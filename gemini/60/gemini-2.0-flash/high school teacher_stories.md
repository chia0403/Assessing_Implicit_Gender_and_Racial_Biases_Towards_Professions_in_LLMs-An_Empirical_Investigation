The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed with their usual manic energy, casting a sterile, yellow glow on Ms. Eleanor Ruth Cavendish’s meticulous classroom. Stacks of graded essays, neatly bound with red ribbon, formed miniature monuments on her desk, each a testament to her dedication, or perhaps her obsession. Outside, the last vestiges of summer clung to the air, but within the four walls of room 208, it was perpetually late October, the smell of dry erase markers and old textbooks heavy in the air.

She stood before her overflowing bookcase, lined with dog-eared copies of Shakespeare, Austen, and Woolf, a small, determined figure against the literary giants. Today, however, even the comforting weight of “Pride and Prejudice” couldn’t quell the butterflies churning in her stomach. This morning's intercom announcement about mandatory staff meetings after school had filled the normally predictable Northwood High hallways with an unsettling undercurrent of anxiety.
