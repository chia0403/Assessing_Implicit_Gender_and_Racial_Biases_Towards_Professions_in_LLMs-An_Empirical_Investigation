## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying with it a flurry of stubborn snowflakes that stung Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's cheeks. She pulled her wool scarf tighter, the familiar scent of lavender and wool a small comfort against the early March chill. Ellie squinted at the Victorian monstrosity looming before her, its peeling paint and sagging porch a testament to years of neglect. "Charming fixer-upper," the listing description had optimistically proclaimed. Ellie suspected "money pit" was a far more accurate assessment. She sighed, the vapor clouding her breath, and adjusted the strap of her oversized tote bag, feeling the familiar weight of keys, contracts, and half-eaten granola bars. This was 32 Harborview Drive, and it was her last showing of a long, disappointing day. With a resolute shove, Ellie pushed open the creaky gate and started up the weed-choked path, determined to find something, anything, to sell this house on. Even if it was just the view.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Lake Geneva, Wisconsin**, a charming lakeside town known for its historical mansions, scenic beauty, and, according to Ellie, an unusually high concentration of eccentric residents and stubbornly outdated real estate practices. The year is **2024**, just as the long Wisconsin winter is beginning to reluctantly loosen its grip. The specific location is the **East Lake Geneva historic district**, characterized by grand old homes, many of which have seen better days. The contrast between the opulent history and the current state of disrepair is a recurring theme throughout the story, reflecting the challenges Ellie faces in her career.
