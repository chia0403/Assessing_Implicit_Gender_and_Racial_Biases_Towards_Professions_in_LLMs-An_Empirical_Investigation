Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of our main character, a phlebotomist:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony in the waiting area of the "Sunrise Clinic," a sprawling, multi-specialty practice nestled on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona. Outside, the desert sun was already baking the earth by 7:00 AM, promising another scorcher. Inside, the air conditioning struggled to keep pace, leaving a thin film of humidity clinging to the vinyl chairs and the faces of the early-morning patients. A flickering television screen showed a local news report about a rattlesnake sighting in a nearby residential area, adding a subtle undercurrent of unease to the already anxious atmosphere.

**Story Opening:**

"Number 27, please," a voice crackled over the intercom, barely audible above the hum of the air conditioning.

Penelope Anastasia Rossi sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Number 27. Old Mrs. Gable, bless her heart, always a difficult stick. Penelope hated to see her nervous wrinkles deepen even more as Penelope went to draw blood. But, duty called, and Penelope was ready. Steeling herself with another deep breath, she glanced at the call sheet on the door, noted the test requests, and plastered a cheerful smile on her face before pushing open the door to the phlebotomy lab. Today, it was Penelope's turn to try and ease Mrs. Gable through her morning appointment. After all, that was the one part of the job Penelope Anastasia Rossi truly loved â€“ making people feel just a little bit better, one tiny vial at a time.
