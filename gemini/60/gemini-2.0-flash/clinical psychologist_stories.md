The fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet anxieties that permeated the air. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth adjusted the stack of intake forms on her lap, the scent of cheap paper and institutional disinfectant doing little to soothe the persistent throb behind her eyes. Outside, a late October wind rattled the bare branches of the oak tree visible through the grime-streaked window, a visual metaphor Eleanor couldn't help but appreciate, even if it was a little on the nose.

Her practice, "Ainsworth & Associates: Mental Wellness for a Modern World," occupied the second floor of a converted brownstone in Philadelphia's bustling Rittenhouse Square. The building, while aesthetically pleasing with its high ceilings and intricate moldings, felt perpetually cold, a consequence, Eleanor suspected, of its aging infrastructure and the city's relentless drafts. The waiting room, decorated in muted tones of grey and teal, was designed to be calming, but often felt sterile, a blank canvas upon which her patients projected their own anxieties.

Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her already disheveled auburn hair. It was Monday morning, the start of a long week, and the patient files in her hand promised a colorful tapestry of neuroses and traumas. She just hoped she had the emotional bandwidth to navigate it all. Especially after the weekend sheâ€™d had.
