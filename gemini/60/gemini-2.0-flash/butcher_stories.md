## Story Opening:

The smell, as always, was a comforting assault on the senses. A metallic tang of blood mingling with the sweet, almost floral scent of freshly cut fat. Ebenezer Augustine Peabody, his hands already slick and crimson, inhaled deeply as he surveyed the morning's delivery. Two whole pigs, plump and glistening, lay waiting on the stainless-steel table. Ebenezer ran a calloused finger down the flank of one, a slight smile playing on his lips. This was good meat. This was *his* domain.

He reached for his well-worn cleaver, the weight familiar and reassuring in his palm. Outside, the first hint of dawn was painting the sky a pale, watery blue. Soon, the townsfolk would begin stirring, their thoughts turning to breakfast, to lunch, to the hearty suppers that kept the harsh winds of October at bay. And Ebenezer, the butcher, would be ready.

## Setting:

**Peabody's Provisions** was more than just a butcher shop; it was a cornerstone of the small, windswept town of Oakhaven, nestled on the edge of the Blackwood Forest in rural Maine. The shop itself was an old building, its weathered clapboard siding painted a faded cherry red. A large, hand-painted sign, its letters slightly chipped and worn, proclaimed the establishment's name in elegant, looping script.

Inside, the air was cool and crisp, a stark contrast to the approaching bite of winter. Sawdust dusted the floor, muffling footsteps and absorbing any spills. Rows of gleaming hooks hung from the ceiling, some laden with sausages of all varieties, others patiently waiting for the day's cuts. Behind the counter, a gleaming antique cash register sat perched, its brass surface polished to a mirror shine. Sunlight, filtered through the shop's large front window, illuminated jars of pickled eggs, brined vegetables, and fragrant spices, casting a warm, inviting glow. The walls were adorned with faded photographs depicting Ebenezer's ancestors, each a butcher in their own right, their faces grimly determined and their hands perpetually holding a cleaver. Peabody's Provisions was a testament to tradition, a legacy passed down through generations, and a place where the simple, honest craft of butchery was still revered.
