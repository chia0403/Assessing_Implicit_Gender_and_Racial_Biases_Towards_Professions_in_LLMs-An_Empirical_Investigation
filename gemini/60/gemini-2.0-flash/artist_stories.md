The salt-laced wind whipped Elara Willowbrook's hair around her face as she perched precariously on the crumbling edge of the cliff. Below, the churning Atlantic gnawed at the jagged coastline of Port Blossom, Maine. The air thrummed with the mournful cry of gulls and the ceaseless crash of waves against stone.

Elara squinted, her eyes, the colour of sea glass, fixed on the chaotic beauty unfolding before her. She was a whirlwind of motion and chaos, a storm of blues and greens, a masterpiece of a sea.  Her canvas, an old, weathered easel her grandfather had left her, was weighted down with stones against the gusts. The smell of linseed oil and saltwater mingled in the air, a familiar and comforting scent in this wild, untamed place.

This was her sanctuary. This was where Elara could breathe, where the anxieties that plagued her back in Boston seemed to dissipate into the mist. Here, in this windswept corner of the world, she was just Elara Willowbrook, the artist, wrestling with the infinite possibilities of color and light. The small, clapboard cottage, a faded blue that mirrored the sky on a clear day, sat nestled just behind her on the cliff's edge, its windows like watchful eyes on her solitary work.  Port Blossom wasn’t known for its high art scene, but its rugged beauty was a muse that Elara couldn’t resist.
