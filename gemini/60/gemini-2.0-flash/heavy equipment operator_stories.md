## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, stinging Finnigan "Finn" O'Malley's cheeks and stealing his breath. He hunched deeper into the worn fleece lining of his Carhartt, the rumble of the Caterpillar D8T vibrating through his boots and bones like a persistent tremor. The digital display in the cab glowed a sickly green in the pre-dawn gloom, mocking the vibrant aurora borealis that occasionally danced across the horizon, a spectacle Finn usually enjoyed. Today, however, all he felt was the creeping dread of the task ahead. He gripped the joystick, the familiar weight doing little to settle the knot in his stomach. Today, they were starting the excavation.

## Setting:

The scene is set in late October in the remote, rugged landscape of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Specifically, Finn is operating his bulldozer on the site of a future wind farm, perched high on a ridge overlooking the vast, churning expanse of Lake Superior. The area is a patchwork of dense pine forests, rocky outcrops, and windswept, desolate beauty. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles, damp earth, and the ever-present metallic tang of lake water. The remnants of a recent snow dusting cling to the sheltered pockets of the landscape, a stark reminder of the long, brutal winter to come. Scattered around him are other heavy equipment – excavators, graders, and loaders – all silent and waiting like slumbering beasts. In the distance, the skeletal framework of the first wind turbine, erected the previous summer, stands stark against the grey sky, a silent sentinel watching over Finn's grim task. The nearest town, Houghton, is a good hour's drive away, making the site feel isolated and exposed.
