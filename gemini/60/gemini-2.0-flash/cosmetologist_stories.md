Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of the main character, who is a cosmetologist:

**Story Opening:**

The chime above the door of "Salon Serenity" warbled a tired greeting, barely audible over the purr of the hair dryers and the low hum of gossip weaving its way through the air. Rain lashed against the large front windows, turning the normally cheerful pastel-colored salon into a cozy, womb-like haven. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne sighed, running a hand through her own perfectly coiffed blonde bob. It had been a long day, filled with demanding clients, questionable fashion choices, and the unending drama of wedding season. She was just moments away from finally locking up and sinking into a bubble bath filled with lavender oil when a figure, shrouded in a dripping trench coat and an aura of desperate urgency, stumbled through the door.

**Setting:**

The year is 2023. "Salon Serenity" is a thriving beauty salon nestled in the heart of the historic district of Willow Creek, a charming, picturesque town in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. The salon itself is located in a converted Victorian-era storefront. Inside, the decor is a carefully curated blend of modern and vintage, with plush velvet seating, antique mirrors, and gleaming stainless-steel styling stations. The walls are painted in calming shades of lavender and sage green, and the air is perpetually scented with hairspray, essential oils, and the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Large windows offer views of the tree-lined street outside, usually bustling with tourists and locals alike, but tonight, it's only the rain. While successful, it is not a large space, containing only 4 styling stations, 2 wash stations, and a small manicure area.
