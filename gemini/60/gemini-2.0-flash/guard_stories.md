## Story Opening:

The midday sun beat down on the crenellations of the West Keep, turning Sergeant Thaddeus Armitage's chainmail into a miniature furnace. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes despite the worn leather bracer he used to wipe them. He squinted, his gaze fixed on the dusty track leading towards the city gates. Another merchant caravan, most likely. The endless stream of carts and hawkers filled the Royal Treasury, but also brought with them whispers, rumors, and sometimes, outright danger. Thaddeus had seen enough of the latter in his twenty years with the City Guard to distrust every smiling face and honeyed word that passed beneath these walls. He shifted his weight, the familiar creak of his leather boots a small comfort in the oppressive heat. Today, however, felt different. An odd stillness hung in the air, a pregnant silence that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck. It was the kind of quiet that came before a storm.

## Setting:

The story is set in the walled city of **Veridia**, capital of the Kingdom of Eldoria. The city is known for its sprawling marketplace, its grand cathedral dedicated to the Sun God, and most importantly, for the imposing **Royal Citadel**, which dominates the landscape.

**Specifically, the scene takes place on the West Keep of the Royal Citadel.** The West Keep is one of the highest points of the citadel, offering a commanding view of the surrounding plains. Constructed of thick, grey stone, it features high crenellated walls, narrow arrow slits, and a watchtower that pierces the sky. The air is typically dry and dusty, carrying the scent of sun-baked stone and distant fields. The West Keep is primarily used for observation and defense, manned by a contingent of City Guards who patrol the walls and watch for threats approaching from the west. It is a place of duty, vigilance, and often, profound boredom, punctuated by moments of intense, adrenaline-fueled action. The Kingdom of Eldoria is a land of rolling hills, thick forests, and fertile farmland, reminiscent of medieval Europe with a touch of high fantasy elements. Magic is rumored to exist, but it is rare and closely guarded by the Royal Court.
