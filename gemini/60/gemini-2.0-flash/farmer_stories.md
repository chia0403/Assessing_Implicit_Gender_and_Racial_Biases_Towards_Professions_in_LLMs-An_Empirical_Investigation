The predawn air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and blooming alfalfa, a familiar perfume that usually soothed Jedediah Isaacs. But this morning, the scent did little to calm the knot of anxiety tightening his gut. He stood on the porch of his weathered farmhouse, the wood groaning beneath his worn leather boots, and watched the first sliver of sun claw its way over the horizon. His farm, Isaacs Acres, stretched before him, a patchwork quilt of fields stitched together with rusty barbed wire and crisscrossed by dusty tractor tracks. He could see the hazy shapes of his livestock stirring in the distance, the faint bleating of sheep carried on the still air. But it wasn't the farm itself that held his gaze; it was the shimmering, almost ethereal quality of the air above the north field, the field where he'd planted his experimental crop of Azure Corn. Something feltâ€¦ wrong. Profoundly, disturbingly wrong.
