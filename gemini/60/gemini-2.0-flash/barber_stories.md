Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a barber named Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley:

**Opening:**

The smell of Bay Rum and stale cigarettes hung thick in the air of O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour, a scent Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley had come to equate with contentment.  The familiar click-clack of his well-worn clippers, a rhythmic counterpoint to the sputtering hum of the ancient barber's chair, had a hypnotic effect, lulling both barber and customer into a temporary truce with the anxieties of the day.  Today, however, even that comforting rhythm felt a little off. Bart’s hand trembled almost imperceptibly as he guided the clippers over old Mr. Henderson's thinning pate, and a knot of worry tightened in his stomach with each passing snip. It wasn’t the hair, or the customer, that troubled him. It was the photograph, tucked face-down in the breast pocket of his starched white coat, a silent reminder of the trouble brewing just beyond the frosted glass of his storefront.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in **Milltown, Pennsylvania, in the autumn of 1938**.  Milltown is a small, blue-collar town nestled in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains.  The town's main industry, the now-struggling Milltown Steel Foundry, looms large, both physically and metaphorically, over the lives of its residents. The town square boasts a faded Victorian-era clock tower, a testament to a more prosperous time.

**O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour** is located on Main Street, sandwiched between a dusty antique store and a diner that serves suspiciously green coffee.  The interior is small and slightly cramped.  The walls are painted a faded, chipped green, adorned with yellowing advertisements for hair tonics and shaving creams featuring handsome men with impossibly smooth chins.  Two barber chairs, relics from a bygone era, dominate the space.  A worn leather strop hangs near the sink, alongside a collection of well-used straight razors.  A large, slightly warped mirror reflects the room back on itself, capturing the faces of men seeking a bit of grooming and a few moments of quiet camaraderie. A pot-bellied stove, crucial for the upcoming winter months, sits in the corner, emitting a faint, metallic smell even when unlit. Sunlight, when it manages to penetrate the perpetually overcast sky, streams in through the frosted glass windows, casting long shadows across the linoleum floor, permanently stained with errant hairs and spilled tonic.
