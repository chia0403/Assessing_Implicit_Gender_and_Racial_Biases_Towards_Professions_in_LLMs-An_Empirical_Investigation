**Setting:**

The air in the abandoned Blackwood Asylum hung thick and cold, a miasma of dust, mildew, and lingering madness. Peeling paint wept from the walls in grotesque patterns, illuminated only by the sickly yellow beam of a work light perched precariously on a toppled examination table. Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the boarded-up windows and sending shivers down the spine even without considering the asylum's infamous history. Decades of whispered stories clung to the place, tales of inhumane experiments, tormented souls, and echoing screams that never truly faded. The main corridor, once a sterile white, was now a canvas of decay, stained with rust-colored blotches and shadowed by the ghosts of those who had walked its length.

**Opening:**

"Damn it all to hell," growled Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, spitting out a stray fleck of crumbling plaster. She brushed a grimy hand across her forehead, leaving a streak of dust and sweat on her brow. The smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, a grim reminder of the electrical fire she’d just managed to extinguish in what was once the asylum's hydrotherapy room. Ellie, a woman built more for practicality than grace, adjusted her tool belt, the weight of it a familiar comfort in this unsettling environment. She took a deep breath, trying to ignore the prickling sensation on the back of her neck.

She was an electrician, not a ghost hunter. But the Blackwood County Historical Society, desperate to restore this crumbling relic to something resembling its former glory, had offered her a sum that would finally pay off her student loans. Wiring the entire place back to life, however, was proving to be a task that tested not only her electrical skills, but also her sanity. The blueprints were outdated, the wiring a tangled mess of corroded copper and frayed insulation, and the whole place just felt…wrong.

Ellie consulted the faded diagram in her calloused hand. Her objective: trace the circuit for the emergency generator. According to the blueprints, it was located somewhere behind the hydrotherapy room. This meant venturing deeper into the bowels of the asylum, into the labyrinthine network of corridors and forgotten rooms where the darkness seemed to press in, thick and suffocating. She clicked on her flashlight, the beam cutting a swathe through the oppressive gloom, and forced herself to take another step forward. "Okay, Ellie," she muttered to herself, her voice echoing eerily in the vast emptiness. "Just find the generator, fix the damn thing, and get the hell out of here."

But even as she said the words, she knew a growing sense of dread had settled over her. She was no longer just an electrician tackling a difficult job. Something in the air, something ancient and malevolent, was watching her. And Ellie Vance, despite her pragmatic nature, couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking into something far more dangerous than faulty wiring.
