## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, the rusted pipe groaning in protest as Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins swore under his breath, a low, rumbling sound that echoed in the cavernous space under the old Victorian house. He could feel the grit of ancient dust coating his sweat-slicked forehead, mingling with the persistent drip, drip, drip of the leaky fitting he was battling. "Come on, you stubborn bastard," he muttered, applying more leverage. The metal shrieked again, a sound that threatened to shatter the fragile peace of the early morning. Just when he thought he had it, the pipe coughed a jet of rusty water directly into his face.

## Setting:

The house itself was a grand dame on Sycamore Street, in the historic district of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Once a beacon of wealth and prosperity, it was now sadly listing towards disrepair, its gingerbread trim chipped and faded, the paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The current owner, a recluse named Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, claimed to have inherited the house from her great-aunt, a woman rumored to have dabbled in spiritualism and the occult. The basement, where Bart was currently wrestling with the plumbing, was a testament to the house's age and the neglect it had suffered. Stone walls, stained with damp and speckled with mold, supported a low, arched ceiling. Cobwebs draped like ghostly curtains, and the air hung thick with the musty scent of decaying wood and stagnant water. A single bare bulb hung precariously from a joist, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the eye, making the already unnerving space feel even more haunted. Mrs. Ainsworth had warned him about the "peculiar energy" in the basement, but Bart, a pragmatist at heart, had chalked it up to the ramblings of an eccentric old woman. Now, as he wiped the rust from his eyes and the water trickled down his neck, he couldn't help but wonder if there was more to the story than he initially thought.
