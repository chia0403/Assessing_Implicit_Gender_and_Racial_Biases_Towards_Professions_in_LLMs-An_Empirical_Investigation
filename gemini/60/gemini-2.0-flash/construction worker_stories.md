Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of our construction worker protagonist:

**Opening:**

The first tremor was so subtle, just a slight vibration in the steel beam under his work boots, that Dominick “Dom” Bartholomew almost dismissed it as the morning coffee wearing off. He tightened his grip on his pneumatic rivet gun, its rhythmic hammering already a comforting hum against the rising din of the construction site. Sunlight glinted off the hardhat of the man working twenty feet above him, a momentary distraction. Then came another tremor, sharper this time, enough to rattle the safety harness across his chest. He glanced around, expecting to see a rogue crane or a misplaced load. Instead, he saw the sky above, a crisp, cloudless blue, suddenly tilt at an unnatural angle.

**Setting:**

The story opens on the site of the *Horizon Towers*, a massive, ambitious skyscraper project rising on the edge of downtown Port Seraphina, California. Port Seraphina itself is a bustling coastal city known for its innovative architecture, tech industries, and its precarious location right on the San Andreas Fault. The Horizon Towers are intended to be the city's tallest building, a symbol of its technological prowess and unwavering optimism.

The construction site is a chaotic ballet of steel and concrete. Cranes groan under the weight of enormous girders, welders send showers of sparks into the air, and the constant roar of machinery fills the air. The half-finished skeleton of the building looms against the skyline, a metal latticework reaching towards the heavens. It's late spring, the air is dry and hot, and the scent of welding fumes mixes with the salty tang of the Pacific Ocean just a few blocks away. The workers are a diverse crew, a melting pot of backgrounds and skillsets, all united by the common goal of building something big, something lasting… something that might, on this day, be destined to fall.
