The harsh fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed, casting a sickly yellow glow on everything, including the wilting heads of the sunflowers propped up in a bucket near the door. It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind where the air hung heavy with the promise of a thunderstorm that never quite materialized. Across the counter, a man in a stained wife-beater argued vehemently about the price of a scratch-off lottery ticket, his voice a gravelly drone that threatened to chip away at the already fragile patience of Imogen Clara Ainsworth.

Imogen, name tag proclaiming her as such, sighed inwardly. The Quick Stop, situated on the desolate stretch of Highway 31 between Dustbowl Gulch and Redemption Ridge (a name that felt particularly ironic today), wasnâ€™t exactly known for its sophisticated clientele. It was more of a haven for truckers, tourists desperate for a bathroom break, and the occasional local trying to score cigarettes without showing ID. She smoothed down her slightly crumpled, maroon Quick Stop uniform and forced a smile that felt faker than the plastic fruit display behind her. Today, more than ever, she longed to be anywhere but here, surrounded by the smell of stale coffee and the incessant beep of the scanner.
