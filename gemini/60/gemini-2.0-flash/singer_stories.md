The sticky summer air hung thick in the narrow alley behind The Blue Moon Saloon, clinging to Amelia Rose Thornton like a second skin. She’d peeled off her sequined dress, now draped over a rusty dumpster, and was pacing in her stocking feet on the grimy concrete. The cigarette trembled between her painted lips, the cherry flaring bright against the encroaching darkness. The Blue Moon, nestled in the heart of New Orleans’ Frenchmen Street, throbbed with music even back here, a cacophony of brass and booming bass threatening to drown out the persistent hum of the city.

Amelia Rose Thornton, with a voice that could soothe a hurricane and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of the bayou, was supposed to be enjoying the adulation that came after a killer set. Instead, she felt like she was suffocating. The applause, the shouts for an encore, even the sweaty-palmed businessmen trying to buy her drinks - they were all a suffocating fog she couldn't quite break free from.
