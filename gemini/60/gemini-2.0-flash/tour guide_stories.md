## Story Opening:

The salt spray kissed Amelia Grace Davies' face as she tightened the knot of her bright orange scarf. The 'Sea Serpent's Whisper' - her boat, her passion, her livelihood - bucked against the choppy waves, a stubborn mule trying to resist her reign. Amelia, however, was undeterred. Even on a blustery day like today, the Isle of Mann's secrets whispered on the wind, waiting to be uncovered.

"Alright, lovelies, gather 'round!" she shouted, her voice barely audible above the roar of the engine and the screech of seagulls. She gestured with a gloved hand towards the jagged, grey cliffs rising dramatically from the turquoise water. "Welcome aboard the 'Sea Serpent's Whisper' and prepare to have your breath stolen! We're about to embark on a journey through time, myth, and the truly bizarre beauty that this island offers!"

A few nervous faces peered back at her from beneath waterproof hoods. Today's crowd was smaller than usual, likely deterred by the ominous clouds gathering over the horizon. Amelia felt a pang of guilt; she'd promised them a stunning panorama of sea caves and hidden coves. But she wouldn't let the weather dampen their spirits. She was Amelia Grace Davies, the Isle of Mann's most enthusiastic, and arguably most eccentric, tour guide. Rain or shine, she'd make sure they left with a memory worth braving the elements for.

## Setting:

The story is set on the **Isle of Mann**, a self-governing British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. The current scene takes place on a small, privately owned tour boat named the **'Sea Serpent's Whisper'**, circling the rugged coastline of the island. Specifically, they are nearing the **Spanish Head**, a dramatic promontory known for its sheer cliffs and abundant birdlife. The weather is **stormy**, with grey skies, choppy waters, and a strong wind. The air is thick with the scent of salt and seaweed. The surrounding landscape is dominated by the **granite cliffs**, covered in patches of green moss and seabird guano. The water is a swirling mix of **turquoise and grey**, reflecting the tumultuous sky above.
