**Opening:**

The flickering neon sign of the "Diner of the Lost Souls" cast a greasy, orange glow across the cracked asphalt of the I-40 rest stop. Diesel fumes hung thick in the air, a noxious perfume that clung to everything - the battered chrome of the eighteen-wheelers, the weathered faces of the drivers, and the threadbare vinyl booths inside the diner. For Jebediah "Jeb" Walker, it was just another Tuesday. Or maybe Wednesday. He'd lost track somewhere around Amarillo. All he knew was that his stomach was grumbling louder than the idling engine of his rig, "The Wanderer," and the promise of burnt coffee and questionable meatloaf was too alluring to ignore.

**Setting:**

Jebediah's world is the long haul. He's a solitary figure, carving a path through the American heartland in his 1978 Kenworth W900A. "The Wanderer," as he affectionately calls her, is a symphony of chrome, dents, and custom paint - a rolling testament to years on the road. The interior is equally well-worn: a tattered American flag hanging above the dashboard, a faded photograph of his late wife taped to the visor, and a well-loved copy of Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath" lying on the passenger seat.

His life unfolds in a landscape of endless highways, desolate truck stops, and small towns that blur together in a kaleidoscope of gas station lights and fast-food signs. The radio is his constant companion, crackling with static, country music, and the voices of fellow truckers sharing gossip, warnings, and the occasional tall tale.

The "Diner of the Lost Souls," where our story begins, is a microcosm of this world. It's a place where weary travelers find solace in greasy comfort food and fleeting conversations. The Formica countertops are stained with countless spills, the air is thick with the aroma of frying bacon and stale coffee, and the waitresses, with their world-weary smiles and quick wit, are like family to those who call the road home. It's a place where anonymity is both a blessing and a curse, where secrets are shared and stories are spun under the watchful gaze of the fluorescent lights.
