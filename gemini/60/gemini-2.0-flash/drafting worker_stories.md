Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the bustling, slightly claustrophobic, office of "Precision Blueprints & Design," located on the third floor of a brick building in the older industrial section of Baltimore. The air is thick with the scent of ammonia from the blueprint machine, mixed with the faint, lingering aroma of yesterday's cheap coffee and the metallic tang of machinery. Natural light struggles to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, leaving most of the office reliant on harsh fluorescent bulbs that hum incessantly. Rows of drafting tables, each littered with technical drawings, pencils, erasers, and half-empty coffee mugs, dominate the space. The walls are adorned with framed blueprints of past projects – bridges, warehouses, and the occasional surprisingly elegant staircase. A rhythmic clatter emanates from the blueprint machine in the corner, occasionally punctuated by the sharper clang of a dropped tool or a frustrated sigh.

**Opening:**

The clock on the wall, perpetually five minutes slow, ticked over to 8:02 AM. **Eleanor Beatrice Griffiths** sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear with the back of a charcoal-stained hand. The blueprints for the new loading dock at the Camden Yards warehouse blurred slightly before her eyes. Another all-nighter. Not unusual, but exceptionally unwelcome this Tuesday. She’d been chasing down phantom dimensions for the better part of fourteen hours.

The blueprint felt like a prison, a sprawling maze of perfect lines and meticulous measurements that held her captive. Eleanor glanced at the window, where a sliver of pale dawn was just beginning to color the sky. Another day, another fight against the impossible. Another day, another blueprint. But a sense of unease simmered beneath the surface, a feeling that this blueprint, more than any other, held a secret, a truth she wasn't quite ready to face. It felt... wrong. And Eleanor Beatrice Griffiths, drafting worker extraordinaire, trusted her instincts above all else.
