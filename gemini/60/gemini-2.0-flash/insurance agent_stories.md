## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the Claims Processing Center hummed a discordant tune, a lullaby for the eternally caffeinated. Mortimer Pruitt, a name that sounded more like a stuffy Victorian lawyer than a mid-level insurance agent, squinted at the claim form in front of him. "Claimant reports," he muttered, his voice a weary drone, "'Act of God.' Well, God's getting litigious these days, isn't he?"

Outside, the Kansas wind, as persistent and unwelcome as a telemarketer, rattled the windows. It was the kind of day that made you yearn for the quiet resignation of a Tuesday afternoon meeting. Mortimer, however, knew there was no escape. He had at least a dozen more 'Acts of God' to decipher – a suspiciously large number of fallen trees, flooded basements, and rogue hailstorms peppering his current caseload. He sighed, the sound a deflated balloon of despair. He wasn't built for this. He’d much rather be tinkering with his antique telescope, lost in the silent majesty of the cosmos, than sifting through the wreckage of earthly mishaps. But needs must. Mortgages didn’t pay themselves, and neither did his surprisingly voracious stamp collection.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the blandly-functional Claims Processing Center of Great Plains Insurance in Wichita, Kansas. The building is a low, single-story brick structure, indistinguishable from the other corporate buildings that line the highway heading out of town. Inside, the decor is a symphony of beige: beige walls, beige carpeting, beige cubicles, all punctuated by the intermittent flash of computer screens. Rows upon rows of desks stretch into the distance, each occupied by an insurance agent wrestling with paperwork and the slow death of their dreams. The air is thick with the scent of stale coffee, recycled air, and the faint, lingering aroma of disappointment. The center is perpetually busy, a chaotic hive buzzing with the anxieties of homeowners, the frustrations of agents, and the quiet hum of a system designed to minimize payouts. It's a place where hope goes to die, one meticulously scrutinized claim at a time.
