Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a roofer named Arthur Reginald Finch:

**Opening:**

The August sun was a blowtorch aimed directly at Arthur Reginald Finch's neck. He squinted, wiped a bead of sweat that threatened to sting his eye, and adjusted the worn leather of his work gloves. The rhythmic thwack of his hammer, usually a comforting soundtrack to his day, felt more like a desperate drumbeat against the impending heatstroke. Arthur wasn't a man to complain, not aloud anyway. He knew the risks that came with his trade. But the shingles felt like they were actively melting to his calloused fingers, and the air shimmered with a heat that seemed to solidify the very molecules he was trying to breathe. "Just a few more rows," he muttered, his voice raspy against the relentless sizzle of the day. He leaned forward, the weight of his tool belt pulling at his hips, and fixed another shingle with a practiced hand. Beneath him, the world hummed, oblivious to the torment happening thirty feet in the air.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the small, quiet town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Havenwood is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else, and the local diner serves as both a culinary and social hub. Arthur, a lifelong resident, is currently working on the roof of the old Carmichael house, a two-story Victorian with gingerbread trim and a sprawling porch. The house sits on Maple Street, a residential road lined with mature oak trees that offer little solace on this particularly scorching afternoon. The Carmichael house has seen better days; peeling paint clings to the clapboard siding, and the overgrown garden is a testament to years of neglect. The house, much like the town itself, holds onto a faded grandeur, a whisper of a more prosperous past.
