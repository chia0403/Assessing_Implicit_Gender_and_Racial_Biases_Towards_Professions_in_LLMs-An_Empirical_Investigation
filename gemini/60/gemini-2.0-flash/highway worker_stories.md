Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Margaret Eleanor Hayes:

**Setting:**

The sun beat down on Interstate 80, ten miles east of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The asphalt shimmered, distorting the horizon into a heat-soaked mirage. Sagebrush clung tenaciously to the dusty shoulder, offering little respite from the oppressive heat. The air hung thick with the smell of exhaust, hot tar, and the faint, metallic tang of distant wildfires. This stretch of highway, a concrete ribbon slicing through the high plains, was Margaret Hayes' office for the day.

**Opening:**

Margaret Eleanor Hayes squinted, pushing a strand of sun-bleached brown hair from her forehead with the back of her gloved hand. The safety glasses dug into the bridge of her nose, leaving a faint red mark, but she dared not adjust them. A semi-truck, a behemoth hauling what looked like oversized pipes, roared past, its wake buffeting her and sending a plume of dust swirling around her bright orange safety vest. “Slow down, you maniac,” she muttered, though the sound was swallowed by the engine's thunder. Today's job: patching potholes on the westbound lane. A thankless, back-breaking task, but someone had to do it. And Margaret, with her calloused hands and unwavering sense of duty, was just the person. She adjusted the handle of her shovel, feeling the familiar weight settle in her palm. This wasn't just about filling holes; it was about keeping people safe, connecting them to their lives, one scoop of asphalt at a time. But today, something felt different. A subtle hum in the air, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.
