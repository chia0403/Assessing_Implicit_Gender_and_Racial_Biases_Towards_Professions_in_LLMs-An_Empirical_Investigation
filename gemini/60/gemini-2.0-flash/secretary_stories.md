## The Story Opening:

The insistent buzz of the intercom cut through the rhythmic tapping of Penelope Ainsworth's acrylic nails against her chipped ceramic mug. She sighed, a wisp of discontent curling through her meticulously applied lipstick. "Yes, Mr. Hargrave?" she chirped, injecting a practiced perkiness into her voice.

"Penelope, darling, get in here. Now. And bring that memo on the Henderson merger. The one I asked for… two days ago?" The voice, thick with impatience, grated on her nerves like nails on a chalkboard.

Penelope clenched her jaw. Two days ago? He'd asked for it a week ago, and she'd delivered it three days ago. He just hadn't bothered to *read* it.

"Coming, Mr. Hargrave," she replied, carefully placing her mug, filled with lukewarm, overly-milked tea, on its coaster. She straightened her perpetually-falling pencil skirt, smoothed down her sensible cardigan, and prepared herself for another round of Hargrave's blustering idiocy.

## The Setting:

The setting is the sterile, yet somehow still suffocating, offices of "Hargrave & Associates," a mid-sized, family-run (and run into the ground, if Penelope had anything to say about it) investment firm nestled in the heart of London's financial district.

Penelope's desk, a cramped island in a sea of beige cubicles, is located just outside Mr. Hargrave's imposing oak door. It's a testament to her organizational skills – files are stacked with military precision, the pen holder perfectly aligned with the computer monitor, and a single, slightly wilting, potted fern clinging precariously to life in the corner. The air is thick with the stale scent of printer ink and old ambition.

The overall aesthetic of the office is one of outdated grandeur trying desperately to keep up with the times. Old oil paintings of dour-faced Hargrave ancestors hang beside motivational posters that scream about synergy and thinking outside the box. It's a place where tradition and innovation clash, with tradition usually winning, much to Penelope's frustration. She dreams of vibrant colors, ergonomic furniture, and, most of all, a boss who could remember what he ate for breakfast, let alone a simple memo.
