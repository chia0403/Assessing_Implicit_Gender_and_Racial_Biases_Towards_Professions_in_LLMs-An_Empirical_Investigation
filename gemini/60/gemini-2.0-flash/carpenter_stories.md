## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of cedar and sawdust was as familiar to Elias Thorne as the beat of his own heart. He inhaled deeply, the scent clinging to the damp, salty air that snuck in through the cracks of his workshop door. He’d been wrestling with this piece of driftwood for nearly three days, coaxing a shape from its gnarly, wave-battered form. Elias ran a calloused thumb along the jagged edge, feeling the ghost of the sea’s fury still clinging to the wood. He saw something in it, a fleeting glimpse of a mermaid's tail, but the stubborn grain was resisting his efforts. Today, he decided, he'd break the wood's will, or break his own trying. He sharpened his chisel with a practiced flick of the wrist, the steel gleaming dully in the weak morning light, a glint of determination mirroring in his eyes.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in a small, windswept fishing village called Port Blossom, clinging to the rugged coast of Northern California. Elias Thorne's workshop is a ramshackle, one-room building perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the harbor. The exterior is weathered and gray, the wood bleached by the relentless sun and salt spray. Inside, it's a haven of organized chaos: tools hang neatly on the walls, organized by size and purpose, while piles of wood scraps and half-finished projects litter every available surface. Sunlight filters through the dusty windows, illuminating floating motes of sawdust in the air. The constant soundtrack is the crash of waves against the cliffs below and the occasional squawk of seagulls overhead. The air is thick with the smell of wood, salt, and the faint, lingering scent of fish from the nearby docks.
