## Story Opening:

The scent of burnt coffee and despair clung to Dr. Alistair Leopold Finch like a persistent ghost. He winced, adjusting the thermostat in his cramped office. February in Chicago was a cruel mistress, and the draft whistling through the ancient windowpane mocked his attempts at warmth. Across his cluttered desk, Sarah Jenkins, his next appointment, sat hunched, her eyes red-rimmed and vacant. Alistair took a deep breath, mentally bracing himself. He could see the question lurking in her gaze, the desperate plea for answers he wasn't sure he could provide. He straightened his tie, a nervous habit, and offered a small, professional smile.

"So, Sarah," he began, his voice calm and measured, "tell me again about the dreams."

## Setting:

**Dr. Alistair Leopold Finch's Office, Chicago, Illinois.**

The office occupied a small corner suite on the fifth floor of a pre-war building in the River North neighborhood. The walls, painted a drab, institutional beige, were crowded with framed diplomas, certifications, and a faded photograph of Alistair hiking in the Scottish Highlands - a reminder of a life before the darkness of his profession had taken hold. Bookshelves overflowed with texts on abnormal psychology, criminal profiling, and the intricacies of the human mind. A worn, leather armchair sat opposite Alistair's imposing mahogany desk, scarred with the rings of countless coffee cups and littered with case files, handwritten notes, and half-eaten granola bars. The only source of natural light came from the aforementioned drafty window, overlooking a grimy alleyway where pigeons cooed incessantly. The overall impression was one of comforting clutter, a space that reflected the organized chaos of Alistair's own mind, a sanctuary carved out in the heart of the city's concrete jungle, a place where the broken came to be understood, if not always healed.
