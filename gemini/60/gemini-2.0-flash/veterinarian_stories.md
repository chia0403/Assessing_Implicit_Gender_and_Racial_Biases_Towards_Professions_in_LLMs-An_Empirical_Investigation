The biting wind, smelling of pine needles and snow, whipped around Dr. Eleanor “Ellie” Ainsworth as she wrestled with the gate of the Elk Ridge Rescue Center. Her breath plumed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the faded sign depicting a cartoonish, perpetually startled-looking elk. Ellie’s fingers, already numb despite her thick gloves, fumbled with the stubborn latch. Damn mountain winters. Damn stubborn elk, too, for that matter. She knew, with a certainty that only twenty years of veterinary practice in the rugged Montana wilderness could provide, that the call from Hank, the Center’s gruff but devoted manager, meant nothing good. "Ellie," he’d said, his voice crackling over the poor cell reception, "got a problem with Freya. You gotta get up here."

The Elk Ridge Rescue Center, nestled deep in the Gallatin National Forest, was less a state-of-the-art facility and more a collection of repurposed barns and sheds held together by sheer grit and Hank’s unwavering belief in the power of rehabilitation. They took in injured and orphaned wildlife – deer, bears, mountain lions, even the occasional wayward moose – patched them up, and, when possible, released them back into the wild. It was a noble, often heartbreaking, undertaking, and Ellie had been their consulting vet for years. She knew every rut, every fence post, every peculiar quirk of the Center's animal residents. But Freya, a particularly majestic female elk with a penchant for escaping her enclosure, was different. She was…challenging. And Ellie had a sinking feeling that Freya’s challenge had just escalated.
