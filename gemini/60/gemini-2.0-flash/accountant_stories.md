The fluorescent lights of Dreary & Diligent Accountants hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack that perfectly mirrored the state of Theodore Frederick Hawthorne's soul. It was Tuesday, 2:17 PM, and Theodore was staring, not for the first time that hour, at a spreadsheet so dense with numbers it resembled a pixelated battlefield. Rain lashed against the office window, a melancholic percussion accompanying the hum. He sighed, a puff of stale air that momentarily disturbed the dust motes dancing in the single ray of sunlight that dared to penetrate the gloom.

The setting was the eighth floor of the Grimshaw Building, a concrete behemoth that dominated the less fashionable end of Willow Creek. Dreary & Diligent occupied a sizable portion of the floor, a warren of beige cubicles, overflowing in-trays, and the perpetual aroma of burnt coffee. Theodore's own cubicle, number 807, was strategically located near the fire exit, a small consolation prize for enduring his perpetually-loud, gum-chewing supervisor, Ms. Belinda Bingley, whose nasal voice could shatter glass at fifty paces. A framed picture of his cat, Mittens, clung precariously to the fabric-covered wall, a tiny splash of normalcy in a world of debits, credits, and the looming specter of tax season.
