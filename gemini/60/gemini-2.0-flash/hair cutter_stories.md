Okay, here's a story opening with a hair cutter named Bartholomew "Bart" Finch:

**Story Opening:**

The humid air hung thick as cotton candy outside Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's small barber shop, "The Close Shave," clinging to the plate glass window and blurring the neon sign that sputtered a weary green. Inside, the air was only marginally better, thick with the comforting scent of lavender aftershave, stale coffee, and the faint, metallic tang of freshly oiled clippers. Bart sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of rogue foam. He squinted at the chipped porcelain clock hanging above the antique cash register. Ten minutes past opening, and still no customers. In Harmony Creek, Alabama, that was a bad omen.

Mornings were usually busy. Farmers coming in for a quick trim before heading to the fields, retirees looking for a friendly chat and a tidy comb-over, even the occasional teenager wanting a trendy fade that Bart usually butchered despite his best intentions. But today, only the buzzing of the fluorescent lights kept him company. He picked up his well-worn copy of "Moby Dick," open to a page he'd read at least a dozen times, and resigned himself to another slow start. He just hoped the power didn't go out again. Last time, Mrs. Higgins had ended up looking like a dandelion gone to seed.

**Setting:**

**Location:** Harmony Creek, Alabama. A small, rural town nestled amongst rolling green hills and pecan orchards. The pace of life is slow, and everyone knows everyone else's business.

**Specific Setting:** "The Close Shave" barber shop. A single-room establishment located on Main Street, between the Harmony Creek Hardware store and the post office. It's a classic, old-fashioned barber shop, complete with two red leather barber chairs, a mirrored wall lined with vintage shaving mugs, a worn checkerboard floor, and a rotating barber pole outside. The shop is a little worn around the edges, reflecting Bart's own struggles to keep it afloat, but it’s clean and well-maintained. A radio perpetually plays country music at a low volume. Framed photographs of past Harmony Creek graduating classes adorn one wall, a testament to the shop’s long history in the community.
