The wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the ancient windows of Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's office at Dunraven University. Outside, the October storm raged, tearing leaves from skeletal branches and whipping the rain against the leaded glass. Inside, a fragile sanctuary of flickering lamplight and the comforting aroma of aged paper and Earl Grey, Eleanor huddled deeper into her worn tweed jacket. The fire in the hearth crackled merrily, a small defiance against the encroaching chill.

Her office, a chaotic reflection of her brilliant and somewhat scattered mind, was crammed with overflowing bookshelves, precariously stacked research papers, and artifacts collected from her years spent excavating forgotten Roman settlements. A half-unpacked box overflowing with pottery shards sat forlornly in a corner, a reminder of her recent, albeit truncated, trip to Italy. A Roman bust, its nose missing from centuries of neglect, gazed down from the mantle with a silent, knowing air. Eleanor, Professor of Ancient History and Archeology, had always felt more at home amongst the relics of the past than the anxieties of the present. But tonight, even the ghosts of Emperors and legionaries offered little comfort. The storm outside seemed to echo the turbulent unease brewing within her, an unease sparked by the cryptic message she'd received just hours before: "Beware the Ides, Professor. They are upon you."
