The buzzing of the drill, a high-pitched whine that could curdle milk at fifty paces, was a familiar symphony to Dr. Alistair Reginald Peabody. He hummed along, off-key as always, a counterpoint to the whirring metal. Outside, the San Francisco fog clung to the windows of his practice, obscuring the view of Lombard Street’s absurdly winding curves. Inside, however, all was pristine and brightly lit.

His office, Peabody Dental Arts, was a study in minimalist chic. Polished concrete floors reflected the stark white walls, punctuated only by strategically placed succulents and a single, oversized abstract painting that his ex-wife, Penelope, had insisted was “a profound statement on the existential dread of modern dentistry.” Alistair personally thought it looked like a splattered Rorschach test.

He leaned closer to his patient, Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose teeth were a testament to a lifelong love affair with licorice and a decided aversion to flossing. “Just a little bit more, Mrs. Higgins,” he said, his voice muffled by his mask. “Almost ready for a sparkling new filling.” He suctioned away the saliva, the taste of minty disinfectant clinging to the air. This was his domain, the battlefield where he waged war against plaque and decay, the kingdom where Alistair Reginald Peabody reigned supreme, the king of pearly whites in a city perpetually shrouded in gray.
