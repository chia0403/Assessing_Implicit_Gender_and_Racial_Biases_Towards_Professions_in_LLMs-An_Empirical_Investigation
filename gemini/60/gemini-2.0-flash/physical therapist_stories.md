**Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic and burnt coffee clung to the air in the PT clinic, a familiar comfort to Abigail "Abi" Rosewood. She adjusted the strap of her wrist brace, the small twinge of discomfort a constant reminder of the long hours she poured into helping others heal. Today, however, the air felt thicker, laced with a tension that went beyond the usual aches and pains of her patients. The reason stood by the window, a silhouette against the muted grey of a Seattle morning, clutching a worn duffel bag. He was new, scheduled for an evaluation, but something about the way he held himself – a guarded stillness – made Abi’s professional instincts hum with a low, apprehensive thrum.

**Setting:**

The Evergreen Physical Therapy clinic occupies a small, unassuming space in a converted brick building in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Sunlight, when it deigns to appear through the perpetual cloud cover, filters through large windows overlooking a bustling street of coffee shops and boutiques. Inside, the clinic is painted in calming shades of blue and green, attempting to create a serene atmosphere to contrast the often intense physical work happening within.

There are three private treatment rooms, each equipped with an adjustable plinth, therapeutic modalities like ultrasound and electrical stimulation units, and various exercise bands and weights. The main area is a larger, open space where patients can perform their exercises under the watchful eye of the therapists. Here, you'll find everything from balance boards and foam rollers to a stationary bike and a treadmill.

A small, cluttered office at the back houses the administrative staff, while a perpetually overflowing coffee station sits just outside the office door, fueling the therapists through their demanding days. Overall, Evergreen Physical Therapy aims to be a welcoming and effective space, a place where patients can find not only physical healing but also encouragement and support.
