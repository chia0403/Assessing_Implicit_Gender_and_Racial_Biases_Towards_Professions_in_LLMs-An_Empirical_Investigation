The wrench slipped, skinning Thomas Michael Riley's knuckles on the corroded undercarriage of the '67 Mustang. He cursed under his breath, a soft, gravelly sound that was more a habit than genuine anger. Sunlight, thick and hazy with exhaust fumes, beat down on the corrugated iron roof of Riley's Auto Repair, turning the interior into a sweltering oven. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light slicing through the open bay doors, illuminating the organized chaos that was his kingdom.

Riley's Auto Repair wasn't much to look at: a squat, cinderblock building painted a faded robin's egg blue, perched on the edge of Highway 61, a lonely stretch of blacktop that snaked through the Mississippi Delta. The yard was a graveyard of forgotten dreams â€“ rusting pickup trucks missing wheels, sedans with caved-in roofs, and the occasional vintage muscle car, all slowly being reclaimed by the kudzu that threatened to engulf the entire place. But for Thomas Riley, it was home, a sanctuary where the scent of gasoline and motor oil was sweeter than perfume and the roar of a finely tuned engine was more melodious than any symphony. He wiped the grease from his forehead with a greasy rag, leaving a dark smudge on his already grimy skin. Today, the heat was particularly brutal, but damn it, he was going to get that Mustang purring like a kitten, even if it killed him.
