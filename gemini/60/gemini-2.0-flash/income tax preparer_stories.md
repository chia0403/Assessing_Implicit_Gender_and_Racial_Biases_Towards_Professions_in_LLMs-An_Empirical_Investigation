## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Solutions & More" office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack perfectly calibrated to induce existential dread. Outside, April drizzled a melancholic grey over Pittsburgh, but inside, the dread was self-inflicted. It emanated from the towering stacks of manila folders threatening to topple over onto the desk of Abigail Mae Harrington, income tax preparer extraordinaire (or, more accurately, income tax preparer struggling to stay afloat in a sea of deductions and depreciation).

Abigail slumped back in her ergonomic chair, the mesh digging uncomfortably into her lower back. She’d been hunched over Schedule C forms for the better part of ten hours, battling the arcane logic of a self-proclaimed "artisan pickle purveyor" whose expenses included “Emotional Support Cucumbers.” She rubbed her tired eyes, the faint scent of industrial-strength coffee clinging to her fingertips. Three days until the dreaded April 15th deadline. Three days to save middle-class America from the wrath of the IRS. Three days...and a sudden, jarring ringtone ripped through the oppressive quiet. Abigail groaned. Not another desperate client begging for an extension.

## Setting:

The year is 2024. "Tax Solutions & More" is a small, independent tax preparation business located on the second floor of a brick building in a slightly rundown, but slowly gentrifying neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The office is cramped and functional, decorated in shades of beige that scream "trustworthiness" but ultimately contribute to a feeling of sterile boredom. Three cubicles house the preparers, each overflowing with paperwork, calculators, and half-eaten snacks. Abigail's cubicle, closest to the window overlooking a perpetually construction-riddled street, is identifiable by the small, framed photograph of her scruffy terrier mix, Winston, and the strategically placed stress ball shaped like a smiling dollar sign. The air smells faintly of toner, stale coffee, and the quiet desperation of those facing the financial complexities of the modern world. Beyond the cubicles, a small waiting area features uncomfortable plastic chairs, a stack of outdated magazines, and a flickering television eternally tuned to the financial news channel. The building itself is old, with creaky floorboards and drafty windows, a subtle reminder that even in the digital age, some things, like the annual tax season scramble, never truly change.
