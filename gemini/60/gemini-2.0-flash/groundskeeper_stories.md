## Story Opening:

The morning dew clung to the meticulously trimmed blades of the putting green like tiny diamonds, reflecting the weak, grey light that filtered through the ancient oak trees. Edgar P. Thornton, Grounds Keeper Emeritus (as he sometimes jokingly referred to himself), sighed, the puff of condensation disappearing into the chilly air. He ran a hand, calloused and stained with years of soil and grass clippings, over the impeccably smooth surface. Something was amiss. Not visibly, not yet. But Edgar, with his sixty-seven years spent nurturing and coddling this hallowed ground, could feel it in his bones. A subtle vibration, a whisper of discordance in the perfect harmony heâ€™d dedicated his life to creating. He straightened, pulling his tweed cap tighter against the wind, the familiar weight of his pruning shears a comforting presence at his belt. Whatever it was, it was out there, hidden amongst the whispering pines and the carefully crafted sand traps of the esteemed Blackwood Golf & Country Club. And it was up to Edgar to find it.

## Setting:

**The Blackwood Golf & Country Club:** Nestled in the rolling hills of Vermont, Blackwood is an old-money haven, a place where tradition and exclusivity reign supreme. The course itself is a masterpiece of landscape architecture, designed in the early 1900s by a famed Scottish architect and meticulously maintained ever since. Towering pines and ancient oaks line the fairways, their gnarled branches reaching towards the sky like arthritic fingers. The manicured greens are legendary for their speed and treacherous slopes, a constant source of frustration and admiration for even the most seasoned golfers. The clubhouse, a stately stone building with ivy climbing its walls, exudes an air of quiet wealth and understated elegance. It is a place where history and reputation matter above all else, a place where Edgar P. Thornton has quietly observed the foibles and triumphs of the elite for decades.
