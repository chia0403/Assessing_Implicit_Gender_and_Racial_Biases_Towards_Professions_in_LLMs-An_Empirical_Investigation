Okay, hereâ€™s a story opening, complete with the setting and the logger character:

**Opening:**

The saw snarled, biting deep into the redwood's heart.  Elias "Eli" Tanner wrestled with the shuddering machine, the scent of fresh-cut wood, rich and spicy, filling his lungs.  Each tooth that tore through the aged trunk sent vibrations through his bones, a primal thrum that mirrored the relentless pulse of the forest.  He squinted against the shower of sawdust, his face, already lined with the deep etchings of sun and wind, streaked with golden grit.  The giant started to groan, a slow, agonizing lament that echoed through the canyons. He knew what was coming.  The tipping, the fall, the thunderous crash.  This was the part of the job that never got easier, no matter how many trees he'd felled. This one felt particularly wrong.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the rugged, isolated Redwood National and State Parks, located on the northern coast of California, circa 1978. The area is a tapestry of towering ancient redwood forests, fog-drenched coastline, and rushing rivers that carve their way through the mountainous terrain.  Small logging towns, once booming hubs, are now struggling to survive as conservation efforts and environmental concerns begin to challenge the established industry. The air is often thick with mist, creating an ethereal and often melancholic atmosphere.  Lumber camps, scattered deep within the woods, offer a spartan existence for the men who work the forests, a life of hard labor and close camaraderie, often tinged with a deep sense of both respect and exploitation of the natural world around them. Eli is working in a particularly remote section of the park, near the border of what would eventually become designated wilderness, a place that feels both untouched and threatened.
