The fluorescent lights of the Willow Creek County Hospital Emergency Room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the ceaseless churn of human suffering. It was 3:17 AM on a Tuesday, and the air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic, stale coffee, and the unspoken anxieties of patients and staff alike. Outside, a relentless drizzle hammered against the reinforced windows, mirroring the drumming pressure behind the eyes of Eleanor Grace Riley, Registered Nurse, as she scanned the triage board. A car accident, a possible stroke, a little boy with a fever spiking dangerously - just another night at Willow Creek.
