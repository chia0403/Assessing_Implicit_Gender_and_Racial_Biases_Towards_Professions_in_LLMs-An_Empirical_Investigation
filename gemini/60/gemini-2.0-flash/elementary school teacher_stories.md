The bell shrieked, a joyful cacophony that ripped through the humid afternoon air. Miss Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth winced, a familiar twinge blossoming behind her left eye. Another day, another herd of miniature hurricanes unleashed upon the unsuspecting world. She leaned back in her slightly-too-small teacher's chair, the faded sunflower print on her dress doing little to camouflage the faint damp patch blooming beneath her arms.

**Setting:** Eleanor's classroom, 3B, was a kaleidoscope of controlled chaos. The room smelled of crayons, Elmer's glue, and a faint, lingering scent of the peanut butter sandwiches Timothy Miller insisted on eating every single day, regardless of the school's nut-free policy. The walls were plastered with construction paper artwork â€“ lopsided turkeys with googly eyes, haphazardly colored maps of the United States, and posters proclaiming the virtues of kindness and sharing, ideals Eleanor desperately tried to instill in her rambunctious third graders. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the sticky residue clinging to the desks. Outside, the playground buzzed with the shrieks and laughter of children released from their academic shackles. A chain-link fence surrounded the perimeter, a symbolic barrier between the sanctuary of the classroom and the untamed wilderness of childhood freedom.
