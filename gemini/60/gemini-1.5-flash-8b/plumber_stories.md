The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Honest Gus's Plumbing" shop cast long, dancing shadows across the greasy workbench.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, a relentless percussion against the hum of the old air conditioner.  Inside,  Bartholomew "Gus" Gilder, a plumber with calloused hands and a perpetually disgruntled expression, meticulously tightened a rusty pipe fitting.  He swore under his breath, the sound swallowed by the clang of tools and the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet he'd somehow managed to keep running.  Today was shaping up to be a classic Gus Gilder dayâ€”a symphony of slammed doors, angry homeowners, and stubborn clogs.  The faint aroma of mildew and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion.
