Professor Eleanor Vance, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the fine, grey particles of forgotten theories and decades of lecture halls, stared out the rain-streaked window of her cluttered study.  The scent of mildew, a familiar companion, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee and the ever-present, almost comforting, smell of aged paper.  Outside, the November drizzle hammered against the ancient brick facade of the university, mirroring the relentless rhythm of thoughts churning in her mind.  Her study, tucked away on the third floor of the sprawling, ivy-covered academic building, was a testament to a life dedicated to deciphering the language of the universe, a language that seemed increasingly elusive. Books, overflowing onto every surface, lined the walls, their spines whispering tales of forgotten galaxies and undiscovered truths.  A half-eaten bowl of muesli sat forlornly on the desk, a silent witness to her many hours lost in contemplation.  The relentless drumming of the rain, the quiet symphony of the university, the whispering voices of the past... all contributed to a profound sense of disquiet.  This particular afternoon, the disquiet felt more acute than usual.
