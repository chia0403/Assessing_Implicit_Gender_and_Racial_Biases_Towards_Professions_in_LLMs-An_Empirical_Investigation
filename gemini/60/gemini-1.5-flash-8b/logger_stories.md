The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, clawed at the exposed skin of Elias Thorne, a logger whose calloused fingers had known the caress of rough-hewn timber for longer than he could remember.  The year was 1898, and the sun, a pale disc stubbornly refusing to pierce the swirling grey clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast, snow-dusted expanse of the Yukon Territory.  Elias, hunched against the elements beneath a threadbare caribou skin, watched the spindly pines that lined the frozen riverbank, their branches laden with the weight of the impending winter.  He knew, with the certainty of a seasoned man who'd seen countless winters come and go, that this one promised to be particularly brutal.  The crisp air, thick with the scent of pine needles and the ever-present tang of impending snow, held the promise of work, of struggle, and of a harsh, unforgiving beauty.  His axe, a familiar companion, rested beside him, its polished steel reflecting the muted light, a silent promise of the labor to come.  The only other sounds were the rhythmic crunch of the ice beneath his boots and the mournful howl of a lone wolf echoing across the desolate landscape.  This, this was the Yukon, a wilderness that held its breath and watched him, a constant and chilling observer.
