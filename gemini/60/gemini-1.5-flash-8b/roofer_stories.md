The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's exposed skin, stinging his cheeks and rattling the flimsy plastic sheeting he'd draped over the gaping hole in the roof.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the rhythmic thump of the hammering echoing the frantic beat of his own heart.  Above him, the grey sky, bruised with the remnants of a recent storm, threatened another onslaught.  Below him, the sprawling Victorian neighborhood of Oakhaven whispered secrets in the wind, secrets only the old houses seemed to hold.  Each chimney, each dormer window, each meticulously crafted gable, a testament to a time long past, a time when a roofer like Elias might have been celebrated, rather than just tolerated.

**Setting:** Oakhaven, a charming but somewhat dilapidated Victorian neighborhood on the outskirts of a rapidly expanding city.  Tall, imposing houses with intricate detailing, some meticulously maintained, others showing the wear of time, stood shoulder to shoulder, surrounded by ancient trees that clawed at the sky and whispered stories in the wind.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint sweetness of decaying flowers.  The neighborhood's quiet beauty was in stark contrast to the bustling, modern city that pressed against its edges.
