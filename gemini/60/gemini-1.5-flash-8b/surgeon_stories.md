The sterile hum of the operating room, a symphony of beeps and whirs, was almost a comfort to Dr. Eleanor Vance.  The rhythmic click of her scalpel against bone resonated with a familiar, almost comforting, rhythm.  But tonight, the familiar wasn't quite enough.  Tonight, the air thrummed with a tension that had nothing to do with the precise choreography of a complex craniotomy.  Tonight, it felt as if the very walls of the operating room were holding their breath.

The setting:  Dr. Vance's usual stomping grounds â€“ the neuro-surgery wing of the sprawling, grey-stone St. Jude's Hospital in the heart of the sprawling, industrial city of Zenith.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight filtering through the grimy window overlooking the towering chimneys of the factory district. Outside, the city was a tapestry of flickering neon signs and hushed whispers of late-night activity.  Inside, the sterile white of the operating theater was punctuated by the urgent, almost frantic, energy of the team.  Each member moved with focused precision, a silent ballet of skill and urgency.  But beneath the surface, the tension hung heavy, thick as the antiseptic fog that clung to the instruments.
