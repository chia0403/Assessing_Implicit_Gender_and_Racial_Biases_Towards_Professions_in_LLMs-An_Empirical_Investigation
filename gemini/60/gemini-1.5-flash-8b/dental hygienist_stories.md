The fluorescent hum of the clinic, a relentless, buzzing counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia "Amy"  Parkinson's gloved hands, filled the small waiting room.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy cityscape outside, painted the room in muted hues of grey and beige.  A chipped ceramic mug sat abandoned on a table, its faded floral design a lonely testament to a forgotten coffee break.  Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously polished a patient's teeth, the rhythmic grinding of the polishing wheel a lullaby of sorts in the sterile, slightly antiseptic atmosphere.  Today, however, the lullaby was interrupted by something… different.  A whisper of something unsettling, something more than the usual clatter of metal on enamel.

The setting:  A bustling, yet worn, dental clinic on the corner of Elm Street and Pine Avenue in the rapidly gentrifying, but still somewhat gritty, district of Southbridge, Chicago.  The waiting room, with its outdated decor and faded posters promoting dental health, felt both familiar and slightly menacing, a place where the silent anxieties of busy lives pooled and settled.  The clinic's walls held faint, faded graffiti – evidence of a youthful rebellion, now obscured by years of antiseptic cleansings.  Amy, 28, her long, dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, focused intently on her work.  But a small knot of unease had begun to form in her stomach, a feeling akin to a premonition.  This particular patient felt different.  Different and...silent.
