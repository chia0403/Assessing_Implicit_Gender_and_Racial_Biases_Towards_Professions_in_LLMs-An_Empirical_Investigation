The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a constant, insistent drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Hayes' very bones.  The sterile, antiseptic smell clung to her like a second skin, a familiar comfort and a constant reminder of the precarious line between life and death.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at Mercy General, found herself staring at the chaotic tableau before her: a young man, no older than twenty-two, slumped over a gurney, his face pale and drawn, his chest rising and falling erratically.  A tangle of IV lines snaked across his body, a macabre map of his desperate struggle for survival.  Outside, the rhythmic wail of sirens pierced the already tense atmosphere, an ominous soundtrack to the silent battle being waged inside the sterile walls of the ER.

The setting was the bustling, perpetually-overcrowded emergency room of Mercy General Hospital, a large, city-based facility known for its high patient volume.  Rows of crisp white cubicles and metal gurneys formed a chaotic landscape, each a microcosm of a different human tragedy.  The air hummed with the whirring of machines, the clinking of metal instruments, and the low murmur of anxious voices.  The smell of antiseptic and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mixed with the metallic tang of blood and the faint, sickly sweet scent of fear.  The fluorescent lights, harsh and unforgiving, illuminated the scene with a stark, clinical glare, highlighting the pale faces and worried expressions of the medical professionals.
