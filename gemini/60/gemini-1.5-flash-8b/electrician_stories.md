The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned warehouse hummed a discordant tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia Petrova's screwdriver against the corroded metal conduit.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows, illuminating a maze of tangled wires and rusted machinery.  This wasn't the gleaming, well-lit workshop of her father, the proud, meticulous electrician she'd grown up admiring. This was...something else. Something salvaged from the decay. Something dangerous.

Amelia, a woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands calloused from years of grappling with unruly currents, swore under her breath.  Another short circuit.  The warehouse, once a bustling factory, now lay silent and brooding, its skeletal remains whispering tales of forgotten production lines and lost dreams.  Broken windows stared blankly at the grey, overcast sky, and the faint scent of mildew hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of burnt insulation.  It was a space that seemed to swallow the sound of her footsteps, and the only company she had were the ghosts of machinery long since abandoned.  The year was 1948.
