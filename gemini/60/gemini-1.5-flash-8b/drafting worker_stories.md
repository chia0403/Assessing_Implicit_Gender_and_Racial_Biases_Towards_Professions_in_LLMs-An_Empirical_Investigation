The flickering fluorescent lights of the sprawling factory hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale rays, illuminating the precise, almost surgical, movements of his hands as he meticulously traced lines onto a sheet of gleaming blueprint paper.  The air, thick with the smell of machine oil and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy in the cavernous workshop.  Rows upon rows of identical drafting tables stretched as far as the eye could see, each occupied by a figure hunched over their own paper, their own silent symphony of drawing and measuring.  Elias, at 27, felt the familiar weight of the job pressing down on him, the same relentless rhythm of lines and angles that had defined his working life for the past five years. He was a drafting worker, a cog in the intricate machine of a massive aerospace firm, a vital but ultimately anonymous part of a process he often felt detached from. The blueprints themselves, precise renderings of complex aerospace parts, held an allure that felt distant and almost mystical, while the work felt repetitive and, at times, pointless.  This particular morning, however, a line on a component called the "Aetherium Stabilizer" felt different.  A subtle, almost imperceptible tremor, had occurred in its theoretical form.
