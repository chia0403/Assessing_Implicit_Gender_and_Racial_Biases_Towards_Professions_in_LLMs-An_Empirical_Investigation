Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Anya Petrova's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy in the small, overcrowded emergency room.  Outside, the storm raged, a chaotic mirror image of the turmoil swirling inside her.  Anya, Emergency Medical Care Technician,  felt the weight of the night pressing down on her, a palpable presence in the sterile fluorescent glow.  The clinic, nestled in the heart of the impoverished, storm-ravaged town of Oakhaven, was a microcosm of the surrounding devastation â€“ battered and bruised, yet stubbornly holding on.  Tonight, holding on felt impossible.  The incessant rain blurred the already smeared windowpanes, the blurred reflections mirroring the blurry thoughts racing in her head.
