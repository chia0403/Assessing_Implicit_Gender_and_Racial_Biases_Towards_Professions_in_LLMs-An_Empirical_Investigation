The chill of November snaked through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of "The Cleaver's Cut," a butcher shop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the shadowed heart of Greyhaven.  Rain, relentless and grey, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic clang of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's cleaver against bone.  Barty, a man whose hands, weathered and stained crimson, spoke of a lifetime spent amongst the raw, visceral beauty of meat, hunched over a slab of glistening, ruby-red beef.  A single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows on the greasy worktops, illuminating the glistening array of cutsâ€”a testament to Barty's artistry and the bounty of the local farms.  The shop itself was a cathedral of cold steel and fragrant blood, a stark contrast to the biting wind howling outside.  The air hummed with the low thrum of the city, a distant and muffled roar, and the faint, sweet aroma of roasted chestnuts drifted in through the cracked windowpane, a ghostly reminder of the bustling market square beyond.
