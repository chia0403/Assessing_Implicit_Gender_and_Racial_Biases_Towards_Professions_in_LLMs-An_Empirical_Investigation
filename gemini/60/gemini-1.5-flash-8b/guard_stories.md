The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of the Old Quarter, stinging Elara Vance's cheeks and rattling the iron bars of the city gate.  Dust, stirred up by unseen hooves, danced in the pale morning light filtering through the skeletal arches.  The scent of brine, carried on the wind from the churning harbor, mingled with the acrid tang of woodsmoke rising from the city's myriad chimneys.  Elara, a Royal Guard, shivered, pulling her worn leather jerkin tighter against the chill.  This was not the ideal start to a Tuesday.  Another day, another patrol of the vulnerable eastern gate, another potential breach for the encroaching whispers of unrest.  The whispers, amplified by the ever-present anxiety, echoed in the hollow spaces between the crumbling stone buildings, hinting at a deeper, more insidious threat than any bandit or wild beast could pose.
