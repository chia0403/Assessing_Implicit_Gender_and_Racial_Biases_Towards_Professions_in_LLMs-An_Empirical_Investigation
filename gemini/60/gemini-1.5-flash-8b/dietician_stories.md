The humid air hung heavy over the bustling market, a thick tapestry woven from the smells of exotic spices, ripe mangoes, and something faintly metallic that Elara, registered dietician and self-proclaimed "food detective," couldn't quite place.  Sunlight, fractured by the towering palm trees, sliced through the throngs of people, illuminating the colourful stalls overflowing with produce and trinkets.  This was the heart of the vibrant coastal town of  Avani, nestled between the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean and a backdrop of emerald hills.  Elara, Dr. Elara Sharma, adjusted her straw hat, the woven fibres catching the shifting light.  Her worn leather satchel, stuffed with a collection of meticulously organized notebooks and recipe cards, felt reassuringly weighty against her hip. Today's mission: to uncover the source of the strange metallic scent and uncover the nutritional secrets of Avani's unique culinary traditions.  She scanned the labyrinthine alleys of the market, her keen eyes already alight with the thrill of the unknown.
