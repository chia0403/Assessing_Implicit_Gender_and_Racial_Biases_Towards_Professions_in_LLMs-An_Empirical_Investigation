The scent of jasmine, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the subtle perfume of lilies of the valley and the earthy tang of damp soil.  Rain lashed against the glass roof of Amelia Butterfieldâ€™s tiny shop, "Blooming Blooms," a floral haven nestled amongst the bustling, grey brick buildings of Spitalfields.  Water trickled down the chipped paint of the sign, blurring the already faded lettering.  Inside, Amelia, a woman whose apron, stained a delicate shade of rose-pink, was perpetually dusted with pollen, meticulously arranged a bouquet.  White roses, their petals almost translucent in the dim light, formed a delicate heart around a cluster of vibrant purple irises.  A single, perfect crimson poppy, its petals like stained glass, perched atop the arrangement.  It was a simple, yet exquisite, creation. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, checked the arrangement once more, her gaze tracing the delicate lines of the stems and the way the flowers formed a gentle curve.  A soft melody, a jaunty tune played by a street musician outside, mingled with the rhythmic patter of the rain.  It was a typically melancholically beautiful Spitalfields afternoon.
