The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something subtly metallic, like old copper.  Dr.  Anya Petrova, a nutritionist specializing in Ayurvedic principles, adjusted her linen sari, the cool cotton a welcome contrast to the oppressive heat of the Mumbai marketplace.  Sunlight, fractured by a thousand shimmering surfaces, sliced through the throng of people.  Stalls overflowed with vibrant fruits and vegetables, spices, and exotic meats.  The cacophony of voices, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of metal on metal from a nearby chai vendor,  swirled around her like a fragrant mist.  Anya's tailored, yet comfortable, clothing, with its understated indigo and ochre, barely made a mark in the swirling kaleidoscope of colors.  She was, as usual, a study in quiet observation, a discreet speck in a vibrant tapestry.  This was her element, this chaotic symphony of flavours and aromas, the sensory feast that was the heart of the city. Today's task:  finding the freshest ingredients for a custom meal plan for a demanding young entrepreneur with a hectic schedule.  But the market itself felt almost chaotic enough to justify a week-long immersion; a symphony of sensory overload.
