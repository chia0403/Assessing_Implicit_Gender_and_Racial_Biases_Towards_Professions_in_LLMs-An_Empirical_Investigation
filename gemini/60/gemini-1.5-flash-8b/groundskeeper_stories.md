The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding Blackwood Manor, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Elias Thorne, groundskeeper for the sprawling estate for the past twenty years, pulled his threadbare wool cap lower over his ears.  He squinted at the encroaching gloom, the last vestiges of sunlight painting the manicured lawns in a fleeting amber glow before plunging them into the inky blackness of a Yorkshire evening.  The wrought-iron gates, normally gleaming under the sun, now seemed to loom menacingly, their ornate details swallowed by the encroaching shadows.  Elias shivered, not just from the chill, but from a prickle of unease that had been growing steadily since the unsettling note he'd found tucked beneath the rhododendron bushes earlier that afternoon.  

Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of dark stone and towering turrets, stood sentinel over the valley.  Its imposing presence dominated the landscape, a brooding presence that mirrored the unsettling atmosphere that settled over the estate with the fall of each day.  Years of tending to its meticulously kept grounds, its hidden pathways and secret gardens, had etched a familiarity into Elias's soul.  But this evening, the familiar felt profoundly alien. The once comforting silence of the grounds was broken only by the rustling of unseen creatures and the creaking of the ancient oak trees as they wrestled with the wind.  He clutched the tattered parchment in his hand, the unsettling script threatening to unravel like the very fabric of the manor itself.
