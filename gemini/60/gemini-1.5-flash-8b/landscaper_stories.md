The biting wind, a relentless sculptor of the Yorkshire moors, whipped at Elias Thorne's worn tweed jacket.  He squinted against the grey, lowering sky, the skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawing at the bruised purple twilight.  Dust, kicked up by a rogue gust, swirled around his worn gardening boots, mimicking the turmoil in his stomach.  Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire, or at least, thatâ€™s what his business card proclaimed.  Tonight, though, the extraordinary was a long way off.


The setting:  The remote, windswept valley of Swaledale, nestled deep within the Yorkshire Dales National Park.  Fields, once vibrant with wildflowers, were now a muted palette of brown and grey under the oppressive blanket of a late autumnal sky.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and impending rain.  Elias's small, but meticulously kept, landscape maintenance business, "Thorne's Tamed Terraces", was a far cry from the bustling, sun-drenched gardens he'd once envisioned designing.  The valley, usually a symphony of rustling leaves and trickling streams, was tonight a stark canvas of melancholy.  He was alone, the only human presence in this vast, whispering landscape, his work truck a solitary beacon against the encroaching darkness.
