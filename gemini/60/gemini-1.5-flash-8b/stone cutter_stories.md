The biting wind, a glacial sculptor itself, whipped across the exposed peaks of the Drakonian Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  Dust, the fine grey sediment of ages, coated everything â€“ her worn leather apron, the chipped granite of the quarry face, and the rough-hewn wooden tools she carried in her calloused hands.  High above, the jagged peaks of the Drakonian Range pierced the bruised sky, a panorama of grey and shadowed stone, a fitting backdrop to the life she knew.

Elara Stonehand, daughter of the quarry's foreman, wasn't born for the harsh, unforgiving beauty of the mountains. Yet, here she was, at the precipice of a new day, already feeling the familiar weight of the mountain's will upon her. The quarry, a vast scar etched into the mountainside, was her kingdom, her prison.  The rhythm of her life was dictated by the stone itself, the stubborn, resistant granite that demanded respect and mastery.  Each chisel strike, each careful shaping, a conversation with the ancient earth.  Today, she was tasked with carving a frieze depicting the legendary dragon-slaying heroes of old, a commission from the wealthy Lord Valerius of the valley below.  But the stone felt different today, heavy with a whisper of something ancient, something...unyielding.
