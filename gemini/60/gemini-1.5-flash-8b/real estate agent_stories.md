The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she stared out the panoramic window of the sprawling penthouse.  Below, the city of Aethelgard shimmered, a kaleidoscope of lights reflecting off the polished steel skyscrapers that pierced the inky sky.  Amelia, a seasoned real estate agent with a reputation for turning a fixer-upper into a showstopper, felt a familiar pang of melancholy.  This particular view, this breathtaking expanse of urban sprawl, usually ignited a fire within her, a passion for transforming raw potential into opulent reality.  Today, however, it felt more like a mocking reminder of the empty space in her own life.  

Her meticulously organized apartment, a stark contrast to the opulent views outside, was hushed.  The only sound besides the distant rumble of traffic was the rhythmic click-clack of Ameliaâ€™s heels against the polished hardwood floor as she paced.  Stacks of meticulously arranged property brochures and marketing materials, representing everything from quaint cottages to grand mansions, lined the walls.  Her desk, a fortress of paperwork, sat like a monument to her relentless pursuit of success in the high-end real estate market.  The city, with its promise of fortune and luxury, had become a cold, indifferent observer to her personal struggles. The year was 2042.
