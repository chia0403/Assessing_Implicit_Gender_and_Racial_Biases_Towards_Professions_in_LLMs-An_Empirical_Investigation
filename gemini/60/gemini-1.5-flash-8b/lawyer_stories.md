The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's crimson coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled alleyway.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the ancient stone walls, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  London, shrouded in perpetual twilight, seemed to press in on her, the damp chill seeping into her bones.  She clutched her worn leather briefcase, the worn, embossed initials – A.K. – a constant reminder of the responsibility weighing her down.  The flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows that danced like tormented spirits.

Setting:  A grimy, winding alleyway in the Victorian-era East End of London.  The air is thick with the smells of coal smoke, wet earth, and brewing discontent.  The buildings, towering and decaying, are a testament to the city's harsh realities.  The sounds of the city – the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths' hammers, the shouts of hawkers, the distant cries of the street urchins – are a constant undercurrent.
