The aroma of cinnamon and freshly baked sourdough hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the bakery's exterior and swirling around the figure of  Amelia Nightingale, a baker with flour dusted hands and eyes the colour of burnt umber.  It was a Tuesday morning, the kind where the grey London sky mirrored the perpetual gloom that seemed to settle over the cobbled streets of Spitalfields.  Rain hammered against the tiny, ivy-covered windows of "The Golden Crust," a bakery tucked away on a narrow lane, its only real claim to fame its legendary sourdough, a secret passed down through generations of Nightingale bakers.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a face etched with the quiet determination of someone who had faced the harshest of mornings, meticulously kneaded a ball of dough.  Each rhythmic push and fold was a silent prayer, a quiet meditation on the day ahead.  She was already late.
