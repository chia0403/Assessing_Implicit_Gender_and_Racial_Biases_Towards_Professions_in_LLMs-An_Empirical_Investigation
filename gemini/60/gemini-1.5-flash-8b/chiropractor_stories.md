The fluorescent lights of the "Spinal Harmony" clinic hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Dr. Amelia Hayes's quiet afternoon.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a scattering of discarded gym bags and half-eaten granola bars on the waiting room floor.  A faint, metallic tang lingered in the air, a familiar companion to the strained sighs and creaks that punctuated the rhythmic *clink* of Amelia's adjusting tools.  

Spinal Harmony was tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling, yet worn-down, industrial district of Anytown.  Brick buildings, stained with time and soot, leaned precariously against each other, mirroring the skeletal aches and pains of the people who sought solace within their walls.  The aroma of exhaust fumes mingled with the scent of frying food from the nearby greasy spoon diner.  A chipped porcelain owl perched on a crumbling shelf in the entryway seemed almost as weary as Amelia, its ceramic eyes staring blankly ahead, as if observing the relentless parade of human misery.
