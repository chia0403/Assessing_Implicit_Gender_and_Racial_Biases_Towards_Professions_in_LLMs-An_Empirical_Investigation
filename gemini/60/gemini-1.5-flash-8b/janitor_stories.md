The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apex Institute for Advanced Algorithmic Studies" hummed a low, insistent song, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of Amelia Petrova's broom.  Dust motes danced in the pale oblong beams, mimicking the ceaseless, almost imperceptible shift of the digital world that pulsed beneath her feet.  The Institute, a sprawling, glass-and-steel monolith perched atop a hill overlooking the city, held a quiet hum of activity, a symphony of keyboards, hushed whispers, and the faint, metallic scrape of automated machinery.  Amelia, with her worn, grey uniform and perpetually tired eyes, was the silent custodian of this digital cathedral, its quiet keeper.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and recycled air, a familiar comfort in the sterile environment.
