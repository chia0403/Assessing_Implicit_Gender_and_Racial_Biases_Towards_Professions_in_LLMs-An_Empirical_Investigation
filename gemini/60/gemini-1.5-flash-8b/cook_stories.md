The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cramped kitchen of "The Rusty Spoon," its greasy air thick with the aroma of simmering stew and frying onions.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, a relentless drumming that mirrored the relentless rhythm of Amelia Hawthorne's chopping knife against the wooden board.  Amelia, a woman whose face, weathered and lined like the worn countertop before her, held a fierce determination, meticulously diced potatoes, her movements precise and practiced.  The tiny kitchen, barely larger than a small bedroom, was a symphony of clatter and steam, a chaotic ballet of culinary creation. Outside, the city of Veridian grumbled in the downpour.  The year is 1888.
