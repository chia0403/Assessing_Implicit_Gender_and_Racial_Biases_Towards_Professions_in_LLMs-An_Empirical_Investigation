The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of spilled peroxide and forgotten conditioner, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the "Snip-Snap Scissors" salon.  Dust motes danced in the beam, illuminating the tangle of tangled hair – auburn, black, and a surprising shade of lavender – strewn across the counter.  This was Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne's domain, a small, unassuming space crammed with the scent of ozone and cheap hairspray, a symphony of hushed conversations and the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors.  Amy, a woman with hands as steady as granite and eyes that could see more than just strands of hair, leaned over her latest client, a young woman named  Elara, tracing the faint line of her jawline.  The air hummed with unspoken stories, the whispers of a thousand lives glimpsed and then, for the most part, forgotten between trims and tints.


The salon itself, tucked away on a side street of the bustling port city of Alderhaven, was a relic of a bygone era.  Crimson velvet curtains, faded and tattered, hung at the doorway, barely masking the faded floral wallpaper behind.  Posters of vintage hairstyles, now slightly warped and yellowed, covered the walls, reminding Amy of a time when a good haircut was more than just a style, it was an art.  The scent of brine from the nearby harbour mingled with the artificial perfume of the salon's products, creating a peculiar, yet familiar, aroma.  Old wooden chairs, worn smooth by countless heads, stood in silent judgment of the fleeting trends of modern fashion.  Outside, the relentless clang of shipyard machinery and the cries of gulls offered a stark contrast to the hushed, almost melancholic, atmosphere within.
