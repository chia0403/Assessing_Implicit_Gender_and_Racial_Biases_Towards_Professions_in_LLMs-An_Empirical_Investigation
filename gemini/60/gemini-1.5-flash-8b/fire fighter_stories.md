The biting wind whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the faded firehouse sign that proclaimed, "The Crimson Guard."  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the forgotten town square, a stark contrast to the unwavering, crimson glow emanating from the second-story window of the dilapidated "Grand Hotel."

The old hotel, a relic of a bygone era, whispered secrets in the wind, secrets that Amelia suspected were about to be unleashed.
