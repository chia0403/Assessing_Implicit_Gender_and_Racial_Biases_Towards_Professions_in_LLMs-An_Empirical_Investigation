The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, mirrored the cloudy sky outside.  Rain hammered against the attic windowpanes, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Elara Blackwood's heart.  She, Elara Blackwood, housekeeper for the esteemed Lord Ashworth and his notoriously demanding family, felt a tremor of unease unlike any she'd experienced during her fifteen years of service.  Not from the dripping pipes, not from the ever-present chill, but from a subtle, unseen shift in the air, a tangible unease that seemed to coil around her like damp wool.

The Ashworth Manor, a sprawling, gothic edifice perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the grey-hued town of Blackwood, had always been a place of quiet, if not stifling, grandeur.  Its many rooms, each echoing with the whispers of forgotten ancestors and the hushed footsteps of generations past, were now strangely silent.  Today, the silence was ominous.  This morning, a new butler had arrived.  A young man, with a nervous air and unsettlingly sharp eyes, named Bartholomew. And whispers about a hidden room had begun to circulate amongst the staff.  Lord Ashworth, known for his aloof disposition and peculiar fascinations, had been unusually preoccupied for the past week,  shut away in the study.  Elara knew the study was not entirely as it seemed. The ancient oak paneling concealed somethingâ€”something that, in the depths of her intuition, she knew held the key to this growing sense of dread. The heavy scent of old parchment and decaying wood hung in the air, almost clinging to her skin.  This was no ordinary day at Ashworth Manor.
