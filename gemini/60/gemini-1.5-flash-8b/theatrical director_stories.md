The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of Covent Garden, rattling the stained-glass windows of the dilapidated "Globe Theatre."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the gloom, illuminating the chipped paint and faded grandeur of the building.  Rain, a relentless percussion against the corrugated iron roof, punctuated the silence.  Inside, nestled amongst the theatrical debris of a recent production's dismantling,  Alistair Finch, Director of the Globe's experimental troupe, "The Crimson Quill," hunched over a worn, leather-bound script.  His name, Alistair Finch, reverberated with a quiet authority that belied the messy, rumpled state of his clothes and the perpetual exhaustion etched into his face.  He was a man of meticulous detail, a sculptor of human emotion on the stage, but today, the theatre felt more like a mausoleum of lost possibilities.
