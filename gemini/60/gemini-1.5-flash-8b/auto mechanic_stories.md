The air in "Rusty Wrench" hung thick with the smell of burnt oil and ozone.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the garage, illuminating grease-stained tools scattered across workbenches that groaned under the weight of forgotten projects.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, a self-proclaimed master mechanic with a reputation as legendary as the sputtering vintage engines he restored.  Barty, a man built like a sturdy oak, with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand stripped spark plugs, was wrestling with a particularly stubborn Ford Model T.  The car, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," had arrived a week ago, its owner, a reclusive old woman named Ms. Abigail Finch, promising a hefty reward for its resurrection.  But the old girl was proving more than a match for Barty's famed skills.

Setting:

The tiny, cluttered garage was tucked away on the outskirts of a sleepy, seaside town nestled amongst rolling hills and the murmur of the Pacific Ocean.  Cobblestone streets, lined with brightly painted houses with weathered porches, framed the town square.  The scent of salt and seaweed mingled with the aromas of freshly baked bread and fish frying, and the rhythmic crash of waves offered a constant soundtrack to the lives of the townsfolk.   Barty’s garage, with its faded sign and perpetually open door, was the heart of quiet desperation, a beacon to anyone needing a helping hand—and a strong set of hands for the local cars, alike. The town felt a collective hold on the past.
