The biting wind, a relentless prairie rat gnawing at the edges of the world, whipped across the parched fields of the Nebraska plains.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre fury, danced across the cracked earth, swirling seed and sorrow into the already hazy sky.  This was the life of Silas Blackwood, a farmer, not a man who dreamt of grandeur, but a man who lived the quiet, stoic rhythm of the land. Silas Blackwood, weathered and worn, stood at the edge of his fields, his calloused hands clenching the worn leather of his work gloves, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon.  A single, stubborn blade of wheat, stubbornly green amidst the browning stalks, was the only visible sign of life.  The heart of the land was dry, gasping for rain, and the heart of Silas, in turn, was heavy with a fear deeper than the drought.  He knew the whispers of the failing well, the cracking of the barn's foundation, and the hollow echo in the empty stalls where his animals once stood. This year, even the sparrows were leaving, the flight of their shadow a mournful testament to the failing land.
