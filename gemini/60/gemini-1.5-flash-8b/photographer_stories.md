The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s camera bag around her, each gust threatening to send the battered leather across the desolate expanse of the Painted Desert.  Dust devils, like miniature tornadoes, danced across the cracked earth, obscuring the already low-lying sun.  Amelia, her breath puffing white in the frigid air, squinted through the dust-coated lens of her Hasselblad, trying to capture the ethereal beauty of the fading light.

This was the 27th day of her self-imposed exile, her 27th attempt to capture a photograph that would speak to the soul, to the very essence of the desert itself.  Her name, whispered on the wind, seemed as insignificant as a grain of sand in this vast, uncaring landscape.
