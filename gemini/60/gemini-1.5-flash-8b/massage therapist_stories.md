Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Willow Creek Massage, a small, almost hidden storefront nestled between a bakery overflowing with the scent of fresh bread and a dilapidated antique shop that smelled faintly of mothballs and forgotten memories.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain matched the steady thrumming of the air conditioner, a small, defiant battle against the oppressive heat that clung to the humid Louisiana air.  Inside, bathed in the soft glow of a single overhead bulb, Amelia Josephine Dubois, a massage therapist with hands as warm and comforting as the summer sun, prepared for her evening clientele.  Her long, dark braid, usually cascading down her back, was pinned back tightly, leaving a delicate halo of curls framing her face.  A faint floral scent, a blend of lavender and chamomile, filled the room, mingling with the faint, sweet tang of honeysuckle that drifted in through the open window.  Tonight's first appointment was due in 15 minutes.
