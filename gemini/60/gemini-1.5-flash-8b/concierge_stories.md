The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Kensington's hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the ornate wrought-iron gates of the Blackwood Manor.  Rain slicked the cobblestones, reflecting the flickering gaslight lanterns that cast long, dancing shadows across the sprawling grounds.  Amelia, Concierge at Blackwood Manor for the past seven years, knew this scene intimately, almost pathologically so.  Each gust of wind, each drip of rain, each creak of the ancient timbers â€“ they were all part of the symphony of Blackwood Manor, a symphony that had started to play a discordant tune lately.  Tonight, the discord was particularly sharp.

The setting: Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece nestled within the whispering woods of the English countryside.  Its grey stone walls, accented with intricate carvings and towering turrets, seemed to hold secrets buried deep within their shadowed recesses.  Beyond the manor, the trees reached towards the bruised, overcast sky, their skeletal branches gnarled and twisting like skeletal fingers. Inside, the grand halls and opulent rooms seemed to breathe with a silent energy, a palpable sense of history and forgotten grandeur.  Amelia knew the residents intimately, each with their own particular eccentricities and stories, but tonight, an unsettling stillness hung heavy in the air.  A palpable unease that resonated with the melancholy of the dying light.  The manor, once a beacon of warmth and laughter, now felt like a stage set for an impending tragedy.
