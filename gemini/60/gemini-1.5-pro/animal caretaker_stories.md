The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep mud.  Around her, the sprawling grounds of Oakhaven Wildlife Rehabilitation Center hummed with a quiet symphony of rustling leaves and distant animal calls.  Towering oaks, skeletal in their winter nakedness, clawed at the grey sky above, their branches laced with icy rain.  Amy pulled her thick, fleece-lined jacket tighter, the pungent aroma of damp earth and pine needles filling her lungs. Oakhaven, nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, was a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, and for Amy, it was more than just a job; it was a calling, a life intertwined with the wild heart of these ancient hills.  This morning, however, a particular unease gnawed at her.  A new arrival was expected â€“ a creature of myth and legend, whispered about in the hushed tones usually reserved for ghost stories.
