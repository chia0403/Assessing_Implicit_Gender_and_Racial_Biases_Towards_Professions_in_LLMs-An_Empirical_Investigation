The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Eventide Manor, tugging at Elias Thorne's threadbare cap and stinging his cheeks. November in the Derbyshire Dales had a way of carving its presence into the very bone, a relentless reminder of winter's impending grip. Elias, his breath clouding the air before him, surveyed his domain.  Eventide, a gothic monstrosity of slate and stone, hunched against the grey sky, its many windows reflecting the leaden light like vacant eyes. Fallen leaves, the burnt orange and russet of autumn’s last gasp, carpeted the grounds, rustling beneath his heavy boots.  He loved this place, this melancholy symphony of nature and architecture, even when the cold seeped into his soul the way it did now.  He felt a peculiar kinship with the aging manor, both bearing the scars of time and weathering the storms with a quiet resilience. But this morning, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual stillness, a subtle shift in the air that Elias couldn't quite place.  It prickled at the back of his neck, a warning he’d learned to heed over his thirty years tending Eventide’s grounds.
