The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Hawthorne's ankles as she trudged up the long, gravel driveway of Blackwood Manor.  Dead leaves, the color of rust and decay, swirled around her sensible brown shoes.  The manor itself loomed against the bruised purple sky, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and darkened windows, more suited to a horror novel than the rolling hills of the Cotswolds. Amelia tightened her grip on the worn leather handle of her carpet bag, the only sound the crunch of gravel beneath her feet and the mournful cry of a distant crow.  She'd been housekeeper at Blackwood for five years now, and the place still managed to send a shiver down her spine, a prickle of unease that no amount of dusting or polishing could erase.  Today, however, felt different. The air hung heavy, thick with a silence that was almost tangible, broken only by the frantic fluttering of her own heart.  Something was wrong at Blackwood Manor. She could feel it in her bones.
