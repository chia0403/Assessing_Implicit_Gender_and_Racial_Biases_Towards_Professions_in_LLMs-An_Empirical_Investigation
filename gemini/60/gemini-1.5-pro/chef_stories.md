The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the windows of "Bisque & Bone," and sending a shiver down the spine of Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez-Flores. Inside, the small Seattle bistro was a warm haven of buttery light and the tantalizing aroma of simmering fennel and saffron.  Esme, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, surveyed her domain. Copper pots gleamed from their hooks, knives honed to razor sharpness lay waiting on the butcher block, and the mise en place for her famous Dungeness crab bisque was meticulously arranged on the stainless steel counter. Tonight was the first night of Restaurant Week, and Esme, notorious for her perfectionism, had been prepping since dawn. The pressure was on. Bisque & Bone, her dream, her sanctuary, her everything, was depending on a flawless performance.
