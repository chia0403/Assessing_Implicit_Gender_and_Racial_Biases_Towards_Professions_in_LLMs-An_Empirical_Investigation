The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and pine through the open windows of the ferry. Amelia "Amy" Reyes, PA-C, shivered, pulling her worn fleece tighter around her. The sky, a bruised purple-grey, mirrored the churning water below.  The San Juan Islands, usually emerald jewels scattered across the sapphire expanse, were today shrouded in mist, their rocky shores barely visible.  Amy, normally energized by the raw beauty of the Pacific Northwest, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach. This wasn't just the usual pre-shift jitters.  She was heading to Orcas Island, the largest of the archipelago, to temporarily fill in for the islandâ€™s only other physician's assistant, who had broken her leg in a kayaking accident.  Amy knew island life could be idyllic, but she also knew it could be isolating, especially for someone in the medical field.  And there was something else, a vague premonition of trouble she couldn't quite shake, clinging to her like the damp sea air.  As the ferry's horn blared, announcing their approach to the Orcas landing, Amy took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever awaited her on this mist-shrouded island.
