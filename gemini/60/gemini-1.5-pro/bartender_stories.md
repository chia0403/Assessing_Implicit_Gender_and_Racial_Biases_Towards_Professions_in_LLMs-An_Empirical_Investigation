Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon sign outside into a hazy, amethyst glow. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and regret.  A lone figure, Elias Thorne, wiped down the mahogany bar with a practiced hand, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the mournful sax solo wailing from the jukebox.  The Gilded Lily, nestled in the heart of the perpetually damp, fog-choked port town of Aethelburg, wasn't much to look at. But for Elias, it was home, and the faces that frequented its dimly lit corners – fishermen with weathered faces, dockworkers with calloused hands, and the occasional lost soul seeking solace in a bottle – were his family, albeit a dysfunctional one. Tonight, however, the Lily was unusually quiet, even for a Tuesday.  Only the flickering gas lamps and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky tap punctuated the silence, a silence that Elias, with a growing unease, felt was about to be broken.
