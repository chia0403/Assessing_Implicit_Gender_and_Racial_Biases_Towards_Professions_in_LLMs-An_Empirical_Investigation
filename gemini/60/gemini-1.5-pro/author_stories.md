The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Cartwright's face as she leaned against the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping her auburn braid against her weathered wool coat.  The Isle of Skye rose from the mist-shrouded sea like a slumbering giant, its jagged peaks barely visible against the bruised twilight sky. Mia, a moderately successful author known for her quirky historical fiction novels, hadn't intended to end up here.  Her destination had been the much more civilized, and significantly less windswept, Isle of Mull, where a writer's retreat promised warm fires, inspiring views, and copious amounts of locally sourced whisky.  But a ferry strike on Mull and a last-minute rerouting had landed her on this isolated, almost mythical island, a place whispered to be steeped in ancient magic and guarded by secrets as old as the mountains themselves.  Dunvegan Castle, her accommodation for the foreseeable future, loomed in the distance, a dark silhouette against the fading light, promising both shelter and an unnerving sense of isolation.
