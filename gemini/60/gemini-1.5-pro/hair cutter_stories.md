The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the melancholic drizzle painting the streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, the warm, vanilla-scented air hummed with the low thrum of a hairdryer.  Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her auburn braid coiled like a sleeping serpent atop her head, expertly snipped at the split ends of Mrs. Henderson’s permed bob.  Outside, the gray afternoon pressed against the large plate-glass window, showcasing the salon’s faded turquoise facade and the chipped paint on the "Open" sign.  Port Blossom, a town clinging to the edge of the Pacific like a barnacle to a ship’s hull, wasn't a place known for its glamour. But within the four walls of Shear Perfection, Eliza Jane created magic, one haircut at a time.  And today, she felt a storm brewing, bigger than the one outside.  She just didn't know it was about to walk through her door.
