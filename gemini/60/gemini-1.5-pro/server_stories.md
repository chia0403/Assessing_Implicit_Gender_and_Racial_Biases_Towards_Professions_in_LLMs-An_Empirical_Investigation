The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow across Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's tired face. Rain lashed against the large plate-glass windows, blurring the already desolate view of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, frying onions, and desperation.  Amy, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop with a practiced hand. It was 11:57 pm on a Tuesday, the slowest night of the week, and the only other occupants of the diner were a truck driver hunched over a bowl of chili and a moth circling the perpetually buzzing fluorescent light above the pie display.  Outside, the wind howled like a hungry wolf, a fitting soundtrack to Amy's growing sense of unease. Something felt different tonight.  Something feltâ€¦wrong.
