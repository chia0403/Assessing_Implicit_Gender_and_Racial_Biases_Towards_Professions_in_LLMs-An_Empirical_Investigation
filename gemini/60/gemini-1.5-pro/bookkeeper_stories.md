The muted clack of the adding machine was the only sound in Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's tiny office, a space barely bigger than a broom cupboard tucked away at the back of "The Gilded Lily," Madame Evangeline's somewhat notorious burlesque theatre.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced through the grimy windowpane, illuminating stacks of ledgers bound in cracked leather and overflowing with meticulously recorded figures.  Outside, the November wind howled down Rue Paradis, rattling the wrought iron fire escape that clung precariously to the brick wall. New Orleans in 1928 was a city of contrasts, a heady mix of jazz, gin, and secrets, and Barty Finch, with his wire-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on his nose and ink-stained fingers, was privy to more than his fair share.  He knew which dancers earned the most tips, which patrons favored the private booths, and exactly how much Madame Evangeline skimmed off the top. He kept meticulous records of every transaction, a silent observer in a world of feathers, sequins, and whispered promises.
