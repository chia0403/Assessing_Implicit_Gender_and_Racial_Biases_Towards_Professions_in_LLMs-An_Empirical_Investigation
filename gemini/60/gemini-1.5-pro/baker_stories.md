The glass, still cool from the night, fogged slightly with each exhale of her warm breath, obscuring the view of Main Street slowly sputtering to life. Inside, the warmth of the ovens radiated outwards, a comforting contrast to the crisp autumnal air.  Today was Apple Butter Festival day, and Elina, despite the lingering scent of her slightly over-ambitious caramel attempt, felt a thrill of anticipation.
