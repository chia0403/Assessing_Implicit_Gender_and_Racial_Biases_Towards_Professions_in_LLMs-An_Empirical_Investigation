The fluorescent hum of the hydroponic growth lamps cast an eerie green glow across Dr. Aris Thorne's face, highlighting the faint worry lines etched around his eyes.  He stood in Lab 7 of the Helios Research Station, a geodesic dome nestled precariously on the edge of the Shackleton Crater, its transparent panels offering a breathtaking, if desolate, view of the lunar landscape.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of ozone and the earthy aroma of the experimental algae strains Aris meticulously cultivated. It was December 27th, 2084, and three months into his solitary research mission, Aris had a growing unease that something wasn't right.  The silence of the moon, usually a comforting balm, had begun to feel oppressive, a suffocating blanket draped over the station.
