The crisp October air nipped at Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s exposed cheeks as she hurried across the quad of Alder Creek High School. Crimson and gold leaves, ripped prematurely from their branches by a recent windstorm, swirled around her ankles like confetti celebrating the demise of summer.  Eleanor clutched her oversized tote bag closer, the weight of student files and assessment reports a familiar burden.  Alder Creek, nestled in the heart of the Vermont mountains, was a picture-postcard town, all charming covered bridges and quaint storefronts. But beneath the idyllic facade, a current of unease pulsed. The recent disappearance of a student, Sarah Jenkins, had cast a long, unsettling shadow over the normally vibrant community, and the pressure on Eleanor to help the students cope, to somehow *fix* the intangible fear that permeated the hallways, was immense.  The bell shrilled, a jarring clang that sliced through the brittle air, and students poured out of the brick building, their youthful energy a stark contrast to the heavy atmosphere. Eleanor paused, her breath catching in her throat.  Something felt different today, a palpable shift in the energy of the crowd, and a prickle of apprehension crawled up her spine.
