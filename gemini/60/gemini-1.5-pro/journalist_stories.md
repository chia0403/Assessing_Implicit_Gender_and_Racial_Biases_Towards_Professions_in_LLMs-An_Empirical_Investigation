The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's dark hair across her face as she stared up at the imposing structure before her.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of wrought iron and grey stone, perched precariously on the edge of the windswept Cornish cliffs.  A perpetual mist clung to the grounds, swirling through the gnarled branches of ancient oaks, giving the place an ethereal, almost sinister, beauty.  Mia, clutching her notepad and pen tightly, shivered, not entirely from the cold. She'd arrived in the desolate, seaside village of Trevelyan Cove just hours ago, lured by the rumour of a story too strange, too compelling, to ignore. The locals whispered of unsettling occurrences at the Manor, a place steeped in a dark history and shrouded in local legend.  Mia, a seasoned journalist for the London Chronicle, specialized in debunking myths and exposing truths, and she intended to do just that, even if the unnerving atmosphere of Blackwood Manor already had the hairs on the back of her neck standing on end.
