The salt spray stung Amelia "Amy" Reyes's face as she gripped the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping her long, dark braid against her crimson anorak. The churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea stretched out before her, dotted with the emerald-green silhouettes of the Sporades islands.  Skopelos, their destination, loomed larger with every chug of the ferry’s engine, its whitewashed houses clinging to the steep hillsides like barnacles to a hull. Amy inhaled deeply, the scent of brine and pine mixing with the faint sweetness of blooming jasmine. This was her hundredth trip to the island, yet the raw beauty of it still managed to steal her breath away. Today, however, a knot of anxiety twisted in her stomach. This wasn’t just another tour group; this was *the* tour group – the one filled with travel journalists and influencers who held the power to make or break the island’s upcoming tourist season.  And after the disastrous earthquake last year, Skopelos desperately needed a good season.
