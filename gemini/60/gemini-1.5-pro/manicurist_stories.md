The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed psychic's shop, chimed a discordant welcome.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bleecker Street, blurring the already fading neon sign advertising twenty-dollar manicures.  Inside,  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her name embroidered in looping cursive on her crisp white salon coat, sighed and looked up from the chipped, flamingo-pink polish she was meticulously removing from Mrs. Higgins' gnarled finger. The scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of approaching thunder. The only other illumination in the cramped space came from a flickering fluorescent light overhead that buzzed with the promise of imminent failure.  Amelia, with her fiery red hair piled in a precarious bun and a scattering of freckles across her nose, pasted on a smile.  "Almost done, Mrs. Higgins, just a few more stubborn bits..."  But her thoughts were far from stubborn polish. They swirled with the same restless energy as the storm brewing outside, charged with a premonition that this particular Tuesday evening was about to be anything but ordinary.
