It was 2:17 AM, the deadest part of the night shift, and the only sound besides the buzzing was the rhythmic whir of the refrigerated coolers lining the back wall.  Rain lashed against the large front windows, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside.  Amelia, perched on her stool behind the counter, idly watched the droplets race each other down the glass, a small, temporary distraction from the monotony of scanning endless bags of chips and questionable microwave burritos for the occasional insomniac trucker or desperate college student.  The Quik-E-Mart, nestled on a lonely stretch of Highway 17 just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, wasn't exactly a bustling hub of activity, especially not at this hour.  Tonight, however, Amelia had a feeling that the quiet wouldn't last.  The air crackled with a strange, static energy, and the hairs on the back of her neck prickled with an unsettling awareness that something was about to change.
