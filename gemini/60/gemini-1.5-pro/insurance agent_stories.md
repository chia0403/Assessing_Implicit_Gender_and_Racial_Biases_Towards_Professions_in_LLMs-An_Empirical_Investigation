Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting image for Archibald "Archie" Finch's current predicament. He sat hunched over a chipped Formica table in the back booth of the Dew Drop Inn, the scent of stale beer and desperation clinging to the air like a shroud.  Flickering neon signs from the pawn shop across the street painted streaks of lurid green and red across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street, the main drag of Havenwood, Ohio. Havenwood, population dwindling, hopes dwindling faster. Archie, Havenwood's sole insurance agent, had just finished calculating his quarterly earnings, or rather, lack thereof.  The numbers, scrawled in shaky ink on the back of a funeral home advertisement, told a grim story: not enough to cover his rent, let alone the mounting medical bills for his ailing mother. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a soundtrack to Archie's rapidly sinking spirits.
