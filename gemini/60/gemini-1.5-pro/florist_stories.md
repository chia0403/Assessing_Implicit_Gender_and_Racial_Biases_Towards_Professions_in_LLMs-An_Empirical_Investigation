The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a melancholic two-note melody as the first customer of the day entered.

The shop, nestled between a dusty antique store and a bustling bakery on the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, was her sanctuary, a world of vibrant hues and fragrant whispers. This morning, however, a disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the rain clouds gathering over the small coastal town.
