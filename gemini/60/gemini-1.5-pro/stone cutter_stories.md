The biting wind whipped across the desolate peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, carrying with it the fine, grey dust of pulverized granite.  Here, nestled in a precarious alcove halfway up Mount Cinder, clung the workshop of Elias Thorne, Stone Cutter.  It wasn't much, a single room carved directly into the mountainside, its rough-hewn walls lined with the tools of his trade: chisels of varying sizes, gleaming mallets, and grinding stones worn smooth by years of constant use.  A small forge roared in one corner, its orange glow painting the otherwise dim space with flickering shadows.  Outside, the setting sun bled across the snow-capped peaks, casting long, ethereal fingers of light that reached down towards the valley below, a verdant tapestry far removed from Elias's solitary existence.  He hummed a low, mournful tune, the rhythm echoing the steady *tap-tap-tap* of his hammer against the stubborn heart of a block of obsidian, his breath misting in the frigid air. He was crafting something special, something unlike anything he had ever attempted before. A tremor ran through the mountain, not from the wind this time, but from something deeper within. Elias paused, his grey eyes narrowed, listening intently. The air crackled with an unfamiliar energy.
