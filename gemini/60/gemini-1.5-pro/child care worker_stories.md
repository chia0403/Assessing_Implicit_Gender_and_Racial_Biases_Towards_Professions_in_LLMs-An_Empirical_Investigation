The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large window overlooking the playground, turning the brightly colored plastic slide and climbing frame into glistening, forlorn islands in a sea of grey. Inside, the air thrummed with the chaotic energy of twenty-three preschoolers, a kaleidoscope of finger-painted masterpieces, building block towers, and the occasional high-pitched squeal. Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, knelt amidst a group engrossed in building a formidable fortress out of blankets and cushions, her smile a little strained as four-year-old Leo declared war on the neighbouring princess castle, brandishing a plastic spatula like a fearsome sword.  The scent of disinfectant mingled with the sweet aroma of playdough, creating a unique perfume that Amelia had come to associate with both exhaustion and a quiet sense of fulfillment. This brightly colored, slightly sticky world was her domain, and these tiny humans, her current responsibility. Little did she know, the rain outside was a harbinger of something far more disruptive than a cancelled outdoor playtime.
