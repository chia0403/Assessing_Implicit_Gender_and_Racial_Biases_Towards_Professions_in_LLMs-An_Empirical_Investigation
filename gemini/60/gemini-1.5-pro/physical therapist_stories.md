The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hurried across the slick, cobbled streets of Old Town, Chicago.  His breath plumed out in frosty puffs, momentarily obscuring the wrought-iron streetlamps that cast a warm, orange glow on the freshly fallen snow.  Elias clutched his worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – patient files, anatomical charts, and a thermos of lukewarm coffee – a comforting weight against the January chill.  His destination, the stately brick building at the corner of Wells and North Avenue, housed the Thorne Rehabilitation Clinic, a practice established by his grandfather almost a century ago.  While the city around it had evolved into a glittering metropolis, the clinic retained its old-world charm, a testament to a time when medicine was less about technology and more about the human touch. Inside, the air was thick with the familiar scent of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of exercise equipment.  It was 7:55 am, five minutes before his first patient, and Elias could already hear the rhythmic thump of a treadmill from the therapy room down the hall.  The day, like most others, promised to be a long one, filled with the aches, pains, and triumphs of his patients – the tapestry of human resilience that made his work both challenging and profoundly rewarding.
