Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau’s office, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the symphony of the New Orleans night. The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and stale beignets, hung heavy and humid, clinging to Cassie like a damp shroud. Her office, tucked away above a voodoo shop on Rampart Street, was a chaotic blend of organized chaos. Stacks of case files teetered precariously on every surface, interspersed with half-empty coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays. A single, bare bulb cast a harsh light across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air.  Cassie, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, tapped a chipped crimson nail against a faded photograph of a missing person, her emerald green eyes narrowed in thought. Outside, the mournful wail of a saxophone echoed through the French Quarter, a melancholic soundtrack to the mystery that had landed on her doorstep.
