The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, snagging at the edges of his worn canvas jacket as he wrestled a stubborn length of copper pipe from his van.  Frost crunched under his heavy work boots, the sound sharp against the backdrop of the desolate moors.  Around him, the landscape stretched, a tapestry of muted browns and greys under a bruised, iron-grey sky.  Drystone walls snaked across the hills, marking ancient boundaries, and a solitary, gnarled hawthorn tree clawed at the wind, its bare branches rattling like skeletal fingers. He was miles from the nearest village, his van parked precariously on the verge of a narrow, rutted track leading to Withering Heights, a crumbling, isolated manor house that had seen better centuries.  Elias had received a frantic call from the new owner, a flamboyant Londoner named Barnaby Featherstonehaugh, complaining of "a plumbing catastrophe of biblical proportions."  Elias, however, suspected the reality was probably a leaky tap and an overactive imagination.  He hefted his toolbox and trudged towards the house, a foreboding sense of unease settling in his gut.  Withering Heights lived up to its name.
