The fluorescent lights of the Discount Dreams mattress showroom hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the slick plastic sheen of dozens of rolled-up mattresses.  Outside, the Oklahoma wind howled a lonely ballad around the strip mall, rattling the plate-glass windows and occasionally flinging tumbleweeds against the storefront like forgotten promises.  Inside, however, the air was thick with the scent of new carpet and the faint, metallic tang of desperation.  This was Patricia "Trish" Ann Holloway's domain, and on this particularly bleak Tuesday afternoon, her kingdom was empty.  Trish, dressed in a crisp, navy-blue pantsuit, two sizes too big for the frame she'd possessed a decade ago, perched on a stool behind the cash register, idly clicking a pen and staring at the peeling "Employee of the Month" photo from June of 2008, featuring a much thinner, much happier version of herself. The picture was yellowed, curling at the edges, much like Trish's hopes for a commission today.
