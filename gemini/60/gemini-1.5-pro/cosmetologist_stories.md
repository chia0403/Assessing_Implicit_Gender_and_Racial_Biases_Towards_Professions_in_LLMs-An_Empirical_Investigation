The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lavender glow on the perpetually damp sidewalk of Elm Street. Rain, a constant companion in Port Blossom, Oregon, hammered against the salon's large front window, blurring the reflection of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois meticulously applying a vibrant teal rinse to Mrs. Higgins's tightly permed curls. Gen, a woman whose own hair was a kaleidoscope of ever-changing colors, hummed along to the eighties power ballads blasting from the salon's ancient stereo system.  The scent of hairspray, perm solution, and the faint sweetness of Mrs. Higgins's rose-water perfume mingled in the air, a familiar cocktail that always signaled the end of another Tuesday at Shear Radiance.  Outside, the rain continued its relentless assault, mirroring the storm brewing inside Gen, a secret she'd guarded closely, threatening to burst forth and change the carefully constructed life she'd built in this small, seaside town.
