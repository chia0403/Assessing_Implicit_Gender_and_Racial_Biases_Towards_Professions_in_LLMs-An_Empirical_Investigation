The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised-purple pre-dawn sky, glared down at Elias "Eli" Vance.  He squinted back, the harsh light reflecting off the dew-slick asphalt of Highway 17, a lonely stretch of two-lane blacktop snaking through the California coastal mountains.  The air, still crisp with the remnants of night, held the scent of pine needles and the faint, salty tang of the distant Pacific. Eli, bundled in a fluorescent orange jumpsuit that practically glowed in the dim light, adjusted the hardhat perched on his head and surveyed his domain for the day: a quarter-mile stretch riddled with potholes, the legacy of a particularly brutal winter.  His breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the battered orange cones marking off his work zone.  The only sound was the low hum of his idling truck, its headlights cutting twin beams through the encroaching fog that clung to the redwood-covered slopes rising on either side of the highway.  Today's task was simple, yet backbreaking: fill the potholes, one by one, a Sisyphean task against the relentless forces of nature and time.
