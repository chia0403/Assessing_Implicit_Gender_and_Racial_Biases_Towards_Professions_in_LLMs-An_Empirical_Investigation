The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack that Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over the past five years.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and blueprint ink, a smell she initially found repulsive but now registered as simply…work.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled against the glass windows of the twenty-second floor, a mournful cry that mirrored the feeling in Amelia's gut.  This Monday morning wasn’t just any Monday. It was the Monday after her meticulously crafted proposal for the Oak Street revitalization project – a project she’d poured her heart and soul into for six months – had been passed over for something “more modern” according to Mr. Henderson, the perpetually tanned and disconcertingly smooth-faced senior partner.  The cityscape spread out beneath her, a grey and steel tapestry punctuated by the occasional flash of the Chicago River, felt less like a symbol of opportunity and more like a vast, indifferent expanse. Amelia stared at her drafting table, littered with discarded sketches and the ghost lines of what could have been.  The half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee beside her reflected her own drained energy. This wasn’t how she envisioned her career unfolding.
