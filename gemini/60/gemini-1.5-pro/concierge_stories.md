The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity.  Sunlight, fractured by the enormous crystal chandelier that dominated the space, splashed rainbows across the polished marble floor.  A gentle cacophony of clicking heels, hushed conversations, and the tinkling of ice in crystal glasses filled the air.  This was Beatrice Eleanor Delacroix's domain.  Behind the gleaming mahogany concierge desk, Beatrice, with her perfectly coiffed auburn chignon and impeccably tailored navy suit, surveyed the scene with the practiced eye of a seasoned conductor leading a complex orchestra.  It was the cusp of the tourist season in Venice, and the Grand Majestic, perched elegantly on the Grand Canal, was already bustling.  The scent of salt air mingled with the faint perfume of lilies from the massive floral arrangements flanking the entrance, promising both adventure and luxury.  Little did Beatrice know, this particular Venetian morning was about to deliver both in spades.
