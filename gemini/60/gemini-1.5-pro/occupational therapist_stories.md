Rain lashed against the windows of the converted carriage house, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elias Thorne.  He stared out at the churning grey of the Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains barely visible through the downpour.  His office, usually a haven of calming neutrals and carefully chosen textures designed to soothe his patients, felt oppressive.  The salt-laced air, normally a comforting presence, carried a chill that seeped into his bones.  Elias rubbed his temples, the tension radiating from the tight muscles in his neck.  He had just finished a particularly challenging session with a young boy, eight-year-old Leo Vance, whose selective mutism had deepened following a recent car accident.  Leo hadn't uttered a single word, his normally bright eyes clouded with a fear Elias couldn't seem to penetrate. The rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from his grandmother's house, only amplified the silence left by Leoâ€™s absence. This small, shingle-sided building, perched on a bluff overlooking the water in Port Townsend, Washington, was supposed to be a place of healing, but today, the weight of Leo's silence felt like a stone in Elias's gut.
