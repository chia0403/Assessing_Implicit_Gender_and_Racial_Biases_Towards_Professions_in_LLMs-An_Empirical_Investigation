Rain lashed against the bay window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  The rhythmic drumming of water against the glass mirrored the insistent thrumming of a headache building behind Elias's eyes.  His office, usually a sanctuary of warm earth tones and carefully chosen artwork depicting serene landscapes, felt oppressive tonight.  Stacks of patient files sat on his mahogany desk, each a silent testament to the weight of other people's struggles he carried with him, even after hours. He was nestled in the heart of historic Georgetown, Washington D.C., the elegant brownstones and cobbled streets just a stone's throw from the bustling, political heart of the nation, a dichotomy that often felt reflective of his own internal landscape.  Tonight, however, the usual charm of the neighborhood was lost in the grey, rain-soaked gloom.  He rubbed his temples, trying to ease the tension, and glanced at the clock: 5:57 pm. Three minutes until his final appointment of the day, and the promise of a quiet evening with a good book and a glass of scotch.  He just hoped his next patient wouldn't bring a hurricane of their own into his already storm-battered office.
