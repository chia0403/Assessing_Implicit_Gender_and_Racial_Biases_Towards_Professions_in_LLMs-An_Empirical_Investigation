The insistent Florida humidity clung to Magnolia "Maggie" Reyes like a damp towel, even at the ungodly hour of 6:00 AM.  Sunrise painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges over the turquoise waters of the Gulf, but inside "Knead to Relax," Maggie's small massage therapy studio nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed surf shop on Sanibel Island, the air was cool and scented with lavender and lemongrass.  She’d already brewed a pot of strong Cuban coffee, a ritual as vital to her morning as the sun’s ascent. Outside, the rhythmic shush of the waves provided a soothing counterpoint to the clanging of metal hangers as she meticulously arranged the freshly laundered towels, each folded with precise, practiced movements. Today was the start of season, and Maggie, despite the pre-dawn quiet, felt the familiar thrum of anticipation humming beneath her skin.  This year, she was determined to finally make Knead to Relax a success, even if it meant working every muscle in her own body.
