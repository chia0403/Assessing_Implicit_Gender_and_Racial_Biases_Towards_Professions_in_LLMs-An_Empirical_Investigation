The biting November wind whipped around Anastasia "Ana" Volkov, plastering strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips.  She shivered, pulling her thick, charcoal grey coat tighter around her. Below, the city of Prague, a tapestry of terracotta roofs and gothic spires, glimmered under a bruised, pre-dawn sky. Ana stood on the Charles Bridge, deserted at this hour, the only sound the rhythmic slap of the Vltava River against the ancient stone piers.  She held a worn copy of the screenplay in her gloved hands, the title, "The Clockwork Heart," embossed in faded gold. This was it. The first day of principal photography on her most ambitious project yet, a steampunk fantasy epic, years in the making.  And Ana, despite the gnawing anxiety in her stomach, felt a thrill course through her as the first sliver of sunrise painted the sky a pale, hopeful lavender.  Prague, with its labyrinthine streets and centuries of whispered secrets, was the perfect backdrop for her story to unfold.
