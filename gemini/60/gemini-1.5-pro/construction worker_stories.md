The pre-dawn air, crisp and biting, nipped at Elias Thorne's exposed ears as he wrestled with the tarp covering the cement mixer.  Frost crunched under his heavy work boots, the sound swallowed by the vastness of the half-finished Olympic Park stadium looming around him.  Towering steel skeletons, destined to become tiered seating, clawed at the lightening sky above the London sprawl. Elias, breath clouding in the cold, finally freed the mixer's drum and slapped the metal reassuringly.  A familiar, low thrum vibrated up his arm as he switched it on, the machine's mechanical groan a stark contrast to the otherwise silent construction site.  Only a handful of sodium lamps, scattered across the sprawling expanse of dirt and steel, pierced the inky gloom, casting long, distorted shadows that danced and shifted with the rhythm of the rising sun.  The air smelled of damp earth, welding fumes, and the faint, metallic tang of impending rain.  This was Elias's domain, his kingdom of concrete and steel, and for the next twelve hours, he would be its king.
