The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, plastering stray strands of her fiery red hair across her face. She pulled her thick wool scarf tighter, the fringe tickling her nose as she surveyed the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre.  Its once-grand facade, now peeling and faded, loomed over her like a forgotten dowager.  Broken windowpanes gazed blankly onto the deserted street of Alder’s Bend, Oregon, a town that had clearly seen better days. The marquee, missing several letters, proclaimed a long-past production of "Oklahoma!" – a poignant reminder of the theatre's more glorious past. Esme, however, saw not decay, but potential.  This dusty, forgotten relic was to be the canvas for her most ambitious project yet, and she, the artist who would bring it roaring back to life.
