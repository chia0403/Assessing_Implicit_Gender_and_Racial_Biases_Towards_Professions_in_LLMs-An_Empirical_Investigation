The insistent chirping of the ancient intercom, more akin to a distressed sparrow than a sophisticated communication device, yanked Eleanor Vance from her meticulously alphabetized Rolodex.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, illuminating their lazy pirouettes. The lobby itself, once a testament to Gilded Age opulence, now whispered of forgotten grandeur.  Faded Persian rugs concealed worn patches in the marble floor, and the once-vibrant murals depicting pastoral scenes were now obscured by layers of nicotine stains and time. The Grand Majestic, nestled between a pawn shop and an all-night laundromat on a forgotten stretch of Bleecker Street, was a relic, much like Eleanor herself.  She sighed, smoothed her neatly pressed charcoal skirt, and reached for the intercom, her perfectly manicured nails clicking against the bakelite. "Grand Majestic, how may I direct your call?"
