The air in Elias Thorne's workshop hung thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faint ghost of lavender Mrs. Albright insisted on having spritzed onto her finished gown.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window overlooking Pinecone Alley, a narrow, cobbled lane tucked between the opulent storefronts of High Street and the ramshackle dwellings of the Tanner's Quarter in the city of Aethelburg. The rhythmic clatter of the downpour was a familiar counterpoint to the whisper of Elias's needle sliding through heavy linen, his brow furrowed in concentration as he stitched the intricate embroidery onto the cuff of a nobleman's doublet.  Gaslight flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered room, illuminating bolts of vibrant silks and velvets stacked haphazardly against one wall, and the worn, wooden tailor's dummy standing sentinel in the corner.  Outside, the year was 1888, and a chill deeper than the autumn rain had settled over Aethelburg, a chill that spoke of more than just the changing seasons.
