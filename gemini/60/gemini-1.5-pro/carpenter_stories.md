The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, sawdust clinging to his eyelashes like frosty tears.  He pulled his thick wool cap further down over his ears, the brim scratching against the stubble of his week-old beard.  Perched atop the half-finished timber frame of what would soon be the Widow Albrightâ€™s new general store, Elias surveyed the small town of Havenwood nestled in the valley below. The smoke from chimneys curled lazily into the grey sky, a stark contrast to the jagged peaks of the Ironwood Mountains looming in the distance, already dusted with the first snow of the season. Havenwood, population 312 (give or take a few lumberjacks), was a place of quiet routines and close-knit families, a place where Elias had spent his entire life shaping wood into homes, barns, and dreams. But this winter felt different.  A strange stillness hung in the air, heavier than the coming snow.
