Sweat beaded on Amelia "Amy"  LaRue's forehead as she adjusted the dials of the Heathkit SB-102 transceiver, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony, competing with the rhythmic thump of a distant offshore oil rig.  Amy's workshop, crammed into the corrugated steel half-cylinder, was a chaotic symphony of its own:  soldering irons rested precariously on stacks of manuals, spools of wire snaked across the workbench like metallic vines, and the faint scent of rosin flux hung in the air.  Bayou Lafourche, sluggish and brown, lapped at the pilings beneath the hut, the only other sound in this isolated corner of the world.  Amy, clad in a grease-stained denim jumpsuit, was alone, save for the ghostly voices whispering from the shortwave radio, a constant reminder of the world beyond the bayou.  Tonight, those whispers held a particular urgency.
