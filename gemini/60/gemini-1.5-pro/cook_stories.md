The clatter of pans and the sizzle of butter in a cast iron skillet were the soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  Elias, whose apron was perpetually dusted with flour and whose hands bore the intricate map of burns and cuts earned from years over a hot stove, was head chef and sole proprietor of "The Wandering Kettle," a tiny, brightly-painted food truck nestled in the heart of Astoria, Oregon.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the view of the Astoria-Megler Bridge, a rust-colored giant spanning the churning gray waters of the Columbia River. The air inside the truck, however, was warm and fragrant with the scent of simmering clam chowder and freshly baked sourdough.  It was a Tuesday in November, the kind of day that sent most people scurrying for the warmth of their homes, but for Elias, it was just another day to feed the souls, and bellies, of Astoria's hardy residents.
