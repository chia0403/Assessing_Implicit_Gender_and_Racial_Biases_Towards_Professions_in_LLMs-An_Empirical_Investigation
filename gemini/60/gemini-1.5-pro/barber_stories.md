The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Finch as his own heartbeat.  It groaned in protest as Elias lowered Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose blue rinse was so potent it could likely strip paint, back to the upright position. Finch’s Barber Shop, nestled between a perpetually closed bakery and a laundromat that smelled faintly of burnt toast, was his kingdom.  It was a small kingdom, admittedly, confined to a single room on a quiet, tree-lined street in the town of Alder’s Bend, Maine.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty glass of the front window, illuminated motes of hair dancing in the air like tiny, glittering insects.  The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy, a comforting aroma that spoke of tradition and routine.  On this particular Tuesday morning, however, Elias felt a prickle of unease, a sensation as sharp and unwelcome as a stray hair down his collar.  Something was different. He couldn’t quite place it, but the air itself seemed charged, humming with a strange, almost electric energy.
