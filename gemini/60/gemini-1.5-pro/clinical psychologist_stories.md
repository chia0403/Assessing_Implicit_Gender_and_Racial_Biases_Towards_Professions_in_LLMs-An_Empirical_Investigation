The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the relentless drumming in her own head.  Her office, nestled in the converted attic of a grand, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian house in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually offered a sense of comforting seclusion.  Tonight, however, the shadows cast by the flickering gaslight seemed to stretch and writhe, mimicking the anxieties of the patients she’d seen that day. The scent of brine and damp earth, usually a welcome reminder of the nearby ocean, tonight carried an undercurrent of something unsettling, something almost… sinister.  Eleanor rubbed her temples, the faint scent of lavender hand lotion doing little to soothe the tension coiled tight within her.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the loose panes of glass, a fitting soundtrack to the storm brewing not only outside, but within Port Blossom itself.
