The biting wind whipped snow against the windows of the Dunsinane Veterinary Clinic, rattling the panes and making the small waiting room feel even more precarious. Dr. Eleanor Vance Cavendish, her auburn hair escaping its braid and plastered against her cheek, peered through the frosted glass.  The only visible movement was the swirling snow and the intermittent flashing of the faded "Open" sign hanging above the door. Dunsinane, nestled deep in the Montana Rockies, was a town that clung stubbornly to existence, much like the tenacious mountain pines that braved the relentless winter.  It was a place where everyone knew everyone elseâ€™s business, and secrets had a lifespan shorter than a mayfly.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night trickle of ranchers and pet owners was absent, and the silence was broken only by the mournful howl of the wind. Eleanor shivered, pulling her worn fleece tighter around her.  She had a feeling this night was going to be anything but ordinary.
