The late afternoon sun, slanting through the grimy windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom, cast long shadows across the jumbled desks and the worn alphabet rug.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the faint scent of chalk dust and construction paper that clung to everything in Room 2B of Maplewood Elementary. Outside, the shrill cries of children on the playground mingled with the rumble of a passing school bus, signalling the end of another day. Eleanor, her fingers stained purple from a particularly enthusiastic art lesson involving glitter glue and pipe cleaners, sighed and leaned back in her creaky chair. Maplewood, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was typically a picture of idyllic small-town life. But today, a strange unease settled in the pit of Eleanor's stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite shake. The normally boisterous classroom felt unusually still, almostâ€¦expectant.
