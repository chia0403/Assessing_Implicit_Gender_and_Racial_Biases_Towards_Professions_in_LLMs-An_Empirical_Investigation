The dashboard clock glowed a malevolent 2:17 AM, casting a sickly green light across Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's face.  Outside, the Nevada desert stretched on forever, an endless expanse of scrub brush and tumbleweeds under a sky dusted with indifferent stars.  Amy gripped the wheel of her eighteen-wheeler, a behemoth christened "The Wanderer" by her late father, its diesel engine a low rumble against the vast silence.  The two-lane blacktop ribboned ahead, swallowed by the darkness, promising nothing but more miles and the ghostly flicker of distant headlights.  A half-eaten bag of chips lay crumpled on the passenger seat next to a thermos of lukewarm coffee, both testament to the long haul from Los Angeles.  Tonight's cargo: a load of pre-fabricated housing units destined for a new development somewhere outside of Reno.  Amy sighed, the dry desert air catching in her throat.  Another night, another endless road.  Little did she know, this particular night was about to become anything but ordinary.
