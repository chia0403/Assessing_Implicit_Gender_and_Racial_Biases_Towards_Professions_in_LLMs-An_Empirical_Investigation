The incessant dripping from the pharmacy's ancient air conditioning unit punctuated the otherwise silent pre-dawn hours.  Amelia Reyes, PharmD, squinted at the digital clock on the pharmacy counter: 4:57 AM. Another Tuesday morning in Havenwood, Indiana, a town where the most exciting event was usually the bi-annual church bake sale.  Thick fog clung to Main Street outside, obscuring the view of the sleepy storefronts across the street.  Inside Havenwood Pharmacy, the air smelled of antiseptic and the slightly sweet, metallic tang Amelia associated with the compounding medications she meticulously prepared.  She was already on her second cup of coffee, her crisp white coat donned, and the pharmacy computer whirring to life, ready for another day of filling prescriptions and offering a sympathetic ear to the town's ailments, both real and imagined. But this Tuesday, the stillness of Havenwood was about to be shattered.
