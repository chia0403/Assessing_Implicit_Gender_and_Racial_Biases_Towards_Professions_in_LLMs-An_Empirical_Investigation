The rusty tang of brake dust and the low growl of a failing power steering pump hung heavy in the air of Rosie's Auto Repair.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the erratic rhythm of Amelia "Millie" Rodriguez's hammering.  Sparks flew from the battered anvil as she wrestled with a stubborn tie rod end, her grease-stained coveralls clinging to her like a second skin. Rosie's, nestled between a dilapidated pawn shop and a perpetually closed bingo hall on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada, wasn't much to look at.  Cracked concrete, faded signage, and a mismatched collection of hubcaps decorating the chain-link fence screamed "backwater garage," but for Millie, it was home, and each clanging tool, each stripped-down engine, a familiar comfort. This morning, however, even the familiar felt tinged with unease.  The desert wind, usually a hot, dry whisper, carried a chilling dampness, and the radio, perpetually tuned to the local classic rock station, was crackling with static and ominous weather reports.  A storm was brewing, both literally and figuratively, Millie could feel it in her bones.
