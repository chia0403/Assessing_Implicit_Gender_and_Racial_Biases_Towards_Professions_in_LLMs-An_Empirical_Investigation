The biting wind whipped at Captain Elara Reyes's flight jacket as she surveyed the desolate landscape.  Jagged peaks, dusted with a perpetual layer of snow, clawed at the steel-grey sky above the Alaskan wilderness.  Her breath plumed in the frigid air, momentarily obscuring the view of the small, ice-encrusted airstrip carved precariously into the side of a mountain.  The De Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter, nicknamed the "Arctic Fox,"  rumbled impatiently behind her, its propeller a blur of silver against the stark white backdrop.  Elara adjusted her fur-lined hood, her dark brown eyes narrowed against the glare, a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration churning in her stomach. This delivery to the remote mining outpost of Qilaktuq was unlike any she'd flown before, and instinct told her this isolated corner of the world held secrets deeper than the snow drifts blanketing the frozen earth.
