The biting wind whipped across the vast expanse of Mrs. Henrietta Ashworth's estate, tugging at the hem of Elias Thorne's worn canvas jacket. Frost crunched under his boots as he surveyed the grounds. November in the Cotswolds had a particular bleak beauty; the skeletal trees clawing at the iron-grey sky, the manicured lawns fading from emerald to a muted olive, and the rose garden, once a riot of color, now a somber collection of thorny, dormant branches. Elias, his breath puffing out white clouds, pulled his thick, knitted beanie further down over his ears. He’d been Mrs. Ashworth's landscaper for five years, and while he appreciated the steady work, winters here were a special kind of brutal.  This year, however, there was something different hanging in the frigid air, something beyond the usual seasonal chill.  A subtle unease settled in Elias’s stomach as he noticed the normally meticulous grounds displayed an unusual…disarray.  A terracotta pot lay shattered by the fountain, its shards scattered across the frost-covered flagstones, and a faint, sickly sweet smell, like overripe fruit, wafted on the wind.
