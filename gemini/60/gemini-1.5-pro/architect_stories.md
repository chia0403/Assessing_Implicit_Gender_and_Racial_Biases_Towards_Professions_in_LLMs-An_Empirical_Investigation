The biting wind whipped Amelia Reyes’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood on the unfinished rooftop, the Chicago skyline a jagged, metallic silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Below, the city hummed with a frenetic energy, a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the clatter of the L train rumbling across its elevated tracks. Amelia, her breath misting in the frigid air, tucked a loose strand of dark hair behind her ear and adjusted the hard hat perched precariously atop her head.  This was her canvas, this concrete and steel skeleton reaching for the heavens.  The Zephyr Building, her most ambitious project to date, a testament to her vision of marrying modern design with the city’s industrial past.  But tonight, instead of the usual thrill of creation, a knot of unease tightened in her chest. The wind seemed to whisper secrets, and the shadows lengthening across the rooftop felt less like the embrace of dusk and more like the fingers of something…unsettling.
