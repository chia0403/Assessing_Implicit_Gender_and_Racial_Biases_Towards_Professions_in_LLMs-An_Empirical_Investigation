The biting November wind rattled the leaded panes of Dr. Elias Thorne’s dental surgery, a quaint, two-story building nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty travel agency on Alderbury High Street.  Inside, the air hummed with the low whine of the autoclave, sterilizing instruments for the afternoon’s appointments.  Rain lashed against the window, obscuring the view of the normally picturesque village square, turning it into a blurry Impressionist painting of grey and brown.  Elias, a tall man with hands that moved with surprising delicacy for someone who spent his days wrestling with molars, tapped a restless rhythm against his polished oak desk, his gaze fixed on the swirling tempest outside.  He wasn't looking at the storm, though. He was looking past it, to the dark, wooded hills that rose beyond Alderbury, a place where whispers lingered longer than the echo of church bells and secrets were buried deeper than the roots of ancient oaks.  He knew, with a certainty that settled like a lead weight in his stomach, that the storm wasn't the only thing brewing in those hills.
