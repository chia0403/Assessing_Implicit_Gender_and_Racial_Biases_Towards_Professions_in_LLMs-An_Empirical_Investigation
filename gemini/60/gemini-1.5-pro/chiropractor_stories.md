The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the thermostat for the tenth time that hour. The small waiting room of Thorne Chiropractic, usually bustling with the aches and pains of Willow Creek's residents, was eerily empty. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock inherited from his grandmother, each tick a stark reminder of the passing minutes and the dwindling hope that a patient might brave the downpour.  Willow Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, wasn't accustomed to storms like this, the kind that rattled the windowpanes and whispered secrets through the ancient pines that encircled the town.  Elias rubbed his hands together, feeling the familiar twinge in his left wrist, a souvenir from a particularly enthusiastic adjustment on a linebacker a few weeks back.  He glanced at the clock: 6:58 pm. Two minutes until closing. Two minutes until he could retreat to the quiet solitude of his apartment above the clinic, a sanctuary from the storm raging outside and the unease brewing within.
