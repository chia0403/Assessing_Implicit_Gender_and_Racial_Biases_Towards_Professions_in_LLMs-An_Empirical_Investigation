The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lurid, purple glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, amidst the chemical scent of perms and the hum of hair dryers, Clementine "Clem" Thistlewick sighed, wiping a stray strand of auburn hair from her forehead.  It was a Tuesday night, usually slow, but tonight the salon was eerily deserted. The only sound besides the rhythmic drip from a leaky pipe was the mournful saxophone solo emanating from the vintage radio perched precariously on a stack of old Vogue magazines. Clem glanced at the clock â€“ 7:53 pm. Seven minutes until closing, and not a single customer had walked through the door all day.  She idly twirled a pair of scissors, the metal cool against her skin, and wondered if she should just lock up early and head home to her cat, Mr. Bigglesworth.  The bell above the door chimed, its cheerful jingle at odds with the oppressive atmosphere, and Clem plastered a welcoming smile on her face.  But the smile faltered, and a chill prickled her skin, as the door creaked open to reveal a figure silhouetted against the streetlights, a figure unlike any she'd ever seen in Port Blossom before.
