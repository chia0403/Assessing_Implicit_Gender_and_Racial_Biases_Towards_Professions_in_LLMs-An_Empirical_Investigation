The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his exposed cheeks and making the already frayed edges of his yellow turnout coat snap like miniature firecrackers.  He stood on the precipice of the old Blackwood Quarry, the sheer drop a dizzying plummet of jagged rock face and skeletal trees clawing at the iron-grey sky.  Below, nestled in the quarry’s basin, lay the town of Havenwood, its twinkling lights a fragile constellation against the encroaching darkness.  Smoke, thick and acrid, coiled upwards, staining the air a sickly yellow and obscuring the normally picturesque view.  Elias’s jaw tightened.  That smoke wasn’t from a cosy fireplace.  It was the telltale breath of a raging fire, and it was coming from the heart of his town.
