The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, Oregon, a town nestled so deep in the Willamette Valley that sunlight seemed a luxury rather than a right. Amelia Persephone Hawthorne, head librarian of the Hollow Creek Community Library and unofficial custodian of its secrets, stood on the library's porch, watching the swirling fog obscure the already dim streetlights. The porch swing creaked rhythmically beside her, a mournful counterpoint to the rustle of dying leaves skittering across the cracked pavement.  Inside, the library glowed with the warm, inviting light of knowledge, a stark contrast to the encroaching chill. This evening, however, the usual haven held a different kind of atmosphere; a nervous energy thrummed beneath the hushed whispers and the turning of pages, a premonition of something unsettling on the horizon.  Amelia shivered, pulling her shawl tighter around her shoulders, the scent of woodsmoke and old books clinging to the wool.  Something was different tonight, and she couldn't quite put her finger on it.
