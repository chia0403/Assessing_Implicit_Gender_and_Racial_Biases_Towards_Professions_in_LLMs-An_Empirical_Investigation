The brass gleamed under the weak November sun filtering through the grimy skylight of the Grand Majestic Hotel. Dust motes danced in the anemic light, illuminating the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet.  This faded grandeur, a relic of a bygone era, was Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins' domain.  Barty, all elbows and nervous energy, adjusted his pillbox hat, the only pristine item on his person.  The lobby, usually bustling with the low hum of hushed conversations and the clinking of teacups, was eerily silent. It was 1932, the heart of the Depression, and even the Grand Majestic, once a haven for the affluent, felt the icy grip of economic hardship. A single guest sat huddled in a plush armchair by the dormant fireplace, a newspaper shielding their face. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a steady reminder of the slow, agonizing passage of time.  Barty leaned against the ornate, but chipped, reception desk, the silence pressing in on him like the heavy velvet drapes covering the tall windows. He knew something was different this morning, something unsettling hung in the air, thick and heavy like the smog that often choked the city outside.
