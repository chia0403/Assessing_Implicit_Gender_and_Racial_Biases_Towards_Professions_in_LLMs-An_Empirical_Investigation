The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vance’s parka, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already limited visibility.  Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred amongst colleagues but never in professional correspondence, shivered despite the multiple layers of thermal gear. The research station, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging precariously to the ice shelf like barnacles on a whale, groaned under the pressure of the gale.  Inside, the generator sputtered intermittently, casting the common room in a flickering, uneasy light.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and stale coffee, offered little comfort against the relentless assault of the elements.  This was Halley VI, the British Antarctic Survey’s state-of-the-art research station, a place of scientific endeavor and, tonight, a place of increasingly unsettling quiet.  Ellie's work, the analysis of recently discovered ice core samples dating back millennia, had already yielded fascinating – and unnerving – results.  But the silence that had fallen over the station in the last hour felt far more alarming than any scientific anomaly she'd encountered.
