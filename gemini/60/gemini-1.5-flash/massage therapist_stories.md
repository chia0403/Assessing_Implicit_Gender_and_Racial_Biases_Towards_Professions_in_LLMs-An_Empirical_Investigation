The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the leaded glass windows of Serenity Spa. Rain hammered a frantic rhythm on the slate roof, a counterpoint to the soothing strains of Tibetan singing bowls emanating from the adjacent treatment room.  Inside her own small, candlelit sanctuary, Aurelia “Rel” Blackwood, a massage therapist with hands as sure and steady as a seasoned sailor’s, meticulously arranged hot stones on a heated basalt slab.  The spa, nestled in a secluded corner of the quaint coastal town of Port Blossom, usually hummed with the quiet energy of relaxation, but tonight, an unsettling stillness pressed down, heavier than the gathering storm.  Rel, normally unflappable, felt a prickle of unease, a sense that something was…off.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain seemed to echo a deeper, more ominous pulse.
