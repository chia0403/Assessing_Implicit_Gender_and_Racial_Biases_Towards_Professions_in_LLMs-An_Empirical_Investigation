The smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion to Elias Thorne.  He traced the faint crackle on his oscilloscope, the green line a nervous tremor against the otherwise steady pulse.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the KSAN radio shack, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Pacific.  The storm, a brutal Pacific Northwest behemoth, had been raging for three days, knocking out power across the entire coastal region, leaving KSAN, and Elias, as one of the few remaining beacons of communication in a rapidly darkening world.  His calloused fingers, stained with the residue of countless solder joints, danced across the archaic equipment, a desperate ballet to restore a failing transmitter.  The fate of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of isolated communities hung in the balance, a weight Elias felt acutely in the pit of his stomach, far heavier than the relentless drumming of the rain.
