The flickering fluorescent lights of the server room hummed a discordant symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of countless hard drives.  Dust motes, illuminated by the pale glow, danced in the stale air like tiny, frantic spirits.  Amelia Katherine Hayes, a systems analyst with a caffeine addiction rivaling that of a small South American nation, squinted at the wall of blinking lights.  Each LED, a tiny, defiant heartbeat in the vast, digital organism she was tasked with keeping alive.  Tonight, however, the organism felt…sick.  A low, persistent growl emanated from the mainframe, a sound that sent shivers down Amelia’s spine despite the oppressive heat of the room.  The air conditioning, usually a roaring beast itself, was strangely silent. This wasn't just a routine server hiccup; this was something else entirely.
