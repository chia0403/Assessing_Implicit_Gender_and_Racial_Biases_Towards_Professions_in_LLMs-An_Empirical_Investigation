The salt spray stung Dr. Evelyn Reed’s face as she wrestled the recalcitrant outboard motor into submission.  The small fishing boat, christened the *Sea Serpent* (a name far grander than its actual state of repair suggested), bucked and coughed, spitting a plume of oily grey smoke into the already overcast sky.  The air hung heavy with the smell of brine, seaweed, and something vaguely…fishy.  Evelyn, however, was far more concerned with the smell of impending doom emanating from the burlap sack at her feet.  It contained her latest patient – a rather disgruntled-looking harbour seal with a badly injured flipper – and the increasingly choppy waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca were not exactly ideal for delicate veterinary surgery.
