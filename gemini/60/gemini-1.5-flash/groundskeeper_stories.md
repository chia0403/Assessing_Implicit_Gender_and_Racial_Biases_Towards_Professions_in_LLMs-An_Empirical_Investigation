The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch, its leaves clinging tenaciously despite the near-freezing temperatures.  Elias, groundskeeper for the sprawling Blackwood Manor, had seen worse winters, certainly, but this one felt different; a creeping, bone-deep chill that permeated even the thick stone walls of the estate.
