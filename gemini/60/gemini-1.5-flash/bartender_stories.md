The only light came from the flickering neon sign above the bar, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the restless patrons huddled around the chipped tables.  Tonight, however, the usual low hum of drunken chatter was replaced by an unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the occasional mournful clink of ice in a forgotten glass.
