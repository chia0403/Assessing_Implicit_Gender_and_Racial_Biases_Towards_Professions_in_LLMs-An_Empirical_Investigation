The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated farmhouse, a relentless rhythm mimicking the frantic beat of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s heart.  Each drop seemed to echo the unspoken accusations hanging heavy in the air, clinging to the damp plaster walls like the lingering scent of decay.  Eleanor, a forensic psychologist with eyes that had seen too much and a weariness etched deep into her lines, knelt beside the body.  The flickering beam of her flashlight danced across the slick, blood-stained floorboards, illuminating the victim’s contorted features in a macabre tableau.  The air was thick with the coppery tang of blood, mingled with the earthy smell of the overgrown garden pressing in on the ramshackle structure, a testament to the years of neglect that had allowed this horrific scene to unfold within its crumbling walls.  This wasn't just a crime scene; it was a whispered confession carved into the very fabric of the abandoned farmhouse, nestled deep within the desolate, windswept moors of Dartmoor.
