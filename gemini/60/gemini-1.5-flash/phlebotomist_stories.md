The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine "Amy" Hernandez's own heartbeat.  It was a sound she'd become intimately familiar with over the past five years, a soundtrack to countless pokes, prods, and the occasional, terrified whimper.  Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and a surprisingly gentle touch for someone who spent her days wrestling with veins, adjusted the rubber band on her wrist, a familiar comfort in the sterile, antiseptic air.  Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the shimmering heat-haze, but inside, the only heat Amy felt came from the perpetually malfunctioning coffee machine and the simmering stress of a Monday morning backlog.  Today's schedule was brutal: a full roster of patients, including the notoriously difficult Mr. Henderson and a cluster of pre-op jitters from the cardiac ward.  It was going to be a long day.
