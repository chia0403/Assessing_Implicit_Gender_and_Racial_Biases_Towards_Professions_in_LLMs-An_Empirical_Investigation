The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the meticulously organized ledgers on Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's desk.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of his office, a rhythmic drumming that competed with the scratch of his quill pen across the parchment.

It clung to him like the damp chill seeping in from the storm outside, a disquieting counterpoint to the comforting predictability of his numerical world.  His usually impeccable attire, a dark suit pressed to a razor's edge, felt suddenly inadequate against the creeping unease that settled in his bones.  This was no ordinary accounting night in the city of Veridia.
