The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort he welcomed as he adjusted the tripod on the wind-battered cliff edge.  Below him, the Atlantic churned, a frothy, restless beast gnawing at the jagged rocks.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a bruised orange, mirrored the turmoil in his gut.  He wasn't here for the dramatic sunset, though the light was undeniably breathtaking.  Elias Thorne, landscape photographer extraordinaire – according to his mother, at least – was here for the ghosts.  The whispers of the past clung to this desolate stretch of Cornish coastline like the clinging sea mist, and he intended to capture them, one meticulously framed shot at a time.  The air smelled of brine and something else… something ancient and subtly unsettling, like the faintest trace of decay on the wind.
