The humid air hung heavy and sweet, thick with the scent of frangipani and something else… something subtly acrid, like burnt sugar.  Amelia Katherine Finch adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed straw hat, its shadow doing little to alleviate the relentless glare of the midday Belizean sun.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, a stark contrast to the crisp, starched cotton of her khaki uniform.  She shifted the weight of her backpack, its contents – a battered first-aid kit, a bottle of water almost lukewarm, and a well-worn copy of  "A Guide to the Mayan Ruins of Xunantunich" – familiar comforts in the overwhelming jungle landscape.  Today, Amelia had a group of particularly excitable American retirees, and the Xunantunich ruins, perched dramatically atop a limestone ridge overlooking the Mopan River, were their final stop on a week-long tour of Belize. The heat, however, promised to be their greatest challenge yet.
