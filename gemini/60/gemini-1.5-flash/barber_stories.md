The scent of bay rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpanes of his small, brick-fronted shop on Bleecker Street.  Outside, the cacophony of New York City – the insistent wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing garbage truck, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of a hurried pedestrian's shoes – was muted by the thick, comforting silence within.  Barty hummed a low, melancholic tune as he meticulously sharpened his straight razor, the honed steel glinting under the weak light, reflecting the weariness etched into his own weathered face.  He’d seen a lot of faces in his fifty-odd years behind that barber chair – faces etched with joy, sorrow, hope, despair – and each one held a story, a silent narrative he’d absorbed, thread by thread, into the fabric of his own life.  Today, however, felt different. A nervous energy crackled in the air, a premonition as sharp as his freshly sharpened blade.
