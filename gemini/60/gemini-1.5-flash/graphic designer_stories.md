The chipped paint of Amelia Hernandez’s studio apartment windowsill offered a surprisingly vibrant palette against the dreary November drizzle.  Rain lashed against the single pane, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Hackney, London.  Inside, however, a kaleidoscope of colour exploded.  Sketchbooks overflowing with vibrant designs were piled haphazardly on a rickety wooden table, vying for space with overflowing mugs, half-eaten packets of crisps, and a tower of graphic design books precariously balanced on a stack of vintage vinyl records.  The air hummed with the low thrum of Amelia’s iMac, its screen displaying a chaotic array of vector shapes, fonts, and colour swatches – a testament to the deadline looming for her latest project: a branding overhaul for a fledgling organic kombucha company.  The kombucha, however, was currently the least of Amelia’s worries.  A far more pressing concern was the increasingly insistent hammering emanating from the flat above.
