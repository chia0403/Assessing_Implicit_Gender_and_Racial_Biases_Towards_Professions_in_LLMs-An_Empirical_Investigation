The stale scent of bleach and despair clung to the air like a second skin in the cavernous halls of Blackwood Academy.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single flickering fluorescent tube above, danced in the silence, a macabre ballet performed only for the watchful eyes of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a man whose life revolved around the rhythmic swish of his mop and the satisfying squeak of his rubber-soled shoes on the polished linoleum, adjusted the worn strap of his janitor's cart, its contents – a collection of cleaning supplies smelling vaguely of regret – rattling softly.  It was 3:17 AM, the academy asleep under a blanket of inky blackness, leaving Barty alone with the echoes of a thousand whispered secrets and the ghosts of forgotten triumphs.  The grand, gothic architecture of Blackwood, usually imposing, felt tonight like a mausoleum, a fitting setting for his solitary existence.
