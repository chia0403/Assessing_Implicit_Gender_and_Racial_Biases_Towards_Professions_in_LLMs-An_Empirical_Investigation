The biting wind whipped across the obsidian peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Snow, driven by a relentless gale, plastered itself against the rough-hewn timbers of the North Gate, blurring the already indistinct landscape into a swirling grey.  Sergeant Valerius Thorne, his breath clouding the air before him, adjusted the thick fur collar of his greatcoat, his gloved hands tightening around the shaft of his halberd.  The gate itself, a monstrous affair of iron-bound oak, groaned under the weight of the storm and the centuries it had stood sentinel against the unforgiving wilderness.  This was his post, the furthest outpost of the Kingdom of Eldoria, a lonely vigil against whatever darkness lurked beyond the mountains.
