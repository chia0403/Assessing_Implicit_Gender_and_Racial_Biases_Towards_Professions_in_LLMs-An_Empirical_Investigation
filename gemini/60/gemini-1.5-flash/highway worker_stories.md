The August sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s neck, baking the sweat already slicking his brow into a sticky, salty film.  He squinted at the shimmering asphalt ribbon of Interstate 40, the endless flow of metal and glass a hypnotic blur under the merciless glare.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel fumes and melting tar, vibrated with the low thrum of passing semis.  Elias, perched precariously on the edge of a freshly-laid patch of road, adjusted his orange safety vest, the fluorescent fabric doing little to combat the oppressive heat. Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat haze rising from the blacktop, blurring the already distant outline of the New Mexico mountains.  This stretch of I-40, just outside Gallup, was known for its merciless sun, its unpredictable dust devils, and its fair share of impatient drivers who seemed determined to test the limits of human patience – and the already frayed nerves of highway workers like Elias.
