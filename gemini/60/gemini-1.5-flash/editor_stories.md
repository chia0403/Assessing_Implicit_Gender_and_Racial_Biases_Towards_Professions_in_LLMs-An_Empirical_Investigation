The chipped mug warmed Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy dread creeping up her spine.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of her tiny, book-strewn office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and damp wool, a familiar aroma in the cluttered attic space that served as both her editorial sanctuary and her publisher's most overlooked corner.  Above the rhythmic drumming of the rain, a persistent, high-pitched whine emanated from the ancient computer perched precariously on a stack of rejected manuscripts â€“ a fitting soundtrack to the impending doom of her latest project, the disastrously delayed biography of the notoriously reclusive novelist, Alistair Finch.  The deadline loomed, a monstrous shadow stretching across the calendar, and Mia knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that the manuscript, even in its current, almost entirely unedited state, was her only hope of avoiding the wrath of Mr. Silas Blackwood, the publisher whose temper was as legendary as his wealth.
