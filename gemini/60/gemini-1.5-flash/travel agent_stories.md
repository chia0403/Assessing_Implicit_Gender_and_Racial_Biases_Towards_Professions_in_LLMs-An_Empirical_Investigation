The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume Amelia Hernandez, Travel Agent Extraordinaire (at least, that's what her business cards boldly proclaimed), found strangely soothing.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass window of her tiny shop, "Wanderlust Adventures," blurring the already faded image of a sun-drenched Tuscan villa.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the glass, illuminating a chaotic collection of travel brochures, half-packed suitcases, and a frankly alarming number of miniature Eiffel Towers.  Outside, the cobbled street of Charleston's historic French Quarter glistened under the relentless downpour, the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages a muffled counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Ameliaâ€™s fingers on her ancient, but stubbornly reliable, typewriter.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos felt suffocating, the scent of spices a bitter reminder of a trip she'd never take.
