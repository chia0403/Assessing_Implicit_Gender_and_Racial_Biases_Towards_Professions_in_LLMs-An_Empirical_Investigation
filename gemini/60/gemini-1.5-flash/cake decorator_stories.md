The air hung thick and sweet in the "Sugarplum Sweet Shoppe," a scent so cloying it almost vibrated.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above Amelia Rose Hathaway's workbench, danced in the golden afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpanes.  Amelia, a woman whose perpetually flour-dusted apron was a testament to her dedication, hummed a slightly off-key rendition of "Happy Birthday" as she meticulously piped delicate forget-me-nots onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the ivory frosting gleaming under the weak light.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint to her cheerful melody, rattling the already fragile windowpanes.  The shop, tucked away on a forgotten corner of Halsted Street, felt both comforting and isolated, a sugary sanctuary in the midst of a bustling, indifferent city.
