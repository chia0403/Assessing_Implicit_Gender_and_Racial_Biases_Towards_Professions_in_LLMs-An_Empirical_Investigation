The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves mingled with the sharper, sweeter aroma of pine from the surrounding woods, clinging to her thick wool coat like a second skin.  This wasn't the picturesque, sun-drenched sanctuary advertised in the brochures for Whispering Pines Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. This was the reality: mud-caked boots, perpetually frost-nipped fingers, and the constant, low-level hum of anxious animal sounds emanating from the various enclosures scattered across the sprawling, hilly property.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the ancient oaks that guarded the center, painting the already melancholic landscape in shades of bruised purple and fading gold.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet was punctuated by an unsettlingly sharp series of barks and growls emanating from the quarantine section â€“ a sound that sent a shiver, separate from the cold, down Amelia's spine.
