The unfinished statue of St. Columba, half-emerged from its rocky prison, seemed to mock him with its patient stillness, a stark contrast to the frantic energy of the storm raging around them.  The quarry, a gaping wound in the mountainside, was a place of both beauty and brutal hardship, a fitting reflection of Elias Thorne's own life.
