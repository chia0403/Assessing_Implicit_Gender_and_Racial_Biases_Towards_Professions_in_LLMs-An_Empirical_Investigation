The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her pen against the overflowing in-tray, a silent testament to the mountain of paperwork that awaited her, a mountain dwarfed only by the emotional weight of her current caseload.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of adolescent chaos was punctuated by an unsettling silence.  The only sound, besides the relentless rain, was the frantic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a morbid reminder of time relentlessly marching on, leaving little room for mistakes.
