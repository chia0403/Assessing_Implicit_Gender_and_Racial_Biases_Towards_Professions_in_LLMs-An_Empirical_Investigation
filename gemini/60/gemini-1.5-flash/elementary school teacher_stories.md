The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the already dusty windowsill, mirroring the slow decay of Eleanor’s own enthusiasm.  It was the last week of school, a week typically reserved for celebratory crafts and sugar-fueled chaos, but this year felt…different.  The usual buzz of excited chatter was replaced by a low hum of restless energy, a palpable sense of anticipation hanging heavy in the air like the humid July heat clinging to the brick walls of Crestwood Elementary.  Sunlight slanted in through the tall, arched windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stagnant air and highlighting the faded crayon drawings tacked haphazardly to the bulletin board – a testament to a year of triumphs and tantrums, now fading into the hazy memories of summer vacation.
