The air, thick with the scent of expensive perfume and damp wool, held a peculiar stillness, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the lobby and the occasional creak of the ancient elevator groaning its way upwards.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of opulent activity felt muted, replaced by a palpable sense of anticipation, tinged with something darker… something akin to dread.
