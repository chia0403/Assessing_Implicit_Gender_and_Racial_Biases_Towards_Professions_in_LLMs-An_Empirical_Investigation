The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the damp, salt-laced breeze that whipped through the open doorway of "Shear Madness," a tiny, almost painfully cheerful salon perched precariously on the edge of the Cornish cliffs.  Seagulls shrieked a discordant chorus, their cries a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of scissors wielded by Aurelia "Rel"  Penhaligon, whose nimble fingers danced across a head of unruly auburn curls. Rel, a woman whose age was as elusive as the shifting sands below, possessed eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a laugh that could charm the birds from the sky â€“ or at least, momentarily silence the gulls outside.  The salon itself, painted a vibrant, almost offensively optimistic yellow, felt like a defiant splash of sunshine against the backdrop of the brooding, grey Atlantic.  Inside, the only other sound besides the scissors was the gentle hum of the hairdryer, a constant companion to the rhythmic pulse of the ocean.
