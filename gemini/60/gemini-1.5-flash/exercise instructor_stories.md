The fluorescent lights of the "Body & Soul Fitness Center" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of twenty-something feet pounding the polished wood floor.  Sweat, the pungent aroma of exertion mingled with vanilla-scented cleaning solution, hung heavy in the air.  Instructor Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her dark braid whipping against her sculpted shoulders as she demonstrated a particularly challenging burpee variation, didn't notice.  Her focus was laser-sharp, her gaze sweeping across the room, correcting postures, encouraging lagging participants with a sharp, encouraging word.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful song, a stark contrast to the carefully curated energy within the walls of Body & Soul – an energy Amelia, with her infectious enthusiasm and unwavering dedication, had personally cultivated.  Tonight, however, even Amelia’s meticulously crafted routine felt…off. A prickling unease, subtle as the shift in a muscle’s tension, had settled deep in her bones.
