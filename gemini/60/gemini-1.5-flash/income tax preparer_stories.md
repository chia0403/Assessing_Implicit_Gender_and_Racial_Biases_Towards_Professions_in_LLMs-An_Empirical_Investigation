The fluorescent lights of Evelyn Reed's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  It was April 14th, the day before the deadline, and the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, desperation, and the faint, lingering odor of last year's W-2s.  Evelyn, whose full name was Evelyn Beatrice Reed, but who preferred simply "Evelyn," adjusted her glasses, a slight tremor in her hand betraying the mounting stress. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful dirge, mirroring the anxieties of her clients, currently represented by Mr. Henderson, a nervous man whose crumpled tax forms lay scattered across her desk like fallen leaves.  The office itself, a cramped space above a laundromat in a slightly less-than-desirable part of Lincoln Park, felt less like a sanctuary of fiscal responsibility and more like a battlefield littered with the casualties of complicated deductions and forgotten receipts.
