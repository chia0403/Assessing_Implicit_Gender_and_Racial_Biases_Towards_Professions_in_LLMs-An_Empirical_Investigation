The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes of his tiny shop, a rhythmic drumming against the silence broken only by the occasional hiss of his shears and the gentle rasp of his thimbled finger against the coarse linen.  Oakhaven itself was nestled deep within a valley, shrouded in mist that clung to the steep, moss-covered hills like a shroud.  The town, a collection of crooked, grey-stone houses huddled around a cobbled square, seemed perpetually bathed in twilight, even on the brightest of days.  Elias, hunched over a half-finished doublet of deep emerald velvet, barely registered the storm.  His world was confined to the precise measurements, the delicate stitch, the whisper of the needle weaving its magic through the fabric. Tonight, however, even the familiar comfort of his craft feltâ€¦ different.  A premonition, perhaps, as sharp and unsettling as the prick of a needle gone astray.
