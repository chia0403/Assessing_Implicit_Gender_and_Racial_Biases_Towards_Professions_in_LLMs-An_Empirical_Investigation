The brass nameplate gleamed under the low, amber light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby:  *Augustus "Gus" Finch, Concierge*.  Gus, however, wasn't polishing it.  He was hunched over a miniature Eiffel Tower, meticulously picking lint from its tiny, painstakingly crafted spire.  The Grand Majestic, a behemoth of Beaux-Arts architecture, hummed around him – a symphony of hushed conversations, the clinking of ice in crystal glasses, and the distant, rhythmic thrum of the city that never slept just beyond its imposing sandstone facade.  Rain lashed against the enormous arched windows, blurring the glittering cityscape into an Impressionist painting of light and shadow.  The air, thick with the scent of expensive perfume and old money, carried a faint undercurrent of something else… something metallic and unsettling.  Tonight, Gus suspected, would be anything but routine.
