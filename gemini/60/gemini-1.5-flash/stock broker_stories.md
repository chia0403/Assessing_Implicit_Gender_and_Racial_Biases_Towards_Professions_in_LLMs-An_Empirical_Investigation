The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Worthington’s perfectly coiffed auburn bob across her face as she navigated the swirling vortex of humanity outside the New York Stock Exchange.  Rain, sleet, and melting snow had transformed the usually granite-grey streets into a treacherous, glistening mess.  Mia, however, barely registered the discomfort.  Her gaze was fixed on the towering edifice before her, its Beaux-Arts grandeur a stark contrast to the raw, chaotic energy pulsing from within – an energy that thrummed in her veins as surely as her own heartbeat.  The scent of exhaust fumes and damp wool mingled with the faint, underlying aroma of expensive coffee and ambition, a heady cocktail she’d grown accustomed to, a fragrance as familiar as her own signature scent of sandalwood and bergamot.  Tonight, however, the usual thrill of the hunt was tinged with something else… a prickle of unease that snaked its way down her spine, colder than the November wind.
