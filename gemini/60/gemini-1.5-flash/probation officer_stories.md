The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s already-frazzled hair across her face as she navigated the crumbling concrete steps of the Northwood Projects.  Grey skies mirrored the grim mood settling over her; a mood heavier than the damp chill clinging to her worn wool coat.  The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and something acrid – burnt sugar, maybe, or something less pleasant.  Northwood wasn't known for its culinary delights, more for its persistent undercurrent of simmering discontent, a simmer that, for Mia, often threatened to boil over.  Her battered Ford Focus, parked precariously on a patch of cracked asphalt, seemed to share the general air of neglect.  This was her beat, her daily bread, and, lately, her growing despair.  Tonight's visit was to see Elias Vance, a repeat offender whose probation was teetering on the precipice of revocation, a fact that both terrified and irritated Mia in equal measure.  The flickering porch light of Vance’s building cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the rustling leaves, a morbid ballet playing out against the backdrop of peeling paint and boarded-up windows.  This wasn't just a job; it was a descent into the heart of the city's darkness, a darkness Mia knew all too well.
