The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine “Amy” Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air tasted of salt and impending rain, a fitting atmosphere for the bleak, windswept Shetland Islands where she’d chosen to film her latest project, *The Raven’s Cry*.  The tiny village of Eshaness clung precariously to the cliff edge, its stone houses huddled together like frightened sheep against the relentless assault of the elements.  Amy shivered, pulling her thick wool coat tighter around her.  This wasn't the glamorous Hollywood she was used to; this was raw, unforgiving beauty, a stark contrast to the meticulously crafted sets she was accustomed to commanding. But it was precisely this rawness, this untamed spirit, that she needed to capture the soul of her film – a gritty, atmospheric thriller based on a local legend of a vengeful sea spirit.
