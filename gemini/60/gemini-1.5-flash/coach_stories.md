The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate soccer field.  Dead leaves, the color of dried blood, skittered across the muddied turf, clinging to the worn-out goalposts like ghostly flags.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke from the distant houses clinging to the edge of the small town of Havenwood, a place where time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace – a pace that Amy, with her relentless drive and tightly wound energy, found increasingly frustrating.  The fading light cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal branches of the surrounding oaks, making the already forlorn scene even more bleak.  Tonight, however, the emptiness wasn't entirely unwelcome.  The silence, broken only by the occasional rustle of wind in the trees, provided a stark contrast to the usual cacophony of shouting and the thud of cleats on the ground that usually filled her life.  Tonight, Amy Hernandez, head coach of the Havenwood High School girls' soccer team, needed the quiet. She needed to think.
