The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Esmelia "Esme" Finch-Hathaway's hand, the floral pattern blurring slightly as she stared out at the relentless downpour lashing against the grimy windows of the dilapidated theatre.  Rainwater streamed down the dusty panes, mirroring the rivulets of anxiety tracing a path down her own cheeks. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp plaster and forgotten dreams, a perfume all too familiar to Esme, the artistic director of the crumbling, but undeniably charming,  Grand Majestic Theatre on Bleecker Street.  Tonight, the grand opening of her ambitious, and some might say foolhardy, production of "King Lear" was mere hours away, and the theatre, a magnificent Victorian relic, seemed determined to sabotage her every effort.  The leaky roof, the temperamental lighting, the perpetually disgruntled stagehand â€“ it all conspired against her, a symphony of chaos threatening to drown out the tragic beauty of Shakespeare's masterpiece.
