The wind, a raw, insistent claw, ripped across the plains, whipping dust devils into frenzied dances across the parched earth.  Sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down on the cracked, ochre soil of the Broken Spur Ranch.  Dust clung to everything: the weathered timbers of the foreman's cabin, the rusting barbed wire fences, and even to the leathery face of Silas "Mac" McAlister, a man etched by the sun and shaped by the unforgiving landscape.  Mac, his Stetson pulled low against the gale, squinted at the distant horizon, his gaze as sharp and weathered as the ancient granite outcroppings that dotted the ranch.  He hadn't seen a decent rain in months, and the worry lines etched around his eyes deepened with each gust of wind.  The Broken Spur, his family's legacy for three generations, was on the brink, a testament to the harsh beauty and relentless cruelty of the Texas Panhandle.
