The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her seaside clinic into submission.  Wind, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, howled a mournful tune around the weathered clapboard building, perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.  The late October sun, a weak and watery orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled, wind-twisted pines that clung to the cliff edge.  Inside, the warmth of the clinic, a stark contrast to the blustery outside, was punctuated by the gentle hum of the waiting room's aquarium – a small, vibrant splash of tropical colour in the otherwise muted palette of sea-worn greys and blues.  Eleanor, her dark hair whipping around her face, finally secured the awning, a sigh escaping her lips as she surveyed her domain – a sanctuary of healing nestled against the unforgiving wildness of the Cornish coast.
