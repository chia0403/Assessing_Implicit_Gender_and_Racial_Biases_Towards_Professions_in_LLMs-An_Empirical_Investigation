Inside, amidst the comforting chaos of hair dryers and the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors, Amelia's usually pristine workspace was a battlefield.  A half-finished balayage sat abandoned on a styling chair, a rogue curling iron lay smoking on the floor, and a trail of mysteriously purple hairspray led from the back room to the shattered remains of a ridiculously expensive ceramic unicorn figurine.  Tonight, Amelia Hernandez wasn't just battling bad hair days; she was battling a full-blown catastrophe.
