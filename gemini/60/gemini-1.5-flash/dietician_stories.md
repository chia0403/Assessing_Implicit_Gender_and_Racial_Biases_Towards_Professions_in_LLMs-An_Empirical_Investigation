The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she leaned against the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her crisp white coat.  The churning grey waters of the Puget Sound separated her from Bainbridge Island, a picturesque speck of evergreen and ochre against the brooding sky.  Autumn had arrived with a vengeance, painting the landscape in shades of russet and gold, but the air held a chill that promised a harsher winter ahead.  Eleanor, however, wasn't focused on the scenic beauty, nor the impending cold. Her mind was preoccupied with the upcoming consultation: a notoriously difficult client, a reclusive novelist with a penchant for absinthe and a deeply unsettling aversion to vegetables.  The ferry lurched, throwing her slightly off balance, and she gripped the railing tighter, a sudden anxiety tightening its icy fingers around her heart. This wasn't just another nutrition consultation; this was a challenge that threatened to unravel more than just her client's unhealthy eating habits.
