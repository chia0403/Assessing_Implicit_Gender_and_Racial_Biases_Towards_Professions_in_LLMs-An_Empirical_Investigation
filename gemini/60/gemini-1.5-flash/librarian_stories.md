The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that usually soothed Elara Vance, Head Librarian of the Blackwood Memorial Library.  But tonight, the familiar aroma did little to calm the tremor in her hands as she traced the faded, gilt lettering on the spine of the ancient grimoire.  Dust motes, disturbed by the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the gothic arched window, danced in the near-total darkness of the Special Collections room.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad against the rain-lashed panes, a counterpoint to the frantic thump-thump-thump of Elara's own heart.  The library, usually a sanctuary of quiet contemplation, felt tonight like a mausoleum, its towering shelves lined not with comforting stories, but with silent, watchful shadows.
