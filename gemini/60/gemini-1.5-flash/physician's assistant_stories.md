The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  The air, thick with the smell of woodsmoke and brine from the nearby harbor, stung her lungs.

She tugged her gloves tighter, the leather stiff and unforgiving against the chill.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard image of coastal Maine tourists often saw; this was Rock Harbor, a town carved from granite and grit, a place where the relentless ocean dictated the rhythm of life, and where Mia Hernandez, Physician's Assistant, was the only game in town when it came to immediate medical attention.  The emergency call had come in just an hour ago, a terse message crackling over the static-filled radio in her battered Jeep: “Fishing boat accident.  Multiple injuries.  Urgent.”
