The chipped paint of the "Sunny Days Child Care" sign flaked onto the overgrown lawn like a confetti of despair.  Twenty-year-old Elara Jeannette Blackwood shivered, pulling her worn cardigan tighter against the biting November wind that whipped through the gaps in the dilapidated fence.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled oak tree that dominated the playground, its branches like clawing fingers against the bruised purple sky.  Inside, the muffled sounds of children’s laughter – a brittle, fragile sound – offered little comfort against the creeping chill that seemed to seep from the very foundation of the building. Elara sighed, the breath misting in the frigid air.  Another long day at Sunny Days, another mountain of paperwork, and another unsettling feeling that something wasn't quite right about this place, a feeling that had been growing stronger with each passing week.
