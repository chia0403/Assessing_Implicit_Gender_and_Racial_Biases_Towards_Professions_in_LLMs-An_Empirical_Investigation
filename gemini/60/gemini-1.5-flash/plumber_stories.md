The biting November wind howled a mournful tune down the narrow, cobbled lanes of Oakhaven, rattling the loose window panes in the ancient houses that clung precariously to the cliffside.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered Amelia "Amy" Worthington's already damp overalls to her lean frame.  The aroma of woodsmoke and brine hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood that faintly clung to the damp concrete beneath her worn work boots.  Amy, a plumber whose calloused hands were more accustomed to wrestling with stubborn pipes than crime scenes, stared down at the crimson stain spreading across the alleyway, a shiver running deeper than the chill wind.  Her trusty wrench, usually her comfort, felt strangely inadequate in the face of this unsettling discovery. The flickering gaslight of the nearby pub cast long, distorted shadows, making the already claustrophobic alley seem even more menacing.  Tonight, Amy Worthington's plumbing skills were the least of her worries.
