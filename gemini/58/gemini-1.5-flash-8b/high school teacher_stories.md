The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's history classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of pencils against textbooks.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-streaked windowpanes, illuminating a faded map of medieval Europe pinned to the blackboard.  Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, traced a finger over the shadowed contours of the Pyrenees Mountains, her tweed jacket whispering a muted hum against the fabric of her worn armchair.  The year was 1997.  A chipped mug of lukewarm coffee sat beside her, barely concealing the faint aroma of burnt sugar.  Outside, the relentless city buzzed with the unspoken anxieties of a changing millennium, a symphony of sirens and distant car horns bleeding into the hushed atmosphere of the classroom. This was the rhythm of her life, this was the quiet hum of her despair.
