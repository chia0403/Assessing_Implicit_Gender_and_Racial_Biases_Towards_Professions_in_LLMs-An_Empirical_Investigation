The air in "The Cleaver's Cut," hung thick with the scent of brine-cured ham and roasting beef.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows, illuminating the glint of steel on the butcher block.  Barnaby "Barn" Blackwood, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused, spoke volumes of a life spent carving meat, meticulously trimmed the fat from a hefty sirloin.  He’d been at it for hours, the rhythmic thud of his cleaver echoing through the narrow shop, a counterpoint to the murmur of the city outside.  The year was 1888, and the Spitalfields district of London teemed with the hustle and bustle of a working-class neighborhood, sounds of clanging streetcars and hawkers' cries bleeding into the shop's interior.  Barn, with his perpetually furrowed brow and the faintest hint of a scar tracing the edge of his left eye, felt a familiar hum of unease.  Something was amiss.  Not in the butcher shop itself – the constant ebb and flow of customers, each with their specific needs – but in the city around him, a feeling as thick and pervasive as the roasting meat's aroma.
