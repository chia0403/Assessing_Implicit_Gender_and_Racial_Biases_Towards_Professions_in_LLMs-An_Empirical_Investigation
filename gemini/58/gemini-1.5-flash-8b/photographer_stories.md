The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks.  Frozen rain, a fine, relentless mist, coated the cobblestones of the Rue de la Mort, a street that lived up to its name, a ghostly artery snaking through the shadowed heart of the old Parisian quarter.  Amelia, a photographer with eyes the colour of stormy seas, crouched low behind a crumbling stone archway, her breath fogging in the frigid air.  Her Leica, nestled securely in its leather case, felt strangely warm in her gloved hand.  The decaying floral patterns of the crumbling facade, the gaunt figures hurrying past in their thick coats, the overall melancholic atmosphere â€“ it all whispered a story.  And Amelia, a chronicler of forgotten tales, was determined to capture it.  Tonight, the Rue de la Mort held a secret, and Amelia Blackwood intended to unearth it, one shutter click at a time.
