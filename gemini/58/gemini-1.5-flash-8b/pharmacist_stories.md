The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull grey from years of lukewarm water and countless forgotten vials, reflected Elias Thorneâ€™s worried face.  The flickering fluorescent lights of "Apothecary's Corner" cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered shelves, piled high with jars of herbs, bottles of tinctures, and rows upon rows of meticulously labeled prescriptions.  Dust motes danced in the lone beam of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faded photograph nestled amongst a stack of ancient medical texts.  It depicted a younger, beaming Elias, a mischievous glint in his eye, surrounded by equally enthusiastic friends in the bustling marketplace of  Veridia, a city nestled between the whispering pines of the Whispering Woods and the shimmering emerald waters of the Sunken Lagoon.  This Veridia, however, was a ghost of its former self, its vibrant market now reduced to a skeletal collection of shuttered stalls and crumbling cobblestones.

Elias, a pharmacist of impeccable reputation in his younger days, now found himself the sole custodian of Apothecary's Corner, a dwindling business in a dwindling city. He was Elias Thorne, 47 years old, his once-bright eyes now veiled with a perpetual weariness that matched the aging mortar and brick of his shop.  The scent of sandalwood and lavender, normally comforting, now felt like a cruel reminder of the lost vibrancy of the past.
