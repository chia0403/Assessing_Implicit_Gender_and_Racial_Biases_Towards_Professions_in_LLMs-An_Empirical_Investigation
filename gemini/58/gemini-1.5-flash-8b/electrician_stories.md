The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electric Fix-It" cast an oily, sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Market Square.  A shiver ran through Elias Thorne, an electrician with a reputation as sharp as his wire cutters, as he wrestled a recalcitrant cable.  The air, thick with the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp earth, buzzed with the low hum of the city, a symphony of street vendors, clanging trams, and the constant, rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the ancient fountain in the centre of the square.  Elias,  his weathered leather jacket plastered to his back by the cold, cursed under his breath. This wasn't your average electrical fault.  This was somethingâ€¦ *else*.


The setting was a bustling, historical Old Market Square, shrouded in the early evening chill of a Northern European city.  The cobblestones, slick with rain, reflected the oily yellow light from the flickering neon sign above Sparky's Electric Fix-It, a small, slightly ramshackle shop nestled amongst the stalls and shops of the market.  The air was thick with the aromas of roasted meats and spices, mingling with the smell of damp earth and the metallic tang of the city's industrial heart.
