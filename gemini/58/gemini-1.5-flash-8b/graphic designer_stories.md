The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Pixel Pushers" office hummed a constant, low-grade anxiety.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the shared workspace, mirroring the relentless pressure building inside Amelia Blackwood, a graphic designer with a portfolio as polished as a freshly-waxed floor and a soul as frayed as a tangled wire.  Empty takeout containers, discarded coffee cups, and stacks of half-finished designs littered the communal table, a testament to the all-consuming nature of deadlines and the relentless pursuit of pixel perfection.  Amelia, hunched over her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard, was drowning in a sea of clients demanding urgent revisions and a relentless stream of design briefings that felt more like convoluted riddles than creative challenges.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a metropolis choked by smog and shrouded in perpetual twilight, threatened to swallow the entire building whole.  The year was 2042.
