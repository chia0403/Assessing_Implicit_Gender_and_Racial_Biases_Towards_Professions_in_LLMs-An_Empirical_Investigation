The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of "The Clipper's Cut," a barbershop nestled in the heart of the forgotten district of Oakhaven.  Cobblestone streets, cracked and uneven, echoed with the muted rumble of carts and the distant cries of hawkers.  A perpetual scent of stale coffee, old leather, and something vaguely floral clung to the air, a peculiar aroma that was both comforting and unsettling, like a familiar friend who'd seen better days.  Barty, a man weathered by more years than he cared to count, ran a calloused hand through his thinning grey hair, a sigh escaping his lips like a puff of smoke.  Another day, another endless cycle of quiet whispers and hushed anxieties in the bustling, yet eerily empty, street outside.  He adjusted his spectacles, his gaze drifting to the faded, almost illegible, sign above the door that read "The Clipper's Cut" in what seemed to be a forgotten script.  Today, however, felt different.  The usual quiet hum of the city seemed... amplified.
