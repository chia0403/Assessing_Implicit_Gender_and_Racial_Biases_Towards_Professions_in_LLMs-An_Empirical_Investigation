The biting wind whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient, gnarled oaks that ringed the Citadel of Eldoria, a constant, mournful symphony.  Snow, the consistency of crushed glass, crunched under the boots of Sergeant Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The Citadel, a fortress carved from obsidian and shrouded in perpetual twilight, stood sentinel over the valley, its towering walls a stark contrast to the desolate landscape.  A perpetual gloom clung to the stone, punctuated only by the flickering torchlight of the guards posted at intervals along the ramparts.  Elias, his thick, grey cloak pulled tight against the biting wind, felt the familiar weight of responsibility pressing down on him.  He was a veteran of countless patrols, his face etched with the weariness of years spent protecting the fragile peace within these impenetrable walls.  Tonight, however, the usual quietude was fractured by a disturbing anomaly.  A faint, almost imperceptible hum, unlike any sound he had ever heard within the Citadel, resonated from deep within its shadowed heart.
