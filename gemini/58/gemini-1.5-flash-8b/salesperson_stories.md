The fluorescent lights of the "Gadgetorium" hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Stone's heels against the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the artificial light, mimicking the swirling, chaotic thoughts in her head.  It was Tuesday, the slowest day of the week in the electronics megastore, and Amelia, a sales associate specializing in the company's revolutionary "Chrono-Synch" wristwatches, was staring at a display of sleek, silver timepieces.  Each one, a marvel of miniature engineering, pulsed with a soft, internal light.  But none of them seemed to hold the same allure as the half-empty display case of the new "Chrono-Flow" models, which had been languishing there for the past three weeks.

The Gadgetorium, a sprawling, glass-and-steel behemoth in the heart of the burgeoning tech district, was designed to overwhelm.  Endless aisles crammed with every imaginable gizmo, gadget, and contraption imaginable snaked through the cavernous space, mirroring the dizzying array of possibilities Amelia felt constantly swirling within her own mind.  The scent of burnt coffee, a byproduct of the twenty-four-hour operations, mingled with the faint, chemical tang of newly manufactured technology.  Today, however, the only sounds besides the hum of the lights were the occasional rustle of a discarded packaging and the faint clatter of Ameliaâ€™s own restless energy.  She desperately needed a sale.
