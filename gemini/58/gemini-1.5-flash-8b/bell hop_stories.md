The brass bell, polished to a mirror sheen, vibrated faintly in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's hand.  The Grand Majestic Hotel, a sprawling edifice of brick and ornate ironwork, loomed over the cobbled street, its many windows glinting like scattered jewels in the late afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light filtering through the high arched entryway.  Barty, a lanky young man with perpetually tired eyes and a mop of unruly brown hair, adjusted the worn velvet band around his cap.  Heâ€™d seen this vista countless times, this symphony of creaking wooden floors, the murmur of hushed conversations, the rhythmic clatter of trays, and the faint scent of lilies clinging to the air. But today, something felt different.  A sense of unease, a subtle tremor in the air, a disquiet that settled like a heavy blanket over the hotel.  He hoped it was nothing more than the usual pre-storm anxiety the city seemed to harbour.  His job was to smooth over wrinkles, not to unravel mysteries.  But the whispers, barely audible at first, were growing louder.  They drifted around the grand ballroom, where the upcoming gala was already shaping itself into a breathtaking display of opulence and power, and followed Barty as he made his way through the maze of corridors.
