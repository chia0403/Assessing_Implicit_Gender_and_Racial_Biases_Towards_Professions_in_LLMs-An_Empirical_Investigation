The fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's existence.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the stacks, illuminating a symphony of forgotten knowledge, and a lonely figure hunched over a discarded copy of "The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe."  Barty, the library's night-shift janitor, was, as always, meticulously wiping down the chipped mahogany desk in the hushed, hushed silence of the otherwise empty reading room.  The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and disinfectant, a familiar aroma that both soothed and irritated him.


The Grand Zenith Library was a monument to the past, its towering architecture a gothic tapestry woven from stone and glass.  Once a vibrant hub of intellectual activity, the library now attracted few visitors.  Its grandeur was marred by years of neglect, the gilded accents dulled, the marble floors stained with countless unknown liquids.  A palpable sense of history, both glorious and decaying, filled the cavernous halls.  Dust clung to everything, from the antique globes to the intricately carved bookcases, a silent testament to the library's slow, inexorable decline.  Even the grand oak doors seemed to sigh in the quiet.
