The biting wind, a razor-sharp whisper against the weathered stone of the quarry walls, clawed at Elara Stonehand's exposed skin.  Dust, the colour of aged parchment, swirled around her, coating her rough-spun tunic and clinging to the sweat that beaded on her brow.  High above, the jagged peaks of the Draken Mountains, eternally draped in a shroud of mist, loomed like sentinels over the valley, their silent, watchful presence a constant reminder of the raw, unforgiving beauty that surrounded her.  This was the quarry of Eldoria, a place where the very heart of the earth was laid bare, a landscape carved and sculpted by time and the relentless hands of men.  Elara, daughter of Gorin Stonehand, a master craftsman renowned throughout the kingdom for his exquisite carvings, was no stranger to the harsh realities of this demanding profession.  But even for her, this particular morning held a foreboding chill, a silent promise of something extraordinary, or perhaps, something terribly wrong.
