The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faded poster of a smiling tooth-fairy.

Her small, cluttered office, a testament to years of accumulated dental tools and patient charts, felt more like a haven than a workplace.  Stacks of X-rays, each a silent record of someone else’s pain, pressed against the wall.  The smell of antiseptic, always present, mingled with the faint, metallic tang of blood.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind that stretched on like a stubborn filling, waiting to be extracted.
