The chipped Formica countertop, stained a perpetual, slightly oily beige, reflected the fluorescent hum of the Legal Eagle law firm.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s chest.  Her pen, a well-loved Bic Cristal, hovered over a page of meticulously organized legal documents.  Across the small, cluttered office, the rhythmic clatter of keys and the low growl of a client's frustrated voice, punctuated by exasperated sighs, formed a soundtrack to Elara's daily struggle.  She was a paralegal at Legal Eagle, a small firm specializing in personal injury cases, and today, as usual, was a disaster waiting to happen.  The case, *Rodriguez vs. the Acme Trucking Corporation*, was already a week behind schedule.
