The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Salt spray stung her cheeks, a familiar companion on the rugged shores of Islehaven.  Islehaven, a tiny archipelago clinging precariously to the Scottish mainland, was a world apart, a place where the whispers of the sea mingled with the bleating of sheep and the mournful cries of the gannets.  It wasn't a place for the faint of heart, or the comfortably housed, but it was home for Amelia, a veterinarian with calloused hands and a heart filled with the quiet dignity of the wild.  Her small, single-storey clinic, "The Healing Cove," nestled amongst the jagged cliffs, was a testament to her dedication, a beacon of hope for the animals of this unforgiving landscape.  A lone gull wheeled overhead, its piercing cry cutting through the wind, a symphony of the solitude Amelia knew so well.  Today, however, the cries seemedâ€¦different.  An almost frantic, worried tone, unlike the usual mournful calls.
