The biting wind, a relentless terrier, whipped at Amelia Blackwood's worn pea coat, tugging at the frayed edges of her scarf.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the forgotten allotments, swirling the skeletal remains of last year's sunflowers into swirling eddies.  November in the Lower Fields was always a brutal mistress, and Amelia, proprietor of Blackwood's Blooms, wasn't one to shy away from a challenge.  Even if that challenge involved battling the elements and the growing sense of despair that clung to the neglected plots like frost on a windowpane.

The setting:  The Lower Fields, a forgotten expanse of derelict allotments nestled between the sprawling city and the whispering woods on the outskirts of Ashbury.  Twisted, gnarled trees clawed at a bruised sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the uneven terrain.  Abandoned gardening tools, rusted and broken, lay scattered like discarded memories among the weeds and patches of overgrown wildflowers.  A sense of neglect permeated the air, a thick, earthy aroma that mingled with the sharp scent of pine and the chilling bite of the wind.  Ameliaâ€™s small, battered van, a familiar refuge of worn-out tools and fragrant soil, was the sole testament to life clinging to this forgotten corner of the world.
