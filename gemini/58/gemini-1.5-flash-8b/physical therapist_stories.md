The fluorescent lights of the rehabilitation clinic hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Hayes's footsteps.  She navigated the sterile hallway, the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee a constant companion.  Today, like every other Monday, the pressure was on.  Amelia, Physical Therapist at the sprawling, city-bound "Rebound Rehabilitation Center,"  had a caseload heavier than a weighted vest.  Eight patients, ranging from a young woman recovering from a skiing accident to a retired carpenter battling chronic back pain, all demanding her attention, all with stories that unfolded like intricate tapestries of life and loss.  The clinic, a sprawling, four-story structure overlooking the bustling urban landscape of New Zenith, felt like a concrete jungle, a place where bodies were repaired, spirits mended, and dreams sometimes re-stitched.  The city's relentless energy – the screech of speeding cars, the distant sirens, the constant thrum of activity – seeped into the building, creating a backdrop of both relentless pressure and quiet resilience.  Amelia took a deep breath, the air thick with the weight of responsibility.  Today, one particular patient’s case was especially troubling; a young artist named Leo, and the intricate dance between his art and his recovery.
