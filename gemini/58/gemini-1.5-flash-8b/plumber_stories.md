The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alder Street.  Water, a constant companion in this city built on a forgotten riverbed, trickled down the gutters, mirroring the relentless drip-drip-drip echoing from within the cramped workshop of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, a plumber of some renown, or rather, some grudging respect amongst the denizens of the Quarter.  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of solder and the faint, musty scent of old pipes.  Barty, a man whose weathered face bore the scars of countless battles against leaky faucets and overflowing toilets, squinted at the miniature waterlogged model of a house, a miniature disaster-in-waiting clutched in his calloused hands.  His workshop, a cramped space barely bigger than a small stable, was crammed with tools and supplies, each one a testament to a past struggle or future repair.  The rhythmic clang of his wrench against pipe was a mournful counterpoint to the incessant patter of rain.
