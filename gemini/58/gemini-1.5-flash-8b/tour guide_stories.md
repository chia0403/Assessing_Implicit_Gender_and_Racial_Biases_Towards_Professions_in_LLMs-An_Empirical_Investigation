The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, snow-dusted courtyard of the Château de Valois.  Frozen icicles clung to the weathered stonework, mirroring the brittle, almost glacial, atmosphere clinging to the air.  The rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages, muffled by the thick blanket of snow, was the only sound besides the mournful howl of the wind.  It was a crisp December morning, the kind that painted the Loire Valley in a stark, ethereal beauty, a beauty that both captivated and chilled Amelia to the bone.  Today's tour, a small group of five affluent art collectors, was proving to be more challenging than she'd anticipated.


Amelia, a thirty-two-year-old with eyes the colour of stormy grey skies and a voice that carried the resonant warmth of the antique books she adored, was a Certified Historical Tour Guide for the Loire Valley. Her meticulous knowledge of the region, its history and its art, was legendary amongst her peers. Yet, today, the silence hanging heavy in the air felt thick, almost tangible.  A single, flickering candle in the chateau’s entrance hall cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the tour's subdued energy.  One could almost taste the centuries of whispered secrets and clandestine affairs that had echoed within these very walls.  Amelia knew, however, that today's expedition was more than just a tour; it was a test.  A test of her ability to weave captivating tales in the face of potential disappointment.
