The biting wind whipped across the frozen expanse of Lake Geneva, stinging Amelia Petrova's cheeks.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and snow, vibrated with a low, rhythmic thrum – the sound of the ice beneath her skates, a soundtrack to the silent, brutal beauty of winter.  Amelia, her breath fogging in the frigid air, adjusted the thick, wool cap pulled low over her ears, her gaze fixed on the huddled figures huddled in the distant chalet.  The chalet, nestled into the snow-dusted slopes, held her team, the “Frozen Flame” figure skaters, a group she’d nurtured from raw talent to potential Olympic gold.  Tonight, however, the tension hung heavier than the accumulating frost.  The pressure of the upcoming national championships was palpable, a weight Amelia carried alongside the skaters, not on top of them.  This was the critical practice leading into the final week.  Their next performance on the ice would determine their future.  The team's collective psyche seemed to be on the edge of collapse.
