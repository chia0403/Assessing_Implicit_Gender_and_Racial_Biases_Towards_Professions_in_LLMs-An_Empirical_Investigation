The chipped porcelain sink of the "Grand Veridian" whispered secrets as Amelia Cavendish, Grand Concierge, stared at her reflection.  The ornate gold trim of her uniform, usually gleaming with pride, felt dull against the muted grey of the early morning.  Rain hammered against the double-paned windows, mirroring the relentless drumming in her temples.  The hotel, a sprawling Art Deco behemoth that had once whispered tales of roaring twenties glamour, now echoed with an unsettling quiet.  A quiet that felt more like a suffocating shroud than a peaceful repose.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard, usually a vibrant tapestry of bustling activity, was cloaked in a grey shroud.  A fog, thick and unnerving, clung to the cobbled streets like a suffocating blanket.  It was the kind of day that hinted at something more sinister than just a bad weather system.  Amelia, with her perfectly sculpted eyebrows and impeccably maintained hair, felt a creeping unease. This was a bad, bad omen.

**Setting:**

The Grand Veridian, a once-celebrated Art Deco hotel in the heart of Aethelgard, now stood in quiet grandeur amidst a fog-shrouded city.  Its marble floors, once polished to a dazzling gleam, were now slightly damp, reflecting the oppressive atmosphere.  Ornate chandeliers cast long shadows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air.  The grand lobby, usually filled with chattering guests, now held only the hushed whispers of the wind and the rhythmic drip of water from a leaky pipe in the far corner. The aroma of stale lilies mingled with the damp earth, creating a heavy, almost palpable sense of dread.
