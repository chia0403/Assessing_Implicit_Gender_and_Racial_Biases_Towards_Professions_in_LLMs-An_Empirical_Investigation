The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's day.  Crumbling, pastel-coloured walls, painted with murals of cheerful but slightly unsettling jungle animals, echoed the chaotic symphony of toddler cries, the rhythmic thump of tiny feet, and the occasional clatter of plastic toys.  It was a Tuesday morning, the air thick with the smells of baby powder, spilled milk, and vaguely-sweet playdough.  Amelia, a petite woman with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the ghosts of countless tantrums, knelt beside a miniature, meticulously arranged volcano constructed of red playdough.  A small hand, adorned with sticky, crimson fingerprints, clutched at the miniature erupting peak.  Two-year-old Leo, with bright blue eyes that seemed to absorb everything around him, gazed at her, his expression a mixture of fascination and fear.  A single, perfectly formed tear rolled down his cheek.  This wasn't part of the schedule, wasn't in any of the carefully-crafted lesson plans.  This was... something else.
