Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Rusty Bucket" theatre, a building more testament to forgotten glories than current successes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the cavernous rehearsal hall, illuminating the figure of Isolde de la Croix, Artistic Director of the Rusty Bucket Repertory Company.  Isolde, a woman sculpted from sharp angles and driven ambition, surveyed the scattered actors with a critical eye.  Her black hair, usually meticulously styled, was plastered to her forehead, a testament to the relentless rehearsal schedule.  Tonight, they were attempting to capture the raw, untamed energy of Shakespeare's Tempest, a play Isolde had chosen with a ferocious conviction that bordered on obsession.  The actors, mostly seasoned veterans of the local theatre scene but struggling under the pressure of Isolde's relentless demands, moved with a hesitant grace, their bodies stiff against the cold, damp air.  The setting was a microcosm of the entire company: struggling, yearning, and desperate for a moment of genuine magic.
