Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the rhythmic pounding in Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and cheap coffee, clung to her like a second skin.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting an anemic glow over the cluttered space, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the gloom.  Outside, the city of Veridian sprawled beneath a bruised sky, a concrete jungle draped in a monochrome shroud.  Amy, a probation officer with five years under her belt and a weariness etched into her tired eyes, stared at the stack of files on her desk.  Each one represented a life, a potential, a chance, often squandered.  Today, one particular file, marked with the stark black ink of "High Risk," felt heavier than the rest.  It belonged to a young man named Jaxon "Jax" Riley, a graffiti artist with a troubled past and a future that felt as uncertain as the weather outside.  Amy's job: to navigate the treacherous currents between the streets and the system, trying to keep one more life afloat.
