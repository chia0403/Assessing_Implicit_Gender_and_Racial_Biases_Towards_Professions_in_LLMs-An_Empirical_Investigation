The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Sprocket" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's face as she meticulously soldered a tiny circuit board.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the cramped workshop.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and burnt soldering flux, clung to her like a second skin.  Milly, a radio technician with calloused fingertips and eyes that held the universe of static, was, as always, wrestling with the stubborn recalcitrance of a vintage shortwave receiver.  The machine, a battered Zenith with a chipped Bakelite cabinet, sat on a workbench cluttered with tools, wires, and half-eaten packets of dried ramen. This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, the heart of The Rusty Sprocket, a hidden haven for forgotten technologies tucked away in the shadow of the burgeoning tech metropolis of Neo-Veridia.

The workshop, a space barely larger than a small apartment, was crammed with equipment.  Stacks of vintage radios, televisions, and oscilloscopes, their glass faces reflecting the sporadic bursts of static and the glow of the fluorescent tubes above, lined the walls.  The smell of old paper and forgotten electronics permeated the air, a constant companion to the hum of forgotten machinery.  A flickering projection lamp illuminated a faded poster advertising “Amateur Radio Night” at the local community centre, a stark contrast to the technological relics around Milly.  Rain pattered against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic counterpoint to the low buzz of the machines. Outside, the neon glow of Neo-Veridia’s skyscrapers was a distant symphony compared to the quiet symphony of the repair shop. The city's pulse, in this forgotten corner, beat slower.
