The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Rusty Mug" cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn Formica tables.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Millie"  Fitzwilliam's heart.  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, yet Millie felt like she was running a marathon, juggling trays laden with lukewarm coffee, stale pastries, and the unspoken anxieties of her regulars.  The greasy smell of frying onions mingled with the faint scent of mildew clinging to the perpetually damp walls.  Outside, the autumn air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, whipped around the small, unassuming diner.  This was Millieâ€™s world, the chaotic, slightly melancholic rhythm of the Rusty Mug.
