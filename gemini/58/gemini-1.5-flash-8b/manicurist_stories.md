The chipped porcelain sink of "The Polished Nail," a salon tucked away on a side street of bustling Bloomsbury, reflected the late afternoon sun, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia Nightingale, a manicurist with hands as deft as they were freckled, meticulously filed a client's nail.  Her brow, usually furrowed in concentration, relaxed into a serene expression as she listened to the client’s tales of her day – a relentless dance of deadlines and double-booked meetings.  The scent of lavender and freshly-ground coffee hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-click-click* of the nail file and the hushed whispers that drifted from the other stations.  Today, however, a different kind of tension thrummed beneath the surface of the salon’s usual tranquility.  Amelia felt it in the tightening of her own shoulders, in the sudden prickle of unease that snaked through her as she glanced at the antique grandfather clock on the wall.  Four o'clock.  And the clock was relentlessly ticking closer to a deadline.
