The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's flight suit, a symphony of icy shrieks against the skeletal frame of the abandoned hangar.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow glare of the setting sun, danced in the air, mirroring the frantic pulse in her temples.  Amy, her name whispered on the wind like a forgotten prayer, tightened her grip on the worn leather controls of the 'Stardust', a biplane patched together with scavenged parts and held together by hope.  The hangar, a cavernous space once bustling with the roar of engines and the excited chatter of mechanics, now echoed with an unnerving silence, broken only by the screech of rusted metal and the mournful cry of unseen birds.  The desolate landscape surrounding the abandoned airfield stretched into the horizon, a vast expanse of cracked earth and skeletal, wind-whipped trees.  A shimmering mirage, a fleeting trick of the light, danced in the distance, promising a watery oasis that likely held nothing more than the harsh reality of the parched wasteland. Amy knew the journey that lay ahead was perilous; the Stardust was more than a mere aircraft, it was a fragile bridge across an unforgiving expanse, a symbol of her desperate hope against the fading light.
