The fluorescent hum of the waiting room was a constant, irritating thrum against Amelia Blackwood's focus.  Her fingers, calloused from years of adjusting vertebrae and coaxing frustrated groans into sighs of relief, drummed a nervous tattoo on the worn linoleum.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a Seattle autumn hammered against the windows, mirroring the persistent ache in her own neck.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Blackwood, chiropractor, had been staring at the chipped porcelain clock for what felt like an eternity.  The clock displayed 3:57 PM.

The setting was the small, but surprisingly bustling, "Spinal Harmony" clinic tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast city.  The aroma of antiseptic mingled with the faint smell of damp earth clinging to the perpetually damp air of Seattle.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick canopy of the surrounding trees, casting the interior of the clinic in a muted, grey light.  Dusty posters featuring before-and-after X-rays and testimonials from satisfied patients adorned the walls, each a testament to the clinic's quiet, persistent success. Amelia, with her sharp, intelligent eyes and perpetually tired but determined expression, knew this was a microcosm of her own life.  A steady hum of work, a consistent push through the routine, a constant whisper of the quiet, almost imperceptible changes that built lasting and meaningful results.
