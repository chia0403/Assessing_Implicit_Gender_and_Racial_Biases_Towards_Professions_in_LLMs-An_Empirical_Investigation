Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Rusty Mug," the only semblance of a cafe in the desolate mining town of Copper Creek.  Dust motes danced in the flickering gaslight, illuminating the chipped mugs and weary faces gathered around rough-hewn tables.  Elias Thorne, Private Investigator, hunched over a steaming mug of something suspiciously dark, his trench coat a shadow against the gloom.  The scent of stale coffee and something akin to burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony to the quiet desperation of Copper Creek.

Elias Thorne, a man carved from granite and tempered by the unforgiving landscape, ran his calloused hand across his chin, the stubble catching the light.  He was a man accustomed to shadows, to the whispered secrets that clung to the rusting relics of the past.  Copper Creek, nestled between towering peaks that seemed to bleed into the perpetually overcast sky, held a history as murky as the swirling fog that often choked the valley.  Elias knew every shadowed alleyway, every whispered rumour that clung to the edges of the town.  And tonight, a new rumour had settled like a shroud, whispering of a missing prospector and a stolen fortune.
