The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom, a faded, pastel swirl of blues and pinks, felt like a familiar, comforting blanket around Amelia Rose Hawthorne.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, Victorian-era windows, painted the room in a warm, honeyed light, highlighting the meticulously arranged blocks, the colourful crayons still smudged with yesterday's masterpieces, and the faint scent of Play-Doh lingering in the air.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, surveyed the room.  Ten little faces, a kaleidoscope of emotions – curiosity, delight, frustration, and sleepy yawns – were focused on the day’s lesson.  Today, they were learning about colours, a lesson Amelia, in her fifth year teaching at Sunflower Valley Kindergarten, had delivered countless times. But today felt different.  A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling as familiar as the comforting routine of counting the children in, checking their lunchboxes, and then leading the boisterous group into the carefully constructed world of the classroom.  Something about the silence that preceded the cheerful chatter, about the way the sunlight danced on the polished wooden floor, felt…off.
