The biting London fog, a thick, grey shroud, clung to the cobbled streets of Spitalfields, clinging to the gas lamps like a spectral shroud.  Rain, a persistent, icy drizzle, plastered Amelia Thistlewick's fine linen dressmaker's apron to her legs, despite the layers of wool beneath.  Amelia Thistlewick, her hands, nimble despite the chill, meticulously stitched a delicate lace trimming onto a silk gown, the rhythmic click of her needle against the fabric the only sound to pierce the oppressive silence.  Her tiny workshop, tucked away on a narrow alley, was a haven of warmth and light, illuminated by a single, flickering gas jet.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax, silk, and freshly brewed chamomile tea, was a stark contrast to the grim world outside.  A single, ornate, antique mirror reflected Amelia's determined face, framed by the tangled tendrils of her raven hair.  Bespoke gowns were her lifeblood, her solace, her art.  Tonight, however, the usual thrill of creation felt muted, replaced by a nagging unease.  A whisper of whispers, carried on the wind, spoke of a looming shadow over the city, a whisper Amelia, with her keen ear, recognised as the approaching rumble of revolution.
