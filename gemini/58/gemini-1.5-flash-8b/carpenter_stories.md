The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s dark hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She hunched deeper into the worn leather of her stool, the scent of pine and sawdust filling the cramped workshop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the intricate pattern of cracks spiderwebbing across the freshly planed surface of a table leg.  Amelia, her name whispered across the generations of Blackwood carpenters, traced the grain with a calloused fingertip. This table, destined for the grand hall of Lord Ashworth’s new manor, was her obsession, her crucible.  Each carefully measured cut, each precise dovetail, was a testament to the quiet, unwavering dedication that defined her.  It was more than just woodworking; it was a dance with wood, a conversation with the grain, a silent symphony of the hands.  The workshop, nestled in the shadowed valley of Oakhaven, was more than just a space; it was a sanctuary, a world of fragrant wood and soft, rhythmic hammers.  The rhythmic thudding punctuated the low, mournful cry of the wind howling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that guarded the valley entrance.
