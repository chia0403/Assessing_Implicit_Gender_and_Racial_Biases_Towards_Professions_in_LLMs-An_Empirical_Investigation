The fluorescent lights of the "Nourish Now" clinic hummed, a relentless, almost sinister drone that echoed Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s thoughts.  She adjusted the straps of her crisp, white uniform, the subtle scent of antiseptic and freshly brewed coffee clinging to the air.  The antiseptic was a constant companion; a reminder of the invisible battles waged within these sterile walls, battles fought not with fists or weapons, but with portion sizes, ingredient labels, and the frustratingly complex dance of human metabolism.  Amelia, a registered dietician with a doctorate in nutritional sciences, had dedicated her life to deciphering the code, to understanding the intricate language of the body.  

The clinic, nestled in the shadow of the towering skyscrapers of Neo-Manhattan, was a stark contrast to the vibrant energy pulsating above.  Glass walls offered a glimpse of the bustling city life, but within the sterile white corridors, only the muted click-clack of keyboards and the soft rustle of paper disturbed the quiet.  Rows upon rows of cubicles, each containing a small, meticulously organized desk, held the secrets and struggles of hundreds.  Amelia’s own cubicle, though slightly larger, was a testament to her minimalist approach – sleek, modern, and dominated by a large monitor displaying graphs and nutritional charts that practically seemed to pulse with data.  Today, however, the data seemed stubbornly resistant to interpretation.
