The chipped paint of the gazebo, a faded shade of ochre, scraped against Elara Blackwood's calloused palm.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun, danced in the air around her as she meticulously pruned the wisteria that clawed its way up the weathered wooden supports.  The scent of damp earth and overgrown roses hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony of the sprawling Blackwood Estate.
