The air in the drafting room hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the metallic tang of graphite.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of the overhead fluorescent lights, danced in the oppressive stillness.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker with calloused hands and perpetually tired eyes, hunched over his drafting table.  Around him, other figures were similarly hunched, their movements slow and deliberate, as if each line, each curve, was a painstaking prayer.  The rhythmic whir of the mechanical pencil sharpener, a constant drone in the otherwise silent space, was the only soundtrack to this particular cathedral of blueprints.  Elias, with his name etched into the very fabric of the place – his name, a mere footnote on the towering stack of blueprints before him – was wrestling with a complex architectural design for a new wing of the city hospital.  He stared at the meticulous renderings, each line representing a wall, a staircase, a window – each line a responsibility, each line a silent testament to the burden of his work.  The clock on the wall, a grotesque, almost mocking reminder of the relentless march of time, ticked on.  A project, a life, hanging in the balance, as thin as the lines he drew.
