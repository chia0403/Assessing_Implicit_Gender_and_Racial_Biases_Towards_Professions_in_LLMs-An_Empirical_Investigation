The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed, a constant, insistent drone that vibrated through Elara Blackwood's weary bones.  The reception desk, a polished granite slab reflecting the sterile white walls, felt like a cold, unforgiving altar.  Elara, a woman of twenty-seven with eyes that held the haunted wisdom of someone far older, stared at the blinking red light on the phone.  It had been flashing for the past fifteen minutes, a maddening metronome counting down the seconds until her patience, already strained to its breaking point, would snap.  The Zenith Corporation, a sprawling conglomerate known for its innovative, often controversial, technological advancements, was not known for its considerate treatment of its receptionists.

The year was 2042.  High-rise buildings pierced the perpetually overcast sky of Neo-Tokyo, their glass facades reflecting the rain-slicked streets below.  The city pulsed with a frenetic energy, a mix of futuristic chrome and traditional Japanese aesthetics.  The air, thick with the scent of recycled air and synthetic food, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of a world teetering on the edge of ecological collapse.  Elara worked in the Zenith Corporation's subsidiary, Zenith Robotics, nestled deep within the sprawling, chrome-plated tower that dominated the city's financial district.
