The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Convenience" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Juniper's life.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and cheap microwave popcorn, clung to her like a second skin.  Every Tuesday, the afternoon rush was particularly brutal, a tidal wave of disgruntled customers clutching their lottery tickets and half-eaten pastries.  Amelia, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that stretched further than her comfort zone, stood behind the counter, her fingers poised over the keypad, ready to dispense the next transaction.  The worn linoleum floor, scarred with countless scuff marks and spilled soda, felt like a stage floor, each step a performance.  Outside, the muted gray of a late autumn sky mirrored the gloom in the small shop.  Corner Convenience.  It felt like a stage waiting for a play that had already been performed a hundred times.
