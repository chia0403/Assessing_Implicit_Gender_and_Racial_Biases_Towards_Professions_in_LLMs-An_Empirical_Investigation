The fluorescent hum of the blood bank, a sterile symphony of whirring centrifuges and the soft hiss of vacuum tubes, was Elias Thorne's daily soundtrack.  Elias Thorne, phlebotomist extraordinaire (or so he liked to think), found solace in the rhythmic precision of his work.  He'd meticulously swabbed and lanced countless arms, collecting the crimson lifeblood that sustained countless others.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum felt amplified, almost menacing.  A low, guttural growl, barely audible over the machines, echoed from the back storage room.


The setting:  The Neo-Gothic, almost labyrinthine, city hospital was built on the reclaimed grounds of an old, abandoned cathedral.  Its architecture, a jarring mix of ancient stonework and gleaming stainless steel, seemed to breathe a strange, quiet life of its own.  Dim, flickering lights cast long, distorted shadows in the hallways, punctuated by the harsh, clinical glow of examination rooms.  The blood bank, a cavernous space in the basement, was refrigerated to a near-freezing temperature, the cold air a stark contrast to the humid August night outside.  A heavy, almost metallic scent of antiseptic and aged stone hung in the air. A thick layer of dust, settling on the polished surfaces, hinted at the facilityâ€™s infrequent use in recent weeks.
