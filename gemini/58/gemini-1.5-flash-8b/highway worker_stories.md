The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's bright orange safety vest, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust, kicked up by the passing semi-trucks, swirled around her ankles, obscuring the already faded yellow lines marking the highway's shoulder.  The sun, a pale disc sinking below the jagged horizon of the Rockies, cast long, skeletal shadows across the endless expanse of asphalt.  This was her world, the I-90 corridor between Denver and Cheyenne, a concrete ribbon snaking through a land sculpted by time and weather.  It was 3 AM, and the highway, usually a symphony of roaring engines and flashing headlights, was eerily quiet.  Sparrow, with her calloused hands gripping the worn handle of her jackhammer, felt the familiar loneliness of the night.  This wasn't just a job; it was a rhythm, a counterpoint to the heartbeats of the great American West.  She was a guardian of this artery, a silent sentinel in the dead of night.
