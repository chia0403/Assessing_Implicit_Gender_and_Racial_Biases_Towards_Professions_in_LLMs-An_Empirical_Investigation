The chipped paint of the "Razor's Edge" salon, a testament to countless forgotten appointments and even more forgotten dreams, reflected the sickly yellow light of the late afternoon sun. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the scattered remnants of yesterday's styling catastrophes â€“ a half-used bottle of hairspray, a tangled clump of crimson highlights, and a single, forlorn bobby pin.  Behind the cluttered counter, Elias Thorne, a young man with eyes the colour of stormy seas and fingers surprisingly gentle for a man who wielded shears with the precision of a surgeon, meticulously cleaned his tools.  The clatter of the scissors against the steel bowl was the only sound besides the faint hum of the fluorescent lights.  Elias was a hair cutter, a master of sculpted strands, and tonight, the salon held the promise of a transformation, or perhaps, just a quiet escape.
