The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Elara Vance, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the humid air.  Sweat beaded on her brow, despite the cool air conditioning that struggled to keep pace with the heat radiating from the crowded bar.  Empty shot glasses clinked against the polished mahogany bar top, a rhythmic counterpoint to the low hum of conversation and the occasional clinking of pool balls from the dimly lit backroom.  Elara, with her perpetually tired eyes and a chipped emerald ring on her left ring finger, expertly poured a whiskey neat, the amber liquid shimmering in the lamplight. Tonight, the air hung thick with anticipation, a palpable tension that settled over the patrons like a blanket, heavier than the usual Tuesday night buzz.  The Rusty Mug, usually a haven of quiet camaraderie, felt unusually charged, and Elara, seasoned bartender that she was, knew this was just the beginning.
