The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort he barely registered.  He braced himself against the relentless wind that howled off the churning grey Atlantic, the biting air a stark contrast to the warmth of the battered leather satchel slung across his shoulder.  Inside, nestled amongst meticulously organized lenses and film canisters, lay his most prized possession: a meticulously restored 1947 Rolleiflex, its chrome gleaming faintly in the gloom.  The craggy cliffs of Cornwall, perpetually lashed by the unforgiving sea, offered a brutal but breathtaking canvas.  This was Elias’s sanctuary, a place where the raw power of nature could be captured, not controlled, a place where the relentless rhythm of the waves echoed the relentless pursuit of the perfect image burning within him.  The lighthouse, a skeletal sentinel against the stormy sky, stood a mile away, its beam a defiant swipe of white against the encroaching darkness.  Tonight, Elias Thorne wasn’t just chasing light; he was chasing something far more elusive – the storm’s soul.
