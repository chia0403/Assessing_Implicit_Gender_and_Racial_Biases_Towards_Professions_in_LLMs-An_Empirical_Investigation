The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall, arched windows of Madame Evangeline Dubois' atelier.  Evangeline, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the intricate seams in her most prized creations, meticulously stitched a delicate silver thread onto a gown of midnight blue velvet.  The fabric, a luxurious import from Lyons, flowed across her worktable like a captured shadow, its texture a symphony under her nimble fingers.  Outside, the Parisian cobblestones hummed with the chaotic rhythm of the city, a stark contrast to the serene calm within her small, cluttered sanctuary on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©.  The atelier itself was a testament to Evangeline's artistry: bolts of shimmering satin and brocade lined the walls, sketches of fantastical gowns pinned haphazardly amongst them, and half-finished masterpieces draped elegantly over antique dress forms, each a silent promise of future elegance.
