The scent of rain-soaked petrichor hung heavy in the air, a damp, earthy perfume that mingled strangely with the heady sweetness of jasmine and lilies spilling from overflowing baskets outside "Petal Pushers," Amelia Rosamund Thorne's shop.  Amelia, a woman whose fingers were as deft with a floral wire as a concert pianist's with an ivory key, shivered despite the thick wool cardigan she wore.  The November wind, a restless, whispering entity, rattled the windowpanes of her small, ivy-covered cottage, tucked away on a cobbled lane just off the bustling market square of the ancient town of Oakhaven.  Inside, the air was warm and fragrant, a riot of colour and scent that offered a stark contrast to the grey, melancholic day outside.  A single oil lamp cast a soft glow over shelves laden with dried lavender, vibrant silks, and an array of exotic blooms, each carefully arranged, a testament to Amelia's artistry.
