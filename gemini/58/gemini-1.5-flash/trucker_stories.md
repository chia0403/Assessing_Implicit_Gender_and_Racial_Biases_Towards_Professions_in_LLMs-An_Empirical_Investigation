Visibility was down to near zero, the only illumination coming from the weak halo of Amelia Jane "Amy" Blackwood's headlights, cutting through the swirling white like a desperate, lonely sword.  Her rig, a beat-up but trusty Kenworth she'd affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," groaned under the strain of the relentless blizzard, its engine a low, rumbling protest against the unforgiving conditions.  The CB radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the tires against the snow-packed highway.  Amy gripped the wheel, her knuckles white, her gaze fixed on the barely visible taillights of the semi ahead, a fragile lifeline in the heart of the storm.  This was no ordinary snowstorm; this feltâ€¦ ominous.
