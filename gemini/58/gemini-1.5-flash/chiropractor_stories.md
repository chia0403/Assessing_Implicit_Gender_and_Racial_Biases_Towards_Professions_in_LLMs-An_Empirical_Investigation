The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless, howling banshee, whipped off the churning grey Atlantic, threatening to tear the flimsy structure from its moorings.  Her clinic, "Coastal Adjustments," perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the tempestuous sea, was more than just a place of work; it was a testament to her stubborn refusal to leave the only home she'd ever known â€“ the windswept, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, Maine.  The scent of brine and seaweed hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of both the beauty and the brutality of her surroundings.  Inside, the small waiting room, smelling faintly of pine and antiseptic, offered a stark contrast to the wildness outside, a haven of warmth and calm that Eleanor desperately hoped she could maintain despite the relentless onslaught of the storm.
