The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a meager comfort against the November chill seeping through the single-paned window of her office.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest tremor from the passing trolley, danced in the weak afternoon sun slanting across the worn oak desk.  Amelia, a meticulous bookkeeper with a penchant for order that bordered on obsessive, meticulously balanced the ledger before her, the precise strokes of her pen a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of the city beyond.  Her office, a cramped space above a bustling butcher shop on Bleecker Street in New York City, smelled faintly of sawdust, aging paper, and the lingering aroma of Mr. Fitzwilliam's prize-winning sausages â€“ a scent that, despite its sometimes overpowering nature, had become as familiar to Amelia as the worn grooves in her mahogany desk.  The year was 1927, and the Jazz Age hummed a discordant tune outside, a stark contrast to the quiet precision of Amelia's world.
