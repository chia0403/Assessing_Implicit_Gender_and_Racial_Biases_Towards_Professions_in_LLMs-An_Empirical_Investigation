The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips as she polished a already-gleaming pint glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor Store" sign across the alley into a hazy, orange smear. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, almost imperceptible sweetness of desperation â€“ the usual Friday night perfume of the bar.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the loose panes in their frames, a sound perfectly in sync with the melancholic clinking of ice in the almost-empty glasses lining the bar. Elara, however, remained unfazed, her movements precise and economical as she wiped down the bar with practiced ease.  This wasn't just a job; it was a well-worn ritual, a nightly dance with the city's shadows.
