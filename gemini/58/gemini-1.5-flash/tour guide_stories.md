The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s neck, turning the already sticky humidity of the Louisiana bayou into something akin to a sauna.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic rhythm, a counterpoint to the rhythmic slap-slap-slap of Amelia’s worn leather sandals against the cypress knees poking out of the murky water.  The air hung heavy with the scent of decaying vegetation and something else, something subtly sweet and distinctly…unnatural.  Amelia adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat, wiping a bead of sweat from her forehead.  This was her third tour of the day, and the sweltering heat wasn’t the only thing making her feel uneasy.  This particular stretch of the Honey Island Swamp, usually teeming with vibrant life, felt…still.  Too still.  Even the usual cacophony of bird calls seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence that prickled at the edges of her senses.
