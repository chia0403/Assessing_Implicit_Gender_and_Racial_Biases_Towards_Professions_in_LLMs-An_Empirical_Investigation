The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  Amelia, all sharp angles and weary eyes behind the chipped Formica counter, tapped her pen against the price scanner, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the low thrum of the refrigerators behind her.  Outside, the desert wind howled a lonely song, rattling the already-loose windowpanes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the grime on the window, illuminating the sparse, dusty shelves stocked with everything from stale tortilla chips to suspiciously bright-colored candy.  The only other sound was the occasional squeak of Amelia's worn-out sneakers as she shifted her weight, a silent protest against the aching in her feet.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of boredom was about to be shattered.
