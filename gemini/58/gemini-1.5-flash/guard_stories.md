The biting wind whipped at Sergeant Valerius Thorne’s worn cloak, stinging his cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  He hunched deeper into his furs, the rough wool scratching against his already chapped skin.  From his vantage point atop the crumbling northern wall of Porthaven, the city sprawled before him like a tapestry woven from gaslight and shadow.  A perpetual drizzle, characteristic of the late autumn in the kingdom of Aeridor, clung to the cobbled streets below, transforming the usually vibrant marketplace into a muted, almost melancholic scene.  The air, thick with the smells of woodsmoke, brine, and something faintly acrid – perhaps the lingering scent of the alchemist's fire – carried the distant, muffled sounds of revelry from the taverns nestled in the lower districts.  But Valerius felt none of the festive cheer. His gaze, hardened by years of guarding Porthaven's vulnerable borders, remained fixed on the turbulent grey sea that churned restlessly against the city walls, a constant reminder of the threats that lurked beyond.
