The siren’s wail was a familiar lullaby to Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Reed, a sound that vibrated not just in her ears, but deep in her chest, a tremor of adrenaline mixed with grim anticipation.  Rain lashed against the windshield of Engine 23, blurring the already chaotic cityscape of Seattle into a watercolour smear of grey and black.  The city, a concrete jungle usually vibrant with life, was now cloaked in the oppressive dampness of a November night, the air thick with the scent of salt and impending disaster.  The radio crackled with urgent dispatches – a suspected arson at the old Rainier Brewery, multiple trapped civilians.  Evie gripped the wheel, her knuckles white, the rhythmic thump of the engine a counterpoint to the frantic beat of her heart. This wasn't just another call; this was personal. The Rainier Brewery.  A place steeped in family history, now consumed by flames.
