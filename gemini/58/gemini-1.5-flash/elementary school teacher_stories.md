Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden beams, each one seemingly mocking her meticulously planned lesson plan on fractions.  Outside, the relentless chirping of crickets – a soundtrack to the late summer heat – battled a distant, persistent hum from the nearby highway, a constant reminder of the world beyond the comforting, slightly-worn walls of Room 207.
