Bellweather Street itself was a picturesque anachronism, a sliver of old-world charm stubbornly clinging to the edge of the sprawling, modern city of Aethelburg.  Gas lamps flickered dimly, casting long shadows from the half-timbered houses, their windowpanes reflecting the nascent glow of the rising sun.  The street was still mostly deserted, save for the occasional early-rising postman and the rustle of leaves stirred by a gentle breeze, all creating a quiet prelude to the bustling day that Elias knew was about to begin.
