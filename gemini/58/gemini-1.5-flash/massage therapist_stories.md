The aroma of sandalwood and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless Vancouver drizzle lashing against the frosted glass windows of Serenity Spa.  Raindrops, fat and insistent, traced sluggish paths down the panes, mirroring the slow, deliberate rhythm of Elias Thorne’s hands as he kneaded the tense muscles in his client’s shoulders.  Elias, a man whose own life felt as tightly wound as the knotted cords he so expertly untangled,  found a strange solace in the quiet intimacy of his work.  The soft sighs of his clients, the gradual release of their tension, were a counterpoint to the storm raging outside, a silent testament to the healing power he wielded with his calloused but surprisingly gentle touch.  Tonight, however, the usual serenity of the spa felt fractured, a premonition of the turmoil brewing just beyond the muted sounds of the rain.
