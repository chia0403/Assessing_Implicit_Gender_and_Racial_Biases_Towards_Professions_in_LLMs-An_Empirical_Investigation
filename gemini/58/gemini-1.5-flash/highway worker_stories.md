The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, baking the already-sticky sweat into his skin.  He wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smudge of grime on his forehead that mirrored the perpetual dirtiness of the I-95 overpass he was currently repairing.  The air hung thick with the smell of asphalt, exhaust fumes, and something vaguely floral – the stubborn scent of honeysuckle clinging to the tenacious weeds pushing through the cracked concrete.  Around him, the relentless drone of passing traffic was a constant, throbbing bassline to the rhythmic clang of his hammer against steel.  This was Elias’s symphony, the familiar cacophony of his life, a life spent battling potholes and dodging semi-trucks on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia.
