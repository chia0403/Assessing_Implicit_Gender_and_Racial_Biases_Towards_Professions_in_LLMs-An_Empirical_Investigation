The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Sunshine Room!" sign was barely visible beneath a thick layer of glitter.  It was a testament, Ms. Eleanor Vance thought with a weary sigh, to the relentless, sparkly energy of five-year-olds.  The Sunshine Room itself, a converted storage closet smelling faintly of old crayons and impending naptime, was a chaotic symphony of miniature human activity.  Tiny hands kneaded playdough into unrecognizable shapes, miniature voices chanted a slightly off-key rendition of "The Wheels on the Bus," and a lone building block tower, precariously balanced, threatened imminent collapse.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpane, cast dancing motes of dust across the room, illuminating a scene of controlled, yet undeniably, beautiful chaos. Today, however, even the usual vibrant chaos felt muted, a hazy grey film obscuring the usual joyful frenzy.  A palpable sense of anticipation, both excited and anxious, hung in the air, thicker than the smell of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  It was the day of the annual Kindergarten Spring Sing-Along, and Ms. Vance, despite her years of experience, felt a flutter of pre-performance nerves in her own stomach.
