The rasp of the cleaver, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Buttercup as his own heartbeat, sliced through the pre-dawn chill of Oakhaven.  Frost clung to the cobblestones of Butcher's Row, painting the narrow street in a delicate, ephemeral white.  Barty's shop, "Buttercup's Best," sat nestled between a bakery that smelled perpetually of warm yeast and a haberdashery overflowing with bolts of vibrant, yet somehow muted, autumnal fabrics.  The air, despite the cold, carried the rich, iron tang of blood – a scent Barty found comforting, a testament to the honest work of his hands.  This morning, however, the usual comforting aroma was tinged with something else, something unsettlingly sweet, like overripe plums mixed with…fear.
