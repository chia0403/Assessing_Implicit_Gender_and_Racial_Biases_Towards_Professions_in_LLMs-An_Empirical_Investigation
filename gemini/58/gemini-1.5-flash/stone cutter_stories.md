The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Elias Thorne's hammer. Dust motes, thick as summer gnats, danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window high above.  Elias, his hands calloused and stained the ochre of the stone itself, paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm.  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet stone and something else, something acrid and unfamiliar – a metallic tang that prickled at the edges of his senses.  His workshop, nestled deep within the shadowed foothills of the Grey Mountains, had always been a sanctuary, a place where the relentless rhythm of his work drowned out the world’s harsh clamor. But today, the silence between the hammer blows felt…wrong.  A premonition, sharp and cold as the mountain wind, settled upon him.
