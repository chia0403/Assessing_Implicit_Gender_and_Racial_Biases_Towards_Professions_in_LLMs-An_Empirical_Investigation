The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles" daycare center’s front door flaked under Elara Vance’s fingertips as she wrestled it open, the familiar scent of slightly-burnt toast and vaguely-floral cleaning solution hitting her like a comforting wave.  Rain, the kind that hammered against windows and turned the world a blurry grey, lashed against the building's faded yellow siding.  Inside, a cacophony of tiny voices – shrieking, giggling, and the rhythmic thud of miniature feet – battled with the insistent drone of Raffi singing "Baby Beluga" on repeat.  It was 7:15 AM, and Elara, already running five minutes late, felt the familiar knot of controlled chaos tightening in her stomach.  But even the impending storm of sticky fingers and temper tantrums couldn’t entirely extinguish the quiet joy she found in the messy, beautiful whirlwind of Sunshine Smiles.
