The air hung thick and humid in the attic room, a miasma of dust motes dancing in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through a grimy windowpane.  Amelia "Mia"  Rosewater, senior editor at Blackwood & Sons Publishing, coughed, a delicate sound that belied the steel-trap concentration etched on her face.  Around her, manuscripts lay scattered like fallen leaves â€“ a chaotic, yet somehow ordered, landscape of rejected poetry, promising thrillers that fell flat, and the occasional diamond in the rough, waiting to be polished to a brilliant shine.  The slanted roof pressed down, the warped wooden beams groaning a mournful symphony under the weight of decades of untold stories, both published and condemned to the dusty oblivion of the attic. This was Mia's sanctuary, her editing cave, far removed from the polished mahogany desks and hushed whispers of the office below.
