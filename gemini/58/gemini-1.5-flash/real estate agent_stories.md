The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates, painting the pristine Tudor homes in hues of amber and rose.  A persistent chill wind, a harbinger of the approaching autumn, whipped Amelia Katherine Hawthorne’s perfectly coiffed auburn hair across her face.  Amelia, a real estate agent with a reputation as sharp as her tailored pantsuits and a smile as dazzling as the diamond solitaire on her ring finger, adjusted her cashmere scarf, a faint frown creasing her otherwise flawless brow.  This showing, unlike the others this week, felt…different.  The air hung heavy with an unspoken tension, a subtle dissonance that vibrated beneath the surface of the seemingly idyllic neighborhood.  The silence, broken only by the rustling of leaves and the distant drone of a lawnmower, was far more unsettling than the usual polite chatter of potential buyers.  Number 14 Willow Creek Drive, with its dark, shuttered windows and overgrown rose bushes, felt less like a home and more like a secret waiting to be unearthed.
