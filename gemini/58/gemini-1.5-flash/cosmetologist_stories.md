The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and burnt sugar, a perfume only Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez could truly appreciate.  It was the olfactory signature of her salon, “Izzy’s Indulgences,” nestled on a cobblestone side street in the heart of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The turquoise shutters of her shop, chipped in places but undeniably charming, were flung open to catch the salty sea breeze, a welcome counterpoint to the humid afternoon.  Inside, the walls, painted a vibrant coral, were adorned with framed vintage postcards depicting sun-drenched beaches and bustling marketplaces.  The rhythmic clang of the trolley cars passing along Calle Cristo provided a soothing soundtrack to the gentle hum of conversation and the whir of hair dryers. Today, however, the usual cheerful cacophony was muted.  A palpable tension hung in the air, heavier even than the lingering scent of hibiscus hairspray.
