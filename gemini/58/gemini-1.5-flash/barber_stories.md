The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, its faded lettering barely whispering "Bartholomew's Barber Shop."  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Dubois, a man whose hands were as weathered and knowing as the cypress trees lining the bayou, hummed a low, mournful blues riff as he honed his straight razor. Dust motes danced in the lone sunbeam slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the swirling chaos of his shop: half-finished crossword puzzles scattered on a chipped Formica counter, a chipped porcelain mug perpetually stained with coffee, and the lingering scent of bay rum and something faintlyâ€¦ unsettling.  It was the smell of secrets, Barty knew, the kind that clung to the humid air of Bayou Lafourche like Spanish moss on ancient oaks.  This wasn't just a barbershop; it was the confessional of the bayou, and today, Barty suspected, a particularly juicy confession was about to be shared.
