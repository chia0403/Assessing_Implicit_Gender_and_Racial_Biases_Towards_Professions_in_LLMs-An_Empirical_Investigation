The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill November wind whistling through the gaps in the crooked windowpanes of Elias Thorne’s tailor shop.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the precise stitches he took, meticulously pinned a length of midnight-blue velvet to the form, the fabric shimmering under the weak gaslight. Rain lashed against the leaded glass, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the quiet rhythm of his work in the shadowed corner of  Cobblestone Lane, a street as old and creased as the worn leather of his workbench.  The shop itself, nestled between a dilapidated bookshop and a perpetually-empty apothecary, was a testament to time’s relentless march – its walls lined with moth-eaten bolts of fabric, their rich colours dulled by years of neglect, yet still whispering tales of bygone elegance.  Tonight, however, Elias wasn't focused on the past; a future, shrouded in the uncertain grey of the coming storm, was sewing itself into the fabric of his life.
