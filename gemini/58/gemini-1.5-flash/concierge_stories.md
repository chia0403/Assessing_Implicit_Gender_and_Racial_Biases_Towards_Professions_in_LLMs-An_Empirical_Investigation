The brass nameplate on the mahogany door read simply:  *Concierge*.  Beneath it, barely visible under a layer of meticulously polished dust, was a smaller, almost illegible plate: *Armand Jules Dubois*.  Armand, however, preferred to be called Armond. It sounded less… stuffy.  Less like the kind of concierge who expected a diamond-encrusted tip for fetching a forgotten umbrella.  Still, he was the concierge of the prestigious Blackwood Towers, a Gothic monstrosity clinging to the cliffside overlooking the perpetually stormy Atlantic.  The salt spray, a constant companion, kissed the vast windows of the building, and tonight, it carried the scent of brine and a distant, almost imperceptible, hint of woodsmoke – a smell that, to Armond, always spoke of impending trouble.  The storm brewing outside mirrored the one simmering within the opulent, gilded cage of Blackwood Towers.  And Armond, with his perpetually weary smile and eyes that had seen too much, was about to be caught in the middle.
