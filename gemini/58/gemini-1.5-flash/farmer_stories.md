The wind, a rasping, insistent hand, clawed at Elias Thorneâ€™s worn coat as he surveyed his fields.  Dust, the colour of burnt ochre, swirled around his ankles, clinging to the thick wool like stubborn grit.  Elias, a man carved from the same stubborn earth he tilled, squinted against the relentless Arizona sun, its glare bouncing off the cracked surface of the parched land.  The once-vibrant green of his alfalfa had withered to a sickly yellow, a testament to the three-year drought that had gripped the Thorne family farm, Oakhaven, for longer than Elias cared to remember.  The air, thick with the scent of dry earth and desperation, hung heavy and still between the skeletal remains of his corn stalks.  This wasn't just a bad year; it felt like the end.
