The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Holloway's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had begun hours ago, plastered her already-soaked coat to her back.  She pulled her scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chapped cheeks, a small discomfort she barely registered.  Ahead, nestled between a bakery with its windows fogged with steam and a bookshop overflowing with pre-loved treasures, stood Willowbrook Manor, a rambling Victorian house that seemed to sigh in the wind, its gables shrouded in mist.  This was Ameliaâ€™s workplace, a place where the past felt as heavy and damp as the present day, and where her work as an occupational therapist felt less like a job and more like a delicate balancing act between hope and despair.
