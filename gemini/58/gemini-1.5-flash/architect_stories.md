The biting November wind whipped Amelia Stoneâ€™s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood atop the scaffolding, the city of Prague spread beneath her like a meticulously crafted map.  Gargoyles, ancient and weathered, leered from the rooftops of the gothic buildings that clawed at the bruised twilight sky.

This wasn't just any city; it was the city that had whispered to her soul since she first saw its image in a dusty textbook, a city she now held in her hands, quite literally, in the form of the half-finished restoration project that dominated her every waking thought: the dilapidated yet majestic Church of St. Giles.
