The biting November wind howled a mournful tune across the slate-grey rooftops of Edinburgh, whipping Elias Thorne’s thick, ginger beard across his frost-nipped cheeks.  Below, the city hummed with a muted energy, a tapestry woven from the distant rumble of traffic and the closer chatter of unseen lives.  Elias, perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of a Georgian townhouse, ignored the symphony of the city.  His focus was entirely on the task at hand: securing a loose slate before the next gust sent it tumbling into the cobbled street below, potentially causing a minor – or major – catastrophe.  The biting wind tugged at the hem of his worn overalls, the smell of damp stone and coal smoke clinging to his clothes like a second skin.  This was his world, a dizzying dance between gravity and the unforgiving elements, a world high above the ordinary.
