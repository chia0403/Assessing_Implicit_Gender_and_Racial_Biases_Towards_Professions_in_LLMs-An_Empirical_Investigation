The fluorescent lights of the Hemlock & Hawthorne law firm hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Beatrice Evangeline Ainsworth’s perfectly manicured fingernails on the polished mahogany of her desk.  Rain lashed against the towering gothic windows of the fifteenth floor, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a watercolour smear of grey and black.  Beatrice, however, remained unflappable.  Her posture was impeccable, her auburn hair a sleek helmet framing a face that, despite the late hour, showed no hint of fatigue.  The only visible sign of stress was the slight tremor in her perfectly poured cup of Earl Grey tea, a tremor that vanished as quickly as it appeared, swallowed by the steely composure she wore like a second skin.  Tonight, however, even Beatrice Ainsworth, paragon of efficiency and calm, felt a prickle of unease.  The storm outside mirrored a storm brewing within the hallowed halls of Hemlock & Hawthorne – a storm that threatened to engulf not just the firm, but Beatrice herself.
