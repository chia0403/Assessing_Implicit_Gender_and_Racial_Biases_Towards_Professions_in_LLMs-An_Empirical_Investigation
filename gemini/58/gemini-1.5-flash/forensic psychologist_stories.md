The biting November wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed’s charcoal grey coat around her legs as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of Grimsborough’s old town.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling mist rising from the River Avon.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else… something acrid, metallic, clinging to the back of her throat like the taste of fear.  Grimsborough, nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds, usually exuded a sleepy charm, a picture postcard town where time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace.  But tonight, the quaint cottages and ivy-covered stone walls felt oppressive, a silent witness to a tragedy unfolding. The flickering gaslight reflected in the polished surface of her silver police identification badge, a cold comfort against the rising unease that prickled her skin.  She pulled her coat tighter, the collar scratching against her already taut nerves. This case, unlike any she'd encountered in her years as a forensic psychologist with the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, promised to be profoundly unsettling.
