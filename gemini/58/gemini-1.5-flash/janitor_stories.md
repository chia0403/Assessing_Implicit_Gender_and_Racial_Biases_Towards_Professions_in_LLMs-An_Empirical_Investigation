The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a discordant tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest tremor of the ancient building settling, danced in the beams like tiny, malevolent spirits.  It was 2:17 AM, and the silence of the deserted school was broken only by the rhythmic swish of Amelia Josephine Cartwright's mop. Amelia, or Amy as she preferred,  wasn't your average janitor.  She wasn't thrilled by her job, not particularly, but neither did she hate it.  It gave her time, a quiet solitude in the echoing halls, amidst the hallowed relics of countless generations of students,  a time for thinking, for observing, and for occasionally stumbling across secrets better left undisturbed. Tonight, however, felt different.  The air itself seemed to thrum with an unspoken tension, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that hinted at something far more unsettling than usual nocturnal school noises.
