The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bonanza" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's carefully cultivated despair.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, glittering stars in the sickly yellow glow, danced in the stagnant air above the aisles crammed with discounted appliances, slightly-used furniture, and a disturbingly large collection of novelty garden gnomes.  The pungent aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy, clinging to the worn carpet like a second skin. Amelia, sporting a strained smile that didn't quite reach her weary eyes, adjusted the name tag pinned to her slightly-too-tight blazer.  Another Saturday, another mountain of unsold inventory, another desperate attempt to meet her quota before the manager, a woman whose smile was as sharp as a rusty knife, decided Amelia was as expendable as a chipped teacup.
