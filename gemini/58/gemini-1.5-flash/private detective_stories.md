The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  Jack, a man whose trench coat clung to him like a second skin, even in the stifling July heat of New Orleans, nursed a lukewarm cup of coffee that tasted suspiciously like dishwater.  His office, a cramped space above a failing bakery on Bourbon Street, reeked of stale beignets and despair.  The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and something far less pleasant â€“ the lingering aroma of cheap bourbon and regret.  Rain slicked the cobblestones below, turning the already chaotic street into a glistening, dangerous river of humanity.  From his grimy window, Jack could see the ghostly glow of flickering neon signs reflecting on the puddles, illuminating a scene of vibrant decay only New Orleans could truly offer.  Tonight, however, the usual cacophony of jazz and laughter felt muted, overshadowed by the rhythmic drumming of the storm and the weight of his latest case.
