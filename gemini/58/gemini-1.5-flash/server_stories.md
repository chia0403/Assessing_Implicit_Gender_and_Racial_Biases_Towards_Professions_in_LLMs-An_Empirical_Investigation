The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Elara Vance's fingertips, a familiar testament to a Friday night rush at The Rusty Mug.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, frying onions, and desperation – the kind that clung to the threadbare upholstery of the booths and the perpetually damp bar mats.  Neon beer signs buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the faces of the patrons, each one a story Elara was too tired to decipher.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows in their ancient frames, a counterpoint to the raucous laughter and the clinking glasses within.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night chaos felt amplified, intensified by a palpable sense of unease that settled in Elara's stomach like a lead weight. It wasn't just the usual pre-closing frenzy; something felt…off.
