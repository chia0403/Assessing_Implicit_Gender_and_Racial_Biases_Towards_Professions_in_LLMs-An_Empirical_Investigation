The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s charcoal coat around her legs as she hurried across the bleak expanse of the city’s East River Park.  Grey, skeletal trees clawed at the bruised twilight sky, mirroring the thorny anxieties that snaked through her own weary soul.  This wasn’t the picturesque postcard view touted in the tourist brochures; this was the raw, unforgiving backdrop to Mia’s life as a probation officer in the 10th Precinct, a reality far removed from the sun-drenched beaches she’d dreamt of as a wide-eyed law student.  Tonight, however, the chilling wind felt particularly keen, a harbinger of the trouble brewing on the other side of the Bowery, a trouble that had the potential to unravel everything she’d painstakingly built.  The flickering neon sign of the “Lucky Dragon” noodle bar cast a lurid glow on the rain-slicked pavement, a stark contrast to the sterile, clinical world of her office just a few blocks away. This was her domain, the unforgiving landscape of second chances, and tonight, one of her charges was about to test the limits of that very concept.
