The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Thorne's face as the wind howled a mournful dirge across the jagged cliffs of Cornwall.  Rain, thick and relentless, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the small, windswept village of Porthcurno huddled below.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, carried a chilling undercurrent â€“ the metallic tang of blood.  Ava shivered, pulling her worn, navy blue raincoat tighter, not entirely from the cold.  The body, discovered just hours ago clinging to the treacherous rocks below the dramatic granite headland, had a story to tell, and Ava Thorne, hardened by years on the force, was determined to hear it, even if it meant wrestling the truth from the teeth of a relentless Cornish gale.
