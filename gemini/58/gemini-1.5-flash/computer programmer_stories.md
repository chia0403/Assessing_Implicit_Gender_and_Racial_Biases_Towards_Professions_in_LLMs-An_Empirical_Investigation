The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon Noodle House" cast a lurid glow across Elias Thorne's rain-slicked shoulders.  Water cascaded from the brim of his worn fedora, mingling with the greasy sheen of his perpetually unkempt dark hair.  He pulled his threadbare trench coat tighter, the damp chill seeping into his bones despite the steaming bowl of ramen clutched in his hands.  Elias, a programmer whose caffeine intake rivaled that of a small hydroelectric dam, found solace in the labyrinthine alleys of Neo-Kyoto's underbelly, a stark contrast to the sterile, glass-and-steel towers where he spent his days crafting code for OmniCorp, a tech behemoth with secrets darker than the soy sauce staining his fingers.  The rain hammered against the corrugated iron rooftops, a relentless rhythm accompanying the rhythmic slurping of his noodles, each mouthful a tiny victory against the encroaching gloom of a night promising more than just rain.
