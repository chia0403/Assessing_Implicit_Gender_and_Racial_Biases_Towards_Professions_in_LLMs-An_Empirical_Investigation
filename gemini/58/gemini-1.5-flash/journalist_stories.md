The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s worn leather notepad, mirroring the crumbling state of the building itself.  A biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the rusted metal, carrying the scent of burnt coffee and desperation – a familiar perfume in the Lower East Side.  Mia, a journalist for the struggling *East Village Chronicle*, huddled deeper into her threadbare coat, the collar pulled high against the chill.  From her perch on the fourth floor, she could see the flickering neon sign of Manny’s Deli, a beacon of greasy sustenance in the encroaching twilight.  Across the street, the boarded-up windows of what was once a vibrant art gallery served as a stark reminder of the neighborhood’s slow, agonizing decay.  Tonight, though, Mia wasn't interested in the usual urban blight.  Tonight, she was hunting something far more elusive – a story that could either save her career, or bury it six feet under.
