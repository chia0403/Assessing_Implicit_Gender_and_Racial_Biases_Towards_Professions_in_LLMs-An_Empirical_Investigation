The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the slick cobblestone street of Port Blossom.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since dawn, plastered her charcoal grey coat to her thin frame. The air smelled of brine and decaying kelp, a familiar aroma that usually soothed her, but tonight, it only served to heighten the gnawing unease in her stomach.  Port Blossom, a picturesque fishing village nestled between craggy cliffs and a turbulent sea, was usually a haven of quiet charm.  Tonight, however, it felt claustrophobic, its narrow streets and tightly packed houses pressing in on her like the suffocating weight of a secret.  Amelia, a physician's assistant at the small, understaffed Port Blossom Community Clinic, tugged her scarf tighter, the worn wool offering little comfort against the penetrating chill.  The emergency call had been cryptic, the voice on the other end frantic and barely coherent, mentioning only a "terrible accident" at the old lighthouse.  Amelia knew, with a certainty that chilled her more than the wind, that whatever awaited her at the end of this rain-lashed path would be anything but ordinary.
