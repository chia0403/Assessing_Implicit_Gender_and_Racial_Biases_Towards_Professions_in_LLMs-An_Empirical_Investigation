The humid air hung heavy, a thick, perfumed blanket woven from the scent of frangipani and something far less pleasant – the lingering aroma of decay.  Judge Evangeline Moreau wiped a bead of perspiration from her brow, the delicate gold filigree of her bracelet catching the weak sunlight filtering through the dense foliage of the courtroom’s overgrown courtyard.  This wasn’t the hallowed hall of justice she was accustomed to in Port-au-Prince; this was a makeshift court, constructed from salvaged planks and rusted corrugated iron, nestled precariously on the edge of Cité Soleil.  The air thrummed with a low, restless energy, a constant hum of cicadas and whispered anxieties that vibrated in the very ground beneath her worn leather sandals.  Before her, a throng of onlookers, their faces etched with a mixture of hope, fear, and simmering resentment, crowded around the ramshackle structure.  Today, Evangeline Moreau would dispense justice, not in the stately grandeur of marble and mahogany, but in the harsh, unforgiving reality of a city struggling to survive.
