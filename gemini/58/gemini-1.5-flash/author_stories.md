The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the small, rocking boat.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, a familiar perfume that usually soothed her creative soul.

Amelia, author of the bestselling "Whispers of the Kelp Forest" trilogy, found herself stranded, quite literally, on the craggy, windswept isle of Inisherin Beg, a place far removed from the polished literary salons of Dublin and even further from the peaceful sanctuary she desperately craved.  The tiny island, barely a mile across, was a jagged tooth of rock thrust violently from the emerald sea, its only visible signs of habitation a crumbling stone cottage and a scattering of sheep gazing with unnervingly intelligent eyes.  The cottage, thankfully, was hers – at least for the next month, a self-imposed exile designed to reignite the flickering embers of her muse.  But the silence, intended as solace, was beginning to feel more like a suffocating shroud.
