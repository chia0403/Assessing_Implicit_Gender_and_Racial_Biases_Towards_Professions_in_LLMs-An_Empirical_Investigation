The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the frost-covered soccer field.  Breath plumed white in the frigid air, momentarily obscuring the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter of the Northwood High School grounds.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised purple orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched and distorted the already uneven playing surface.  Amy, bundled in a thick Northwood Eagles’ parka, felt the familiar chill not just in the air, but deep in her bones.  This wasn't the kind of weather that inspired finesse or flowing passes; this was the kind of weather that bred grit, determination, and the raw, unforgiving will to win.  And Amy Hernandez, head coach of the Northwood Eagles girls' varsity soccer team, needed all three in abundance.  The regional playoffs were only a week away, and the team's performance lately had been...uninspiring.
