The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed Blackwood Manor.  Dead leaves, the colour of burnt umber and rust, swirled around his worn boots, clinging to the damp, moss-covered stone walls. The manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey granite, hunched against the storm like a brooding giant, its many windows like vacant, dark eyes staring out at the desolate landscape.  Elias, groundskeeper to Blackwood for the past twenty years, pulled his threadbare scarf tighter, the wool scratchy against his chapped skin.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, a familiar, almost comforting aroma that spoke of the relentless cycle of life and death playing out across the sprawling estate.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholic beauty of Blackwood felt…different. A prickling unease, sharper than the wind’s bite, settled in his bones.
