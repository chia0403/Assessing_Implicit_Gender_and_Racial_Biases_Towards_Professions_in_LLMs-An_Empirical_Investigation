The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Jean Hawthorne's otherwise silent existence.  Amelia Jean, or Amy as everyone – except the perpetually disgruntled Mr. Sterling – called her, perched on her ergonomic chair, its plush cushioning doing little to alleviate the dull ache in her lower back. The aroma of stale coffee and old paper hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to the beige walls and the worn, plush carpet like a stubborn stain.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the hum of the office, rattling the windowpanes of the imposing skyscraper, a stark contrast to the sterile calm within.  It was a Tuesday, and for Amelia Jean, Tuesdays were always the same: a slow burn of anticipated tedium punctuated by the occasional jarring interruption.  Today, however, felt different.  A subtle shift in the air, a premonition of something… unsettling.
