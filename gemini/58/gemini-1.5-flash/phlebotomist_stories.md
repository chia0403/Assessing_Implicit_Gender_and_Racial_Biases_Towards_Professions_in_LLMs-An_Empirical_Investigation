The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Memorial Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic beeping of the heart monitors that occasionally drifted in from the hallway.  Rain lashed against the large windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape into streaks of grey and black.  Amelia Katherine “Amy” Hernandez, a phlebotomist with eyes the colour of burnt umber and hands that moved with surprising gentleness despite their frequent contact with needles, sighed, the sound barely audible above the whirring of the centrifuge.  Tonight, the usual pre-holiday chaos was amplified tenfold.  A flu outbreak had swept through the city, filling the hospital with a sea of coughing, feverish patients, each one demanding a vial of their precious blood.  Amy rubbed her tired eyes, the scent of antiseptic and fear thick in the air.
