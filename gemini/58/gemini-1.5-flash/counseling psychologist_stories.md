The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room was a surprisingly calming shade of seafoam green.  It was a deliberate choice, she’d told the decorator, a muted hue to offset the anxieties that inevitably permeated the space.  This morning, however, even the carefully curated serenity couldn’t quite mask the simmering tension.  The air hung heavy, thick with the unspoken anxieties of the three clients already seated – a nervous-looking young man meticulously picking at a loose thread on his trousers, a woman clutching a worn handbag as if it contained a lifeline, and an older gentleman whose carefully combed silver hair couldn’t quite disguise the tremor in his hands.  Outside, the relentless drumming of Seattle rain against the windowpanes added its own melancholic soundtrack to the unspoken worries filling the room.  Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist with a reputation for both her empathy and her incisive insights, adjusted her glasses, a small, almost imperceptible sigh escaping her lips.  Today was going to be a long one.
