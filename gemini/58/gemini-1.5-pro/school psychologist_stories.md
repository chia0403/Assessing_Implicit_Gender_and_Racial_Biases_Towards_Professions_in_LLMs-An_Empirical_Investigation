The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the frost-covered parking lot of Ashwood Elementary.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs, and the thin soles of her ankle boots offered little protection against the frigid concrete. Ashwood, a squat brick building nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside, looked deceptively cheerful this morning.  The golden leaves still clinging to the ancient maple trees at the edge of the property shimmered in the weak sunlight, and strings of brightly coloured construction paper leaves decorated the windows, proclaiming the imminent arrival of Thanksgiving.  Inside, however, Dr. Vance knew a different story was unfolding.  Eight-year-old Samuel Croft had been withdrawn and exhibiting increasingly erratic behaviour, culminating in yesterday's incident where he'd barricaded himself in the art cupboard, clutching a pair of safety scissors.  Eleanor tightened her grip on her worn leather satchel, a familiar knot of apprehension forming in her stomach. This wasn't just another case file; this was a child in distress, and she desperately hoped she could help.
