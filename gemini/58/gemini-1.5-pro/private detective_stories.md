Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting irony given the state of Amelia Hayes’ office.  Water trickled down the cracked pane, tracing a muddy path across a faded photograph of a grinning boxer dog. Amelia herself, full name Amelia Grace Hayes, sat hunched over her desk, the flickering gaslight casting long shadows that danced with the swirling cigarette smoke. Her once-sharp emerald eyes, usually alight with shrewd intelligence, were dull with exhaustion. The aroma of stale coffee and cheap whiskey hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in her cramped, second-floor office above O’Malley’s Pub on Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 1948. A city still shaking off the post-war jitters, a city brimming with secrets, and a city Amelia knew like the back of her hand.
