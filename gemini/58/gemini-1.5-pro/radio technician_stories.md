The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Bonneville Salt Flats, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks and rattling the antenna bolted to the roof of her beat-up Ford Econoline van.  Inside, nestled amongst a chaotic tangle of wires, oscilloscopes, and soldering irons, Amy hunched over a vintage Heathkit SB-102 transceiver, the faint glow of vacuum tubes painting her face in an ethereal orange light.  It was 3:17 AM, the sky a bruised purple canvas speckled with the indifferent glitter of distant stars.  Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted a tiny trimmer capacitor with the tip of a miniature screwdriver.  She was chasing a ghost – a faint, elusive signal that had been drifting in and out of the shortwave bands for the past week, whispering its secrets into the ether just beyond her grasp.  The salt flats, normally silent save for the whisper of the wind, had become her listening post, a place far removed from the interference of civilization where she hoped to finally isolate and decipher the enigmatic broadcast.
