The biting wind whipped across the vast, flat expanse of the Texas panhandle, carrying the scent of dust and diesel.  A lone figure, Silas Rayford "Si" Jenkins, hunched deeper into his fluorescent orange parka, the reflective stripes barely visible in the pre-dawn gloom.  Si, a man built like a fire hydrant with a weathered face that spoke of long days under the relentless sun, stamped his feet against the frozen ground.  His breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the blinking red lights of the traffic cones that marked off his section of Highway 87.  The highway, a black ribbon stretching to the horizon in both directions, was eerily deserted at this hour, save for the occasional rumble of a long-haul trucker battling the wind further down the road.  This morning's job was a simple pothole repair, but the sub-zero temperatures threatened to turn the asphalt into something resembling concrete, making Si's already arduous task even more challenging.  He eyed the steaming thermos in his truck, a beacon of warmth in the frigid landscape, and knew he had better get started before the morning commute transformed the empty highway into a roaring river of steel.
