The insistent California sun, already high and hot even at 9:30 am, glinted off the chrome and glass facade of "Nailed It," Amelia Rose Hawthorne's petite nail salon. Nestled between a bustling laundromat and a slightly dubious-looking psychic parlor in the heart of Venice Beach, the salon was Amelia Rose's sanctuary.  Inside, the air thrummed with the gentle whir of the ventilation system, battling the mingled scents of acetone, acrylic, and the coconut-mango lotion Amelia Rose swore by.  Tropical-themed murals, painted by her eccentric Aunt Mildred, adorned the walls, depicting impossibly cheerful monkeys getting pedicures and toucans sporting elaborate nail art. This morning, however, the usually vibrant space felt heavy, the air thick with unspoken anticipation. Amelia Rose, perched on her rolling stool behind the manicure station nearest the window, tapped a perfectly polished, coral-pink nail against her teeth, her brow furrowed. Something was about to happen, she could feel it in her perfectly sculpted acrylics.
