The biting November wind whipped across the desolate beach, stinging Elara Vivienne Moreau’s cheeks as she watched the grey Atlantic churn.  Salt spray kissed the lens of her vintage Bolex camera, a gift from her grandfather, the renowned French filmmaker, Jean-Luc Moreau.  This windswept stretch of the Irish coast, near the tiny village of Doolin, was a far cry from the sun-drenched sets of her last film, a critically acclaimed romantic comedy. But Elara wasn’t here for romance.  She was here for ghosts. The crumbling ruins of Carragh Castle, perched precariously on the cliff edge, loomed above her, a skeletal finger pointing towards the brooding sky.  This was the location, the inspiration, the heart of her next project: a gothic psychological thriller that she was determined would cement her place, not just as a rising star, but as a true auteur.  This film, Elara knew, would be her masterpiece.
