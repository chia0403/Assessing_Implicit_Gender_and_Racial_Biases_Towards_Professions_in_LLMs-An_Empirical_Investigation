The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet of Northwood High.  Elias, his full name Elias Vance Thorne, stood at his desk, meticulously arranging stacks of graded essays. Outside, a bruised purple sky bled into the inky blackness that still clung to the corners of the small, rural town of Havenwood, Oregon.  Pine-scented air, crisp with the promise of a frosty October morning, snaked through the slightly ajar window, rustling the student artwork pinned to the corkboard behind him.  Havenwood, nestled deep within the Cascade foothills, was a town where secrets grew like moss on the ancient Douglas firs, and where the line between the ordinary and the extraordinary was often blurred by the swirling mists that rolled in from the surrounding mountains. This morning, however, felt different. A palpable tension, thick and unsettling, hung in the air, a discordant note in the usual symphony of morning stillness.  Elias, a man acutely attuned to the rhythms of his small town, felt it prickle at the back of his neck.
