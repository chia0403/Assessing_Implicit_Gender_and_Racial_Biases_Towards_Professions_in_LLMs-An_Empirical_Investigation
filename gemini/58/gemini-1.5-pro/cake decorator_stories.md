The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bitter counterpoint to the usual symphony of vanilla, buttercream, and almond that permeated Genevieve "Vivi" Dupres's bakery, Buttercream Dreams.  Rain lashed against the large picture window overlooking the cobbled streets of Wicklow, Ireland, turning the normally charming view into a blurry impressionist painting.

It was the centerpiece for the O'Malley wedding, scheduled for tomorrow, and currently resembled a melting glacier more than a symbol of everlasting love.  This was not how she envisioned her Tuesday evening.
