The biting wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the "Skyreach" tower, whistling through the exposed steel girders like a mournful ghost.  Fifty stories above the sprawling metropolis of New Zenith,  Elijah "Eli" Blackwood clung to a beam, his thick, calloused hands raw from the cold.

Below him, the city was slowly waking, a symphony of distant car horns and the rumble of early morning deliveries a stark contrast to the eerie quiet of the half-finished skyscraper. Eli shifted his weight, the harness digging into his shoulders, and spat a stream of condensation into the void. Another day, another dizzying climb.  This was his life, etched in steel and sweat, a testament to grit and gravity.  And today, it was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
