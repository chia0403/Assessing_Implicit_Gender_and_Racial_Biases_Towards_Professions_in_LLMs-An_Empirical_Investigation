The flickering fluorescent lights of the server room hummed a discordant B-flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the cooling fans.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the endless rows of blinking servers that formed the beating heart of Chronos Corporation.

Chronos, a global leader in time-series data analysis, prided itself on its impenetrable security and unwavering system stability.  Tonight, however, something felt fundamentally wrong. The usual green status indicators were interspersed with an unsettling number of flashing ambers, and a low, pulsing alarm, usually reserved for catastrophic failures, throbbed ominously from the depths of the room.  Amelia pushed a stray strand of dark hair from her face and took a deep breath, the metallic tang of ozone heavy in the air. This was more than just a routine system glitch.
