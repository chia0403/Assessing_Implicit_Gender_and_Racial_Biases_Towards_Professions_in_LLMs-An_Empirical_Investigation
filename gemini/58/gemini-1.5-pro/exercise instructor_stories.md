The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into shimmering diamonds.  Inside the air-conditioned sanctuary of "Body By Beatriz," the air thrummed with a bass-heavy Latin beat and the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on polished wood.  Beatriz "Bea" Rodriguez, clad in vibrant coral leggings and a matching sports bra, bounced on the balls of her feet, her microphone headset secured around her dark curls.  Sweat glistened on her bronzed skin, but her smile never faltered.  "Come on, mis amores!" she yelled over the music, her voice full of infectious energy. "Feel the burn!  Five more squats, and we're onto those glorious glutes!"  The mirrored walls reflected twenty determined faces, all mirroring Beaâ€™s enthusiasm, though with varying degrees of struggle.  The Monday morning "Booty Blast" class was always packed, a testament to Bea's magnetic personality and killer workout routines.  Little did they know, this Monday was about to be anything but routine.
