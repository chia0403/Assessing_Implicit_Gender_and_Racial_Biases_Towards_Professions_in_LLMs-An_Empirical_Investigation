The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick balaclava.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, promised a blizzard within the hour.  He hunched deeper into his thermal layers, the crunch of his boots on the packed snow the only sound louder than the ceaseless howl of the wind.  Around him, the McMurdo research station was a cluster of prefabricated buildings, clinging to the edge of Ross Island like barnacles to a ship's hull. Inside the brightly lit windows, Aris could see the flickering shadows of his colleagues, warm and safe, while he remained out here, tethered to the reality of this unforgiving landscape. He adjusted the heavy backpack containing his spectrometer and gazed across the frozen expanse of the McMurdo Sound, towards a distant, shimmering anomaly that had drawn him to this desolate corner of the world.
