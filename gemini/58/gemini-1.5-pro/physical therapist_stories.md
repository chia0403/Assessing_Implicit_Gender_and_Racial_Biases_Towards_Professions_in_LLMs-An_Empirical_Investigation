The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, stinging Amelia Reyes' cheeks as she hurried across the cobbled street.  Rain, a near-constant companion in Seattle, threatened to unleash another deluge. Clutching her worn leather satchel tighter, Amelia ducked into the warm, faintly antiseptic-smelling haven of "Harborview Physical Therapy," a small clinic nestled between a bustling fish market and a dusty antique shop.  Inside, sunlight strained through rain-streaked windows, illuminating the brightly colored exercise balls and the rows of gleaming parallel bars.  The air hummed with the low whir of ultrasound machines and the rhythmic squeak of a stationary bike. It was a Tuesday morning in November, the kind of gray, damp day that made Amelia long for the sun-drenched beaches of her childhood in Southern California, but also, strangely, made her appreciate the cozy familiarity of her small practice.  She hung her coat on the hook by the door, a small brass nameplate glinting beneath:  *Amelia Reyes, DPT*.
