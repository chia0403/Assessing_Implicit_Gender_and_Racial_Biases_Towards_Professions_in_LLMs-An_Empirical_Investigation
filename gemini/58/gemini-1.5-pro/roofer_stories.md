The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell clinging to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He adjusted his sweat-soaked bandana and squinted at the sprawling Victorian mansion below, its gables and dormers a dizzying puzzle of angles and shadows.

A gothic behemoth overlooking the windswept cliffs of Port Blossom, Maine, a town where the fog rolled in thick as secrets and lingered just as long. The salty air, usually a welcome reprieve from the tar’s fumes, today carried the unsettling scent of brine and something else… something faintly metallic.
