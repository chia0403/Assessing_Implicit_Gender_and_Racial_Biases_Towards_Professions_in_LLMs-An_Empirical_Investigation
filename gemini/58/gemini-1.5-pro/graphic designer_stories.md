The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes, snatching stray strands of her auburn hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant easel across the cobblestone sidewalk. The Parisian twilight was settling in, casting long shadows from the tightly packed buildings that lined the Rue de Charonne.  Amy’s breath puffed out in white clouds as she finally managed to position the easel in front of "Le Chat Noir Reimagined," a tiny, vibrant cafe she’d recently begun designing posters for.  The cafe’s owner, Madame Dubois, a woman whose energy seemed inversely proportional to her size, had specifically requested a chalkboard design advertising their Beaujolais Nouveau celebration, and Amy, despite her numb fingers, was determined to get the initial sketch done before the last vestiges of daylight disappeared. The air buzzed with the anticipation of the upcoming festival, a mix of swirling aromas of roasted chestnuts and the cheerful chatter spilling from open doorways, weaving a comforting magic around Amy despite the chill.  Her charcoal pencil felt heavy in her gloved hand, the rough texture of the board beneath a welcome grounding sensation in the midst of the swirling energy of the street.
