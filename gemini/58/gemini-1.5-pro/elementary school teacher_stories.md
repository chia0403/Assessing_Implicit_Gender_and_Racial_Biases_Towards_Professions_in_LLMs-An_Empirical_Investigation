The late October air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke, nipped at Amelia Hayes's cheeks as she hurried across the parking lot of Maplewood Elementary.  The sun, a pale disc struggling through the morning mist, cast long shadows from the towering sugar maples that gave the school its name.  Nestled in the heart of the sleepy Vermont town of Havenwood, Maplewood Elementary was a small, single-story building, its brick facade softened by overflowing window boxes of now-withered petunias.  Amelia, clutching a stack of graded spelling tests and a thermos of pumpkin spice latte, reached the back entrance and fumbled for her keys, a familiar knot of anticipation tightening in her stomach.  It was Tuesday, which meant art class with Mrs. Periwinkle and, more importantly, story time with her rambunctious second graders.  This week, she'd promised them the legend of the Headless Horseman, and judging by the elaborate pumpkin decorations adorning the hallway, her students were already well-immersed in the spooky spirit of the season.
