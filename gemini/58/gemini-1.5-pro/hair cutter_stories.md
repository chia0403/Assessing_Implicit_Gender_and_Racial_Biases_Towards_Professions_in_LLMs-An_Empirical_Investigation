The air in Clementine's Chop Shop, thick with the scent of coconut oil and sandalwood, vibrated with the low hum of electric clippers. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the view of Ashworth Street beyond. Inside, beneath the warm glow of Edison bulbs strung across the exposed brick walls, Clementine Prichard meticulously sculpted a high-fade, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Ashworth Street, a once-bustling artery in the heart of Old Town, now held more boarded-up businesses than open ones, but Clementine's shop remained a vibrant exception, a small beacon in a slowly fading neighborhood. Tonight, however, the only other occupant was a ginger tabby cat curled asleep atop a stack of vintage vinyl records, oblivious to the storm raging outside and the quiet tension that hung in the air within.
