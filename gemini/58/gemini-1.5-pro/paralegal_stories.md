The fluorescent lights of the Weathersby, Finch, and Keating Law Offices hummed a low, monotonous song, punctuated only by the rhythmic click-clacking of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's keyboard. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Chicago, blurring the already fading November twilight into a hazy smear of grey.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, hunched over her desk, a half-eaten turkey and swiss sandwich lying forlornly on a paper plate beside her.  Deadlines loomed, three of them, all demanding immediate attention like squawking, needy chicks. The senior partner, Mr. Weathersby himself, had a penchant for assigning impossible tasks on Friday afternoons, a habit Amelia suspected was less about legal urgency and more about his perverse enjoyment of watching his underlings scramble.  Tonight, it was the Peterson case â€“ a messy divorce involving a contested yacht, a hidden offshore account, and a surprisingly high number of miniature poodles.  Amelia sighed, the scent of stale coffee clinging to the air like a persistent ghost.  This wasn't how she'd envisioned her life as a paralegal.  Glamorous courtroom dramas, she'd imagined. Not endless document review and the lingering aroma of poultry.  Little did she know, the Peterson case was about to become a lot more interesting than missing poodle custody papers.
