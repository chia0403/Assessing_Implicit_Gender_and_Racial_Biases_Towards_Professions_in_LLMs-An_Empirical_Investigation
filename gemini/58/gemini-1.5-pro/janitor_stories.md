The flickering fluorescent lights of the Northwood Research Facility hummed a lonely tune, their pale glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour, the hour when even the ghosts of ambition seemed to sleep.  This was Elias Thorne's domain.  Elias, with his salt-and-pepper beard tucked into his collar and his name tag slightly askew, pushed his janitorial cart down the deserted hallway of Wing C, the bio-engineering department. The air, usually thick with the metallic tang of ozone and the antiseptic scent of bleach, tonight carried a faint, unfamiliar sweetness, like overripe fruit. It prickled at the back of Elias's throat and made the fine hairs on his arms stand on end. He paused, his hand gripping the worn handle of his mop, a sense of unease settling in the pit of his stomach.  Northwood was never this quiet.  Something was wrong.
