Rain lashed against the gothic arches of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Dr. Elias Thorne. The biting November wind whipped through the narrow closes, carrying the scent of brine and damp wool.  Elias, his dark hair plastered to his forehead, adjusted his worn leather satchel and hurried through the imposing oak doors. Inside, the air was thick with the murmur of hushed voices and the rustling of paperwork. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn linoleum floor. Elias was here to assess the mental competency of Alistair Croft, a man accused of a particularly gruesome crime â€“ the ritualistic murder of a prominent historian in the shadowed depths of Calton Hill. The case had gripped the city, whispering its macabre details through the cobbled streets and into the nightmares of its citizens. This wasn't just another evaluation for Elias; it was a descent into the heart of darkness, a confrontation with the monstrous that lurked beneath the veneer of Edinburgh's elegant facade.
