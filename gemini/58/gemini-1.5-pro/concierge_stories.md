The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered, a symphony of polished marble, cascading crystal chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of moneyed conversations.  Rain lashed against the towering arched windows, blurring the Parisian cityscape into a watercolour wash of greys and golds.  Inside, the air hummed with a carefully orchestrated warmth, a stark contrast to the November chill that clung to the city outside.  This was Antoinette Dubois' domain.  As Head Concierge of the Magnifique, Antoinette, with her impeccably coiffed auburn hair and a smile that could charm the birds from the trees, was the gatekeeper to a world of exclusive experiences, whispered secrets, and impossible requests.  Tonight, however, the usual low thrum of activity carried a distinct edge of anticipation, a tension that even the fragrant lilies strategically placed around the lobby couldn't quite mask.  A priceless diamond necklace, the “L’Étoile du Nord,” was on display in the hotel’s vault, and its glittering presence seemed to amplify every shadow, every creak of the ancient building.
