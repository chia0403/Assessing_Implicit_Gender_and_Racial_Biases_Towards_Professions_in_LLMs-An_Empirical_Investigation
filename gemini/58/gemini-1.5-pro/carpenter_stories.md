The scent of sawdust and pine hung thick in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne's threadbare waistcoat like a second skin.  The late afternoon sun, already dipping behind the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows across his small workshop. It nestled at the edge of Oakhaven, a village clinging precariously to a steep hillside overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Whisperwind Sea.  The rhythmic clang of Elias's hammer against iron echoed through the quiet village, a familiar counterpoint to the ceaseless whisper of the wind that snaked through the narrow, cobbled streets. The workshop, barely bigger than a one-room cottage, was overflowing with half-finished projects: a rocking horse with a chipped ear, a sturdy oak table missing a leg, and stacks of planks still smelling of the forest they were born from.  A single window, patched with oiled parchment, offered a breathtaking view of the turbulent sea far below, a constant reminder of the precariousness of life in Oakhaven.
