The clatter of pots and the sizzle of garlic in olive oil filled the tiny kitchen, a symphony conducted by Elias Thorne.  His apron, once pristine white, was now a Jackson Pollock of tomato sauce, flour, and a suspicious smear of something purplish he suspected was blueberry. Elias, head chef and sole proprietor of "Thorne in Your Side," a hole-in-the-wall eatery nestled between a laundromat and a pawn shop in the perpetually drizzly port town of Port Blossom, Maine, hummed along to a scratchy vinyl of Bessie Smith. Outside, the fog clung to the salt-laced air, obscuring the fishing boats bobbing in the harbor.  It was a Tuesday, typically slow, but Elias had a feeling today was going to be different. A shiver ran down his spine, unrelated to the chill of the walk-in fridge. Something was brewing, and it wasn't just the clam chowder.
