The velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of anticipation, trembled slightly as Amelia Wren Nightingale adjusted the silver microphone clipped to the bodice of her emerald green gown.  The air in the Grand Majestic Theatre, a gilded relic of a bygone era in the heart of New Orleans, buzzed with a thousand whispers, a low hum of excitement that vibrated through the floorboards and up into Amelia's satin heels.  Rain hammered against the stained-glass skylight high above, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the nervous flutter in her stomach. Tonight wasn't just any performance; it was the culmination of years of relentless practice, grueling auditions, and soul-baring songwriting.  Tonight, Amelia was debuting her first original album, "Moonlight Serenade,"  to a sold-out crowd, a crowd that held the key to her dreams â€“ and perhaps, to the secrets of her past. The scent of old wood and damp velvet mingled with the sweet aroma of lilies from the bouquets lining the stage, a heady mix that both soothed and exhilarated her. This was it. Her moment.
