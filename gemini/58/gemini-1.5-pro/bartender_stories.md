The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Mug, a rhythm that matched the thrumming anxiety in Elias Thorne's chest.  Elias, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead, wiped down the sticky mahogany bar with a practiced hand. The air inside the Mug, usually thick with the smell of stale beer and peanut shells, tonight held a sharp, metallic tang that Elias couldn't quite place.  Nestled between a pawn shop and a boarded-up bookstore on the fringes of the rain-lashed port town of Port Blossom, Maine, the Rusty Mug was rarely this empty, even on a Tuesday night.  Usually, a handful of the town's fishermen and dockworkers would be huddled in booths, nursing their sorrows and swapping stories. Tonight, however, only one other person occupied the bar: a woman with eyes as dark and stormy as the night itself, sitting silently in a shadowed corner booth.  She hadn't touched her drink – a neat whiskey – for the last hour.
