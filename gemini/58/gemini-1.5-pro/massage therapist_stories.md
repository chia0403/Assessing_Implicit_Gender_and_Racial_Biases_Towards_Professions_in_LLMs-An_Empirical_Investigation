Rain drummed lightly against the single, fogged-up window, a soundtrack Amelia had grown accustomed to in her five years of practice.  Mrs. Petrov, a regular client with a seemingly endless supply of anxieties and a penchant for gossip, sighed contentedly.  "Right there, Amelia, that's the spot," she murmured, her voice muffled by the face cradle.  Amelia, her own anxieties simmering beneath a veneer of professional calm, applied just a bit more pressure, her fingers seeking out the source of the tension.  Outside, a car backfired, startling a flock of pigeons into flight.  Amelia braced herself.  Mrs. Petrov’s anxieties were contagious, and something told her this was going to be more than just a typical Thursday afternoon.
