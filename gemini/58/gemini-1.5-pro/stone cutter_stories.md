The wind, sharp and smelling of pine resin, whipped through the high passes of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He knelt, bracing himself against the gale, his calloused fingers tracing the lines of jade that ran through the granite face of the cliff.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded across a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Elias's breath plumed white before him, momentarily obscuring the half-finished carving of a griffin he was commissioned to create for the archway of Lord Aerilon’s new keep.  Five hundred feet below, the valley floor – a patchwork of emerald fields and dark forest – looked like a tapestry woven by giants.  Here, perched precariously on a scaffolding of ropes and weathered timber, Elias felt closer to the sky gods than to the men who toiled far below.  This was his domain, a world of granite and wind, where the only sounds were the screech of hawks and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his chisel against stone.
