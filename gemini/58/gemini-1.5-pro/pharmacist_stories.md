The relentless New Orleans humidity clung to Dr. Evangeline "Evie" Moreau like a second skin as she unlocked the wrought-iron gates of Moreau's Pharmacy.  Spanish moss draped from the ancient live oak that shaded the building, its branches reaching out like skeletal fingers over the faded green awning.  The pharmacy, nestled in the heart of the French Quarter, had been in Evieâ€™s family for generations, its walls steeped in the scent of ancient remedies and whispered secrets.  The year was 1928, a time of jazz, flapper dresses, and a burgeoning undercurrent of something darker brewing beneath the city's vibrant surface.  This morning, however, held only the promise of another sweltering day and the usual trickle of customers needing tonics for everything from summer colds to heartache.  Little did Evie know, a prescription for murder was about to walk through her door.
