The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau, plastering strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her charcoal grey scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her skin, but offering a welcome barrier against the icy air.  Below her, the city of Montreal shimmered, a mosaic of slate rooftops dusted with a premature snowfall, punctuated by the glittering spire of Saint Joseph's Oratory.  Cassie stood on the unfinished rooftop of Le Phénix, her latest project, a daringly modern residential tower that was slowly but surely clawing its way into the Montreal skyline. The concrete floor, still rough beneath her sturdy work boots, vibrated faintly with the distant hum of construction machinery.  The scent of wet cement hung heavy in the air, mingling with the crisp, metallic tang of winter.  Cassie breathed it in deeply, a familiar and strangely comforting aroma.  This was her element.  Up here, amidst the skeletal framework and the raw exposure to the elements, she felt more alive than anywhere else.  But today, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling as cold and hard as the concrete beneath her feet. Something about Le Phénix felt… off.
