The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Thorne's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking Portwenn, Cornwall.  Her easel, battered and splattered with every colour imaginable, stood defiant against the gusting wind, its legs wedged between two rocks.  Below, the turquoise waves crashed against the granite shore, churning into white foam that looked like spilled milk against the dark, brooding sea. The sky, a vast expanse of bruised purple and swirling grey, threatened rain, but Amy was oblivious.  Her entire focus was consumed by the scene before her: the tumbledown cottages clinging to the hillside, their slate roofs gleaming wetly, the tiny fishing boats bobbing in the harbour like brightly coloured toys, and the lone lighthouse, a stark white sentinel against the gathering storm.  This wild, untamed beauty was her muse, the very air she breathed.  Here, in this remote corner of England, Amy felt truly alive, her artist's soul awakened by the raw power of the Atlantic.
