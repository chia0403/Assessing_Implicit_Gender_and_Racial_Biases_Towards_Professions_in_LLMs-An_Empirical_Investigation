The pungent scent of acetone mingled with the sweet aroma of coconut oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Genevieve "Gen" Dubois like a second skin. Her salon, "The Gilded Lily," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, was a tiny haven of shimmering powders, vibrant dyes, and the constant hum of a hairdryer.  October in New York City had painted the trees outside in fiery hues of red and gold, but inside, the Gilded Lily was a perpetual summer, illuminated by warm, strategically placed lighting designed to flatter every complexion.  Gen, with her fiery red curls pulled back in a loose bun, surveyed her kingdom. It was a Tuesday morning, slow as molasses, but she knew the pre-Halloween rush was just around the corner, a whirlwind of glitter, elaborate updos, and theatrical makeup that always left her both exhausted and exhilarated.  This year, however, something felt different.  A prickle of unease danced on the edge of her awareness, a feeling as persistent as the faint scent of ozone that lingered even after the last perm had settled.
