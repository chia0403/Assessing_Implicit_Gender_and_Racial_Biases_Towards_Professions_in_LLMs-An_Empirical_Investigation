The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat above Amelia Hayes, a pitch only truly noticeable in the pre-dawn quiet.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with a penchant for floral scrubs and a surprisingly steady hand, navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the hospital's basement level.  The air down here was thick with the metallic tang of disinfectant and the faint, sweet aroma of the hospital cafeteria's overnight baking â€“ a strange, sterile sort of comfort.  At 5:45 am, the world outside was still shrouded in darkness, but here, in the bowels of St. Jude's, the day was already beginning.  The lab was her domain, a kingdom of vials and centrifuges, where the secrets held within the human body were revealed.  Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the back of her neck, a sensation she couldn't quite explain, like the air itself held a secret it was reluctant to share.
