The fluorescent lights of McKinley High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the beige walls and linoleum floors of Evelyn Reed's office. Evelyn, full name Evelyn Beatrice Reed, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm tea against her teeth, her gaze drifting over the motivational posters adorning the walls.  "Believe in Yourself," one proclaimed, its vibrant colors clashing violently with the drab reality of a Monday morning in late November. Outside, the wind howled, whipping the bare branches of the ancient oak tree that dominated the courtyard. A thin film of ice glazed the sidewalks, hinting at the long, brutal winter yet to come in the small, isolated town of Havenwood, Maine.  Evelyn sighed, the warm, spiced tea doing little to thaw the creeping chill that seemed to permeate not just her office, but her very soul.  This was her tenth year at McKinley, and for the first time, the familiar routine felt less like comfort and more like confinement.
