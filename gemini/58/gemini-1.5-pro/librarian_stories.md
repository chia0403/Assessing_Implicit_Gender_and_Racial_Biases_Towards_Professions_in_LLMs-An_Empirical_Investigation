The frosted breath of Eleanor Vance, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, puffed out into the pre-dawn chill.  November had clawed its way into the small town of Auberon, Maine, bringing with it the scent of woodsmoke and the promise of early snow.  Auberon, nestled between a dense pine forest and the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, was a town steeped in quiet tradition and the hushed secrets of generations past. The library, a sturdy granite building with ivy clinging to its weathered walls, was no exception.  It stood sentinel at the edge of town square, its windows dark and unwelcoming at this early hour. Eleanor, however, found solace in the pre-opening stillness. It was in these quiet moments, before the creak of the front door and the rustle of turning pages, that the library truly felt like hers.  This morning, however, a different kind of stillness hung in the air, a charged silence that prickled the back of her neck and made the fine hairs on her arms stand on end.  Something was amiss.
