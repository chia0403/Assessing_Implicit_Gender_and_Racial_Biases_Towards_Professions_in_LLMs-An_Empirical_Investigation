The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne's ankles as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the ancient stone radiating a chill that seeped through his thick wool overcoat.  Gargoyles perched high on the gothic facade, their stony faces grimly illuminated by the flickering gas lamps that lined the walkway.  Built in 1722, the hospital clung to the edge of the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Sea, its very foundations seemingly groaning under the relentless assault of the waves.  Inside, warmth and the faint, antiseptic scent of carbolic acid awaited him, but out here, exposed to the raw elements, Elias felt a growing unease that had nothing to do with the cold and everything to do with the telegram clutched in his gloved hand. It summoned him back from a rare weekend respite in the nearby village of Port Blossom, and the cryptic urgency of the message – "Return immediately.  Matter of utmost importance. –  Sister Agnes" – had settled a knot of apprehension in his stomach that refused to unravel.
