The salt spray stung Amelia Reyes's face as she perched precariously on the black volcanic rocks, her tripod wobbling dangerously in the wind. Below her, the churning turquoise waters of the Devil's Churn, a natural cauldron carved into the Oregon coastline, foamed and roared.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the overcast sky, cast long, dramatic shadows across the jagged cliffs. Amelia, clad in a weather-beaten parka and sturdy hiking boots, adjusted the zoom lens of her Canon, her breath catching in her throat at the raw, untamed beauty of the scene. This was the shot – the one she’d been chasing for months. The one that would finally solidify her reputation, not just as a talented landscape photographer, but as an artist capable of capturing the very soul of the Pacific Northwest.
