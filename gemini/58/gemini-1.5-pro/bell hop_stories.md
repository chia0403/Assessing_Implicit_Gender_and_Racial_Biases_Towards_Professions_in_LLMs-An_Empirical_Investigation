The brass fixtures of the Grand Majestic Hotel gleamed under the oppressive July sun, reflecting the heat back onto the wilting potted ferns flanking the entrance.  Inside, the air hung thick and cool, a stark contrast to the swelter of New Orleans.  Ceiling fans whirred lazily overhead, stirring the scent of lilies and old money. Elias Beaumont, a young man with skin the colour of warm honey and eyes that shone like polished obsidian, straightened his pillbox hat and adjusted the starched collar of his uniform. He was one of the newest bellhops at the Grand Majestic, a position heâ€™d secured only a week prior, and the pristine white gloves he wore still felt stiff and unfamiliar on his hands.  He watched as a gaggle of women, draped in furs despite the weather, swept through the revolving doors, their laughter echoing off the marble floors, leaving a trail of expensive perfume in their wake.  Elias took a deep breath, the weight of the grandeur settling on his shoulders like the heavy brass buttons of his jacket. He had a feeling this summer was going to be anything but ordinary.
