The biting November wind whipped off the East River, carrying the scent of brine and decaying leaves and slapping against the exposed brick of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, stubbornly independent French bistro nestled between a laundromat and a bodega in a rapidly gentrifying corner of Brooklyn. Inside, the air thrummed with the controlled chaos of a Friday night dinner rush.  Copper pots clanged, orders were barked in a mix of rapid-fire French and heavily accented English, and the aroma of garlic, thyme, and butter hung thick in the air.  At the eye of this culinary storm, her auburn braid swinging like a metronome, stood Chef  Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont, her brow furrowed in concentration as she plated a perfectly seared duck breast with a flourish of her wrist.  Tonight's special, Magret de Canard Ã  l'Orange, was proving particularly popular, and Ellie felt a familiar thrill of satisfaction as she surveyed her domain.  This tiny kitchen, crammed with mismatched equipment and overflowing with passion, was her kingdom, and tonight, she was queen.
