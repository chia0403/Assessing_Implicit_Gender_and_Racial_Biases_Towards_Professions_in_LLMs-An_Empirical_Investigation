The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow over Amelia Reyes's scuffed sneakers. Rain lashed against the plate-glass windows, each drop a miniature explosion mirroring the churning anxiety in Amelia's stomach. It was a Tuesday night, usually slow, but tonight the diner was packed, every vinyl booth filled with the murmur of hushed conversations and the clatter of cutlery.  Steam rose from the perpetually full coffee pots, mingling with the sweet, synthetic scent of frying onions and the faint, underlying odor of bleach. Outside, on the slick, rain-washed streets of downtown Philadelphia, the city held its breath, waiting for the storm to break. Inside, Amelia, balancing a precarious tower of plates laden with cheesesteaks and onion rings, braced herself for another grueling round of orders.  She'd been on her feet for eight hours already, and the double shift stretched before her like a desolate highway.
