The relentless Florida sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the interior of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's aging Honda Civic to a stifling 100 degrees.  Palm trees swayed languidly in the humid air, offering little respite from the oppressive heat. Amelia, her crisp white blouse already clinging uncomfortably to her back, adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses and sighed.  Dunedin, Florida, a charming coastal town normally bustling with tourists and retirees, felt strangely deserted this Tuesday afternoon.  She was parked outside the faded pink stucco walls of the "Mermaid's Purse," a kitschy curio shop owned by Mrs. Evangeline Periwinkle, a client who was notoriously late for everything, including insurance premium payments. Amelia checked her watch. Fifteen minutes past their scheduled appointment. This was the third time this month.  The scent of brine and something vaguely fishy wafted from the shop's open doorway, mingling with the cloying sweetness of hibiscus blooming in a nearby planter.  Amelia grabbed her briefcase, its leather handle already warm to the touch, and braced herself for another round of Mrs. Periwinkleâ€™s rambling tales of mermaid sightings and pirate treasure.  This was the glamorous life of an insurance agent, Dunedin-style.
