The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones, the cries of street vendors hawking their wares, and the ever-present aroma of roasting chestnuts formed the backdrop to Elias Finch's life.  His small tailoring shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually dusty bookshop on Candlewick Lane, was his sanctuary.  The year was 1888, and the gas lamps of London, flickering against the encroaching November fog, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished wood floor of Elias's shop.  Fine fabrics draped from the walls, silks shimmering like captured rainbows, velvets whispering tales of luxury, and tweeds sturdy as the Yorkshire Moors from which they came.  Elias, a man of precise movements and quiet observation, stood at his workbench, the soft glow illuminating the intricate embroidery he was crafting onto a waistcoat destined for a Duke. The air in the shop, thick with the scent of beeswax, thread, and the faintest hint of cinnamon from the bakery next door, held a stillness that contrasted sharply with the cacophony of the street outside.  But tonight, Elias sensed something else in the air, a subtle shift, a prickle of unease, like the stillness before a storm.
