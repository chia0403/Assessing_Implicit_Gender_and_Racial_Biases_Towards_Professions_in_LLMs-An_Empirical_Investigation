The salt spray kissed Amelia Thorne's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking Port Blossom.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, had whipped her auburn braid into a frenzy against her paint-splattered oilskins. Below, the small fishing town clung to the Cornish coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull, its slate-roofed cottages huddled together against the vast expanse of the churning Atlantic.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, vibrated with the cries of gulls. Amelia, her palette knife clutched tight in her gloved hand, squinted at the scene before her.  The turbulent grey-green sea, the frothing whitecaps where they crashed against the rocks, the defiant splash of crimson from a lone fisherman's boat â€“ it was a scene that demanded to be captured, a symphony of colour and movement that echoed the tempestuous spirit within her own soul.
