The flickering neon sign of "The Binary Bean" cast a lurid green glow across Amelia Grace Chen's tired face. Rain lashed against the cafe's panoramic window, blurring the already distorted cityscape of Neo-Kyoto.  It was 3:17 am, the kind of hour where the lines between the physical and the digital world seemed to dissolve, especially when viewed through the grime-streaked glass. Inside, Amelia, clad in a worn coding hoodie and three-day-old jeans, hunched over her laptop, the rhythmic click-clack of the keys a counterpoint to the relentless downpour.  Empty coffee cups formed a defensive perimeter around her, each a testament to another hour wrestled from the jaws of sleep.  Tonight, or rather this morning, Amelia was chasing a ghost in the machine, a rogue algorithm that was wreaking havoc across the city's interconnected network. And she was the only one who could stop it.
