The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note chime as the last customer of the day departed, leaving Amelia Wren Blackwood alone amongst the fragrant chaos of her shop.  Outside, the late October dusk was bleeding into the cobblestone streets of Port Blossom, Maine, casting long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled oaks that lined the harbor. Inside, the warm glow of Edison bulbs illuminated buckets overflowing with dahlias the color of bruised plums, sprays of ghostly white Queen Anneâ€™s lace, and velvety crimson roses that perfumed the air with a heady sweetness. Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate shade of ochre from pollen, sighed contentedly, surveying her domain.  The shop, a converted Victorian carriage house, was a riot of organized clutter.  Copper watering cans hung from wrought iron hooks, vintage botanical prints adorned the peeling plaster walls, and shelves groaned under the weight of ribbon spools, twine, and antique glass vases.  Tonight, however, a faint layer of unease settled over Amelia, a prickle of anticipation that had nothing to do with the approaching Halloween festivities.
