The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ears, tugging at the brim of his worn canvas hat.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he surveyed Mrs. Henderson's sprawling property, a vast canvas of dormant perennials and skeletal trees silhouetted against the steely January sky.  Nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, the Henderson estate, known locally as "Whispering Pines," was a labyrinth of meticulously planned gardens, winding pathways, and a stone fountain that, in warmer months, gurgled a soothing melody. Now, however, the fountain lay silent, encased in a thick sheet of ice, a testament to winter's unforgiving grip on the upstate New York landscape.  Elias pulled his thick wool scarf higher, the icy air stinging his cheeks. This was his first solo job since striking out on his own, and a wave of nervous energy hummed beneath his thick winter coat.  Mrs. Henderson, a notoriously exacting client, had entrusted him with the crucial task of preparing the gardens for the harsh winter ahead â€“ a task that could make or break his fledgling landscaping business.
