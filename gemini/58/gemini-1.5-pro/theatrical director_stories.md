The biting November wind whipped around Vivienne Holloway, snagging at the edges of her already fraying charcoal scarf.  The flickering gaslights of Gaslight Alley cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the cobblestones, turning the narrow passage between the grand Majestic Theatre and the dubious-looking Speakeasy Sally's into a chiaroscuro nightmare. Vivienne shivered, not entirely from the cold.  It was 1928 in New York City, and while the Roaring Twenties roared for some, for Vivienne, the decade echoed with the constant, low hum of anxiety. Tonight, it was a particularly discordant symphony. Opening night of her ambitious, avant-garde production of "The Dreams of Icarus" was just hours away, and the lead actor had just dramaticallyâ€¦ disappeared.
