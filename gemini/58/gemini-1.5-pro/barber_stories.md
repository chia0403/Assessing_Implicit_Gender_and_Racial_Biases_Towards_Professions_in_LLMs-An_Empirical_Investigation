The rusty squeak of the barber chair echoed through the otherwise silent shop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Elias Thorne's shears.  Elias, a man whose salt and pepper beard was as meticulously sculpted as the topiary bushes outside the town hall, surveyed his work in the tarnished mirror. The late afternoon sun, filtering through the grime-streaked window of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour, cast long shadows across the worn checkerboard floor of the small establishment.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating a faded poster advertising "Guaranteed Cure for Baldness â€“ Only 5 Cents!"  Perched precariously on the edge of the basin was a chipped enamel mug that read "World's Best Barber," a gift from a long-gone customer whose name Elias could no longer recall.  The Parlour, nestled between a pawnbroker and a perpetually shuttered bakery on the dusty main street of Dustbowl, Arizona, had seen better days, much like the town itself.  But for Elias, it was home, and the only world he knew.
