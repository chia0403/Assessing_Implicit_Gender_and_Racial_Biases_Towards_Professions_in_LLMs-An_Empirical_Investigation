The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Moreau's parka as she prepped her De Havilland Beaver, the "Arctic Fox," for takeoff.  The small plane, painted a vibrant crimson against the stark white landscape, was her lifeline in this desolate, beautiful corner of the world.  The sun, a pale ghost in the pre-dawn sky, cast long, ethereal shadows across the frozen surface of Lake Iliamna, turning the ice into a kaleidoscope of blues and greys.  Ace adjusted her fur-lined aviator cap, the breath from her nostrils puffing out in white clouds.  This morning's flight was a routine mail and supply run to the remote village of Nondalton, nestled between the lake and the volcanic peaks of the Aleutian Range.  Routine, perhaps, but in Alaska, even routine flights held the potential for adventure, or disaster, depending on the whims of the unforgiving wilderness.  The air crackled with the anticipation of a long, cold day.
