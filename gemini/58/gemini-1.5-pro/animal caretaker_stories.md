The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of the Yorkshire Wildlife Rescue Centre. Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges, but the sun itself remained hidden behind the brooding moors.  Amy’s breath puffed out in white clouds, each one swallowed by the vastness of the valley.  Around her, the sounds of the awakening sanctuary rose in a symphony of grunts, chirps, and rustles. A badger grumbled from its sett, a tawny owl hooted a mournful farewell to the night, and from the distant fox enclosure, a sharp bark echoed through the frosty air.  The Rescue Centre, nestled deep within a sheltered fold of the moors, was Amy's kingdom, a chaotic but beloved realm of injured and orphaned creatures.  Today, however, a different kind of chaos awaited her.  A rumour, carried on the same biting wind that whipped her hair, had reached her of an unusual arrival. An arrival that promised to test even Amy's considerable experience with the wild and the wounded.
