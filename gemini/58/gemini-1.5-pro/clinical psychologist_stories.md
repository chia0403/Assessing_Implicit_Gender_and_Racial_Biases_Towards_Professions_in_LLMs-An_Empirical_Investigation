The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his latest patient. The room, located on the third floor of the stately, ivy-clad Bellingham Psychiatric Clinic overlooking the grey expanse of the Puget Sound, usually projected an air of calm reassurance.  Dark wood paneling, a strategically placed ficus, and shelves filled with weighty tomes on the human psyche all whispered promises of solace and understanding. But tonight, even the crackling fire in the hearth couldn't dispel the palpable tension.  The scent of salt and ozone, carried in on the gusts of wind, mingled with the subtle, medicinal tang of antiseptic that clung to everything within the clinic walls. Elias shifted in his leather chair, the faint squeak a counterpoint to the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner, and waited for the silence to break.  His patient, a young woman with eyes that seemed to hold the vastness of the oncoming storm, finally spoke. Her voice, barely a whisper, was swallowed by the rumble of thunder.  "I… I don’t know where to begin, Doctor."
