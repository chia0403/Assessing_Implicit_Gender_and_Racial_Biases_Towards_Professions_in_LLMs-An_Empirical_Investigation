The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic click-clack of Dr. Evelyn Reed's keyboard. Outside, a late November storm raged, battering the isolated research facility with icy rain. Wind howled like a banshee through the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, rattling the antiquated windows of the Glenmavis Bioresearch Institute. Evelyn, oblivious to the tempest, hunched over her monitor, the glow reflecting in her tired, hazel eyes. Her breath fogged the air in front of her face, a small white cloud momentarily obscuring the complex genetic sequences scrolling past.

She ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun, dislodging a stray strand of fiery red hair. The scent of sterile equipment and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar and oddly comforting aroma that had permeated every corner of her cramped, windowless lab. The walls were plastered with whiteboards, covered in a chaotic jumble of equations, diagrams, and half-formed hypotheses, testaments to months of relentless work. A single, framed photograph, tucked away in the corner, showed Evelyn beaming, holding a small, scruffy terrier. A reminder of a life outside these four walls. For now, though, her world was confined to this room, and to the secrets hidden within the amplified DNA of a rare, indigenous fungi she had painstakingly cultivated.
