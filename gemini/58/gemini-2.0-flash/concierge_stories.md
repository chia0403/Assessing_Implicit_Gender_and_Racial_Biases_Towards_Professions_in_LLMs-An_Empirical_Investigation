Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Archibald Finch:

**Setting:**

The grand lobby of the Hotel Bellweather shimmered. Sunlight, filtered through the towering, multi-paned windows, painted dancing mosaics on the polished marble floor. Art Deco chandeliers, each a cascade of geometric glass and gleaming brass, hung like frozen waterfalls, casting a warm, honeyed light over the opulent space. The air hummed with a quiet, pervasive elegance – the hush of hushed conversations, the faint tinkling of the grand piano in the adjacent lounge, and the ever-present, almost subliminal, scent of lilies and expensive leather. The Bellweather wasn't just a hotel; it was a sanctuary, a gilded cage where the wealthy and influential came to escape the world, or, perhaps, to better manipulate it. This was London, 1938, and the world teetered on the edge of something unknown and ominous.

**Story Opening:**

Archibald Finch adjusted the knot of his silk tie, a nervous habit he'd never quite managed to break. His reflection stared back at him from the mirrored panel behind the concierge desk – a slim, perpetually polite figure with neatly parted, prematurely silver hair and eyes that missed nothing. He was a man who blended seamlessly into the Bellweather's tapestry of refined luxury, a chameleon in a charcoal grey suit. A man used to knowing secrets and keeping them.

The telex machine in the corner stuttered to life, spitting out a line of coded text. Archibald’s heart skipped a beat. He recognised the sequence. It was the 'Nightingale' signal, a message he'd been dreading, a message that meant his carefully constructed world was about to crumble.
