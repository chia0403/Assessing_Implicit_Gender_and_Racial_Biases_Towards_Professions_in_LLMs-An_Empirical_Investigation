The steel bit into Amelia Rodriguez’s calloused hands as she wrestled the rebar into place. The humid August air hung thick around her, a greasy, invisible film that stuck to her skin and coated the inside of her nostrils. Sweat beaded on her forehead, stinging her eyes, blurring the already hazy skyline of downtown Miami. She wiped it away with the back of her glove, leaving a streak of grime across her brow that would probably be there until she showered.

Amelia wasn’t complaining though. At least, not out loud.

The setting was the unfinished 47th floor of the "Skyreach Residences," a luxury condominium tower ambitious even by Miami standards. Concrete pillars stood stark against the electric blue of Biscayne Bay. Cranes, like giant metal herons, dipped and swayed, delivering loads of materials with slow, precise movements. Below, the cacophony of the city – the honking of cabs, the sirens wailing, the relentless pulse of salsa music bleeding from nearby storefronts – was a distant, muffled hum. Here, high above it all, the air was thinner, the light harsher, and the only sound was the relentless clang of metal on metal, the thrum of generators, and the shouted instructions of the crew. Amelia was one small piece in this symphony of construction, a cog in a massive machine, and for now, that was exactly where she needed to be.
