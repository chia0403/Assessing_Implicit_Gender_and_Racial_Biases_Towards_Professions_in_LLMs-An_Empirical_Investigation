## Opening:

The smell of burnt ozone hung thick in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the back of Elias Thorne’s throat. He coughed, pulling his grime-stained bandana higher over his nose. The hum of the faulty transformer he’d been wrestling with had finally, and violently, sputtered into silence, leaving only the oppressive quiet of the abandoned factory and the ringing in his ears.

Elias sighed, the sound heavy with frustration. This was the third time this week he'd been called out to this godforsaken place. The "promise of lucrative salvage rights" was starting to feel a lot less promising and a lot more like a slow, painful electrocution. He ran a gloved hand through his already disheveled salt-and-pepper hair, leaving a streak of grease across his forehead.

“Alright, old girl,” he muttered to the defunct machine, the words barely audible over the wind whistling through the broken windows. “Let’s see what you decided to throw at me this time.” He grabbed his headlamp, the beam cutting through the gloom, and prepared for another dance with death.

## Setting:

The abandoned textile factory, known locally as “The Loom,” dominated the skeletal skyline of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania. Once a thriving hub of industry, Oakhaven had withered and died alongside its mills, leaving behind a decaying carcass of rust, concrete, and shattered dreams.

The Loom stood on the banks of the choked and sluggish Willow Creek, its brick walls stained green with algae and choked with ivy. Broken windows gaped like empty sockets, offering glimpses into the cavernous, dust-choked interior. Inside, rusting machinery – relics of a bygone era – stood frozen in time, shrouded in cobwebs thick as shrouds. Graffiti, a vibrant tapestry of anger and apathy, adorned the walls, a testament to the town’s lost youth and forgotten promises.

The factory floor was littered with debris – shattered glass, splintered wood, and scraps of faded fabric, remnants of the looms that had once clattered day and night. The air hung heavy with the smell of decay – damp concrete, rotting wood, and the ever-present metallic tang of rusting iron. The only sound was the wind, whistling through the broken panes and whispering secrets of the past, a haunting melody that echoed the despair that clung to the very bricks of The Loom.
