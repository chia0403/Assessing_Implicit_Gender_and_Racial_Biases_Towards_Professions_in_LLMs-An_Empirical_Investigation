## Opening:

The rhythmic clatter of the vintage Underwood typewriter was the only sound that could fully silence the cacophony in Amelia Beatrice Thorne's mind. Each tap, each ding of the carriage return, chipped away at the granite block of writer's block that had settled there weeks ago. Outside, the San Francisco fog hung thick and heavy, muffling the city's usual clamor and painting the world in shades of grey. Amelia barely noticed. She was lost in the imagined world flickering behind her closed eyelids, a world desperately seeking a way onto the page.

## Setting:

Amelia's apartment, perched precariously on a steep incline in North Beach, was a sanctuary carved from the vibrant chaos of the neighborhood. Sunlight, when it dared to pierce the fog, filtered through lace curtains, dappling the hardwood floors and illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The room was crammed with evidence of a life devoted to words. Towering bookshelves lined one wall, overflowing with well-worn novels, dog-eared poetry collections, and dog-eared biographies of fellow literary misfits. Piles of manuscript pages, annotated with frantic scribbles and coffee rings, littered the floor surrounding her writing desk, a sturdy oak monstrosity that had once belonged to her grandfather, a newspaperman in Chicago. A half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat precariously close to the edge, threatening to spill its murky contents onto a stack of rejection letters. The scent of ink, old paper, and a hint of lavender (from the sachet tucked between the pages of her favourite copy of "Wuthering Heights") hung perpetually in the air, a comforting aroma that both soothed and tormented her with its promise of untold stories.
