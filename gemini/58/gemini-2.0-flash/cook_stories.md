The aroma of simmering cardamom and star anise hung heavy in the air, a fragrant shield against the biting November chill seeping in through the perpetually cracked window. Inside, the tiny kitchen of "Le Coq Enchanté," a humble bistro tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Bruges, Belgium, was a hive of controlled chaos. Pots clanged, knives thwacked against well-worn wooden cutting boards, and the low hum of jazz radio battled with the sizzle of butter hitting hot cast iron.

Elise Madeleine Dubois, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun and flour dusting her cheeks like a faint snowfall, moved through the cramped space with the practiced grace of a seasoned ballet dancer. She plucked sprigs of thyme from a terracotta pot perched precariously on the windowsill, her brow furrowed in concentration as she considered the balance of flavors in her upcoming "Moules Frites." The lunch rush was only an hour away, and every mussel had to be perfect, every frites crisp and golden, every aioli garlicky and divine. Le Coq Enchanté might be small, but Elise’s reputation, built on years of dedication and a fierce passion for honest, comforting food, demanded nothing less. Today, however, a different kind of pressure simmered alongside the seafood broth, a feeling as unsettling as a poorly shucked oyster lodged in the throat.
