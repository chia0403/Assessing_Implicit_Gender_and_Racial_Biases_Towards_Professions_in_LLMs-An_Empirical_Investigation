## Story Opening:

The clanging of metal on metal echoed in the cavernous crawlspace beneath Mrs. Hawthorne's Victorian mansion. Dust motes danced in the weak beam of Reginald "Reggie" Perkins' headlamp, making him cough and wipe his brow with the back of his grimy hand. The copper pipe, stubbornly corroded, refused to yield to his wrench. A muffled "thump... thump... thump..." emanated from the house above, growing louder each second. Reggie groaned.

He wasn't just a plumber; he was *Reginald Perkins, Master Plumber, Licensed and Bonded*. He prided himself on his skills, his professionalism, and his punctuality. But Mrs. Hawthorne's leaky antique shower fixture was testing all three. He'd been under this house for over an hour, battling rusted connections and a spider population that seemed to thrive on the gloom.

Suddenly, a deafening CRASH reverberated through the floorboards above, followed by a piercing scream. The rhythmic thumping, now frantic, ceased abruptly. Reggie froze, his wrench slipping from his grip and clattering onto the damp earth floor. 

"Right," he muttered, pulling himself to his feet. "Guess plumbing's gonna have to wait. Sounds like I'm about to earn my hazard pay."

## Setting:

**Exterior:** A sprawling, three-story Victorian mansion, painted a faded lavender, sits perched on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood. The house, affectionately (and sometimes derisively) referred to as "Hawthorne House," has seen better days. Peeling paint, overgrown ivy, and a general air of disrepair hint at a neglect born more from eccentricity than outright poverty. A winding, gravel driveway leads to the house from the main road.

**Interior (specifically crawlspace):** A cramped and dusty crawlspace beneath the house, accessible through a small, creaky trapdoor hidden behind a rose bush. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, mildew, and something indefinably antique. The low ceiling forces Reggie to crouch, making movement difficult. Ancient pipes, wrapped in decaying insulation, snake across the floor. Cobwebs cling to everything, and the occasional scurrying sound suggests unseen inhabitants. The only light comes from Reggie's headlamp, which casts long, distorted shadows that dance across the dusty walls.
