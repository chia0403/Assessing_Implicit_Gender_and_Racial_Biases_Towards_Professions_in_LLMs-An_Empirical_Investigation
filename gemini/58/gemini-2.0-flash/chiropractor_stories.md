## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the antiseptic gleam of the examination table. Dr. Eleanor Maeve Thornton sighed, her shoulders aching just thinking about the next patient. It was Thursday, the day her most difficult clients seemed to congregate, drawn to her practice like moths to a particularly irritating, buzzing flame.

She pinched the bridge of her nose, the scent of lavender oil from the diffuser doing little to soothe her fraying nerves. Outside, the rhythmic patter of rain on the window offered a temporary distraction. She watched a bead of water snake its way down the glass, momentarily mesmerized by its solitary journey. It was a good metaphor, she thought wryly, for her own day.

The chime above the door jingled, a sound she usually welcomed with a practiced smile. But tonight, it felt more like a summons to battle. She steeled herself, plastering on a professional smile, and turned to face her next challenge.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Maeve Thornton's chiropractic practice, "Thornton Wellness," was located in a converted Victorian house in the quaint, slightly eccentric town of Havenwood, Maine. The building itself was painted a calming shade of seafoam green with white trim, its front porch adorned with overflowing flower boxes bursting with vibrant petunias and geraniums during the warmer months.

Inside, the waiting room was designed to be a sanctuary of calm, with soft lighting, comfortable armchairs upholstered in muted floral patterns, and shelves lined with books on wellness, holistic health, and self-care. A gurgling fountain featuring smooth, polished stones added to the tranquil ambiance.

Eleanor's examination room, however, was more clinical. While still retaining touches of warmth, like a framed watercolor print of a coastal scene and the aforementioned lavender diffuser, the room primarily featured the necessary equipment: a specialized chiropractic table, charts detailing skeletal structures, and various tools for assessment and treatment. This room was where healing, and sometimes a little bit of pain, occurred. It was Eleanor's domain, and a space where she wielded her knowledge and skill to help alleviate the aches and pains of Havenwood's residents.
