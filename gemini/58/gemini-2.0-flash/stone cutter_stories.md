The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he squinted out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea. He wasnâ€™t looking for ships, nor for the meager bounty of the ocean, but for something far more fundamental: the rhythm of the waves against the cliffs. That rhythm was the heartbeat of his life, the metronome against which he measured every swing of his hammer, every chisel stroke, every grain of stone he coaxed into being.

Elias Thorne, a man whose name echoed the very material he worked, stood perched on a precarious ledge halfway down the sheer face of the Greymaw Cliffs, a formidable bastion of granite that guarded the northern edge of the Isle of Aethelgard. The island itself was a windswept, lonely place, populated mostly by hardy fishermen, stubborn crofters, and the scattering of hermits and eccentrics who sought solace in its harsh beauty.

His workspace was a small, flattened area barely large enough for him and the massive block of granite he was currently wrestling with. Ropes secured him to the cliff face, a simple safeguard against the hungry drop that yawned below. The air hummed with the constant whisper of the wind, punctuated only by the crash of waves against the rocks and the sharp, rhythmic *chink, chink* of his chisel. He wore thick leather gloves, stained with stone dust and oil, and a worn woolen cap pulled low over his brow, shielding his eyes from the glare of the perpetually overcast sky.

The date was creeping towards mid-autumn, and the light, even at midday, was thin and brittle, casting long, dramatic shadows that danced across the rugged landscape. The air held the promise of the coming winter, a bite of frost that warned of long nights and howling gales. This piece, a commission from the wealthy Lord Ashworth, who owned the only truly habitable manor on the island, needed to be finished before the worst of the weather hit. Elias knew Lord Ashworth cared little for deadlines, but Elias cared a great deal for payment, and payment meant food on his table and fuel for his meager fire. And so, he chipped and hammered, coaxing the stone, revealing the shape that lay hidden within, waiting to be freed by the hand of Elias Thorne.
