The midday sun beat down on Harmony, Texas, turning the asphalt of Main Street into a shimmering mirage. Heat waves rose in lazy spirals, blurring the storefronts advertising everything from "Bubba's Bait & Brew" to "Daisy Mae's Hair Haven." A dog, a mangy mutt with one ear perpetually flopped over, panted in the shade beneath the awning of the hardware store, too hot to even bother chasing the flies buzzing lazily around its head.

Inside the air-conditioned sanctuary of the Harmony Police Department, Officer Ezekiel "Zeke" Bartholomew wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, even though the AC was cranked high enough to frost his mustache. He stared at the overflowing inbox on his computer, each email a potential headache disguised as an electronic missive. Stolen lawn gnomes, parking disputes over prime barbeque spots, Mrs. Higgins convinced her cat was being targeted by a neighborhood conspiracy â€“ the usual summertime madness in Harmony. Zeke sighed, the sound echoing in the mostly empty office. Aside from dispatch, a bored-looking teenager named Tiffany chewing gum with the ferocity of a jackhammer, he was alone. And on days like these, with the temperature pushing triple digits and the town drowsing in the heat, it felt like all the trouble in Harmony had a habit of coming his way.
