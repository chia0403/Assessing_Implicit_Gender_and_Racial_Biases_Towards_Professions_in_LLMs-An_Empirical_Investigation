## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and pine hung thick in the air, a familiar and comforting blanket that couldn't quite chase away the chill creeping in from the November wind. Arthur Elias Blackwood squinted, pushing a stray lock of grey-streaked brown hair from his eyes as he wrestled a stubborn piece of oak. He’d been fighting with this particular board for the better part of an hour, and its recalcitrance was beginning to mirror his own mood. Outside, the incessant drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop mimicked the throbbing ache in his knee, a souvenir from a tree-felling accident years ago.

He slammed the oak down onto the workbench with a frustrated sigh. The wood vibrated, sending a small avalanche of shavings onto the already cluttered surface. He was building a cradle, a simple thing, but it felt like the most complicated project he'd ever undertaken. He just couldn't seem to get the curve of the rocker right, couldn't quite capture the gentle promise of peace and rest it was supposed to embody. Maybe, he thought grimly, some things were just beyond his abilities now.

## Setting:

Arthur’s workshop was a haven and a graveyard. It was located at the back of his small, rambling cottage on the edge of the sleepy village of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the Cotswolds. Sunlight, when it dared break through the often-overcast skies, streamed through dusty windows, illuminating motes of wood dust dancing in the air. The walls, lined with shelves overflowing with tools both ancient and modern, told the silent story of Arthur’s life. Chisels gleamed beside well-worn hand planes, marking gauges lay near electric sanders. Carvings, some finished, others just nascent ideas, adorned every surface.

The air was a cocktail of wood scents: pine, oak, cherry, and the faintest hint of beeswax from the furniture polish he occasionally used. Outside, a small, overgrown garden fought for space with stacks of seasoned timber. The quiet murmur of Oakhaven – the distant bleating of sheep, the occasional passing car, the gossip from Mrs. Higgins over the garden fence – provided a constant, comforting backdrop to Arthur’s solitary work. It was a place where Arthur could lose himself in the grain of the wood, a refuge from the world, a place where he could be, simply, Arthur. And lately, Arthur needed that more than ever.
