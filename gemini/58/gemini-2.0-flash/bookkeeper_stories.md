The fluorescent lights of Accounts Receivable flickered, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stacks of invoices threatening to topple from Evelyn Beatrice Finch's desk. It was a Tuesday, which in the grand scheme of things meant it was no better or worse than any other day at Stellar Manufacturing, a mid-sized, family-owned business specializing in industrial-grade widgets. Stellar Manufacturing was located on the outskirts of Millbrook, Pennsylvania, a town that boasted a single movie theater, two diners perpetually stuck in the 1950s, and an alarming number of antique shops. Evelyn, however, rarely saw Millbrook. She was usually too buried beneath spreadsheets and profit margins to venture out during daylight hours.

The perpetual hum of the server room next door was a constant companion, a dull thrum that seemed to vibrate in her bones. Occasionally, Barry from IT would stick his head in and ask if she needed anything, which usually translated to him needing a stapler or a piece of candy from her emergency stash. Evelyn appreciated the gesture, even if it was driven by ulterior motives. Barry was, after all, the only person in the office who acknowledged that she was more than just a walking calculator.

Today, though, even the hum of the server and Barry's potential stapler-seeking missile couldn't distract Evelyn from the nagging feeling that something was…off. A particularly stubborn discrepancy had been plaguing her all morning: a missing $1500 invoice for a shipment of widgets sent to a new client in Pittsburgh, a client named... well, that was the problem. The client seemed to have vanished from the system, along with the invoice itself. And Evelyn Beatrice Finch, keeper of the financial records, was starting to feel a disquiet she hadn’t experienced since the Great Widget Pricing Debacle of '08.
