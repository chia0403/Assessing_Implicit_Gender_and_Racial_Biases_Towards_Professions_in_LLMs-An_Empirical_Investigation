## The Dusted Relic

The gargantuan grandfather clock in the foyer of Blackwood Manor always ticked a little too loudly for Imogen Lily Hawthorne’s liking. Each slow, deliberate *tick-tock* echoed through the cavernous entrance hall, a constant reminder of the passage of time and the sheer volume of dust she had yet to vanquish. It was a battle Imogen fought daily, a losing war against the relentless onslaught of spores and grit that seemed to emanate from the very stones of the ancient estate.

Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, was a creature of grey stone and shadowed corners. Built in the 16th century by a notoriously eccentric pirate, Captain Silas Blackwood, the manor was a haphazard amalgamation of styles – Tudor gables jostled with gothic arches, and a whimsical Victorian conservatory sprouted incongruously from the side like a glass-bellied mushroom. The inside was a labyrinth of echoing corridors, crammed with unsettling portraits, dusty taxidermy, and enough antiquated furniture to furnish a small museum. The salty tang of the sea hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of mothballs and decaying parchment.

Imogen, a woman of forty-two years with a perpetually kind smile etched on her face and hair perpetually escaping its sensible bun, had been head housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past five years. She knew every creaking floorboard, every drafty windowpane, every cobweb-draped gargoyle statuette that guarded the library shelves. She knew the secrets whispered in the rustling tapestries and the ghost stories attached to the abandoned west wing. And, despite the constant battle against the encroaching dust and the unnerving atmosphere, she loved it. Blackwood Manor, with all its quirks and secrets, had become her home.
