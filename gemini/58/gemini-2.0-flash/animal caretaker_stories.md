## The Story Opening:

The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to creep across the sprawling silhouette of the Redwood Peaks Sanctuary, painting the misty firs with a gentle blush. Amelia Grace Thorne, a thermos of lukewarm coffee clutched in her gloved hand, squinted at the brightening sky. A symphony of chirps and rustles, the prelude to another day in the wild, filled the crisp morning air.

Amelia took a long, fortifying sip of her coffee, the faint bitterness doing little to combat the chill that had seeped into her bones. A low rumble, a guttural growl really, pierced through the avian chorus. It was Bear 7, one of the sanctuary’s more challenging residents, letting her know in no uncertain terms that breakfast was late. 

“Alright, alright, you grumpy bear,” Amelia muttered, pushing open the creaking gate to the sanctuary's lower meadow. “Patience is a virtue, even for apex predators.” She adjusted the heavy bag of nuts and berries slung over her shoulder and started towards the enclosure, her heart, as always, filled with a curious blend of affection and cautious respect for the creatures in her care. Today, however, that familiar feeling was tinged with a knot of unease. Something felt… different. The air held a stillness beyond the usual morning calm, a pregnant silence that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.
