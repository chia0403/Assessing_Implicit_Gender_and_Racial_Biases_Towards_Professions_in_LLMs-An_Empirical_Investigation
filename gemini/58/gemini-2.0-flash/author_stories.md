The clatter of rain against the corrugated iron roof was deafening. It sounded less like a gentle shower and more like a horde of angry goblins drumming a war beat on a tin can. Isabella "Izzy" Bellweather shivered, pulling her threadbare wool shawl tighter around her shoulders. She peered out the window of her borrowed shack, the grey light doing little to illuminate the sodden landscape that stretched before her. 

This was her self-imposed exile. A small, forgotten corner of the Scottish Highlands, miles from the bustling literary scene of London, where she'd been lauded and then, rather publicly, lambasted. The shack itself belonged to a distant cousin, a stoic shepherd who'd simply handed her the key, grunted something about needing it aired out, and disappeared back into the mist, leaving Izzy alone with her notebooks, a faulty stove, and the relentless rain.

The setting: a remote glen in the Scottish Highlands, early October. The air was thick with the smell of peat and damp earth. Bleak, heather-covered hills rose on either side of the valley, their peaks perpetually shrouded in mist. The shack, a small, one-room structure, stood precariously on the edge of a sheep pasture, its whitewashed walls peeling, a testament to its age and the harsh climate. Inside, the furniture was sparse â€“ a rickety bed, a wobbly table, a couple of mismatched chairs. The only sources of light were a flickering oil lamp and the occasional crackle of the peat fire in the corner. The place was utterly devoid of charm, and yet, somehow, utterly perfect for Isabella Bellweather to write her next masterpiece, or perhaps, more realistically, to simply survive.
