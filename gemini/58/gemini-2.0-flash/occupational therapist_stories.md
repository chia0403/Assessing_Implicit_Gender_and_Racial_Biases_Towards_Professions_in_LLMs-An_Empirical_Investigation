## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The stale coffee had long lost its meager warmth, and the fluorescent hum of the rehab clinic was doing little to soothe Amelia Grace Thorne's fraying nerves. She traced the rim of her chipped ceramic mug, the faded floral pattern a testament to countless rushed mornings and desperate attempts to fuel the endless cycle of assessments, treatments, and paperwork. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, mirroring the ache in her own chest. Amelia sighed, pulling her cardigan tighter around her. Today, it wasn't the physical challenges she dreaded, the aching backs or the struggling limbs. Today, it was Mrs. Gable, and the silent, invisible wall of grief she couldn't seem to penetrate.

**Setting:**

Amelia Grace Thorne works at "Momentum Rehab & Wellness," a bustling, often chaotic occupational therapy clinic located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. The clinic occupies the ground floor of a repurposed brick building, its large windows offering a panoramic view of the bustling street outside. Inside, the space is divided into several treatment rooms, a spacious gym area filled with adaptive equipment (therapy putty, resistance bands, parallel bars, and a gleaming, chrome-plated hand bike), and a small, cluttered breakroom where Amelia often steals moments of quiet contemplation. The walls are painted a cheerful, albeit slightly faded, shade of robin's egg blue, and are adorned with inspirational posters and patient artwork. Despite the intended cheer, the constant murmur of therapists' instructions, the whirring of equipment, and the occasional frustrated sigh create an atmosphere of determined effort, and a subtle undercurrent of underlying pain.
