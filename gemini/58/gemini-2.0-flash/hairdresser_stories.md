## Story Opening:

The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights was the first thing Amelia Bellweather registered each morning, a sound she both loathed and relied upon. It was the sonic equivalent of a lukewarm shower, jolting her awake and reminding her that another day in the chair was about to begin. Today, however, the hum seemed especially shrill, amplified by the knot of anxiety currently residing in her stomach. Mrs. Gable's appointment was in an hour, and Amelia knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that the woman was going to request the unthinkable: bangs.

## Setting:

The year is 2023, and "Bellweather's Bouffants" is a small, brightly-colored salon nestled in the heart of Maple Creek, a town known for its picturesque landscapes and predictably conservative hairstyles. The salon, owned and operated by Amelia Bellweather, is a haven of retro charm. Think pastel pink walls adorned with vintage hair dryer ads, mismatched floral armchairs arranged around a coffee table piled high with dog-eared magazines, and the scent of lavender and hairspray perpetually hanging in the air. Sunlight streams through the large front window, illuminating rows of meticulously arranged shampoo bottles and the gleaming chrome of the antique barber chairs. It's a cozy, comforting space, reflecting Amelia's own warm personality, a stark contrast to the inner turmoil she often battles. Outside, Maple Creek hums with its own quiet rhythm, a rhythm that Amelia, and Bellweather's Bouffants, have always been a part of. But today, that rhythm felt a little off-key.
