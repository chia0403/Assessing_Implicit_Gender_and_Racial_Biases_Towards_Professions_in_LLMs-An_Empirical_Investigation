The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting perfume for Dr. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne. Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of the observation window, cast a pale, diffused glow on the stainless steel surfaces of Operating Room 3. Evelyn adjusted the strap of her surgical mask, her gaze fixed on the monitor displaying the patient’s vital signs. Outside, Chicago was waking up; a symphony of distant sirens and the rumble of the ‘L’ train provided a faint, almost imperceptible counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping of the EKG machine.

Evelyn was at home here, in this controlled environment. The bustling, chaotic energy of Northwestern Memorial Hospital melted away the moment she stepped through the automatic doors of the surgical wing. Here, it was just her, her team, and the patient, locked in a delicate dance with life and death.

The clock ticked relentlessly forward, each second carrying the weight of her responsibility, the weight of his life resting in her steady hands.
