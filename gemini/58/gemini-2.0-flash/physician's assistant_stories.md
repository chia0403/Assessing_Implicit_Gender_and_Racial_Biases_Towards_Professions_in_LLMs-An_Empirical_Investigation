## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of isopropyl alcohol hung heavy in the air, doing little to mask the underlying anxiety that permeated the small, cramped examination room. Dr. Ramirez was running late again, and patient after patient stacked up on the schedule, their needs growing more urgent by the minute. Evelyn Grace Miller, Physician's Assistant, pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to quell the nascent headache throbbing behind her eyes. She’d already triaged Mrs. Rodriguez’s escalating COPD and attempted to reassure a frantic mother about a feverish toddler. Now, a harried-looking man with a hacking cough and a crumpled tissue clutched in his hand sat before her, radiating a potent combination of fear and exhaustion.

"So, Mr. Davis," Evelyn said, forcing a calm smile, "tell me what's been going on." Her hand hovered over the keyboard, ready to document everything he said. She may be just an assistant, but in Willow Creek, Montana, she was often the first and sometimes the only line of defense between its residents and the vast, unforgiving wilderness that surrounded them. Today, she felt the weight of that responsibility acutely.

## Setting:

The setting is the Willow Creek Family Clinic, a small, single-story building that serves as the primary healthcare provider for the isolated town of Willow Creek, Montana, and the surrounding ranches. The clinic is nestled in a valley, surrounded by towering pines and the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness.

The interior is functional, but worn. The walls are painted a faded, institutional green, and posters about healthy eating and exercise hang slightly askew. The waiting room is sparsely furnished with mismatched chairs and a battered coffee table strewn with dog-eared magazines. The examination rooms are similarly utilitarian, each equipped with an examination table covered in crisp white paper, a metal instrument tray, and a computer station. The air is perpetually dry, a testament to the relentless Montana wind.

Outside, the vastness of the Montana landscape presses in on the small clinic, a constant reminder of the isolation and the unique challenges faced by both the medical staff and the community they serve. In the winter, snow drifts often block the driveway, and in the summer, wildfires can choke the air with smoke, making even breathing a struggle.
