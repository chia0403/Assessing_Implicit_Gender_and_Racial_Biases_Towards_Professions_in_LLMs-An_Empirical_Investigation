Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a doctor:

**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling, if slightly dilapidated, emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. It's late October; the biting wind whipping off the Detroit River seems to have brought with it a fresh wave of flu cases, coupled with the usual Friday night assortment of bar fights and accidental injuries. The air hangs thick with the smell of antiseptic, stale coffee, and a low hum of controlled chaos. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting a sterile glow on the faces of the waiting patients and harried medical staff.

**Story Opening:**

The shrill, insistent ring of the ambulance bay phone cut through the already considerable din of St. Jude's ER. Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Hayes, a woman whose steely gaze and perpetually tired eyes belied a deep well of empathy, barely registered it. She was too focused on inserting an IV into the trembling arm of a young woman, her face pale and clammy, suffering from a suspected overdose. "Easy there, honey," Eleanor murmured, her voice low and soothing. "Just breathe. You're going to be alright."

As she secured the line, a young nurse, fresh out of school and radiating nervous energy, practically bounced to her side. "Dr. Hayes, trauma incoming! Possible GSW to the chest. ETA two minutes."

Eleanor suppressed a sigh. Two minutes wasn't nearly enough. She glanced at the clock on the wall - 11:47 PM. Just another Friday night at St. Jude's, another desperate fight against the relentless tide of human misery washing through its doors. "Alright, let's get ready," she said, her voice firm, the weariness momentarily banished. "Prep a chest tube tray, page Dr. Ramirez, and clear the trauma bay. And someone, please, get me another coffee." She pulled off her gloves, the latex snapping softly, and braced herself. The night, she knew, was far from over.
