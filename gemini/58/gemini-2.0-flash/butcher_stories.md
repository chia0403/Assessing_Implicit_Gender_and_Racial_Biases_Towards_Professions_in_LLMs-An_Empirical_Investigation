## Story Opening:

The biting smell of sawdust and sawdust, clinging to Ezekiel "Zeke" Bartholomew's apron like a second skin, did little to soothe the simmering anger that churned in his gut. The meat grinder, usually a comforting hum in the backdrop of his life, now sounded like a mocking snarl. Another Tuesday. Another delivery of pre-packaged, factory-farmed chicken breasts to compete with. And another day where Mrs. Abernathy, bless her cotton socks, asked if he could "trim off just a *little* more fat, dear," as if he hadn’t been painstakingly trimming fat from ethically-raised livestock for the better part of thirty years.

He slapped a slab of beef tenderloin onto the worn wooden counter, the thud echoing in the near-empty shop. He needed a distraction, something to focus on besides the creeping feeling that his livelihood was slowly being ground into dust, just like the bone fragments he meticulously swept from the floor each evening. Maybe, just maybe, carving this particular piece of meat into something magnificent would quiet the storm raging inside. He reached for his favorite cleaver, the one his grandfather had passed down, its handle worn smooth with generations of Bartholomew butchers…

## Setting:

**Bartholomew & Sons Meats**, nestled on the corner of Elm and Willow in the sleepy, almost-forgotten town of Havenwood, Missouri, was a relic. Its brick façade, weathered by decades of Ozark summers and harsh winters, bore a faded painted sign: "Bartholomew & Sons Meats: Since 1928 - Quality You Can Trust." The interior was a time capsule, from the chipped porcelain tiles on the floor to the brass cash register that still chimed a satisfying "ka-ching" with each sale. Racks of dried sausages and cured hams hung from the ceiling, their aromas mingling with the sharp tang of sawdust and the rich, metallic scent of fresh meat. A large, antique scale, proudly displaying its weight in pounds and ounces, stood sentinel near the counter. The walls were adorned with faded photographs of generations of Bartholomews in bloodied aprons, wielding knives and cleavers with an air of quiet pride. Havenwood itself, a town slowly succumbing to the creeping influence of chain stores and fast-food restaurants, seemed to hold its breath, hoping that Bartholomew & Sons Meats would somehow weather the storm and keep a piece of the old world alive.
