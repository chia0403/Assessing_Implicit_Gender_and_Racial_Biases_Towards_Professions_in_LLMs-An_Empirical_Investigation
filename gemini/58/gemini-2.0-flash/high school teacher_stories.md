The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Agatha Penelope Finch's worn leather heels echoed through the otherwise silent halls of Northwood High. It was 6:15 AM, a time most reasonable humans were still snuggled beneath their duvets, dreaming of waffles and warm socks. But Agatha, a woman whose life motto was "early bird gets the superior seating chart," was already unlocking her classroom, room 212, the sanctum of AP English Literature.

The setting was Northwood High, a brick behemoth that loomed over the sleepy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Built in the 1950s, it possessed a certain faded grandeur. The wide corridors, once gleaming, now bore the scuff marks of generations of teenage angst. Lockers, perpetually adorned with stickers proclaiming allegiance to various bands, sports teams, and vaguely rebellious causes, lined the walls like metallic stalactites. Sunlight, hesitant and weak at this hour, filtered through the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The air itself held the distinct aroma of old textbooks, floor wax, and the lingering ghost of last week's mystery meat cafeteria special.
