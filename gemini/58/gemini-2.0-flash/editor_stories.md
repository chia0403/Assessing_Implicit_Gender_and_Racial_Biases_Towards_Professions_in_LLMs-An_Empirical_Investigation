The flickering neon sign outside read "Eddie's All-Night Diner," but tonight, it felt more like Eddie's All-Night Confessional. Clara Beatrice Ainsworth nursed her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a familiar companion at this ungodly hour. Her glasses, perched precariously on her nose, magnified the dark circles under her eyes. The diner, a greasy spoon institution clinging to the edge of downtown Chicago, smelled perpetually of stale grease, burnt toast, and desperation. Red vinyl booths lined the walls, some ripped and patched with duct tape, others sticky with forgotten spills. A lone trucker, his face etched with the miles heâ€™d travelled, sat slumped over a plate of suspiciously orange eggs.

Clara, normally surrounded by the sterile hum of her publishing house, found a perverse comfort in the diner's grimy authenticity. It was a world away from the manicured prose and meticulously crafted narratives she dealt with all day. Tonight, though, she felt as broken and frayed as the diner's decor, the glow of her laptop screen painting a lonely rectangle of light in the dimness. Tonight, a deadline loomed like a monstrous, inky kraken, and Clara Beatrice Ainsworth, Senior Editor at Blackwood & Sterling Publishing, was losing the battle.
