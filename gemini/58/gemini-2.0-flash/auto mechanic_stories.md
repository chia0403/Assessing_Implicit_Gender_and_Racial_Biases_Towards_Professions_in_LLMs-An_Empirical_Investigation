Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a main character who's an auto mechanic:

**Opening:**

The air in Grease Monkey Garage hung thick and heavy, a fragrant stew of WD-40, stale coffee, and the low growl of Loretta's ancient engine. Sweat beaded on Beatrice "Bea" Kowalski's brow, tracing lines in the grime that clung to her skin like a second layer.  Loretta, a beat-up 1967 Mustang, was proving to be even more stubborn than usual.  Bea had been wrestling with her distributor cap for the better part of an hour, and the darn thing was still refusing to budge.

"Come on, you piece of junk," Bea muttered under her breath, twisting the wrench with a grunt.  "I've got a reputation to uphold.  And a line of angry customers stretching around the block."

A sudden bang from the back of the garage made her jump, nearly sending her wrench skittering across the oily concrete floor.  Bea straightened up, wiping her hands on a tattered rag.  "Danny!  What in the Sam Hill was that?"

**Setting:**

The setting is Grease Monkey Garage, located in the small, somewhat forgotten town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  Harmony Creek used to be a thriving mining town, but those days were long gone, leaving behind a population struggling to stay afloat.

*   **The Garage:**  Grease Monkey Garage is a ramshackle building, a testament to years of patching and repairs.  The exterior is faded green paint peeling off weathered wood. A rusty, hand-painted sign swings precariously above the entrance. Inside, the floor is stained with oil and grease, and tools hang haphazardly on pegboards. There are two bays, one currently occupied by Loretta and the other housing a '57 Chevy undergoing a complete restoration. A cramped office in the corner serves as a waiting area, adorned with vintage calendars featuring classic cars and a battered, overflowing ashtray.

*   **Harmony Creek:** The town itself is a quiet place.  The main street consists of a few locally owned businesses: a diner, a general store, and a post office. Everyone knows everyone else's business, and gossip spreads like wildfire.  The surrounding landscape is a mix of rolling hills, dense forests, and winding mountain roads.  It's a place where people rely on each other, and where a good mechanic is worth their weight in gold.
