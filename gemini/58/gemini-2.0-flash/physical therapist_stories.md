**Story Opening:**

The smell of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Evelyn Amelia Reed. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, melancholic shadows across the manicured lawns of Meadowbrook Assisted Living, painting the scene in hues of amber and sepia. Inside, Evelyn braced herself for her last appointment of the day: Mrs. Beatrice Ainsworth. Beatrice, with her paper-thin skin and stubborn refusal to use her walker, was Evelyn’s most challenging patient, and today, she was particularly uncooperative.

“Dr. Reed, is that you lurking about like a gargoyle?” Beatrice’s voice, a reedy tremor amplified by the silence of the room, sliced through the quiet. Evelyn sighed internally. Gargoyle indeed. She adjusted her glasses and plastered on her most encouraging smile.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is **Meadowbrook Assisted Living**, a privately owned facility located in the affluent suburb of Oak Haven, Pennsylvania. The building itself is a sprawling, single-story structure built in the Tudor Revival style, with exposed brick and decorative timbering. Inside, the decor is meant to be comforting and homey, but often feels sterile and impersonal. Think floral wallpaper, plush armchairs arranged in conversational groupings, and framed prints of landscapes that are suspiciously lacking in vibrancy. The facility boasts meticulously maintained gardens, walking paths, and a small, underutilized greenhouse. Evelyn spends most of her time in the physiotherapy room, a brightly lit, functional space crammed with equipment: parallel bars, resistance bands, weights, and a treatment table. The atmosphere is generally quiet and uneventful, punctuated by the occasional cough, the shuffle of feet, and the clatter of dishes from the nearby dining hall. Outside of Meadowbrook, Evelyn occasionally travels to patients' private residences, offering in-home therapy services in a variety of settings, from cozy apartments to sprawling estates.
