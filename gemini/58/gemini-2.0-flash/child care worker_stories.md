## Story Opening:

The scent of stale Cheerios and disinfectant hung thick in the air of the Sunflower Room, a potent cocktail that always tickled Amelia Rose Davies’ nose. She sighed, pushing a stray lock of strawberry blonde hair behind her ear with the back of a crayon-stained hand. The quiet hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to amplify the leftover chaos from the afternoon's dinosaur-themed free play: a half-finished crayon drawing of a particularly ferocious T-Rex lay crumpled on the floor, a herd of plastic stegosauruses were scattered haphazardly across the climbing frame, and a single, forlorn block of Duplo lay abandoned near the pretend kitchen.

Amelia, at 24, was already intimately acquainted with the landscape of controlled pandemonium. She’d been working at "Little Sprouts Daycare" for three years, and while the noise levels often threatened to shatter her eardrums and the sticky fingers were a constant occupational hazard, she wouldn't trade it for the world. Most days, anyway. Today, the lingering quiet felt more unsettling than the usual raucous energy. It was the calm before the storm, the pregnant pause before parents descended like hungry vultures, ready to pluck their little darlings from her carefully constructed world of glitter and glue. And Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, that tonight's storm was likely to be a particularly nasty one.
