**Setting:** The late afternoon sun beat down with merciless indifference on the slate roof of St. Jude's Church in the small, forgotten town of Havenwood, Ohio. Years of neglect had mottled the once uniform gray with patches of green moss and lichen. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling faintly of dust, bird droppings, and the sweet rot of decaying wood. From his precarious perch, you could see the whole of Havenwood: the faded clapboard houses huddled together like sheep against the wind, the rusting skeleton of the abandoned steel mill on the outskirts, and the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, shimmering in the heat.

**Opening:** Ezekiel "Zeke" Tiberius Blackwood wiped a sheen of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. He squinted at the setting sun, a fiery orb threatening to engulf the entire landscape. "Just another hour," he muttered to himself, his voice rough from years of breathing in dust and weathered by the harsh realities of his profession. He shifted his weight, feeling the familiar discomfort of his safety harness biting into his shoulders. Ezekiel was a roofer, a craftsman, a caretaker of forgotten structures. And today, St. Jude's, with its crumbling facade and leaky roof, felt more forgotten than most. He reached for another slate tile, chipped and cracked, a symbol of the town's own slow decline. Replacing these tiles wasn't just about keeping the rain out; it was about holding onto something precious, something that Havenwood seemed determined to let go. He hammered the new tile into place, the rhythmic clang echoing across the deserted town square, a lonely counterpoint to the silence that had become Havenwood's signature tune. But today, that silence felt different, heavier, imbued with a subtle unease that prickled the hairs on the back of Zeke's neck. He couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone on that roof, even though he knew, logically, that he was. Something was wrong.
