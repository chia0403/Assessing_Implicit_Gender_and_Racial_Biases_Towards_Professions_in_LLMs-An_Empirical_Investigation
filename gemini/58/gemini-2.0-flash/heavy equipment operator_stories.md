The biting wind whipped around Edgar Bartholomew Finch's face, tugging at the edges of his thick, woollen hat. He spat a stream of amber tobacco juice into the snowdrift, the sizzling sound barely audible over the drone of the Komatsu D375A-5 bulldozer. Edgar Bartholomew Finch, all six-foot-four and two hundred and eighty pounds of him, was a man built for this: the brutal, unforgiving landscape of the Yukon Territory.

His setting was the Klondike Highway, roughly sixty kilometers north of Dawson City. The year was 1978. He wasn’t paving it, exactly. He was, as he wryly thought of it, *un*paving it. A massive landslide, triggered by an unusually warm spring, had obliterated a section of the highway, leaving behind a chaotic mountain of mud, rock, and splintered trees. Edgar’s job, and that of the rest of his crew at "Northern Grit Construction," was to carve a new path through the mess, a feat of sheer stubbornness against the forces of nature.

The sun, a weak and watery disc behind the perpetually overcast sky, barely offered any warmth. The air smelled of damp earth and pine needles, tinged with the metallic scent of diesel fuel. His fingers, despite the thick gloves, were already starting to stiffen, but Edgar Bartholomew Finch wouldn't complain. This was his domain, his livelihood. He'd faced down worse, and he'd wrestle this mountain back into submission, one roaring scoop at a time. Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of his neck, a sense of unease he couldn't quite shake. Something was wrong. And out here, wrong usually meant dangerous.
