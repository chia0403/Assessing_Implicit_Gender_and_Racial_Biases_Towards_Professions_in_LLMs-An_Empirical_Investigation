## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The stale air hung thick with the scent of lemon-scented cleaner and impending doom. Harold Bartholomew Finch, his tie already loosened and his collar beginning to chafe, stared at the file in front of him with a weary resignation. "The Widow Higgins," the tab read in a stark, unforgiving font. He'd been dreading this one all morning. Two weeks after her husband, Edgar, had plummeted to his death from the lighthouse – a lighthouse, Harold reminded himself with a grimace, that *Edgar himself had built* – Mrs. Higgins was finally ready to discuss the life insurance policy. He took a deep breath, the scent of lemon cleaner doing little to soothe his fraying nerves, and knocked.

**Setting:**

The setting is the sleepy, fog-shrouded town of Port Blossom, Maine. It's a picturesque place, postcards practically selling themselves with its rocky coastline, colorful fishing boats bobbing in the harbor, and quaint clapboard houses clinging to the cliffs. Harold's office, "Finch & Sons Insurance," (the "Sons" were figurative, as Harold's two offspring were firmly entrenched in San Francisco's tech scene and had no desire to return to Port Blossom's slow pace) is a modest space above the local bakery. The building, like most in town, is weathered by the constant sea spray, giving it a certain melancholic charm. Inside, the office is cluttered but organized. Files overflow from shelves, maps of the local coastline are pinned to the wall dotted with potential accident zones, and a vintage adding machine sits proudly on his desk, a testament to Harold's resistance to fully embracing the digital age. The perpetual smell of freshly baked bread wafts from downstairs, a constant, almost comforting, presence in the otherwise often stressful world of insurance claims.
