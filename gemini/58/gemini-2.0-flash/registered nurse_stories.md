## Story Opening:

The scent of antiseptic was a familiar comfort to Clara Amelia Davies, a sterile blanket against the creeping unease that had been plaguing her for days. Steam billowed from the Styrofoam cup in her hand, warming her fingers as she stared out the rain-streaked window of the nursing station. Another storm, just what she needed. The sky outside St. Jude's Hospital was a bruised purple, mirroring the exhaustion that had settled deep beneath her skin. It was a Thursday night, the halfway point of her week of grueling twelve-hour shifts in the Emergency Department, and the air hung heavy with the unspoken tension that always preceded a chaotic rush.

## Setting:

**St. Jude's Hospital** sits in the heart of the grimy but slowly gentrifying neighborhood of Iron Ridge, a bustling district in a large, Northeastern American city. The hospital itself is a sprawling, brick-and-glass behemoth, a testament to modern medicine's relentless march forward. However, the aging infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the constant influx of patients. The Emergency Department is a cacophony of beeping monitors, hurried footsteps, and shouted orders. Fluorescent lights hum relentlessly, casting a stark, unforgiving glow on the chipped linoleum floor and the weary faces of the medical staff. The waiting room, perpetually overflowing with the sick, injured, and desperate, is a breeding ground for anxieties that seep into the already tense atmosphere. The faint, underlying smell of bodily fluids and despair is a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the relentless pressure Clara faces every shift.
