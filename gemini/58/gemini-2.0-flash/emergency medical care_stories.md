## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, carrying the scent of diesel and impending snow. Amelia Grace "Amy" Callahan shivered, pulling her worn EMS jacket tighter around her. The flashing lights of Rescue 18 painted the already grim scene in pulsating strokes of red and blue – a twisted mess of metal that was once a sedan, its driver pinned inside.

"Dispatch, Rescue 18 on scene," Amy’s voice, usually so steady, crackled with a nervous energy as she spoke into her radio. "Single vehicle accident, confirmed patient trapped, unknown vitals. Requesting fire for extrication."

The adrenaline was already pumping, the familiar cocktail of fear and focus that came with every call. This one felt different, though. The silence hanging in the air, broken only by the wind and the distant wail of approaching sirens, was heavier than usual. It felt... wrong.

## Setting:

The setting is a rural stretch of Highway 39, just outside the small, struggling town of Havenwood, Wisconsin. It's late November, nearing dusk. The sky is a bruised purple, threatening snow. The landscape is bleak; harvested fields stretching into the distance, dotted with bare, skeletal trees. The road itself is narrow and winding, notorious for black ice in the winter months. Havenwood is a town that has seen better days, its economy gutted by the closing of the local lumber mill a decade ago. The residents are hardy, used to hardship and relying on each other. The nearest major hospital is over an hour away, making emergency services even more crucial. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and quiet desperation, a place where tragedy can strike swiftly and unexpectedly.
