## Story Opening:

The biting wind clawed at the tattered canvas tarp strapped across Jedediah "Jed" Benjamin Thompson's flatbed, a relentless assault that mirrored the gnawing anxiety in his gut. He tightened his grip on the steering wheel, the worn leather smooth and familiar beneath his calloused fingers. The snow, a swirling, blinding white maelstrom, had been falling for hours, turning I-80 into a treacherous, shimmering ribbon. He squinted, the wipers groaning a mechanical lament as they struggled to clear the accumulating ice. Ahead, barely visible through the swirling flakes, loomed the ghostly silhouette of a semi, taillights barely glowing, crawling along at a snail's pace. Jed let out a long, weary sigh that fogged the cab window. This was it, the kind of weather that made even the most seasoned drivers pray for a safe haven. He just hoped his prayer would be answered before the mountain got its say.

## Setting:

The story unfolds during a brutal blizzard in the desolate, high-altitude reaches of the Wyoming Rockies. The season is late November, just before Thanksgiving, adding a layer of urgency to Jed's delivery schedule. He's driving a beat-up, but meticulously maintained, 1987 Peterbilt 379, nicknamed "The Widowmaker" (a darkly ironic nickname given its tendency to break down in the most inconvenient locations, not actually due to causing accidents). The cab is cramped, filled with the aroma of stale coffee, worn leather, and the faint lingering scent of his late wife's perfume. Emergency supplies, including a tattered sleeping bag, a propane heater, and a well-stocked cooler, are crammed behind the seats. Outside, the landscape is a monochrome canvas of white, punctuated only by the occasional skeletal branches of pine trees struggling against the relentless wind and snow. The radio crackles intermittently, broadcasting weather warnings and the occasional garbled plea for help, adding to the overall sense of isolation and impending danger. The air is frigid, biting through even the thickest layers of clothing, promising a long and perilous night ahead.
