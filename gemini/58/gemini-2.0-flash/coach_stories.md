## Story Opening:

The biting wind off Lake Michigan howled like a scorned lover, rattling the corrugated metal walls of the Evanston High School gymnasium. Coach Evelyn "Ev" Anya Petrova, her breath misting in the frigid air, pulled her threadbare Blackhawks parka tighter. It was 5:45 AM, the kind of pre-dawn chill that seeped into your bones and clung there, refusing to be shaken off.  The gym was cavernous and silent, except for the rhythmic squeak of Ev's old basketball shoes on the polished wood floor as she dribbled. One, two, three… *thud*. She missed. Cursing under her breath, a string of rapid-fire Russian obscenities she’d learned from her grandfather, Ev bent to retrieve the errant ball. This wasn't how she'd envisioned her Tuesday mornings.  This wasn’t how she'd envisioned anything.

## Setting:

**Evanston, Illinois, November.** The setting is specifically Evanston High School's gymnasium, an aging but well-maintained structure. Outside, Lake Michigan is a turbulent, grey expanse under a bruised November sky. The gym itself is a typical high school gym: high ceilings, faded blue and gold bleachers that can accommodate hundreds, a scoreboard that occasionally flickers, and the lingering scent of sweat and disappointment.  Evanston, a suburb north of Chicago, is a mix of affluent lakefront homes and more modest, working-class neighborhoods, creating a tension that often mirrors the dynamics within the high school. The crisp, cold air and the impending winter are a constant presence, influencing mood and highlighting the struggle against the elements.
