The stale scent of yesterday's rain and cheap whiskey clung to the air in the office of Silas Blackwood, Private Investigations. Moonlight bled through the grimy window, painting dust motes dancing in the gloom. Silas himself, a hulking silhouette slumped behind a scarred oak desk, looked about as welcoming as a tax audit. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock Silas had inherited from his grandfather, a cop on the force back in the good ol’ days when a bribe was a handshake and a murder was a crime of passion, not corporate convenience.

The setting was the third floor of a pre-war building on Bleaker Street in the Lower East Side. Bleaker Street, living up to its name, was a symphony of shadows and broken promises. The neighborhood had seen better days, and so had Silas. His office reflected that – a chaotic blend of overflowing ashtrays, stacks of unsolved case files threatening to topple, and a single, wilting ficus plant stubbornly clinging to life in a chipped terracotta pot. It wasn’t much, but it was home. And tonight, it was about to get interesting. The phone, a rotary dial relic from a bygone era, buzzed impatiently, shattering the melancholic silence.
