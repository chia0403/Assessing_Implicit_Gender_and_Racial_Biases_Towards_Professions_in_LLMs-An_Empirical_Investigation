Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a main character who is a school psychologist:

**Setting:** Maple Creek Elementary, a brick-and-mortar school in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying small town nestled in the Appalachian foothills of North Carolina. The walls inside are painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, yellow, and the air perpetually smells of crayons, floor wax, and slightly overcooked cafeteria chili. The calendar in the main office is perpetually behind by at least two weeks.

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of sneakers on linoleum echoed in the otherwise silent hallway. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth rubbed the sleep from her eyes, the taste of stale coffee already bitter on her tongue. It was 6:47 AM, and she was the first one in the building, as usual. The pre-dawn quiet was a fleeting luxury she savored before the storm of anxieties, behavioral outbursts, and whispered confessions that constituted a typical Tuesday at Maple Creek Elementary. Ellie unlocked her office, the faint smell of lavender oil emanating from within â€“ her valiant, and often futile, attempt to counteract the chaos. She flipped on the desk lamp, the warm glow illuminating the carefully arranged collection of fidget toys, the framed diplomas, and the overflowing in-tray that threatened to topple over at any moment. Today, however, was going to be different, she resolved with a sigh as she sank into her ergonomic chair. Today, she was going to *finally* get a handle on the escalating situation surrounding young Billy Peterson. A shiver of unease prickled her skin. There was something about Billy that tugged at her, a subtle discordance that went beyond the usual disruptions. She just couldn't quite put her finger on it.
