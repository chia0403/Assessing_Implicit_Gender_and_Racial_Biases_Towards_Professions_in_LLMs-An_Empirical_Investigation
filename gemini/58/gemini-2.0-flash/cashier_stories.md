The hum of the fluorescent lights was a constant companion to Beatrice Eleanor Higgins. It pulsed in time with the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner as she swiped another can of peaches across the glass, the price flashing up on the register display: $1.29. Beatrice didn't even have to look; she knew the prices of half the items in the Sunnydale Grocery by heart. Years of scanning them at checkout lane number five had etched them into her memory like grooves in a worn vinyl record.

The Sunnydale Grocery wasnâ€™t just any grocery store. It was *the* grocery store in Sunnydale, a small, quiet town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. Picture postcard perfect, if postcards included rows of slightly dented cans of generic beans and a lingering scent of overripe bananas. Outside, the late afternoon sun was painting long shadows across the parking lot, a sign that the dinner rush would be starting soon. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting smell of baking bread from the in-store bakery, mixed with the less appealing aroma of industrial-strength cleaner from aisle four. Beatrice sighed, pushed a stray strand of grey-streaked brown hair behind her ear, and braced herself for another onslaught of coupons, forgotten reusable bags, and the endless, existential dread of being a cashier on a Tuesday.
