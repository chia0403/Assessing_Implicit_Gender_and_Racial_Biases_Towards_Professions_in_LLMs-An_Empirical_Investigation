The sterilizer hummed a low, insistent song, a soundtrack to the drudgery of after-hours cleaning. Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, D.D.S., sighed, wiping down the gleaming surfaces of her operatory with a disinfectant wipe. Outside, the late-October wind howled a mournful tune against the windows of "Ainsworth Dental: A Reason to Smile," tucked between Mrs. Higgins' Knit 'n' Nibble and Bob's Bait & Tackle in the heart of the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine.

Eleanor, a woman whose own smile was as bright and well-maintained as any of her patients', found herself frowning tonight. The last patient of the day, Mrs. Periwinkle, had rattled on, as she always did, about the strange occurrences down at the old lighthouse – whispers, shadows, and a chilling breeze that seemed to cut right through the bone. Eleanor usually dismissed Mrs. Periwinkle's pronouncements as the ramblings of an eccentric widow, but tonight, a small, unsettling seed had been planted. Port Blossom, usually so predictable, felt different. There was a tension in the air, thicker than the salty fog rolling in off the bay, and it had nothing to do with tooth decay. The sterilizer pinged, signaling its readiness, but Eleanor remained, perched on her stool, a strange unease settling in her chest. Port Blossom wasn’t known for its mysteries. It was known for its blueberry pie, its lobster rolls, and the annual clam bake. But tonight, as the wind howled louder and the shadows deepened, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth had a feeling that something very unusual was about to happen.
