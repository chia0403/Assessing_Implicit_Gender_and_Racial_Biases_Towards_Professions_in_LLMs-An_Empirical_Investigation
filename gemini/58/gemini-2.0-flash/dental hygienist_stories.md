The biting scent of spearmint mouthwash hung thick in the air, mingling with the ever-present undercurrent of antiseptic. For a moment, it almost masked the metallic tang of fear that clung to the corner of Amelia Grace Davies' own tongue. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the frosted windows of "Gleaming Smiles Dental, LLC," nestled in the heart of quaint, but perpetually damp, Port Blossom, Oregon.

Amelia straightened her navy blue scrubs, adjusted the slightly-too-tight elastic band of her surgical mask, and took a deep breath. Three years she’d been a dental hygienist, three years of coaxing nervous patients through fluoride treatments and root planing. Three years, and she still got a little twitch of anxiety before each new appointment, a tiny flutter in her stomach that mirrored the hummingbird-like thrum of the high-speed scaler she was about to wield.

Her next patient, according to the schedule, was Mr. Silas Hawthorne. A new client, no notes beyond a cryptic “recent extraction site sensitive.” Sensitive. That could mean anything from a mild ouch to a full-blown panic attack in the chair.

Amelia smoothed down her hair, tucked a stray strand behind her ear, and pasted on her most reassuring smile. Time to face the music, and hopefully, prevent a cavity or two.
