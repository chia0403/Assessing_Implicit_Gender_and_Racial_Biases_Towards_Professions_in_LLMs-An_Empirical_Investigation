The setting was Dustbowl County, Oklahoma, 1937. A landscape sculpted by hardship and wind, where skeletal trees clawed at the relentless, orange sky. The soil, once fertile, was now a fine, suffocating powder that invaded every crack and crevice, coating everything in a perpetual film of despair. The sun beat down with merciless indifference, baking the land and the hopes of those who dared to cling to it.

**Ezekiel Silas Blackwood** stood on his porch, the warped and splintered wood groaning beneath his weight. He squinted, his eyes already etched with the deep lines of a life spent battling the elements, searching for any sign of life amidst the swirling dust devils. His calloused hands, rough as bark, gripped the railing, knuckles white. He smelled not rain, nor the rich earth he yearned for, but only the acrid tang of dust and the faint, metallic scent of a hope slowly bleeding out. Today was no different than yesterday, and he feared tomorrow would be even worse.
