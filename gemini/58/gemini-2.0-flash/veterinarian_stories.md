## Story Opening:

The acrid smell of disinfectant clung to Dr. Evelyn Maeve Carter's clothes, a constant reminder of her profession, even as she stood on the windswept clifftop. Below, the churning turquoise of the Atlantic crashed against the craggy Cornish coast, a wild, untamed beauty that both soothed and mirrored the turmoil within her. She tightened her grip on the worn leather strap of her binoculars, lifting them to her eyes. She wasn't looking at the dramatic coastline, though. Her gaze was fixed on a small, isolated cove nestled amongst the rocks, a cove where a distress call had pulled her away from a much-needed cup of tea and a roaring fire. This wasn't a typical vet call, not for a farm animal or a domestic pet. This was different. This was the reason she'd traded the bustling city of London for the rugged solitude of Port Isaac, a haven for seabirds and, more importantly, for seals in need.

## Setting:

The story is set in the charming, albeit windswept, village of **Port Isaac, Cornwall, England**. The year is present-day.

**Key aspects of the setting:**

*   **Coastal Landscape:** Dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, and the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean dominate the landscape. The weather is often unpredictable, ranging from sunshine to torrential rain in a single day.
*   **Traditional Village:** Port Isaac is a small, picturesque fishing village with narrow, winding streets, whitewashed cottages, and a strong sense of community.
*   **Veterinary Practice:** Dr. Carter's practice, "Carter's Coastal Veterinary Clinic," is a converted stone barn located just outside the village. It caters to both farm animals and domestic pets, but Evelyn has a particular passion for marine wildlife, especially seals.
*   **Seal Sanctuary (Sub-plot):** A struggling but dedicated seal sanctuary lies a few miles down the coast, playing a vital role in the story.

This setting allows for a blend of cozy village life, dramatic natural beauty, and the inherent dangers and challenges of working with marine animals.
