## Story Opening:

The brass cage groaned a familiar protest as Marcus Aurelius Thorne, bellhop extraordinaire, wrestled with it. He wrestled with it daily, this ancient Otis elevator, and more often than not, it wrestled back. Today, it felt particularly obstinate, the gears grinding like disgruntled teeth as he coaxed it towards the opulent penthouse suite on the thirtieth floor. He straightened his crisp, if slightly worn, uniform – a symphony in burgundy and gold – and adjusted the stack of monogrammed Louis Vuitton luggage precariously balanced on the hand truck. Sweat beaded on his brow, a constant companion in the stifling August humidity that clung to New York City like a lovesick lover. He wasn't just fighting the elevator; he was fighting the relentless, glamorous façade of the Hotel Majestic, a place where dreams were bought and sold, and Marcus Aurelius Thorne was just another cog in the machine, ringing the bell instead of dictating the tune.

## Setting:

**The Hotel Majestic, New York City, August 2024.**

The Hotel Majestic, a towering edifice of Art Deco grandeur, dominated a prime stretch of Park Avenue. Inside, marble floors gleamed under the soft glow of chandeliers, reflecting the hushed whispers of power and privilege. The lobby buzzed with a carefully orchestrated symphony of activity: impeccably dressed guests arriving in chauffeured cars, impeccably polite staff gliding through the crowds, and the almost palpable scent of money and ambition hanging in the air. Palm trees swayed gently in ornate planters, providing a tropical counterpoint to the city's relentless energy outside. Every detail, from the fresh-cut orchids on the reception desk to the perfectly aligned velvet ropes, was designed to reinforce the hotel's reputation as a sanctuary of luxury and discretion. But behind the glittering facade, in the dimly lit service corridors and cramped staff rooms, a different story unfolded – one of relentless labor, quiet observation, and the occasional stolen glimpse of a world forever out of reach. The contrast was stark, and Marcus Aurelius Thorne, perpetually straddling both worlds, knew it all too well.
