## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "A Close Shave" jingled a weary, almost melancholic, tune as a gust of November wind bullied its way inside. Albert "Al" Finnegan, proprietor and sole barber of said establishment, barely registered it. He was far too engrossed in the task at hand: coaxing a stubborn glob of shaving cream into a lather the consistency of whipped meringue. The old badger brush, worn smooth with years of service, swirled in the chipped ceramic mug with practiced ease. Al inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of sandalwood and bay rum a balm to his weary soul. Today felt like it was going to be a long one.

## Setting:

**A Close Shave** occupied a modest storefront on Elm Street in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Ohio. The year was 1962, and the town, like Al, was beginning to show its age. The once-vibrant Main Street now sported more empty windows than thriving businesses, a testament to the allure of the sprawling suburbs slowly encroaching on Oakhaven's borders. Inside the shop, the decor was unapologetically classic. A single, well-worn barber chair, its leather cracked and softened with time, dominated the space. A long, mirrored wall amplified the room, reflecting the framed black-and-white photos that lined it â€“ snapshots of Oakhaven's past, of graduating classes and victorious football teams, of families posing stiffly in their Sunday best. A chipped porcelain sink sat in the corner, beside a stack of neatly folded, pristine white towels. The air was thick with the aroma of aftershave and pipe tobacco, a comforting, familiar scent that clung to the very walls. A vintage Philco radio, perched precariously on a shelf above Al's head, hummed with the gentle static of the morning news. Outside, the grey skies threatened rain, and the wind rustled through the bare branches of the elm trees that gave the street its name.
