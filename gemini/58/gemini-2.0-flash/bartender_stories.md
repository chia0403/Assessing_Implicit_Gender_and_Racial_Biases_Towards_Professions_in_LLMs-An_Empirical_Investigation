## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The dim, smoky interior of "The Serpent's Kiss," a dive bar nestled in the grimy underbelly of New Orleans' French Quarter. Rain lashed against the warped, green-painted windowpanes, a rhythmic counterpoint to the mournful wail of a blues harmonica drifting from the jukebox. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and something indefinably, unsettlingly *else* - a hint of swamp mud and decaying flowers that clung to the old building like a stubborn memory.

**Opening:**

The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked street. Inside, **Evangeline "Eva" Moreau** polished a shot glass with a practiced flick of her wrist, her dark eyes reflecting the muted light. A half-smoked cigarette smoldered in an ashtray near the taps, a testament to the long, slow night ahead. The blues harmonica whined a mournful tune about lost love and bad decisions, a soundtrack that perfectly mirrored the clientele that frequented The Serpent's Kiss. Eva knew every face, every story etched in the lines around their eyes. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease crawled beneath her skin, a whisper of something ancient and restless stirring in the humid air. She glanced at the ancient, gnarled wooden mask hanging above the bar, its painted eyes seeming to follow her every move. It was just the weather, she told herself, just another slow, wet night in New Orleans. But the mask kept watching, and Eva couldn't shake the feeling that something wicked was brewing.
