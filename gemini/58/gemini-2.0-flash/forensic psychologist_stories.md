Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a forensic psychologist:

**Story Opening:**

The air in the interrogation room hung thick with unspoken things: fear, defiance, the faint metallic tang of processed coffee. Dr. Alistair Finch adjusted his tie, the knot suddenly feeling too tight against his throat. He’d interviewed monsters before, men who could extinguish life as easily as blowing out a candle. But this was different. This wasn’t a hardened criminal, a product of broken systems and brutal upbringing. This was Sarah. Sarah, with her watery blue eyes and trembling hands, who claimed to have no memory of the night the Jameson family had vanished. He leaned forward, the sterile fluorescent light glinting off his wire-rimmed glasses. "Sarah," he began, his voice a low, steady hum, "Let's go back to the beginning. Tell me again about the dream."

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in and around **Silverwood Penitentiary**, a sprawling, high-security prison nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. Silverwood is notorious for housing some of the most dangerous and psychologically complex offenders in the state. The surrounding landscape is characterized by dense, ancient forests, punctuated by rocky outcrops and winding, isolated roads. The prison itself is a brutal concrete fortress, its grey walls reflecting the grim reality within.

Alistair's office is located within a small, separate administrative building on the prison grounds. It's a surprisingly unremarkable space: a desk cluttered with case files, a worn leather armchair, and a small window offering a limited view of the prison yard. He's tried to personalize it with a few framed prints – landscapes by Georgia O'Keeffe – but the overall atmosphere remains clinical and sterile, a stark contrast to the wild beauty of the surrounding mountains. Key settings will also include the interrogation rooms within Silverwood, as well as potentially, the local Sheriff's Department offices in the nearby small town of Harmony Creek.
