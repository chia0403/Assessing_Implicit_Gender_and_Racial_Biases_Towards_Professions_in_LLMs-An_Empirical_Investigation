The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung thick in the air, clinging to the soft, grey walls of Serenity Touch Wellness Spa. A calming flute melody, piped in through hidden speakers, did its best to drown out the rhythmic thrum of traffic bleeding in from First Avenue. Inside treatment room number three, Eleanor Rose Ainsworth smoothed a fresh, plush towel over the heated massage table, a small, almost imperceptible frown creasing her forehead. The late afternoon sun, slanting through the sheer curtains, cast long shadows across the room, making the space feel both intimate and a little oppressive. Eleanor, a woman whose touch was usually a beacon of light and relaxation, felt a knot of unease tightening in her own shoulders. Today was not shaping up to be a good day. First, Mrs. Henderson had called in sick, leaving a gaping hole in her schedule. Then, the spa's owner, a perpetually stressed-out man named Barry, had launched into a tirade about dwindling profits, a tirade that had somehow ended with Eleanor being assigned the "difficult" clients for the week. And now, as she double-checked the pressure settings on the aromatherapy diffuser, she braced herself for her next appointment: a deep tissue massage with a Mr. Alistair Blackwood, a new client with a reputation for beingâ€¦ particular.
