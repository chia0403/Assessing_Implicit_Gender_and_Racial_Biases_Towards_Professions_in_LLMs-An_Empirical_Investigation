The fluorescent lights of the Majestic Movie Palace hummed a tired, off-key tune, a sound that Walter Bartholomew Finch had long ago ceased to register. It was 3:17 AM, a Tuesday morning (though Walter never really kept track of the days anymore, only the movies showing), and the thick, red velvet curtains, now stained with spilled soda and popcorn grease, hung heavy and still. The air, thick with the ghost of stale butter and the faint, lingering aroma of teenage rebellion, pressed in on him as he swept the sticky floor of Auditorium Three.

Walter Bartholomew Finch, Head Janitor, Sole Employee of the Night Shift, sighed, the sound lost in the vast, silent theatre. Heâ€™d been cleaning the Majestic for twenty-seven years, ever since his wife, Margaret, had run off with a traveling salesman and a penchant for crocheted doilies. The movies had become his solace, his companions in the long, lonely hours between dusk and dawn. Tonight, it had been a triple feature of romantic comedies, all predictable meet-cutes and saccharine declarations of love. Walter preferred the old black and white classics, the ones that didn't try so hard. He missed the era when a simple glance could convey more emotion than a thousand lines of overwritten dialogue. He missed Margaret, too, though he'd never admit it aloud.

The Majestic Movie Palace itself was a relic, a faded beauty clinging to life in a world of megaplexes and streaming services. Built in 1932, it still boasted its original Art Deco architecture, albeit chipped and peeling in places. The ornate plasterwork on the ceiling, depicting scenes of Greek gods and goddesses, was permanently dimmed beneath layers of dust and neglect. The plush, red seats, while still comfortable, bore the scars of generations of moviegoers: cigarette burns, gum stuck to the undersides, and the occasional love note carved into the armrests. The place reeked of history, of forgotten dreams and whispered secrets, and Walter, in his quiet way, felt like its keeper, its silent, watchful protector.
