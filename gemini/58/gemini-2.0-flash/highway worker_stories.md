## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket clinging to the Louisiana bayou like Spanish moss on an ancient oak. Bees droned lazily around the ditch lilies lining Highway 90, their buzzing a low hum against the insistent whine of the asphalt milling machine. Sweat beaded on the brow of Arthur Lee Beaumont, trickling down into the furrowed lines etched by years of sun and wind. He wiped it away with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smudge of grime across his forehead that only served to emphasize the exhaustion in his eyes.

The sun, a malevolent orange eye peering through the hazy atmosphere, beat down on the exposed stretch of highway. Another scorcher. Just another damn scorcher in a long line of damn scorchers. Arthur sighed, the sound lost in the grinding rhythm of the machinery. He adjusted his orange hard hat, the plastic already slick with perspiration, and squinted at the seemingly endless expanse of cracked and crumbling asphalt stretching before him. Another mile to mill, another mile to pave, another mile closer to home.

He glanced at the digital display on the milling machine, a glowing green number taunting him with its slow, incremental progress. The day stretched ahead of him, a long, shimmering mirage of heat and dust, and Arthur Lee Beaumont braced himself for the grind. He was just a highway worker, after all. Taming the unruly beast that was the Louisiana asphalt, one painstaking mile at a time.
## Setting:

**Location:** A particularly sweltering section of Highway 90, traversing the Louisiana bayou between Morgan City and New Iberia. Specifically, a stretch undergoing extensive resurfacing.

**Time:** Mid-July, around 10:00 AM, at the peak of the Louisiana summer heat.

**Atmosphere:** Oppressive humidity, scorching heat, and the ever-present backdrop of the bayou: cypress trees draped with Spanish moss, brackish water shimmering in the distance, and the low, constant hum of insects. The air is thick with the smell of asphalt, diesel fumes, and the faint, earthy scent of the surrounding swampland.

**Visuals:** Cracked and crumbling asphalt, heavy machinery (milling machines, asphalt pavers, rollers), bright orange safety cones and barriers, and the occasional glimpse of the bayou through the trees. The landscape is flat and monotonous, stretching to the horizon in a hazy blur.
