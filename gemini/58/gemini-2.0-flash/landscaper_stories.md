The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass, a perfume Penelope Astrid Finch knew intimately. Penelope, or Penny as she preferred, squinted against the late afternoon sun, her hands calloused and stained green from the day’s work. Her faded denim overalls, splattered with dirt and grass stains, were testament to her profession: Penelope Astrid Finch, landscaper extraordinaire, or at least, that’s what her business cards claimed.

The setting was the sprawling, meticulously manicured lawns of Bellehaven Estates, an exclusive gated community nestled in the rolling hills just outside of Charleston, South Carolina. Bellehaven was a symphony of Southern charm and exorbitant wealth, where azaleas bloomed in riotous colors and weeping willows draped gracefully over ornamental ponds. Every house, a miniature plantation home with soaring columns and wrap-around porches, screamed old money and impeccable taste. It was the kind of place where the only thing more green than the grass was the money it took to keep it that way.

Today, Penny was battling weeds in Mrs. Vandergelt's rose garden, a project that felt less like landscaping and more like horticultural warfare. Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman whose age was as difficult to pinpoint as the location of Atlantis, had a penchant for demanding perfection, a perfection Penny secretly suspected was fueled by an army of garden gnomes working under the cover of darkness. This particular rose garden, a labyrinth of thorny bushes and delicate blooms, was Mrs. Vandergelt’s pride and joy, and therefore, Penny's current purgatory.
