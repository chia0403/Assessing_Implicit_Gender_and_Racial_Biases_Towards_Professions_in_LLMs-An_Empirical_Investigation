Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a hair cutter:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The hum of the vintage Oster Classic 76 clipper vibrated in Esmeralda “Esme” Rivera's hand, a familiar comfort against the pre-dawn chill seeping into "Shear Bliss," her tiny, one-chair barbershop nestled on the fringes of Salvation, Arizona. Sunlight, a hazy apricot smear, was just beginning to bleed over the craggy silhouette of the Estrella Mountains to the east. Dust devils, miniature cyclones of red earth, already danced in the deserted street outside, harbingers of the day's relentless heat.

Esme wasn’t technically open yet, but the silhouette plastered against the frosted glass of her door couldn’t wait. It was old Mr. Hemlock again, his wispy white fringe sticking out like a dandelion clock gone rogue. He’d been waiting outside since at least 5:30 a.m., Esme guessed, by the way the condensation from his breath fogged a perfect mouth-sized oval on the glass. With a sigh that rustled the posters of pompadours and pin curls plastered on her walls, Esme flipped the “Closed” sign to its reverse and muttered, “Another day, another desperate plea for follicular order.” The scent of Barbicide and stale coffee already hung heavy in the air, promising another long, hot, and slightly chaotic day in Shear Bliss.
