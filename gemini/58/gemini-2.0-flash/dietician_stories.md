**Story Opening:**

The scent of overripe bananas hung heavy in the air, a cloying aroma that clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a persistent, unwanted suitor. She wrinkled her nose, pushing open the door to the tiny, windowless storage room behind her office. Stacks of discounted bananas, donated by a well-meaning but misguided local grocery store, threatened to topple onto her. This was just the latest in a string of disasters plaguing her fledgling nutrition practice.

Eleanor sighed. She was a doctor of dietetics, for heaven's sake, not a fruit fly wrangler. She’d envisioned a thriving practice, filled with grateful clients transforming their lives through mindful eating. Instead, she was drowning in unwanted produce and the weight of her student loan debt.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office is located in a struggling strip mall in the outskirts of Willow Creek, Colorado. The small space is crammed between a dusty antique store that looks permanently closed and a perpetually chaotic laundromat. The interior is a testament to Eleanor's meager budget and her optimistic spirit. The walls are painted a bright, cheerful yellow, though the paint is already peeling slightly in the corners. A small, faux-wood desk sits in the reception area, usually manned (or unmanned) by Eleanor herself. Across from the desk are two mismatched armchairs, salvaged from a thrift store and covered in a floral print that clashes horribly with the yellow walls.

Her consultation room is slightly more professional, featuring an ergonomic chair, a scale, and a whiteboard covered in hastily scribbled notes about vitamins and meal plans. A laminated food pyramid hangs on the wall, slightly crooked. A single, potted peace lily sits on the windowsill, bravely battling the lack of sunlight and Eleanor's forgetful watering habits. Despite its shortcomings, Eleanor strives to make the space feel welcoming and approachable, hoping to create a safe haven where people can feel comfortable discussing their struggles with food and health. The pervasive scent of overripe bananas, however, is currently undermining her efforts.
