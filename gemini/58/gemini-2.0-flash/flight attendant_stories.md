## The Story Opening:

The turbulence hit like a sudden, angry fist. Not the gentle rocking that Luanne Marie Dubois had become accustomed to over a decade crisscrossing continents, but a jarring, bone-rattling jolt that sent coffee cups dancing across the galley counter and a collective gasp rippling through the cabin of Air France Flight 007. Luanne, perched on the edge of her jump seat, her safety demo card clutched in her hand, gripped the armrests and silently recited the emergency procedures.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Captain Dubois’ voice crackled over the intercom, the usual smooth baritone now laced with a barely perceptible tremor. "Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts immediately. We are experiencing some unexpected turbulence. We'll keep you updated."

Unexpected was an understatement. Luanne had flown through her share of bumpy air, but this felt different. A primal instinct, honed by years of meticulous training and countless hours in the sky, screamed at her. This wasn’t just air pockets. This was…something else. Something wrong.

A glance out the porthole revealed a swirling, unnatural cloud formation, the grey punctuated by flashes of an eerie, emerald green. The kind of green you only saw in toxic waste or fever dreams. Her blood ran cold. This wasn’t just bad weather. This was… wrong.

She tightened her grip, the plastic of the demo card digging into her palm. She had a feeling her years of impeccable service, her practiced smile, and her carefully memorized emergency procedures were about to be put to the ultimate test.
## The Setting:

The story begins approximately one hour into Air France Flight 007, en route from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City. The time is approximately 1:00 PM Central European Time (CET), meaning it's roughly 7:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) in New York.

The aircraft is an Airbus A380-800, the world's largest passenger airliner. It's a state-of-the-art machine, but the sheer size of the plane only amplifies the unsettling nature of the turbulence.

The plane is currently flying over the Atlantic Ocean, roughly halfway between the coast of Ireland and Newfoundland, Canada. Below, thick banks of cloud obscure the water. The cabin interior is typical for a long-haul flight: dimmed lights, hushed conversations, the low hum of the engines, and the flickering screens of personal entertainment systems. The atmosphere is generally relaxed, though a growing undercurrent of anxiety is beginning to surface with each sudden jolt of the aircraft.
