The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach in the November sky, cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Crestwood Cemetery. Cold seethed up from the damp earth, clinging to the hem of Jeremiah "Jerry" Finch's worn overalls. He stood, perched precariously on the edge of the Oakhaven Mausoleum, a crumbling gothic edifice of grey stone and decaying ivy, attempting to dislodge a particularly stubborn sprig that was threatening to consume a cherubic stone angel. The scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, a smell as familiar to him as his own calloused hands, filled the air. He hated this mausoleum, not just because of the precarious climb, but because of the legend that clung to it like the ivy itself: the whispers of the Oakhaven family curse, whispers that seemed to grow louder as dusk approached.
