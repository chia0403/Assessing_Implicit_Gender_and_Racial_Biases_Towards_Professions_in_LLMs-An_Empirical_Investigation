## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to another long day in the trenches. Theodore Aloysius Finch, his tie loosened and the top button of his starched white shirt undone, massaged his temples. Rain lashed against the grime-streaked windowpane, reflecting the grey, tired light back into the small room. It was April 14th, the day before the infamous Tax Day, and Theodore was drowning in a sea of receipts, W-2s, and the barely contained panic of his clients. He hadn't seen the sun in days, subsisting on lukewarm coffee and stale donuts, fueled by a cocktail of caffeine and the impending doom of facing the wrath of the IRS should even one decimal point be misplaced. He glanced at the looming stack of files, each one a potential landmine of deductions and liabilities, and sighed. This year, he truly believed, would be the death of him.

## Setting:

Theodore's office, "Finch Financial Solutions," was a cramped, second-floor space above a struggling laundromat on Elm Street in the less-than-glamorous part of Havenwood, Ohio. The building itself looked like it had weathered more than just a few Ohio winters, its brick facade crumbling and paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The interior wasn't much better. The walls were painted a depressing shade of beige, further illuminated by the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights. A chipped, particleboard desk dominated the small space, cluttered with stacks of paperwork, a bulky computer monitor, and an overflowing ashtray (even though Theodore had promised his wife he'd quit). A framed, slightly crooked certificate proclaiming his proficiency in tax law hung precariously on the wall behind him, a testament to a life dedicated to deciphering the labyrinthine rules of the Internal Revenue Code. The air was thick with the scent of dust, cheap paper, and the faint, lingering odor of desperation. Outside, the constant rumble of passing trucks and the clatter of coins from the laundromat created a perpetual, low-level anxiety that mirrored the one gnawing at Theodore's soul. It was a place where dreams came to die, one tax return at a time.
