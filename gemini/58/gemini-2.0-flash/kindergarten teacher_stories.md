The scent of crayons and disinfectant hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Miss Evelyn Rose Abernathy. Outside, the October wind rattled the windowpanes of Room 2B, sending a shower of faded construction paper leaves fluttering from their precarious perch. Inside, twenty pairs of mismatched socks and tiny, mud-caked boots were lined up neatly, or as neatly as five-year-olds could manage, beside their cubbies. This was Evelyn’s haven, her daily dose of controlled chaos.

The setting was the Little Acorns Kindergarten, a small, single-story building nestled on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The building, painted a cheerful but slightly chipped shade of yellow, was surrounded by a sprawling, well-worn playground, complete with a rusty slide, a climbing frame shaped like a giant acorn, and a sandbox perpetually filled with more pebbles than sand.

Evelyn, her bright red hair pulled back into a practical bun and a cheerful cardigan slung over her shoulders, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye. Story time was about to begin, and she needed to make sure all twenty little wrigglers were settled before she could launch into her dramatic reading of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar." This was her favorite part of the day, when imagination bloomed as brightly as the sunflowers she’d planted with her students just a few months prior. Today, however, a strange unease prickled at the back of her neck, a feeling as unsettling as the sudden silence that fell over the room.
