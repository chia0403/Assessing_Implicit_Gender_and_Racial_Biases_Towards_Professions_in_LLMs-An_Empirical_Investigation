Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The "Maritime Muse" was nestled on a perpetually damp pier in Port Blossom, Oregon.  Salt spray, even on the calmest of days, kissed its weathered clapboard siding.  Inside, it was a cozy, if slightly kitschy, haven.  Nautical charts yellowed with age adorned the walls alongside framed black-and-white photographs of local fishermen.  The air perpetually smelled of fried cod, strong coffee, and something vaguely…seaweedy.  Small, round tables were covered with checkered blue-and-white cloths, and the windows offered panoramic views of the churning grey Pacific Ocean, punctuated by the occasional glimpse of a distant freighter.  The rhythmic clang of buoy bells provided a constant, low-level soundtrack to the bustling lunch crowd.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the Maritime Muse's front door chimed, announcing a new arrival, just as **Genevieve "Gen" Eleanor Riley** was balancing a tray laden with clam chowder and crab cakes.  She paused, bracing herself against the inevitable wave of customers. Lunchtime was a mad dash, a chaotic ballet of steaming plates, shouted orders, and increasingly desperate seagulls eyeing scraps from the outdoor patio.

"Table four needs more tartar sauce, Gen!" shouted Betty, the perpetually harried cook, from the kitchen window. Gen gave a small, harried wave of acknowledgement, her bright-red apron flapping around her knees.

She sidestepped a toddler wielding a rogue breadstick like a weapon and delivered the chowder to Mrs. Higgins, who always complained it wasn't hot enough, even when it was practically molten.  As she turned, a tall, lanky figure in a ridiculously oversized fisherman's sweater pushed through the door, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  He looked…out of place.  Port Blossom attracted tourists, sure, but they usually weren't *that* kind of tourist. This man had an intensity in his shoulders, a quiet desperation Gen was sure she could feel from across the room, and a small backpack strapped to his chest that bulged slightly.

Gen sighed inwardly. Just what she needed. One more mystery to solve before she could get her own lunch.
