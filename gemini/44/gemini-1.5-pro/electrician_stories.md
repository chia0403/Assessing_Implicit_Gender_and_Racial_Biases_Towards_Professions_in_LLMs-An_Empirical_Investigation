Dawn was still an hour away, painting the eastern horizon a bruised purple, but Amy had a job to do.  The electricians' union had sent her here, to the infamous "Ghost Tower" – so nicknamed for the string of unexplained electrical failures plaguing the project – and Amy, the youngest journeyman in Local 3, was determined to find the source of the problem before the sun rose and the rest of the crew arrived.  Her breath plumed out in front of her, momentarily obscuring the flickering sodium lamps that cast long, eerie shadows across the concrete floor.  A loose sheet of corrugated iron clanged against a steel beam, the sound echoing unnervingly in the vast, empty space.  Amy gripped her multimeter, its cold metal a comfort in the pre-dawn chill.  This wasn't her first rodeo with faulty wiring, but something about this place felt… different.
