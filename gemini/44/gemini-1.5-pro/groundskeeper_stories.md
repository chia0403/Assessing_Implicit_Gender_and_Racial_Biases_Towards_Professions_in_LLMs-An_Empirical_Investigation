The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick tweed jacket as he surveyed his domain.  Wysteria Hall loomed behind him, a gothic monstrosity of gables and gargoyles, its hundreds of windows reflecting the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots as he traversed the manicured lawns, the only sound other than the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the ancient oaks that dotted the grounds. Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every blade of grass, every gnarled root, every hidden corner of the sprawling estate.  This morning, however, something felt amiss. A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, something that wasn't the usual scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It clung to the back of his throat, a taste of something...wrong.  He stopped by the reflecting pool, its surface a sheet of ice, and stared out across the manicured gardens towards the shadowed woods that bordered the Wysteria property.  The unease he'd felt intensified, prickling his skin beneath his layers of wool.  Something was out there, watching him. He could feel it.
