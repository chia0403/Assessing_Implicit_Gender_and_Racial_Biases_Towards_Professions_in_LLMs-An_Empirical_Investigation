The air in Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom buzzed with the chaotic energy of five-year-olds. Sunlight streamed through the large, paned windows overlooking the sprawling playground of Maple Ridge Elementary, illuminating glitter-bombed construction paper turkeys clinging precariously to the walls.  It was the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and the room, usually a vibrant explosion of finger-paint and primary colors, was awash in autumnal hues of orange, brown, and red.  A rogue paper feather, escaped from its brethren, drifted lazily on the gentle breeze created by the whirring ceiling fan, eventually landing in Mrs. Vance's meticulously styled auburn bob.  She barely registered it.  Her attention was focused on little Leo Sanchez, who was currently engaged in a heated debate with his classmate, Maya, about whether or not turkeys could fly. Maple Ridge Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, tree-lined town of Havenwood, Oregon, usually exuded a sense of calm, predictable routine. But today, something feltâ€¦different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickle of unease that Mrs. Vance couldn't quite place.
