The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Motel cast a lurid, purple glow across Amelia Grace Hawthorne's sensible beige Corolla. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already desolate landscape of Joshua Tree, California. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of perfectly coiffed auburn hair behind her ear.  Her taupe blazer, normally crisp and professional, now clung damply to her shoulders. This wasn’t exactly how she’d envisioned closing the deal with Cactus Valley’s largest date farm, but Mr. Henderson had insisted on this last-minute, emergency meeting. "Urgent business," he'd rasped over the phone, the line crackling with static and what Amelia suspected was the clinking of ice in a glass.  The desert air, thick with the smell of wet creosote and something vaguely unsettling, pressed against her as she stepped out of the car.  Her heels clicked on the cracked asphalt, a lonely sound in the vast, rain-swept emptiness.  The Starlight's office, a cramped box illuminated by a single bare bulb, was empty save for a dusty plastic fern and a ringing rotary phone.  This wasn’t going to be easy.
