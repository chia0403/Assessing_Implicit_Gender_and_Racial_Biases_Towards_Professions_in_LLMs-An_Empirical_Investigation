Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  Loose papers, victims of a sudden gust that had snuck through a cracked pane, danced a frantic jig across the worn wooden floorboards. Amelia, her full name Amelia Elizabeth Thorne, sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of her eye. The attic, nestled in the eaves of a rambling Victorian house on the outskirts of the perpetually misty town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was usually her sanctuary. Tonight, however, it felt less like a haven and more like a cage. The scent of old books and printer ink, usually comforting, hung heavy in the air, suffocating her with the weight of the manuscript spread across her desk.  It was supposed to be the next big thing, a fantasy epic poised to redefine the genre. But in Amelia’s experienced editorial eye, it was…well, it was a mess. A glorious, sprawling, imaginative mess.
