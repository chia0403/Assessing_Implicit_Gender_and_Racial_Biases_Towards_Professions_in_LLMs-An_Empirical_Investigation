The courtroom clock, a relic from a bygone era of brass and ornate carvings, ticked with ponderous finality.

The case before her, a seemingly simple dispute over a dilapidated Victorian in the Haight-Ashbury district, had taken a dark and unexpected turn.  A whispering campaign, fuelled by rumour and innuendo, had spread through the city, insinuating corruption and backroom deals. Now, as the final witness shuffled nervously in the stand, a palpable tension hung in the air, thick and suffocating as the fog rolling in from the Golden Gate.  Amelia, known for her unwavering adherence to the letter of the law and her icy demeanour, felt a prickle of unease. This case was more than just bricks and mortar; it was a test, not just of her legal acumen, but of her very integrity.
