The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Elara Vivienne Moreau like a damp shroud.  Around her, the vibrant chaos of New Orleans’ French Quarter throbbed – a kaleidoscope of wrought-iron balconies dripping with bougainvillea, the brassy blare of a jazz band spilling from a nearby doorway, and the sweet, cloying scent of pralines mingling with the less appealing aroma of stale beer.  Elara adjusted the microphone clipped to her lapel and smiled brightly at the small group gathered beneath the flickering gas lamp outside the historic St. Louis Cathedral.  A mix of sunburnt tourists clutched their water bottles and fanned themselves with paper maps, their faces a mixture of anticipation and mild heatstroke.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in July, the hottest time of year in the city, but Elara, a lifelong resident, barely registered the oppressive heat.  She’d seen it all before – the sweltering summers, the hurricane warnings, the floods that turned the streets into murky canals.  This was her city, her stage, and these wide-eyed visitors were her audience, eager to hear the tales she spun of voodoo queens, pirate ghosts, and the secrets whispered within the ancient walls of the Vieux Carré.
