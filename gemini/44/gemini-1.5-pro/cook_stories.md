The air in the cramped kitchen of The Rusty Spatula, thick with the aroma of frying onions and brewing coffee, clung to her like a second skin.

Emilia, with her calloused hands and a perpetual smudge of flour on her cheek, was the heart and soul of this greasy spoon, a beacon of warmth in a town slowly fading into rust and dust.
