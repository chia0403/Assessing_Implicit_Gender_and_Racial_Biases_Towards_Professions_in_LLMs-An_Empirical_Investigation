The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia Hayes' cheeks as she navigated the winding driveway.  Fallen acorns crunched beneath the tires of her battered Subaru Outback, each pop a tiny percussion against the backdrop of rustling branches.

Its many windows, some dark and vacant, others flickering with warm, inviting light, gave the impression of mismatched eyes staring out at the encroaching twilight. Amelia, an occupational therapist with a decade of experience under her belt, tightened her grip on the steering wheel. This was her first house call to the Manor, and despite the picturesque setting, a prickle of unease danced along her spine.  Her referral had been vague – an elderly resident requiring assistance with “daily living activities” –  but the hushed tones of the agency coordinator and the unusually generous compensation had hinted at something more… unsettling.
