The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout gear as she stood on the precipice of what was once the Majestic Hotel, now a roaring inferno against the pre-dawn sky.  Embers danced on the updraft, swirling like angry fireflies against the bruised indigo canvas overhead.

The air, thick with smoke and the metallic tang of burning wiring, scorched her lungs with each ragged breath.

The five-story building, a relic of the town's grander past, was collapsing in on itself, storey by storey, like a dying giant.  And somewhere inside, trapped amidst the smoke and flames, were two terrified children.
