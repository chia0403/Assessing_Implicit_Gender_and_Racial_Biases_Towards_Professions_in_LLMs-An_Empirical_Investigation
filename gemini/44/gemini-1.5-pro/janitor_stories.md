The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital east wing cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished linoleum. It was 3:17 a.m., the quietest hour, when even the ghosts seemed to sleep.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, the only visible movement in the deserted corridor.  This was Elias Finch's domain.  His push broom leaned against the wall, a loyal steed awaiting its master.  Elias, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, hummed a mournful tune as he wrung out his mop, the scent of disinfectant mingling with the metallic tang of old blood that clung stubbornly to the air.  St. Jude's had seen its share of suffering, and Elias, in his own quiet way, had witnessed it all.  Tonight, however, felt different. A chill, deeper than the air conditioning's hum, settled in the marrow of his bones.
