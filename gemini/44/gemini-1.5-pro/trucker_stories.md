The Nevada sun, a malevolent eye in the pale desert sky, beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 379.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," and kicked up gritty swirls against the rig's chrome grill. Inside, Delilah "Dee" Jones, her brow beaded with sweat despite the roaring AC, gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white.  The radio crackled with static punctuated by the twang of a forgotten country song.  West of Fallon, the landscape stretched out before her, an endless expanse of sagebrush and shimmering heat haze, broken only by the occasional jagged peak in the far distance. Deeâ€™s destination: a small mining town nestled in the shadow of the Stillwater Range, a place called Austin, Nevada, population: less than 200 souls, and likely fewer secrets.  This haul, a load of mining explosives, was Dee's last before a two-week break back home in Reno, and she was itching to deliver it, shower, and sleep for a week straight. But the oppressive stillness of the desert, the very air itself, seemed to hum with a nervous energy, hinting that this particular run wouldn't be as straightforward as she hoped.
