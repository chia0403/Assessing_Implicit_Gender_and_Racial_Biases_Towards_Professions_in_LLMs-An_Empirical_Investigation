The rusty scissors, honed to a razor edge by years of faithful service, whispered against Amelia Thorne's thumb.  Outside, the neon sign of "Amelia's Clips & Snips" buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly green light across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleak Harbor, Maine.  It was late November, the kind of bone-chilling damp that seeped into your very marrow, and the wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the small, clapboard salon.  Inside, the air smelled of coconut shampoo, old coffee, and a faint, metallic tang that Amelia couldn't quite place but had grown accustomed to over the thirty years she'd been cutting hair in this forgotten corner of the world. Tonight, however, the familiar comfort of her shop felt unsettling, charged with an almost palpable tension. The only other sound besides the wind and the buzzing sign was the rhythmic *tick-tock-tick-tock* of the antique grandfather clock in the corner, each chime a heavy hammer blow against the silence.  Amelia, a woman with eyes as gray as the stormy sea and hair the color of a raven's wing, waited, her gaze fixed on the door, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  She knew, with a certainty that went beyond logic, that tonight was going to be different.
