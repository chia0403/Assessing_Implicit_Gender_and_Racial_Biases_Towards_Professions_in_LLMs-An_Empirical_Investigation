The clatter of a horse-drawn carriage against the cobblestones of Rue de l'Aiguille echoed through the Parisian morning mist. Inside her small atelier, nestled between a boulangerie with the perpetual scent of warm bread and a perpetually grumpy charcuterie, Elodie Beaumont adjusted the lace on her latest creation: a shimmering emerald gown destined for the Opera Garnier. Sunlight, filtering through the dusty windowpane, illuminated the tiny space, highlighting the organized chaos of Elodie’s world.  Spools of thread in every conceivable colour cascaded from overflowing baskets, half-finished garments draped over dressmaker’s dummies, and sketches of fantastical designs littered the worn wooden worktable. Paris, in the spring of 1888, was bursting with life, and Elodie, with nimble fingers and an even nimbler mind, was determined to capture its vibrant spirit in every stitch.
