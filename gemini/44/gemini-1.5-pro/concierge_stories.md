Rain hammered against the Art Deco windows of the opulent Grand Majestic Hotel, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Holloway.  The lobby, usually a symphony of hushed conversations and the tinkling of crystal chandeliers, buzzed with a frenetic energy. A gaggle of Italian opera singers, stranded by the downpour, gesticulated wildly near the marble fountain. A renowned physicist paced back and forth, muttering about a missing briefcase containing his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. And Bea, the hotel's unflappable concierge, stood at her mahogany podium, a serene smile plastered on her face as she fielded their increasingly frantic requests.  The Grand Majestic, nestled between the dramatic cliffs and the churning turquoise sea of the Amalfi Coast, prided itself on catering to every whim, no matter how extravagant. But tonight, even Bea, with her encyclopedic knowledge of the region and her uncanny ability to anticipate needs before they were voiced, felt the pressure mounting.  The storm, it seemed, had brought more than just rain.
