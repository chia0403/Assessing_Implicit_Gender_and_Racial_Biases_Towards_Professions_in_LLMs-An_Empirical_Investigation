The biting November wind whipped through the canyons of downtown Los Angeles, carrying with it the scent of exhaust fumes and desperation.  Neon signs flickered to life against a bruised twilight sky, reflecting in the rain-slicked streets.  Perched precariously on a scaffolding platform thirty feet above Hollywood Boulevard,  Elias Vance Holloway, a man whose prematurely silver hair belied the youthful fire in his hazel eyes,  gripped a megaphone, his knuckles white. Below him, chaos reigned. Extras in flapper dresses shivered and gossiped, a vintage roadster backfired dramatically, and a grip swore loudly as a spotlight malfunctioned, casting erratic shadows across the painstakingly recreated 1920s street scene.  Elias, however, remained focused, his gaze fixed on a specific point in the swirling activity:  the rising starlet, Isabella Rossi, poised mid-scene, her face a perfect mask of melancholic beauty.  This was the shot. This was the moment that would make or break his comeback film, and Elias, after five years in directorial exile, couldn't afford to break.
