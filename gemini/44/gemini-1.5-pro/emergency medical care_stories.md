The biting wind whipped off the East River, stinging Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's cheeks as she leaned out of the open back doors of the ambulance.  Manhattan's jagged skyline glittered with a million indifferent lights, a stark contrast to the pulsing red and blue strobing atop their rig.  It was 2:17 AM, the kind of early morning cold that burrowed deep into your bones, the kind that made even the seasoned paramedics of Rescue 12 crave the lukewarm coffee brewing back at the station. Tonight, however, Amy wasn’t dreaming of caffeine.  She was focused on the radio chatter crackling in her ear, describing a multi-vehicle collision on the FDR Drive, just south of the Brooklyn Bridge.  The dispatcher’s voice, strained and urgent, painted a grim picture: multiple casualties, possible entrapment.  Amy gripped the metal handrail, the cold seeping through her gloves, a knot tightening in her stomach. This wasn't going to be a good one.
