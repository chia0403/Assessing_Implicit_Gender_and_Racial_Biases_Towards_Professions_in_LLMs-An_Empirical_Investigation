The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack that had accompanied Amelia Reyes, the school’s guidance counselor, for the past fifteen years.  Her office, a converted storage closet tucked between the bustling cafeteria and the echoing gymnasium, was a testament to organized chaos. College pennants plastered one wall, vying for space with motivational posters featuring kittens clinging to ropes.  A precarious stack of student files teetered on her desk, threatening to avalanche onto the worn, floral-print rug beneath. Outside, the late September air, crisp and carrying the scent of burning leaves, filtered in through the perpetually cracked window.  This Monday morning felt different, though.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the usual pre-test anxiety.  Amelia felt it prickle at the back of her neck, a premonition that this week wouldn’t be filled with the usual schedule changes and college application woes.
