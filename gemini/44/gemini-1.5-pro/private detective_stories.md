Rain lashed against the grimy window of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's office, mirroring the tempest brewing in her gut.  Neon light from the 'Lucky Clover' bar across the street reflected in the puddles accumulating on the fire escape below, casting lurid green streaks across her worn leather armchair. The room, a cramped box above a failing bakery in the French Quarter of New Orleans, was thick with the cloying scent of stale beignets and Cassie’s own brand of cheap coffee, brewed strong enough to strip paint.  A single, flickering bulb illuminated the clutter: overflowing ashtrays, stacks of case files teetering precariously on every surface, and a half-eaten muffuletta sweating grease onto a newspaper from last week. The year was 1957, and a humid, oppressive heat clung to the city even in late October, a blanket stifling the already languid pace of life. This was Cassie’s world, a world of shadows and secrets, where the line between right and wrong blurred like the watercolor washes of the city after a downpour. And tonight, it was about to get a whole lot blurrier.
