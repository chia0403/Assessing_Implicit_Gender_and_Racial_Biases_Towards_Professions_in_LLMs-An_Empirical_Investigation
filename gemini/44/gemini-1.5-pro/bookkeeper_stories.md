The frosted glass of Amelia Prudence Higgins's office door declared, in elegant gold lettering, "A.P. Higgins, Bookkeeping & Accountancy."  It was a lie of omission, really. The "& Accountancy" part was aspirational, a nod to the future Amelia envisioned for herself, one brimming with complex audits and lucrative business consultations.  Currently, her clientele consisted mostly of Mrs. Migginsâ€™ cat grooming emporium, a struggling used bookstore run by a man who insisted on being called Professor Quibble, and the surprisingly lucrative Whispering Pines Funeral Home.

Her office, nestled above a bakery on the perpetually damp High Street of Port Blossom, Oregon, smelled faintly of cinnamon and despair. Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the view of the grey, churning Pacific. Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Amelia's fingers on the keys of her ancient adding machine, a machine that predated her by several decades and possessed a personality as cantankerous as Mrs. Miggins' prize-winning Persian, Mr. Fluffernutter.  It was a Thursday in late November, the kind of day that made Amelia long for the blazing sun of her Arizona childhood, a stark contrast to the drizzle-soaked reality of her present.  Today, however, even the familiar melancholy of a Port Blossom afternoon was about to be shattered.
