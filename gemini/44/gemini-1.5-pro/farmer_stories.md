The wind, smelling of impending rain and churned earth, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered coat as he surveyed his fields.  Dusk was settling over the rolling hills of the Silverstream Valley, painting the sky in bruised purples and oranges.  His farm, nestled between the whispering willows lining Silverstream Creek and the towering shadow of Mount Cinder, was a patchwork of greens and browns â€“ the newly sprouted winter wheat a vibrant contrast to the fallow fields awaiting spring planting.  A lone crow perched on the weather vane atop his barn, its silhouette stark against the fading light. Elias, his calloused hands thrust deep into his pockets, felt a familiar knot of worry tighten in his chest.  The rain was needed, desperately so, but the whispers of a late frost in the valley had him on edge.  This year's harvest was crucial, more so than any before.
