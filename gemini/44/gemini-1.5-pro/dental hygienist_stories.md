The fluorescent lights of Aspire Dental hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Evelyn Reed had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years of scraping tartar and polishing enamel. Outside, the late October wind howled through the eaves of the Victorian house that had been converted into the clinic, rattling the leaded glass windows.  Fallen maple leaves, the color of burnt umber and rust, plastered themselves against the glass like desperate patients seeking an appointment. Inside, the air smelled faintly of mint and antiseptic, a scent Evelyn usually found comforting but today, it held a metallic edge that pricked at her nostrils, a premonition she couldn't quite place.  She tapped her gloved fingers against the sterile tray, waiting for her 2:30 – Mr. Henderson, a retired history professor with a penchant for licorice and a surprising fear of the tiny, whirring polisher. But Mr. Henderson didn’t show. And when the phone rang, Evelyn had the uneasy feeling that her quiet, predictable Tuesday afternoon was about to become something else entirely.
