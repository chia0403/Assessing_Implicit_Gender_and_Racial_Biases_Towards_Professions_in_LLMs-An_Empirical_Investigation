The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold Finchley's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the single, grime-streaked window.  April 14th.  The penultimate day of tax season.  For Amelia Priscilla Higgins, Registered Tax Preparer, it felt less like a penultimate day and more like the final boss battle in a particularly grueling video game.

The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, clung to Amelia like a second skin. Outside, the decaying industrial landscape of Bridgeport, Connecticut, offered no solace. The rain mirrored the grim determination etched on Amelia's face as she stared down another Schedule C, bracing herself for the inevitable onslaught of depreciation calculations.
