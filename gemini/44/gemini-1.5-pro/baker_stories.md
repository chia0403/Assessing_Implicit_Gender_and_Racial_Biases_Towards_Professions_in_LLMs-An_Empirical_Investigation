The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Amelia "Amy" Thistlewick, her flour-dusted apron tied tight around her waist, hummed a jaunty tune as she wrestled a particularly stubborn batch of croissant dough.  Her bakery, "The Whispering Oven," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling laundromat on Lavender Lane, was her sanctuary.  The small space, with its mismatched chairs, chipped porcelain teacups, and overflowing shelves of cookbooks, held the warmth of a thousand rising loaves.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a quaint seaside village in Cornwall, were still slumbering, unaware of the magic Amy was weaving within the four walls of her bakery.  The only sound besides her humming was the gentle lapping of waves against the harbor wall, a rhythmic whisper promising a new day.
