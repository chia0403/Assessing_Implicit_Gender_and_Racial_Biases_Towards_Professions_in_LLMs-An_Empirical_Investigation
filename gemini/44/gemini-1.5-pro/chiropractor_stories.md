The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street.  Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., sat hunched over a stack of insurance claims, the fluorescent lights above humming in counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large bay window. His office, "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness," was a testament to both meticulous organization and a distinct lack of interior design flair. Anatomical charts lined the walls, competing for space with framed diplomas and certificates.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and the slightly sweet, earthy scent of the medicinal herbs Elias insisted on using in his heat packs.  Oakhaven, Illinois, population just shy of 5,000, wasnâ€™t exactly a bustling metropolis, and on a Tuesday night like this, with the rain coming down in sheets, Elias half expected to close up shop without seeing a single patient. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, the faint ache behind his eyes a familiar companion.  That was before the bell above the door chimed, announcing an arrival that would change everything.
