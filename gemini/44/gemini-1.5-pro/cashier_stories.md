The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped wasps, casting a sickly yellow glow across the aisles of expired candy and dusty bags of chips.  Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the view of the deserted gas pumps outside.  Elara Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, tapped her chipped red nails against the worn countertop.  It was 11:53 PM on a Tuesday, the kind of night where even the stray cats sought shelter, and Elara was certain she'd seen more tumbleweeds roll past than customers in the last three hours.  The Quick Stop, nestled between a defunct laundromat and a perpetually "Grand Opening Soon" psychic parlor on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Nevada, wasn't exactly a bustling hub of activity.  Tonight, the silence was broken only by the relentless drumming of rain and the low hum of the refrigerator struggling to keep the lukewarm sodas cool.
