The rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning of the Busy Bee Diner, a sound that usually soothed Elara Juniper Reyes, but tonight, it felt like an angry drummer keeping time with her churning stomach.  Neon signs from the pawn shop across the street reflected in the greasy puddles gathering at the curb, painting the scene in sickly yellows and greens.  Inside, the diner was a haven of warmth, buzzing with the low hum of conversation and the clatter of cutlery against thick ceramic plates.  The air hung thick with the smell of frying onions and cheap coffee, a fragrance Elara usually found comforting, but tonight, it only added to the cloying feeling of unease.  She wiped her sweaty palms on her apron, the embroidered bee buzzing mockingly above her name tag, and plastered on her best customer service smile.  A new family – two tired parents and three rambunctious kids – had just walked in, and Elara, despite the tremor of dread in her chest, knew exactly what they needed: a booth by the window, three high chairs, and a bottomless pot of coffee.  Little did she know that this seemingly ordinary Tuesday night was about to take a decidedly extraordinary turn.
