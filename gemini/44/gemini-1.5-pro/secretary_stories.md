Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Bradbury Building, drumming a restless rhythm against the ornate ironwork.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old paper and lemon polish, a familiar perfume to Miss Evangeline Periwinkle, secretary to the eccentric Mr. Silas Quibble, purveyor of rare and unusual antiquities.  Her small office, tucked away on the fifth floor, a labyrinthine level reserved for Mr. Quibbleâ€™s most prized (and arguably most cursed) acquisitions, usually offered a sanctuary from the bustling Los Angeles streets below. This afternoon, however, even the familiar clicking of her typewriter couldn't quite drown out the ominous rumble of thunder.  Evangeline, a woman of impeccable posture and even more impeccable organization, adjusted her spectacles and glanced at the ornate clock ticking away on the wall.  5:57 pm. Three minutes until she could lock up, brave the storm, and escape to the comforting predictability of her evening cup of chamomile tea.  Three minutes that felt like an eternity.
