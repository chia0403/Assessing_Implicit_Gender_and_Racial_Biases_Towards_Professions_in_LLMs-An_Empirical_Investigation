The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Christiansen's parka as she prepped her De Havilland Canada D-2 Beaver for takeoff.  The frozen expanse of Lake Iliamna stretched before her, a vast, white canvas scored with pressure ridges like the brushstrokes of some colossal, icy artist.  The late afternoon sun, already low in the sky, cast long, distorted shadows from the surrounding peaks of the Chigmit Mountains, painting the snow-covered landscape in hues of lavender and deep blue.  Ace tightened her fur-lined hood, the breath escaping her lips forming small, fleeting clouds in the frigid air. This was her office, her kingdom â€“ a thousand square miles of untamed wilderness, accessible only by air, and today, her mission was both urgent and perilous:  delivering vital medical supplies to a remote research outpost nestled deep within the unforgiving Alaskan Range.
