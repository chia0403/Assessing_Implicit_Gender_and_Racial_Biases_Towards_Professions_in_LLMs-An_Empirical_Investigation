Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  The room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually exuded a calming atmosphere.  Thick, burgundy drapes framed the windows, a crackling fireplace fought back the November chill, and the scent of vanilla and sandalwood from a discreet diffuser hung in the air.  But tonight, the flickering gaslight seemed to highlight the sharp angles of Mrs. Albright's face and the nervous tremor in her hands, rather than soften them.  Elias, his own reflection a pale ghost in the rain-streaked glass, leaned forward in his worn leather armchair, his expression a careful blend of concern and professional detachment. He had a feeling this session was about to unearth something far more complex than a simple case of autumnal blues.
