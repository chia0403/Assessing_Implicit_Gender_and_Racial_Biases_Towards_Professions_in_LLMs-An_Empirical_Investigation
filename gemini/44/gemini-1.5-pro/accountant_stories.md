The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Grace Holloway's tiny office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  The office, tucked away at the end of a dusty corridor above Patel's Spices & Sweets in the heart of Brick Lane, London, usually offered a strange sort of comfort with its overflowing filing cabinets and the faint, perpetual scent of cardamom.

Amelia, a meticulous accountant known for her unflappable nature and precise decimal points, found herself staring at a ledger that refused to balance, a discrepancy of precisely Â£17,492.38 glaring back at her like a malevolent eye. This wasn't just a misplaced decimal; something was deeply, disturbingly wrong.  And it was connected to the newly opened, suspiciously glamorous "Velvet Curtain" burlesque club just across the street.
