The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, whistling a mournful tune as it snaked its way through the gaps in Elias Thorne’s worn wool coat.  Elias, his breath clouding the frosty air, adjusted the heavy toolbox slung over his shoulder and squinted at the house number – 13 Blackwood Lane. It was a narrow, two-story Victorian with peeling paint and a sagging porch, tucked away at the very end of a cul-de-sac, as if trying to hide its secrets from the rest of the respectable, well-maintained houses in the affluent town of Hollow Creek.  The late afternoon sun, a pale and watery disc, cast long, distorted shadows across the overgrown lawn, giving the place an unsettling, almost sinister air. Elias, a carpenter by trade and a man of few words, felt a prickle of unease he couldn't quite explain.  He’d been hired to repair the rotted floorboards in the attic, a simple enough job, but something about the silence, the isolation, and the way the house seemed to hunch in on itself filled him with a sense of foreboding.
