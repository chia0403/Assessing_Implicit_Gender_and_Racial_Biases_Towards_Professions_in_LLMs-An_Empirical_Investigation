The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual aroma of vanilla and buttercream that permeated Eliza Jane Humphreys' cake decorating studio. Rain lashed against the large, arched window of "Eliza's Edible Artistry," blurring the view of the usually bustling Market Street in the quaint, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. Eliza, her auburn braids coiled atop her head like a cinnamon swirl, stared dejectedly at the smoking remains of what was supposed to be a three-tiered masterpiece for the Mayorâ€™s inaugural ball.  Outside, the normally cheerful string lights adorning the storefronts swung wildly in the wind, reflecting off the slick, cobblestone streets. The storm, which had rolled in unexpectedly just an hour ago, seemed to mirror the turmoil brewing within Eliza.  This cake, a towering confection of spun sugar and hand-painted chocolate sails, was meant to be her magnum opus, her ticket to finally being recognized beyond Port Blossom's charming, yet limiting, borders.  Now, with the ball just twenty-four hours away, it was nothing more than a charred, sugary mess.
