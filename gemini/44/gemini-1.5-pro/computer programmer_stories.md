The flickering neon sign of the "Binary Bean" coffee shop cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Grace Chen's face as she hunched over her laptop.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Neo-Kyoto into a shimmering, holographic mess.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and synthetic ramen, punctuated by the rhythmic clack of Amelia's keyboard.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour in a city that never truly slept, and Amelia, a freelance programmer with a penchant for impossible deadlines and even stronger coffee, was wrestling with a particularly stubborn piece of code.  Her apartment, a cramped micro-unit six blocks away, offered little in the way of inspiration, so the Binary Bean, with its 24/7 availability and perpetually spotty Wi-Fi, had become her unofficial second home. Tonight, however, even the familiar hum of the faulty ventilation system couldn't drown out the growing sense of unease that prickled at the back of her neck.  The code she was working on, a seemingly simple encryption algorithm for a shadowy client, was behaving in ways that defied logic, almost as if it wereâ€¦ sentient.
