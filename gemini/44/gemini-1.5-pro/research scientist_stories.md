The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, the icy tendrils snaking through the inadequate layers of thermal wear beneath.  He squinted at the swirling snow, the landscape a blinding monochrome of white and grey. The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a cluster of squat, futuristic buildings barely visible through the blizzard, felt a million miles away, though it was only a few hundred yards from where he stood, precariously balanced on the edge of the newly-formed chasm. This monstrous fissure, a yawning maw of ice and shadow, hadn't been here just three days ago. Now, it stretched for almost a kilometre across the glacial plain, its depths shrouded in an unnatural, pulsing blue light that seemed to vibrate against the harsh Antarctic silence. Aris, his breath clouding the frigid air, lowered his thermal imaging camera, a chill crawling down his spine that had nothing to do with the sub-zero temperature.  This wasn't just a geological anomaly. This was something else entirely.
