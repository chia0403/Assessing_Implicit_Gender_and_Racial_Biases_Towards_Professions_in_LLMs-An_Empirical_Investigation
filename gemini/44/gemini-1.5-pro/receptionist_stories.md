The lobby, with its soaring ceilings, marble floors inlaid with brass palm fronds, and cascading crystal chandeliers, whispered of a glamorous past, a past Eliza witnessed only in sepia-toned photographs that hung in the manager's office. Now, a faint scent of chlorine from the pool and the persistent buzz of air conditioning battling the Florida humidity were the true ambience of the hotel. This morning, that ambience was punctuated by the frantic buzzing from Room 402.
