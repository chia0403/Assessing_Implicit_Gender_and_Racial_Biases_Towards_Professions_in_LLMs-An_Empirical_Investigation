The salt spray kissed Aurelia Celeste Bouchard's face, a fine mist that mingled with the scent of turpentine clinging to her worn linen smock.  The October wind, sharp and invigorating, whipped around her easel, perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning grey-green sea.  Below, the fishing village of Portwenn, Cornwall, huddled against the coming storm, a jumble of slate roofs and crooked chimneys exhaling wisps of smoke into the bruised sky.  Aurelia adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat, its faded crimson a stark contrast to the muted palette of the landscape. Her fingers, stained with cobalt and ochre, tightened around her palette knife, ready to capture the raw, untamed beauty of the Cornish coast before the heavens unleashed their fury.
