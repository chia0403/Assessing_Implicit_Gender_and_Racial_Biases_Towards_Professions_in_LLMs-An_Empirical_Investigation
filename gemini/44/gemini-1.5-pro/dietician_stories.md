The biting November wind whipped through the cobblestone streets of Arkham, Massachusetts, carrying the scent of brine and decaying leaves.  A thin layer of frost kissed the wrought-iron gates of Arkham Sanatorium, reflecting the pallid light of a prematurely setting sun. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heels against the polished linoleum floor.  Eleanor, her full name Eleanor Beatrice Vance, adjusted the tortoiseshell frames of her glasses and sighed.  Her breath puffed out in a small white cloud, a stark contrast to the sterile, overheated air of the sanatorium's dietary wing.  Tonight's menu:  Shepherd's pie, a bland, comforting dish designed to soothe the troubled minds residing within these walls.  Little did Eleanor know, the comfort she aimed to provide was about to be shattered by something far more unsettling than a dietary restriction.
