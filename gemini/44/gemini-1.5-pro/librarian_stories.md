The frosted breath of November clawed at the leaded windows of the Briarwood Public Library, sketching fleeting patterns across the panes. Inside, Amelia Priscilla Hawthorne, Briarwood's head librarian and self-proclaimed guardian of its literary treasures, shivered despite the crackling fire in the hearth.  The library, a rambling Victorian edifice of dark wood and echoing hallways, usually hummed with a quiet energy – the rustling of pages, the gentle tap of keyboards, the hushed murmurs of patrons. Tonight, however, an unsettling silence reigned, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reading room, a sound that seemed amplified in the stillness.  A single lamp illuminated Amelia's desk, casting long shadows that danced across the towering stacks of returned books waiting to be reshelved.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient oak branches against the building, a sound that mirrored the unease growing in Amelia’s heart. Something was not quite right.
