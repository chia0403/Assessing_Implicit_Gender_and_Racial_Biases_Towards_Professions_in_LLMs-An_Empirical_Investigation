The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Greystone Quarry, carrying with it the fine dust of pulverized granite that clung to everything â€“ the rough-hewn shelters, the rusted tools, and the weathered face of Elias Thorne. Elias, his calloused fingers already stiff despite the meager morning sun, surveyed his domain. The quarry, a gaping wound in the earth's flank, spiraled downwards in a series of uneven terraces, each level a testament to generations of Thorne men who had carved their living from the unyielding stone. Here, beneath the perpetually overcast sky of the northern Altan Mountains, life was as hard and unforgiving as the rock itself.  A single, crooked pine clung precariously to the edge of the quarry, its branches gnarled and twisted, a mirror of the men who toiled below. This morning, however, a different kind of stillness hung in the air, a hushed expectancy that had nothing to do with the usual grim routine.  Elias felt it too, a prickling at the back of his neck, a premonition that the unchanging rhythm of his life was about to be shattered.
