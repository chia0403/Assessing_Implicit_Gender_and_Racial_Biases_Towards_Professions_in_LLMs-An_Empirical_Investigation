The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery and stinging his cheeks as he hurried across the cobbled street.  Greyhaven, a small fishing village perched precariously on the Yorkshire cliffs, was shrouded in a thick, salty mist that swallowed the sound of crashing waves and the cries of gulls.  The air hung heavy with the smell of brine and coal smoke, a familiar scent that Elias, despite his medical training in London, had never truly grown accustomed to. The year was 1923, and the shadows of the Great War still clung to the village like the persistent sea fret, leaving an unspoken melancholy in its wake.  The flickering gas lamps lining the narrow, winding streets offered little solace against the encroaching darkness, casting long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed like the anxieties that plagued the hearts of Greyhaven's inhabitants.
