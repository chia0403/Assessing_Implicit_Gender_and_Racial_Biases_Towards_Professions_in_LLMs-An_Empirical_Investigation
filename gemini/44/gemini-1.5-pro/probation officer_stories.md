The stale, recirculated air of the Franklin County Courthouse hummed against Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s skin as she ascended the grand, echoing staircase.  Cracked linoleum, stained a sickly yellow from decades of spilled coffee and hurried footsteps, stretched before her. The third floor, her domain, housed the probation department – a warren of cramped offices crammed between the Family Court and the District Attorney's bustling suite.  Charleston, West Virginia, simmered in the July humidity outside, but inside, the courthouse was a perpetually cool, dimly lit labyrinth, radiating an atmosphere of quiet desperation. Amy, clutching a thick file bulging with pre-sentencing reports, navigated the familiar maze, her sensible heels clicking rhythmically against the worn stone. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unforgiving glare on the chipped paint and water-stained ceiling tiles.  Today’s caseload was particularly heavy: a repeat DUI offender, a young woman caught shoplifting baby formula, and a man facing charges of aggravated assault.  Amy sighed, a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Every day felt like wading through quicksand, trying to pull people back from the brink, even when they didn't want to be saved.
