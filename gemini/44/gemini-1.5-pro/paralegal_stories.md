The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kester & Kleinman office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a paralegal.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Philadelphia, blurring the cityâ€™s iconic skyline into a watercolour wash of grey and ochre.  November in the city brought a damp chill that seeped into the bones, and Amelia, wrapped in a worn cashmere cardigan, cradled a steaming mug of tea in her hands.  It was 7:15 pm on a Friday, and she was the only one left in the sprawling office, save for the cleaning crew bustling discreetly in the hallway.  The deadline for the Peterson antitrust case loomed large on Monday, and Amelia had volunteered to stay late to organize the mountain of documents that had arrived earlier that day.  Usually, this kind of late-night grind irritated her, but tonight, an unusual quiet had settled over her, a welcome respite from the usual frenetic energy of the firm.  This peace, however, was about to be shattered.
