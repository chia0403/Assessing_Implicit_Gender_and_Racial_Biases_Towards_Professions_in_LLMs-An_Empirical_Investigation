The biting November wind whipped Dr.  Eleanor Vance Holloway's auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.  Grey, gothic spires pierced the bruised, twilight sky, mirroring the jagged unease churning in her stomach. Rain threatened, a fine mist already clinging to the ancient stone walls, making the air smell of wet wool and centuries-old secrets.  Eleanor clutched the thick file under her arm, its contents – the details of the ‘Canongate Carver’ case – pressing against her ribs like a physical manifestation of the weight she carried.  This was her first high-profile case since relocating to Scotland, a chance to prove herself in a new city, a new country, but the grotesque nature of the crimes and the media frenzy surrounding them were already taking their toll.  Inside, the warm, halogen glow of the courtroom beckoned, but Eleanor felt no comfort.  The shadows clinging to the corners of the imposing building seemed to whisper warnings, and she couldn't shake the feeling that this case was going to burrow deep under her skin, leaving a mark far darker than the Edinburgh rain.
