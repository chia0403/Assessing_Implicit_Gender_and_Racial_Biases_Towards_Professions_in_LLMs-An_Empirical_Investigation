The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Dew Drop Inn," a rhythm that mirrored the frantic thump of Eleanor Vance's heart.  Dust motes danced in the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above her head, illuminating the grime clinging to the chipped mugs and sticky tabletops.  Cigarette smoke, thick and cloying, hung in the air like a shroud, punctuated by the occasional burst of raucous laughter from a group of miners huddled around a dartboard in the corner. This wasn't the kind of establishment Eleanor, a seasoned reporter for the Boston Globe, frequented, but Nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, the Dew Drop Inn was the only place in the dilapidated coal town of Blackwood offering a semblance of warmth and a lukewarm cup of coffee. Eleanor, clutching her notebook and pen, shivered, not entirely from the cold seeping through the drafty walls, but from a growing unease that had taken root in her gut since she’d arrived three days ago. She’d come to Blackwood chasing a story, a whisper of a story really, about a mine closure and the subsequent disappearances that had plagued the town like a persistent cough.  The locals were tight-lipped, their eyes guarded, and the sheriff, a man with a face like weathered leather and a voice to match, offered nothing but platitudes and thinly veiled warnings to stay out of their business. But Eleanor, driven by a relentless curiosity and the scent of a story bigger than she’d ever imagined, wasn't about to leave Blackwood without some answers.
