The biting November wind whipped across the sprawling fields of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine needles.  Frost glittered on the long grass, crunching under Elara Juniper Finch's boots as she made her early morning rounds.

From the majestic bald eagles recovering in the aviary to the mischievous family of raccoons residing in the hollow oak by the creek, Elara knew each resident intimately. This morning, however, a strange unease settled in her stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite shake, like the quiet before a storm. The sky, a bruised purple, mirrored her apprehension.  Something was different.  Something was wrong.
