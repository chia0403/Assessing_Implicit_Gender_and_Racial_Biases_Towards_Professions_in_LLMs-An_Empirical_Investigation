The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the shed and whistling through the gaps in the wooden planks. Inside, bathed in the warm glow of a soldering iron and the flickering green light of an oscilloscope, Elias Thorne meticulously rewired a vintage Marconi radio receiver. Salt spray had corroded the original wiring, a common ailment for electronics on the remote Shetland island of Foula, the most westerly point of the British Isles.  Elias, his dark hair perpetually falling into his eyes, squinted through his magnifying glass, the scent of rosin and ozone filling the cramped space. Beyond the single window, the setting sun painted the dramatic cliffs of Da Kame in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple, a stark contrast to the organized chaos of his workbench.  This shed, perched precariously on a windswept hill overlooking the churning ocean, was Elias's sanctuary, his workshop, his escape from the quiet, sometimes stifling, island life.
