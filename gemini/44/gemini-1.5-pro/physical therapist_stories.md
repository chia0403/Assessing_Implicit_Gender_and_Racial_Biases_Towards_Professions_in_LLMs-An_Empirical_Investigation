The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of the Alderwood Rehabilitation Center.  Nestled deep in the Vermont countryside, Alderwood was a sprawling complex of renovated farm buildings, all warm brick and weathered wood, clustered around a central green.  The late afternoon sun, already dipping behind the forested hills that encircled the valley, cast long shadows that danced across the manicured lawns, making the wrought-iron benches and meticulously pruned rose bushes appear almost skeletal.  Elias, clutching a steaming mug of apple cider in one hand and a patient's file in the other, paused for a moment, taking in the tranquility.  It was a far cry from the bustling city hospitals where heâ€™d spent the first decade of his career, a deliberate choice he'd made seeking a slower pace and a more profound connection with his patients.  Little did he know, the quiet of Alderwood was about to be shattered.
