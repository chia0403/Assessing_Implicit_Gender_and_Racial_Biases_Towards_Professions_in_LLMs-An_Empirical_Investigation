The rusty tang of dawn hung heavy in the air, a metallic scent mingling with the petrichor rising from the still-damp shingles. Elias Thorne, his knees already protesting the coming climb, perched on the edge of Mrs. Petrov's porch roof, the slate-grey expanse stretching out before him like a petrified ocean. Below, the sleepy town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was slowly blinking awake. Thin ribbons of smoke curled from chimneys, and the distant clang of a cowbell echoed across the valley. Elias adjusted his tool belt, the familiar weight a comforting presence against the creeping chill.  This was his domain, this precarious world of peaks and valleys, a place where the only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic hammering of his own heart. Today's task was a simple repair, a few slipped slates near the chimney, but Mrs. Petrov's house was the oldest in Oakhaven, its roof steep and treacherous, a testament to a time when things were built to last, and men like Elias were expected to do the same.
