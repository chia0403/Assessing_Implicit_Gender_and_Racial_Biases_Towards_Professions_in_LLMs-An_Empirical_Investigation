The rusty squeak of the screen door announced the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, her floral perfume preceding her like a herald. Elias Thorne, his full name rarely spoken aloud in the small town of Harmony Creek, adjusted his spectacles and plastered a welcoming smile on his face.  Harmony Creek, nestled in a forgotten fold of the Appalachian Mountains, was a place where time seemed to slow down, mirroring the languid pace of the Harmony River as it meandered through the valley. Elias's barbershop, a squat, clapboard building sandwiched between a dusty feed store and a perpetually closed antique shop, was its own little pocket of stillness. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting aroma that spoke of tradition and routine.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked window, illuminated the worn leather barber chair, a relic of a bygone era.  This was Elias's domain, a space where he held court, trimming the town's anxieties and gossip along with its hair.
