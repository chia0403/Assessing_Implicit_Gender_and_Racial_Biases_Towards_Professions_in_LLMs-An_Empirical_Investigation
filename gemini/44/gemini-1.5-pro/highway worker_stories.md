The sun, a molten orange eye in the pre-dawn sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cracked asphalt of Interstate 80. Dew clung to the brittle weeds pushing through the verge, and the air, still crisp with the remnants of night, hummed with the low thrum of distant eighteen-wheelers.  This was Amelia Reyes’s domain. Not the sleek, climate-controlled cabs of the trucks hauling goods across the country, but the rough edges, the forgotten spaces, the miles of concrete and steel that kept it all connected.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back beneath a fluorescent orange safety vest, adjusted her thick work gloves and squinted at the pothole yawning before her. It was a deep one, a jagged maw in the highway’s surface, and Amelia, armed with a shovel and a bucket of asphalt patch, was its only adversary. Eastbound traffic was still light, a trickle of early commuters, but Amelia knew the morning rush was coming, a steel river of sedans and SUVs that would turn this stretch of I-80 into a roaring torrent.  And this pothole, if left untended, would be a hazard, a jarring interruption to their smooth, predictable journeys.
