The chipped porcelain sink, stained a delicate shade of rust from years of neglect, reflected the flickering gaslight back into Elara Celeste Moreau's weary eyes. The cramped dressing room, tucked away behind the velvet curtain of "The Serpent's Kiss" – a dimly lit speakeasy nestled in the heart of 1920s New Orleans – reeked of cheap gin and stale cigarette smoke. A single, bare bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling cast elongated shadows that danced across the peeling wallpaper adorned with faded images of burlesque dancers. Outside, the muffled cacophony of clinking glasses, drunken laughter, and the rhythmic pulse of jazz bled through the thin walls. Elara, her crimson lips a stark contrast against her porcelain skin, adjusted the beaded fringe of her flapper dress, a nervous flutter in her stomach. Tonight was her debut at The Serpent’s Kiss, and the weight of her dreams, fragile as a butterfly's wing, rested upon the notes she was about to sing.
