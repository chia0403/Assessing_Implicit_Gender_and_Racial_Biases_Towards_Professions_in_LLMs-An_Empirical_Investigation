The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&L Architectural firm buzzed in a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of graphite on vellum. Amelia Reyes, her brow furrowed in concentration, hunched over a sprawling blueprint of the proposed Riverside Community Center. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the brick buildings of downtown Ashton, painting the cityscape in hues of burnt orange and deep violet.  A fine layer of dust coated the drafting table, a testament to Amelia's dedication to her craft. The air hung thick with the scent of aging paper, pencil shavings, and the faint metallic tang of the old blueprint machine humming in the corner. It was a familiar, comforting smell â€“ the aroma of creation.  This was Amelia's world, a world of precise lines, meticulous measurements, and the quiet satisfaction of bringing architectural dreams to life, one painstaking detail at a time. But tonight, something felt different. A strange unease prickled at the edges of her awareness, a feeling she couldn't quite place, like a forgotten line in a crucial drawing.
