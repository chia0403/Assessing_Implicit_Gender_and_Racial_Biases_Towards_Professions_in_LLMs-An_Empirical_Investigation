The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she perched precariously on the black volcanic rocks of El Hierro, the smallest of the Canary Islands. The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the churning Atlantic, cast long, dramatic shadows across the jagged coastline.  Amelia, her dark hair whipping around her in the wind, adjusted the tripod supporting her vintage Hasselblad.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and something subtly volcanic, vibrated with the ceaseless roar of the ocean crashing against the basalt cliffs. She was searching for the perfect shot, the one that would capture the raw, untamed beauty of this forgotten corner of the world, the one that would finally launch her career beyond the confines of wedding photography and into the realm of fine art.  This trip, funded by a small grant and a lot of ramen noodles, was her chance, her everything.
