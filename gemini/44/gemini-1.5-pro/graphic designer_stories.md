The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau, plastering stray strands of her vibrant purple hair across her face.  She tugged her scarf tighter, the rough wool scratching against her chin, and hurried down Bleecker Street, the aroma of roasted chestnuts and woodsmoke swirling around her. Greenwich Village, normally a vibrant tapestry of artists and eccentrics, felt muted beneath the steel-grey sky.  Cassie’s breath puffed out in white clouds as she clutched her portfolio case, its edges digging into her gloved hand.  Tonight was the opening of her exhibition at the quirky, yet influential,  "Kaleidoscope Gallery," a space tucked between a vintage bookstore and a dimly lit jazz club.  Three years of freelance hustling, late nights fueled by lukewarm coffee, and the constant hum of self-doubt had led to this moment.  And yet, instead of the exhilarating rush of anticipation she’d expected, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest.  This wasn't just another client presentation; this was *her* work, her vision, laid bare for the world to judge.
