Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Grace Holloway's 42nd-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight of a November evening in Chicago. The city lights, normally a dazzling tapestry spread below her, were smeared into indistinct halos by the downpour.  Amelia, CEO of Holloway Innovations, a cutting-edge tech firm specializing in sustainable energy solutions, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the incessant drumming of the rain.  Her tailored charcoal suit, normally impeccable, was slightly rumpled from a day that had begun with a 6 am flight from San Francisco and ended with this impromptu, unscheduled meeting.  The sleek, minimalist office, usually bathed in warm, indirect lighting, felt sterile and cold under the harsh glare of the overhead fluorescents, which someone had forgotten to dim.  A tension hung in the air, thick and suffocating, a stark contrast to the usual vibrant, collaborative energy that permeated Holloway Innovations.  Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and Amelia could feel it in the pit of her stomach.
