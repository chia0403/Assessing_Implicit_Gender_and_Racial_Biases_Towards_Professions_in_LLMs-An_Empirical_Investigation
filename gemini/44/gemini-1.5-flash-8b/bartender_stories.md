The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly green glow over Elias Thorne, the bartender.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of the city's heartbeat outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation.  The small, dimly lit bar was a haven for the city's forgotten â€“ the weary travelers, the down-on-their-luck hustlers, the souls lost in the labyrinthine alleys of late-night New Haven.  Elias, a man carved from granite and haunted by the stories whispered on every empty shot glass, poured another whiskey.  He didn't hear the soft chime of the bell above the door, only the insistent drip-drip-drip of the leaky faucet, a sound that seemed to mock the silent drama playing out before him.
