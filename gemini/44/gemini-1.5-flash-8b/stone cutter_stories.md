The wind, a rasping, icy hand, clawed at Elias Thorne’s exposed cheeks as he carved.  Dust, the colour of a winter sky, swirled around him, coating his leather apron and clinging to the rough-hewn stone block before him.  He was a stone cutter, a sculptor of the earth itself, working in the shadowed valley of the Grey Peaks, a place where the sun rarely dared to peek beyond the jagged mountain teeth.  The air, thin and biting, hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Granite, the heart of the peaks, lay exposed in the valley floor.  His hammer, a familiar weight in his calloused hand, echoed against the stone, a rhythmic pulse in the desolate landscape.  He was alone, save for the screech of ravens circling high above and the ceaseless whisper of the wind.  His workshop, a rudimentary shelter carved from the very stone he sculpted, offered little warmth against the relentless cold.  The flickering lamplight cast long, dancing shadows on the rough-hewn walls. Elias, despite the biting wind and the harsh solitude, felt a familiar satisfaction.  The stone, a silent, stubborn thing, yielded to his patient touch. This particular block, destined for the façade of a new abbey nestled in the shadowed valley, held a challenge. It demanded a certain grace, a subtle narrative whispered within its impenetrable heart.
