The flickering neon sign of "Plumber Pete's Pipes & Problems" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water, the very substance Bartholomew "Barty" Pipkin was supposed to master, pooled in puddles reflecting the fractured light like shattered glass.  Barty, a man whose physique seemed sculpted from the very copper he worked with, hunched beneath a leaky fire escape, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The faint, metallic tang of copper mingled with the acrid scent of mildew and something else, something vaguely sweet and sickeningly familiar.  He traced the source of the drip, a stubborn, persistent leak emanating from a section of pipe hidden behind a tangle of ivy that had somehow managed to claw its way up the crumbling brickwork.  The building, the dilapidated tenement known as the "Whispering Walls," loomed above him, a symphony of creaking timbers and sighing wind.  Barty swore he could hear whispers within its decaying heart. This wasn't just a plumbing job; it feltâ€¦ significant.
