The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent hum of the office, reflecting the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of 14B.  Amelia Penelope Featherstone, a woman whose sharp, tailored suit seemed almost out of place in this beige-and-brown mausoleum of a building, meticulously filed a stack of invoices.  Each numbered slip, a brittle whisper of a transaction, felt like a small, silent rebellion against the relentless monotony of her day.  The rhythmic clack of her typewriter, a relic from a bygone era, echoed faintly in the vast emptiness of the accounting department, punctuated only by the low, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of the old-fashioned air conditioning unit, a constant reminder of the suffocating heat.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of horns and sirens a million miles away from the sterile, predictable hum within. Amelia’s world, for the time being, was contained within these four walls, the silent, paper-laden kingdom of Mr. Grimshaw’s accounting empire.
