Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Lucky Clover Insurance" office, a building as weathered and worn as the small town of Oakhaven itself.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of weak afternoon sunlight filtering through the grime-coated windows.  Agnes Periwinkle, insurance agent extraordinaire (a title she bestowed upon herself with quiet conviction), hunched over her worn, oak desk.  A half-eaten sandwich of questionable origin sat beside a mountain of meticulously organized claim forms, each one a testament to the fragility of human endeavour and the inevitable demands of life's unpredictable nature.  Agnes, a woman whose silver hair seemed to absorb the ambient gloom, traced a delicate fingertip along the chipped edge of a file labelled "The Barrington Catastrophe of '29."  The relentless drumming outside mirrored the relentless ticking of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner, a silent metronome marking the passage of time, time that Agnes, in her quiet office, felt racing against her deadlines.  Her job – securing the future of Oakhaven’s inhabitants, one meticulously crafted policy at a time – was more challenging than ever.
