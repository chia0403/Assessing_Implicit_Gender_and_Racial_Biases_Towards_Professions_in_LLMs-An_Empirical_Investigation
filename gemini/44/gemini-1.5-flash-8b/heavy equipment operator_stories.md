The rhythmic clang of the excavator's bucket, a percussive tattoo against the bruised landscape, was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  He'd been humming along to it for the better part of a decade.  The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the abandoned quarry, turning the dust motes dancing in the air into miniature fireflies.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and simmering earth, hung heavy, a suffocating blanket.  Elias, a man sculpted from years of sun and grit, squinted at the yawning chasm before him.  He was meticulously clearing the last remnants of a collapsed section of the quarry wall, a task as arduous as it was pointless, an exercise in futility performed by a man determined to tame the untamed.  This wasn't just a quarry anymore; it was a graveyard.  A forgotten graveyard of dreams buried beneath mountains of shattered rock.


The setting:  The abandoned Blackwood Quarry, a forgotten expanse of scarred earth and crumbling concrete, nestled deep within the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  Years of extraction had left the area pockmarked and desolate.  The once-proud mountains, now scarred and etched, whispered tales of extraction and neglect in the biting winds that swept through the valley.  Scattered amongst the rubble were the ghosts of a past industry, rusting machinery, and the occasional broken piece of equipment, silently bearing witness to the quarry's decline.
