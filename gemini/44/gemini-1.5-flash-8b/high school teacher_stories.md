The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of a pen against a worn textbook.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating the faded posters advertising Shakespearean plays and the faded, slightly-off-kilter, motivational quotes.  Eleventh-grade English.  Another Tuesday. Another battle against the encroaching lethargy of the pre-winter afternoon.  Ms. Vance, a woman whose auburn hair, usually pulled back in a severe bun, was today haphazardly cascading around her shoulders, sighed inwardly.  Today's lesson, "Macbeth," was proving particularlyâ€¦challenging.  Her students, a motley crew of future doctors, lawyers, and perhaps, a few aspiring musicians, seemed more interested in their phones than their iambic pentameter.  The air in the classroom hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  This wasn't just about Shakespeare; it felt like a battle for their attention, their engagement, their very souls.  And she was losing.
