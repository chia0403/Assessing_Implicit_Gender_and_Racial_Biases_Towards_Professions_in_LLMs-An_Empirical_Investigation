The biting wind whipped across the exposed fields of the Yorkshire Dales, stinging Amelia Blackwood’s cheeks as she surveyed her latest project.  Below, nestled amongst the grey stone walls of the sprawling, centuries-old manor known as Oakhaven, lay a riot of colour: a meticulously crafted border of lavender, rosemary, and thyme, interspersed with splashes of scarlet poppies. Amelia, clad in a waterproof jacket that seemed to cling to her like a second skin, adjusted her thick wool scarf, the faint scent of earth and damp wool filling her nostrils.  Oakhaven, perched on a precarious outcrop overlooking the valley, seemed to defy the relentless wind, its stone facade as solid and ancient as the hills themselves.  Amelia, a landscaper with a keen eye for detail and a heart as resilient as the native Yorkshire stone, was preparing to confront the final challenge of this demanding season. The manor, and its notoriously demanding owner, Lord Ashworth, had called for a new orchard to be planted – a task that promised to be far more daunting than simply arranging a few colourful borders.
