The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's dental office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Hayes's instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a meticulous approach and an ever-present smile, meticulously cleaned the patient's teeth, her movements precise and purposeful.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the muted tones of the waiting room – a stark contrast to the vibrant hues of the dental charts and colourful posters promoting healthy smiles.  Amelia’s focused eyes, usually sparkling with an infectious energy, were dulled today, reflecting the accumulating anxieties building in her chest.  The waiting room, typically a place of hushed whispers and the faint scent of antiseptic, felt oppressive. Today, it held a palpable tension.  Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Grace Hayes, felt it acutely.  It wasn't the patient's unease; it was a deeper, more unsettling weight that clung to the air like the lingering aroma of freshly brewed coffee.  Her own anxieties were the unwelcome guest. She was a dedicated dental hygienist, but the mounting stress was starting to gnaw at her, pushing her beyond her comfort zone.  The quiet murmur of the dental equipment was all she could hear, a solitary lullaby in the symphony of worry playing out in her mind.
