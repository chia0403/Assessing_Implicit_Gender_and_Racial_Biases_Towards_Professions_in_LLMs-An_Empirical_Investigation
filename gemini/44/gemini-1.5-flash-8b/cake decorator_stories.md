The scent of buttercream and toasted almonds hung heavy in the air, a comforting fog that swirled around Amelia Butterfield, clinging to her threadbare apron and the intricate sugar roses she meticulously sculpted.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window of her tiny bakery, "Sugar Rush," nestled in the shadowed alleyway behind the Grand Theatre.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia's hands as she painstakingly piped a delicate filigree border onto a bride and groom cake.  Tonight's order was particularly demanding: a three-tiered confection representing the crest of the aristocratic Blackwood family, adorned with a painstakingly recreated heraldic eagle.  Amelia hadn't slept well since the order arrived.  The pressure, palpable in the damp air, was a heavy weight on her shoulders.  She'd dreamt of cakes before, but never one imbued with such lineage.  Each tiny detail felt burdened with the expectation of perfection; each sugar flower, each delicately iced petal a testament to the family's esteemed history. And tonight, she would decide if she was worthy of bearing its weight, too.
