The flickering fluorescent lights of the city newsroom hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Blackwood’s anxieties.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the Herald-Post, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The year was 2042.

The city itself, through the window, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the next seismic shift in the digital ether.
