Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the fire station, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Captain Amelia Hayes's heart.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the cramped, smoke-stained dispatch area.  Outside, the city of Veridia, nestled between the towering peaks of the Obsidian Mountains and the shimmering expanse of the Azure Sea, was swallowed by a pre-dawn gloom.  Amelia, her face etched with the weariness of countless nights and the faint scent of acrid smoke clinging to her uniform, stared at the flashing red light on the console.  Dispatch was callingâ€”again.  This time, the location: The Whispering Pines, a dilapidated Victorian mansion rumored to be haunted, nestled deep within the city's oldest, most overgrown district.  The call indicated a possible electrical fire.  Yet, for Amelia, the familiar scent of ozone and burning wood, the guttural roar of the engine, and the adrenaline surge that always accompanied a call were tinged with an unsettling premonition.  The old house, known locally for its unsettling stories and mysterious history, always seemed to attract the worst of Veridia's misfortunes.
