The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual caramel, reflected the harsh fluorescent hum of the kitchen.  Dust motes, tiny specks of forgotten afternoons, danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window.  Amelia Peabody, her calico apron tied securely at her waist, scrubbed at a stubborn ring of coffee around the rim of the chipped mug.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale croissants and the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of lavender â€“ a remnant of Mrs. Ainsworth's beloved, but now sadly neglected, floral arrangements.  Amelia sighed, a sound swallowed by the echoing emptiness of the grand, yet strangely desolate, Victorian mansion.

The house, known as Blackwood Manor, stood perched precariously on a hill overlooking the town of Ashbrook.  Ivy, thick and tenacious, clawed its way up the stone walls, obscuring ancient carvings and whispering secrets in the wind.  Grey skies, perpetually bruised with the promise of rain, mirrored the mood of the house itself.  The creaks and groans of the aging structure were a constant, unsettling soundtrack to Amelia's solitary existence.  Each shadowed hallway, each dust-laden bookshelf, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for some long-forgotten tragedy to unfold.
