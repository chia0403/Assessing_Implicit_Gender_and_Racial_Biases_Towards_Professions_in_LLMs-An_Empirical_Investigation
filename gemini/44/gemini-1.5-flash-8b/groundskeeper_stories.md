The chipped paint of the gazebo, once a vibrant cerulean, now clung to the weathered wood like a decaying shroud.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the grounds.  Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield, groundskeeper for the sprawling Blackwood Manor, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  Dead leaves, the remnants of a recent storm, lay scattered across the meticulously manicured lawn, a testament to the relentless cycle of nature.  His calloused hands, stained a perpetual terracotta, were dusted with the same autumnal debris. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Barty, a comforting hum in the symphony of Blackwood Manor.

The setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the whispering woods of the English countryside.  Grey stone walls, kissed by centuries of moss and ivy, wound around the property, obscuring much of the sprawling grounds.  The manor itself, a imposing structure of dark grey stone, sat perched atop a small hill, its numerous gothic-style windows reflecting the ever-shifting light.  A network of winding paths and meticulously kept gardens, filled with exotic flowers and rare shrubs, stretched out before Barty, each a silent testament to the meticulous upkeep he provided.  Whispers of the manor's history, of powerful families and hidden secrets, clung to the very air, adding an almost palpable tension to the otherwise serene landscape.
