The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, clawed at Elara Nightingale's worn leather tunic.  Each gust whipped snow into stinging needles against her face, mirroring the icy dread that settled in her gut.  The sprawling, grey fortress of Aethelgard, perched precariously on the jagged peaks of the Frostfang Mountains, seemed to groan under the weight of the blizzard.  Towering spires, etched with frost and shadowed by swirling clouds, pierced the sky like skeletal fingers.  Twisted, gnarled trees, their branches laced with frozen icicles, formed a menacing border around the fortress walls.  Elara, a seasoned guard of the Royal Order, shivered not from the cold but from the growing sense of foreboding that pressed in on her.  The air, usually thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke, was now choked with the acrid tang of something else... something unnatural.  The rhythmic pounding of her boots on the frozen stone echoed strangely in the oppressive silence, punctuated only by the howl of the wind.  She was stationed at the northernmost gate, the one that faced the cursed Whisperwind Pass, a place whispered to be haunted by the restless spirits of forgotten kings and the chilling whispers of the approaching winter.
