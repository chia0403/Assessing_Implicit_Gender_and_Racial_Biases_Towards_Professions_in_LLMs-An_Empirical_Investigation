The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Slightly Overpriced" department store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Peabody's meticulously planned day.  Amelia, a junior sales associate in the Home Furnishings department, hated fluorescent lights.  She found the sterile, glare-inducing glow grating on her nerves, mirroring the sterile, pre-packaged feeling of the products she sold.  Today, she was focused on the new "Zenith" line of modular sofas, a collection of beige and taupe pieces that promised relaxation but felt eerily devoid of soul.

The setting was a sprawling, cavernous section of the store, designed with an almost industrial efficiency.  Rows upon rows of identical display units, each showcasing a meticulously arranged array of seemingly interchangeable sofas, filled the space.  The air, thick with the faint scent of fabric softener and something vaguely chemical, hung heavy.  Sunlight, filtered weakly through the enormous store windows, cast long, distorted shadows over the displays, making the beige pieces appear even more bland.  The relentless rhythmic thrum of the HVAC system underscored the inescapable monotony of Amelia's existence.
