The scent of lavender and freshly pressed linen hung heavy in the air of Elias Thornewood's workshop, a fragrant counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of his sewing machine.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the high, arched windows of "Thorne's Threads," a tiny shop tucked between a bustling bakery and a melancholic antique shop on the cobbled side streets of  Old Oakhaven.  Elias, a tailor of meticulous precision and quiet renown, meticulously pinned a delicate lace collar to a silk gown, the intricate pattern reflecting the light in a kaleidoscope of shimmering hues.  Heâ€™d been working on this commission for Lady Beatrice Ashworth for weeks, her extravagant demands a constant challenge to his patience.  But this gown, the culmination of countless hours and careful handwork, felt different.  There was an unnerving energy surrounding it, a subtle hum of expectation that seemed to resonate from the very fabric itself.  Outside, the city buzzed with its usual cacophony of horse-drawn carriages, street vendors, and the cheerful chatter of the locals, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within the small tailor shop.
