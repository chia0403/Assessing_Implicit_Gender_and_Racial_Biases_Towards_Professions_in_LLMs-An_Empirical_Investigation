The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Institute hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the silent, echoing corridors.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated window of the janitor's closet.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his worn, navy blue uniform straining against his slightly paunchy frame, meticulously scrubbed a stubborn stain from the linoleum floor.  The stain, a peculiar shade of iridescent purple, stubbornly refused to yield to his elbow grease, mirroring the enigma that was the Zenith Institute itself.  

The institute, a towering obsidian monolith situated atop a windswept plateau, seemed to absorb all sound and light.  Jagged edges of the building, stark against the perpetually overcast sky, seemed to bite at the edges of the world.  Narrow, winding hallways, lined with silent, empty offices and sterile laboratories, snaked through the labyrinthine structure, leaving Barty feeling perpetually disoriented.  He'd been the institute's sole janitor for seven years, and yet, he still felt as if he were navigating a foreign country, each day uncovering new and disturbing details about the enigmatic research conducted within.
