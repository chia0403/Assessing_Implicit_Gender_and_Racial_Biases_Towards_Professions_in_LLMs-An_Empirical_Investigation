The fluorescent hum of the server room vibrated through Alistair Finch's worn sneakers.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh white light, danced in the air like tiny, spectral gnats.  Alistair Finch, Systems Analyst III at the sprawling multinational corporation, ZenithCorp, wasn't impressed.  He'd seen this particular server rack, with its tangled network cables and overheating fans, a hundred times.  It hummed with the same monotonous, predictable energy as the endless reports he was expected to churn out.

Setting:

The server room at ZenithCorp headquarters was a cavernous space, a concrete cathedral dedicated to the digital pulse of the corporation.  Rows upon rows of server racks, each containing an intricate web of wires and humming hardware, stretched into the gloom.  The air hung heavy with the smell of burnt circuits and ozone, a scent Alistair had come to associate with the relentless demands of his job.  Large, flickering monitors displayed a dizzying array of data streams, their lights reflecting off the sweat beading on Alistair's forehead.  Beyond the server room, the vast expanse of ZenithCorp's headquarters shimmered under the fluorescent glow, a labyrinth of brightly lit hallways and windowless offices that felt as isolating as the server room itself.
