The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air of Amelia Hawthorne's workshop, a tiny, sun-drenched space tucked between a cobbled alley and a bustling market square.  Dust motes danced in the golden afternoon light filtering through the small, arched window, illuminating the intricate patterns laid out across Amelia's meticulously polished work table.  Sketches of gowns, ethereal and opulent, lay beside piles of silk, velvet, and lace, their vibrant colours a stark contrast to the muted grey of the rough-hewn wooden walls.  Amelia, a woman of quiet grace with eyes the colour of polished amethysts, carefully pinned a delicate sprig of jasmine to a shimmering brocade swatch.  The soft chime of a distant church bell echoed through the narrow streets, a gentle counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of her sewing machine, a relic of a more modern age that she nevertheless valued for its swiftness.  It was a Wednesday, and the air thrummed with the energy of a market day about to begin.
