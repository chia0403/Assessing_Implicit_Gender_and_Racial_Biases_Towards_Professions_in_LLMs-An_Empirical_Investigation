Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating splinters of wood, half-finished projects, and the glint of sweat on his brow.

Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that gave the town its name, a colossal sentinel against the stormy sky, seemed to mock his struggles.  Oakhaven itself, nestled deep within the misty valleys of the Appalachian Mountains, was a place of quiet desperation, where time seemed to slow to a glacial pace, mirroring the methodical pace of Elias's work.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, and the distant rumble of thunder echoed the storm brewing inside Elias.
