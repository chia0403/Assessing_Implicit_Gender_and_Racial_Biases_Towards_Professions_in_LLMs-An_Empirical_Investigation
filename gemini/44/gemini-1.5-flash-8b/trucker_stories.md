The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Dakotas, stinging Amelia "Ace" Blackwood's cheeks as she fought the steering wheel of her rig, the "Iron Horse."

The radio crackled with static, a soundtrack to the silence that gnawed at the edges of her consciousness, echoing the gnawing emptiness inside.  This wasn't just a delivery. It was a confrontation.
