The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale’s coat around her legs as she navigated the treacherous path leading to the Whispering Woods Animal Sanctuary.  Grey clouds, thick as a flock of ravens, obscured the already dim afternoon light, painting the ancient oaks in somber hues of grey and bruised purple.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth, usually comforting, felt tinged with a foreboding chill this particular day. Amelia, a dedicated animal caretaker at the sanctuary for the past five years, knew this feeling – a premonition of something amiss.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the whispering woods, was a haven for creatures both large and small, a patchwork of enclosures and meticulously maintained habitats.  Today, however, the usual symphony of chirps, squawks, and gentle snuffles was muted, almost silent.  This unsettling quiet gnawed at her, a feeling like a growing shadow.
