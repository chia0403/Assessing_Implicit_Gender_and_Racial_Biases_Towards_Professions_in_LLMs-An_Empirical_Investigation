Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the hospice, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic beating of Elara Nightingale's heart.

Elara, her name a whisper of fragile hope against the backdrop of suffering, felt the weight of the night pressing down on her.  Each cough, each labored breath, each whispered plea, resonated with an unspoken urgency.  Tonight, she was on the third night of a particularly challenging shift.
