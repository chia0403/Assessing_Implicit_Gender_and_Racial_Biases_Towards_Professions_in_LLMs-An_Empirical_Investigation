The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Penny Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's rain-slicked trench coat.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and frying onions, hung heavy in the pre-dawn chill.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm pounding in Izzy's temples.  This, she thought, was exactly the kind of night she dreaded.  The kind where the quiet murmur of the city became a cacophony of unspoken fears.  

The diner, a dilapidated landmark on the edge of the gritty, industrial district, was usually bustling with a motley crew of truck drivers and weary factory workers.  Tonight, however, only a lone figure hunched over a table in the back, shrouded in shadow, occupied the otherwise empty space.  Izzy, her breath fogging in the cold air, approached cautiously. The rhythmic thump of her boots on the cracked pavement was the only sound louder than the relentless rhythm of the rain.
