The fluorescent lights of the precinct’s interrogation room hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia “Amy” Sterling’s heart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a scene more oppressive than any forensic crime scene she’d ever encountered.  Across the scarred oak table, a young man named Leo Vance stared back at her, his eyes hollow, his gaze lost in a maelstrom of grief and fear.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and unspoken accusations, hung heavy with the weight of a case that had already consumed Amy for the last three days.

The precinct, a sprawling, beige behemoth of concrete and steel, seemed to swallow the city's anxieties whole.  Crumbling brick buildings, marked with graffiti and the ghosts of past lives, surrounded it like a jagged, worn perimeter.  The city, a concrete jungle with an undercurrent of despair, mirrored the fractured psyche of her client.  Amy's office, tucked away in a quiet corner of a building that had once housed a grand art gallery, was a stark contrast.  Filled with the reassuring weight of textbooks, charts, and a collection of antique pocket watches, it served as an island of order amidst the chaotic wave of despair that swept through the precinct and the wider city. Each meticulously organized item seemed to whisper stories of past cases, past lives, all a prelude to the work she had before her, the complex puzzle of Leo Vance.
