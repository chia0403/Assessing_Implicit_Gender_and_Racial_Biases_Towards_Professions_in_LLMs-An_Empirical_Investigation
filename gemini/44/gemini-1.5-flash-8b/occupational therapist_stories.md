The chipped paint of the therapy room walls, a faded teal that once held a promise of calm, now seemed to absorb the afternoon light, swallowing the faint buzzing of the fluorescent lights.  Amelia "Amy"  Parkinson, occupational therapist extraordinaire (and self-proclaimed "fixer-upper" of broken lives), surveyed the scene with a sigh that escaped as a quiet whoosh.  Seventeen-year-old Leo, slumped over a colourful, yet strangely lifeless, collection of clay and sculpting tools, stared blankly at the wall.  His brow was furrowed in frustration; the rhythmic tapping of his fingers against the table felt like a frantic drum solo.  Amyâ€™s meticulously organized office, usually a haven of calm activity, felt charged with a palpable tension. Today, the healing touch was going to be tougher than usual.

The setting was a small, but bustling, community centre on the outskirts of the city. The worn, linoleum floor of the therapy room reflected the dim light, the scent of lavender from Amy's diffuser doing little to mask the lingering smell of burnt clay. The windows, overlooking a small, neglected park, offered a glimpse of the city's vibrant pulse, but the quiet enclosure of the room emphasized the disconnect Leo seemed to carry.  The silence was thick with unspoken words and lingering frustration, a contrast to the vibrant murals and brightly coloured materials that adorned the room, designed to create an environment of comfort and empowerment.  Amy knew this particular case was going to test not only her therapeutic skills, but also her patience.
