The metallic tang of blood hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion to the pungent aroma of spices and roasting meat that wafted from the nearby stalls.  His sharp gaze, often lost in the contemplation of his craft, was currently focused on the subtle tremor in the pig's flank, a tremor that, even to Barty's discerning eye, felt just a littleâ€¦off.
