The sun, a molten coin in the bruised cerulean sky, beat down on Elias Thorne, Highway Maintenance Technician, as he wrestled with a stubborn bolt.  The desert wind, a relentless, whispering phantom, whipped dust devils around his ankles, stinging his eyes and coating everything in a fine, abrasive grit.  He was alone, miles from the nearest town, a speck of a roadside diner swallowed by the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Arizona desert.  The cracked asphalt of Route 66 stretched out before him, a ribbon of faded majesty snaking its way into the horizon.  His worn work boots crunched on the gravel shoulder, the rhythmic sound a counterpoint to the ceaseless symphony of the wind.   Elias, a man weathered as the old highway itself,  knew this stretch of road like the back of his calloused hand.  He'd seen it birth dreams and bury hopes, witness the passage of countless cars, and hold secrets whispered by the desert itself. Today, though, he felt a chill creeping up his spine, a feeling not quite connected to the desert's familiar heat. It felt... different.
