The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks.  She pulled her scarf tighter, the wool a meager barrier against the icy blast that howled across the desolate moorland.  The low, guttural growl of the wind mingled with the rhythmic, almost mournful, bleating of sheep lost somewhere in the grey mist.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Blackwood, veterinarian,  had spent the last hour trudging through this unforgiving landscape, searching for the missing flock.  Her battered, four-wheel-drive Land Rover, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," sat abandoned a short distance away, swallowed by the thickening fog.  The air, already thick with the scent of peat and damp earth, hung heavy with a premonition of trouble.

**Setting:** The rugged, windswept moorlands of the Scottish Highlands, a region steeped in legend and shrouded in perpetual twilight, particularly during the late autumn.  A harsh beauty, where vast, empty landscapes meet the turbulent skies, and ancient secrets are whispered on the wind.
