The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a dissonant counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Hayes's heart.  The sterile white walls seemed to press in, claustrophobic and unforgiving, reflecting the anxious faces and the frantic murmurs that filled the air.  Outside, a howling wind rattled the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within the small, overcrowded waiting area.  Amelia, a seasoned Emergency Medical Care Technician with three years under her belt, adjusted her worn but trusty stethoscope, the familiar weight a comfort against the mounting pressure.  Tonight was already shaping up to be a nightmarish affair, a stark contrast to the predictable, albeit demanding, rhythm of the days she'd become accustomed to.  

The setting:  The bustling, understaffed emergency room of the St. Jude's Regional Hospital in the perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven. Snow had begun to fall, coating the already grim streets in a layer of white, and the wind whipped across the landscape, mirroring the chaotic energy inside the hospital. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and fear, a peculiar blend that had become strangely familiar to Amelia.  St. Jude's was a vital resource for the town, yet always felt dangerously close to collapse under the strain of its surroundings.
