The wind howled a mournful dirge against the skeletal frame of the abandoned church, rattling the loose shingles that clung precariously to the roof.  Rain lashed down, blurring the already dim light filtering through the fractured stained-glass windows.  Elias Thorne, his weathered face obscured by the brim of his worn, rain-soaked hat, clung to the treacherous pitch of the crumbling edifice.  He was, as always, several feet higher than anyone would ever feel comfortable, the cold, damp stone a constant reminder of the precariousness of his profession.  Below, the city roaredâ€”a symphony of sirens and distant car horns, completely oblivious to the silent, perilous dance Elias performed on the rooftop.  His hands, gnarled and scarred, worked with surprising deftness, repairing the ravaged wooden supports that held the roof together.  This wasn't just a job for Elias; it was a dance, a communion with the very skeleton of the old world.  The city sprawled beneath him, a tapestry of gleaming glass towers and shadowed alleys, the constant hum of life a stark contrast to the decaying majesty of the church.  He was a part of both, a silent guardian of the city's hidden scars.
