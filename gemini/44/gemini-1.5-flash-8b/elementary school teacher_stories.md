Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic drumming in her chest.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and something subtly sweet, like decaying leaves.  Outside, the once vibrant autumn colours of the schoolyard had dulled to muted greys and browns, reflecting the gloom that settled over the small, rural town of Oakhaven.  Eleanor, a fifth-grade teacher with a perpetually hopeful smile that felt strained today, stared out the window.  The familiar rhythmic patter of the rain, usually a soothing lullaby, felt menacing.  She’d never seen it rain this hard this late in the season.  Something felt…off.  The usual boisterous energy of the children, their laughter and chatter echoing from the halls, was muted, replaced by an unnerving stillness.  And a whisper. A faint, persistent whisper that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves.
