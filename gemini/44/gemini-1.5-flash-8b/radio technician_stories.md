The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned broadcast station hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crackle of static emanating from Amelia "Milly"  Fitzwilliam's workbench.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a tangle of wires, capacitors, and ancient tubes that seemed to writhe and sigh with unspoken histories.  Milly, her brow furrowed in concentration, traced a greasy finger along the etched markings of a vintage amplifier.  The year was 1987.  The faded grandeur of the station, once the heart of the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven's broadcasting life, was now a testament to the shifting sands of technology.  Abandoned for over a decade, the building had become a haven for bats and whispered rumours.  A network of rusted pipes snaked through the decaying walls, their echoes echoing the ghosts of broadcasts past â€“  the jaunty saxophone of the local jazz band, the comforting cadence of the nightly news, the children's choir serenading their way through "Silent Night." Milly was the only one who still cared to listen.
