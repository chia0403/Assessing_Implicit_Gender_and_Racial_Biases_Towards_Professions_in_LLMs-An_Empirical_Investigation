The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the worn leather of her armchair and the half-eaten bowl of granola sitting beside a stack of clinical manuals. Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with ten years of experience treating trauma victims, stared out at the rain-slicked streets of Portland, Oregon.  The city, a tapestry of vibrant street art and hidden alleyways, held a tension she recognized all too well.  It was a city that whispered secrets in the wind, secrets that often found their way into the minds and hearts of the people she treated.

The setting:  a cluttered, yet strangely comforting, office on a side street in Portland, Oregon.  The city's gray skies and constant drizzle seemed to mirror the atmosphere of quiet desperation that often permeated her patients' lives.  The room, while functional, held a faint aroma of old paper and lavender, the scent subtly masking the lingering traces of anxiety and fear.  Eleanor's life – both professional and personal – was a delicate balance between navigating the complexities of the human psyche and maintaining her own fragile equilibrium.  Today, a new patient, a young woman named Anya Petrova, was scheduled to arrive, and Eleanor felt a familiar knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach.
