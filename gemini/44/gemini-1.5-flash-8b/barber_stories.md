The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual sepia by years of lukewarm water and forgotten soaps, reflected Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield's anxious face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of "The Clipper's Edge," a barbershop nestled on the shadowed side of Oakhaven Street.  Cobwebs, thick as spun sugar, draped from the faded floral wallpaper, their dusty tendrils brushing against the brass-rimmed mirrors.  The scent of stale coffee and faded lavender clung to the air, a familiar, if not entirely comforting, aroma of Barty's small, solitary kingdom.  Today, however, even the scent seemed heavier, more oppressive than usual.  His usual clientele—a mix of weathered farmers, gruff factory workers, and nervous businessmen—were absent.  The clatter of scissors, the rhythmic snip-snip of the clippers, the murmurs of gossip, all were silent, replaced by a suffocating stillness that mirrored the unease in Barty's chest.
