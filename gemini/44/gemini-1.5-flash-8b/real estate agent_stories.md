Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated agency, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia Hawthorne's chest.  The "Hawthorne Real Estate" sign, once gleaming gold, now faded and tarnished, seemed to mock her from above.  It had been three weeks since the market had collapsed, and the once-bustling office, located in the heart of the slowly decaying industrial district of Riverport, felt like a mausoleum.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak sunlight filtering through a grimy window.  Amelia, a woman whose vibrant energy usually bounced off the walls, felt as though she'd been flattened by the economic storm.

The year was 2024.  Riverport, once a thriving manufacturing hub, was now a forgotten relic of a bygone era.  Abandoned factories, choked by ivy and weeds, lined the streets, their skeletal frames whispering tales of lost jobs and shattered dreams.  The city's once proud waterfront was now choked with industrial runoff and litter, its shimmering skyline dulled by the oppressive grey of the perpetual rain.  Despite the gloom, Amelia, with her bright pink blazer and unwavering optimism, still clung to the hope that a single sale could spark a flicker of life back into this dying city.
