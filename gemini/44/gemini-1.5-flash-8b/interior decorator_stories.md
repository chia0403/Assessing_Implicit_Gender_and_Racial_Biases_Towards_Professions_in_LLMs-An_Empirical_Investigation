The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she navigated the narrow cobblestone streets of the Italian Riviera.  Sunlight, fractured by the ancient buildings, dappled the uneven pavement, painting the scene in a kaleidoscope of warm golds and cool blues.  Above, the scent of jasmine hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the sea just beyond the towering walls of the medieval town.  Amelia, a meticulous interior decorator with a penchant for vibrant colour and sophisticated simplicity, was on a mission.  Her latest client, a renowned art collector named Signor Rossi, had commissioned her to transform a centuries-old palazzo overlooking the Ligurian Sea into a gallery and residence, a breathtaking fusion of history and modern artistry.  The palazzo, with its faded frescoes and echoing halls, whispered stories of generations past, a silent testament to the region's rich heritage.  Amelia felt the weight of expectation, a tangible pressure against her chest, yet also an undeniable thrill. This project held the potential to redefine her career, to turn a crumbling relic into a masterpiece.  She traced the intricate carvings of a weathered doorway with a gloved hand, her mind already sketching possible layouts, envisioning the perfect interplay of light and shadow, form and function.
