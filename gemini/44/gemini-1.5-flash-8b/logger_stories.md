The biting wind, a relentless razor, whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed the scarred landscape.  The valley floor, once a tapestry of emerald green, now lay a patchwork of sun-baked earth and skeletal remains of ancient redwoods, their fallen giants scattered like forgotten toys.  Barty Blackwood, logger extraordinaire, or perhaps more accurately, logger *extraordinary* in his dogged determination, squinted at the towering peaks of the Cascade Range.  Snow, a persistent, icy shroud, clung to the higher elevations, a stark contrast to the parched, dusty earth below.  He was deep in the heart of the Oregon wilderness, a place where the wild still wrestled with the encroaching hand of industry, a place where silence often spoke volumes louder than any voice.  His worn leather boots crunched on the gravel path, the sound amplified by the raw stillness.  He was alone, as he often was, but not lonely. The forest, with its myriad of unseen creatures, was his companion, its rhythms a comforting counterpoint to the relentless grind of his work.
