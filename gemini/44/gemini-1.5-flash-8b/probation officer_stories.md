The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hayes's trench coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  The grey sky, bruised and threatening, mirrored the mood of the city â€“ a concrete jungle snarling in the pre-dawn gloom.  She adjusted the worn leather straps of her bag, the familiar weight of paperwork pressing against her side.  Her probation caseload, a tangle of troubled lives and broken promises, felt heavier than usual.  This particular Tuesday, a premonition, a knot of unease, clung to her like a second skin.  She was assigned to supervise two men:  a former petty thief named Julian "Jax"  Jackson, struggling with reintegration; and a brooding, enigmatic artist, Kael "The Shade"  Stone, accused of vandalism.

Amelia worked for the 24th Precinct Probation Department, a sprawling, antiquated building that stood on the cusp of the gentrifying uptown district.  The chipped paint on the facade and the echoing halls whispered of past successes and failures, of lives turned, and lives broken.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting the sterile white walls and the weary faces of the staff, huddled over mountains of paperwork. This particular office, a small cubicle off a long corridor, smelled faintly of stale coffee and despair.  Amelia, perpetually exhausted yet driven, stared at the file of Kael Stone, the name etched in stark print, as if the weight of his potential for trouble pressed down on the paper itself.
