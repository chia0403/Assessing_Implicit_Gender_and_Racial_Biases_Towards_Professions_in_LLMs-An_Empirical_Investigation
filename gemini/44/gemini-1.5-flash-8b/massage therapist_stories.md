The scent of lavender and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the tiny, sun-drenched storefront.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle hum of the old refrigerator tucked behind the counter.  This was Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's sanctuary, her haven carved from the bustling heart of the city, a small oasis of quiet amidst the clamour.  Amy, a massage therapist with hands as skilled as they were gentle, meticulously prepared her workstation.  Essential oils, each with its own whispered promise, lined the shelves â€“ sandalwood for serenity, chamomile for calm, rosemary for revitalisation.  The faint, almost imperceptible, click of her weighted blanket falling into place was the only sound besides the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Today, the quiet would be shattered.  A new client.  A new story.
