## Story Opening:

The incessant chirping of her phone sliced through the otherwise serene hum of the late-night city. Amelia Josephine Hayes groaned, burying her face further into the plush velvet cushions of her armchair. 2:47 AM. It had to be Mr. Abernathy. Who else would have the audacity to call at this ungodly hour?

Hesitantly, she reached for the offending device, her fingers tracing the cool, smooth glass. Every instinct screamed to ignore it, to return to the blissful oblivion of pre-caffeine exhaustion. But Abernathy was the kind of client who didn't take 'no answer' for an answer. He'd just call again, and again, and again until she surrendered.

With a weary sigh, Amelia answered. "Abernathy," she croaked, her voice thick with sleep.

"Amelia, darling! Thank goodness you're awake. I have aâ€¦ a slight alteration. Imperative, really."

Amelia closed her eyes, mentally steeling herself for the inevitable onslaught of demands. It was nights like these that made her question her career choice. Sometimes, the vibrant world of graphic design felt less like artistic expression and more like a slow descent into madness, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the incessant demands of clients who thought they were experts.
## Setting:

Amelia's apartment, a converted loft in the heart of Chicago's River North neighborhood, was a study in curated chaos. Exposed brick walls provided a raw, industrial backdrop to the meticulously arranged collection of vintage movie posters and quirky, handcrafted furniture. Sunlight, when it dared to peek through the towering skyscrapers outside, filtered through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

Tonight, however, the apartment was bathed in the cool, artificial glow of her oversized iMac. A half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat precariously on the edge of her drafting table, surrounded by scattered sketches, mood boards, and half-eaten takeout containers. The aroma of stale pizza mingled with the lingering scent of lavender essential oil, a desperate attempt at creating a calming atmosphere amidst the creative frenzy. Despite the apparent disarray, the apartment felt distinctly *Amelia*. It was a space where inspiration, exhaustion, and the remnants of a life lived fully and creatively coexisted.
