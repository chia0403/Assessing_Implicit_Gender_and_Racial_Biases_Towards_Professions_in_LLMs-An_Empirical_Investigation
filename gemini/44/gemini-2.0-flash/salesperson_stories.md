## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The condensation from Eleanor Vance's iced latte was already beading on the mahogany desk, threatening to leave a ring even deeper and more permanent than the ones her own backside had imprinted on the plush chair. Eleanor tapped a manicured fingernail against the laminated spreadsheet, the rhythmic click echoing the frantic pulse in her throat. Another quarter, another sales slump. The numbers were unforgiving, stark red against the crisp white background, and they screamed one thing: failure.

Eleanor sighed, the exhale rustling the wispy bangs that stubbornly refused to stay tucked behind her ear. She scrolled down, her eyes blurring over the names of potential clients, the promises she'd made, the deadlines she'd missed. "Just one big win, Eleanor," she muttered to herself, "that's all it takes." The problem was, "big wins" were rarer than unicorns these days, and Eleanor Vance, seasoned salesperson though she was, was starting to feel like she was chasing a ghost.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the open-plan office of "NovaTech Solutions," a mid-sized software company specializing in cloud-based data management systems for the healthcare industry. The office occupies the entire 12th floor of a modern glass-and-steel tower in downtown Boston. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer panoramic views of the harbor, but today, the view is obscured by a persistent, grey drizzle that seems to mirror Eleanor's mood.

The atmosphere is a mix of sterile corporate efficiency and forced camaraderie. Motivational posters with slogans like "Synergize!" and "Think Outside the Box!" adorn the walls, jarring against the cold, minimalist design. The air hums with the constant chatter of keyboards, ringing phones, and the occasional strained laughter emanating from the communal kitchen area, where someone is undoubtedly microwaving yesterday's leftovers. Eleanor's desk is located in a bustling section, surrounded by other salespeople, their individual personalities vying for attention amidst the corporate uniformity. Each desk is meticulously organized, a curated display of productivity and ambition, a stark contrast to the simmering anxiety that permeates the air.
