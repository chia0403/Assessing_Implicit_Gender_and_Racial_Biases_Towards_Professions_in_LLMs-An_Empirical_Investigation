**Setting:** The cavernous, dust-choked auditorium of the Grand Majestic Theatre, a faded jewel in the heart of Detroit's theatre district. The once opulent velvet seats are ripped and stained, the ornate plasterwork is crumbling, and the air hangs thick with the scent of decay and forgotten dreams. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grime-coated stained-glass windows, casting weak, fractured rainbows across the stage.

**Story Opening:**

A single, bare bulb swung precariously from the proscenium arch, casting elongated, dancing shadows across the vast, desolate stage. Theodore Bartholomew Finch, a man whose wiry frame and perpetually rumpled attire belied the tempest brewing inside him, stood center stage, arms crossed, surveying the scene with a mixture of despair and fierce determination. The silence was almost deafening, broken only by the occasional creak of the aging building and the frantic tap-tap-tapping of Theodore's worn leather boot against the warped floorboards.

He'd seen better days, the Grand Majestic had seen better days, and frankly, the entire city of Detroit had seen better days. But Theodore Finch, theatrical director extraordinaire (or at least, he had been, once upon a time), refused to succumb to the creeping malaise. This theatre, this neglected beauty, held a piece of his soul. And by God, he was going to resurrect it.

"Alright, you dilapidated old beauty," he muttered to the empty house, his voice echoing in the cavernous space. "Time to wake up. Time to shine again."
