## Story Opening:

The clatter of Mrs. Higgins’ bone-dry cough was the only music Beatrice Penelope Plum knew at 8:03 AM. It was the soundtrack to her professional life, a rhythmic prelude to another day of filing, phone calls, and the gnawing realization that she was destined for something more than alphabetizing invoices. This morning, however, the familiar rasp felt sharper, laced with an extra dose of something unpleasant. Beatrice imagined the microscopic dust bunnies swirling around Mrs. Higgins’ perpetually displeased nostrils, gathering strength and plotting a takeover of the office's already questionable air quality. Beatrice sighed, adjusting her sensible navy skirt and mentally rehearsing her 'sick day' excuses. Perhaps a touch of the dreaded 'Higgins Cough' was in her future, a convenient way out of today's mandatory office potluck.

## Setting:

The story unfolds within the claustrophobic confines of Higgins & Sons Plumbing Supplies, a family-run business stubbornly clinging to the ethos of the 1950s. Located on the gritty, industrial outskirts of Leeds, England, the office is a beige-on-beige symphony of despair. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a sickly glow on the chipped Formica desks and the overflowing in-trays. The air is thick with the scent of stale tea, dust, and the faint, lingering odor of pipe sealant. Yellowed calendars depicting scantily clad women wielding wrenches decorate the walls, relics from a bygone era that Mrs. Higgins, the matriarch and de facto manager, refuses to retire. Each desk is a miniature fortress, built from stacks of paperwork and guarded by a landline telephone with a coil that stretches like a tenacious vine. Outside the window, the grey sky mirrors the mood within, offering a panoramic view of a rusty scrap yard and the perpetually clogged drainpipes of a neighbouring factory. This is Beatrice Plum’s kingdom, her gilded cage, and she’s starting to feel decidedly ornithophobic.
