The morning air hung thick with the scent of diesel and damp earth. Sunlight, still bleary-eyed itself, struggled to penetrate the dust that perpetually clung to the air surrounding the construction site. The clanging symphony of steel on steel hadn't yet reached its full crescendo, but the low hum of generators and the guttural growl of excavators warming up already vibrated through the soles of Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley's worn leather work boots.

Bart stood on the edge of the nascent skyscraper's foundation, a thermos of lukewarm coffee warming his calloused hands. Below him, a gaping chasm waited to be filled with rebar and concrete, the beginnings of what would one day be the tallest building in the rapidly gentrifying district of Old Town, Chicago. He took a long, slow sip, the bitterness grounding him, and squinted up at the skeletal framework already reaching for the sky. He'd helped raise every one of those beams. Pride, a sentiment as solid and unshakeable as the concrete he poured, bloomed in his chest.

This was his city. He'd helped build it, brick by painstaking brick, since he was a kid sweeping floors for his Uncle Leo. And the "O'Malley Tower," as he jokingly referred to this project, was going to be his masterpiece. Even if it meant dealing with smug architects in their fancy spectacles and pushy developers obsessed with deadlines.

The setting: A bustling construction site in Old Town, Chicago, in the early morning hours, where the skeletal frame of a skyscraper under construction dominates the skyline. The site is a cacophony of heavy machinery, dust, and the nascent sounds of a workday about to erupt.
