The biting wind of a Montana January howled through the gaps in the corrugated metal roof of Rusty's Garage, a tune as familiar to Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley as the clang of a wrench on a stubborn bolt. Steam curled from the mug clutched in his grease-stained hands, a weak attempt to ward off the bone-chilling cold that permeated everything â€“ the metal, the concrete floor, even Bart's own weary bones.

Rusty's Garage wasn't much to look at. Situated on the outskirts of the small, forgotten town of Harmony Creek, it was a single, sprawling building that had probably seen its heyday sometime in the 1970s. The faded red paint peeled in strips, revealing patches of rust underneath. The windows were grimy and cracked, offering a distorted view of the snow-covered landscape. A graveyard of abandoned vehicles, their skeletons picked clean by time and the harsh elements, surrounded the garage like silent sentinels.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of oil, antifreeze, and the faint metallic tang of welding. Tools hung haphazardly on pegboards, their shadows dancing in the dim light cast by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling. Posters of classic cars and pin-up girls, faded and torn, adorned the walls, relics of a bygone era. Despite the disrepair, a sense of rugged functionality reigned supreme. This was Bart's domain, a place where he understood every creak, every groan, every stubborn nut and bolt. It was a place where he could breathe, even if the air was thick enough to choke on.

Tonight, however, the usual comfort was missing. Bart was staring out the cracked window, his gaze lost in the swirling snow, his brow furrowed with a worry that went deeper than the cold. Harmony Creek was a town that didn't offer much, but it was his town. And something felt deeply, profoundly wrong.
