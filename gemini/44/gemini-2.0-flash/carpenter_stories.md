The scent of pine sap and sawdust hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Barnaby Clement like a second skin. Outside, the October wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elms that ringed the old Carpenter's Yard. Inside, however, Barnaby found a small solace, a pocket of warmth and order amongst the approaching winter. He stood hunched over his workbench, the lamplight catching the fine lines etched around his kind blue eyes, illuminating the steady concentration etched on his face.

The Carpenter's Yard itself was a testament to a bygone era. A sprawling, ramshackle collection of weathered sheds and workshops, it had been in his family for generations, nestled in the heart of the sleepy village of Oakhaven, nestled at the foot of the Blackwood Mountains. The Yard was more than just a place of business; it was a repository of memories, a tangible link to his ancestors, each plank and beam whispering stories of the craft and the countless hands that had shaped them. Old tools hung neatly on the wall, each meticulously cared for, each bearing the patina of years of service. Sacks of nails and screws lined the shelves, arranged with a precision only a true craftsman could appreciate. It was a chaotic beauty, a symphony of wood and metal orchestrated by the unseen hand of time.

Barnaby Clement was known throughout Oakhaven for his skill and dedication. He wasn't just a carpenter; he was a creator, a shaper of dreams, turning rough-hewn timber into works of art, from sturdy tables and chairs to intricate cradles and finely carved mantelpieces. Tonight, though, he wasn't building furniture. He was building a box. A small, wooden box, lined with velvet, the purpose of which stirred a cold unease in the pit of his stomach.
