Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a phlebotomist named:

**Story Opening:**

The sickly sweet antiseptic scent clung to everything in the drawing room, a smell Beatrice "Bea" Ainsworth had come to associate with Mondays, frantic nurses, and the general malaise that seemed to settle over St. Jude's Hospital every time the clock struck 8:00 AM. Bea pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the inevitable caffeine headache. She’d been up late, chasing down vintage anatomical illustrations for her side hustle Etsy shop, and now the consequences were knocking at her temples with tiny, insistent hammers. Still, she forced a smile as Mrs. Gable, a woman with veins as elusive as Bigfoot sightings, shuffled into the room, muttering something about the injustice of having to fast before bloodwork.

"Good morning, Mrs. Gable! How are we doing today?" Bea asked, her voice a carefully modulated blend of cheerfulness and competence. Mrs. Gable’s response was a grunt that sounded suspiciously like, "Bloody awful, thank you very much." Bea sighed inwardly. It was going to be one of *those* Mondays.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set within **St. Jude's Hospital**, a mid-sized community hospital located in the fictional town of **Havenwood, Massachusetts**. The hospital itself is a sprawling, brick building, a mix of older, slightly dilapidated wings and newer, modernized sections.

**Specific Setting:**

The opening scene takes place in the **hospital's blood drawing room**, located on the second floor, near the main laboratory. It's a bright, sterile space, designed for efficiency and hygiene rather than comfort. There are several phlebotomy chairs, each equipped with adjustable armrests and safety restraints. A small, partitioned waiting area with uncomfortable plastic chairs lines one wall. The walls are painted a pale, institutional green and adorned with anatomical posters and hand-washing guidelines. Medical supplies are neatly organized on shelves and in rolling carts. A computer workstation sits in the corner, where Bea logs patient information and test requests.

**Time:**

The story begins on a **Monday morning, around 8:00 AM**. The air is filled with the chaotic energy of the start of the work week, with doctors rushing to make rounds, nurses juggling multiple tasks, and patients anxiously awaiting their appointments.
