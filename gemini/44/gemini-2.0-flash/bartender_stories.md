The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like a second skin. Inside, the low hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses offered little respite. Even the aged ceiling fan seemed to struggle against the oppressive heat. This was The Crooked Spoon, a dive bar nestled deep within the French Quarter, and for Juliette “Jules” Moreau, it was home.

Jules leaned against the worn mahogany bar, polishing a glass with a practiced flick of her wrist. The dim lighting cast long shadows, making the chipped paint and faded photographs seem even more ancient. Tonight, the bar was quieter than usual, only a handful of regulars scattered amongst the tables, their voices a low, mournful drone. Outside, a blues guitarist wailed a melancholic tune, the music seeping into the bar like a salty, unseen tide. It was a Tuesday, which meant it was "Trouble Tuesday," a night Jules had unofficially christened because it consistently brought her the weirdest, most dramatic, and most exhausting customers. Tonight, she braced herself, hoping the trouble would be manageable, preferably involving spilled beer and heartbroken tourists, not brawls or ghostly apparitions.
