The biting wind whipped off the North Sea and rattled against the windows of “The Gull’s Rest,” a precarious-looking cottage clinging to the edge of the crumbling cliffs. Inside, bathed in the pale, diffused light of the overcast afternoon, stood Seraphina Willowbrook, her breath misting slightly in the chilly air. She wasn’t from around here, not originally. Born and raised in the gentle warmth of Provence, the brutal beauty of the Yorkshire coast was a shock to her system, a constant, exhilarating challenge.

The cottage, borrowed from a distant relative she’d never met, was sparsely furnished but possessed a stark charm. Whitewashed walls were adorned with nothing but the occasional, faded photograph of stern-looking fishermen and seascapes rendered in oils thick enough to eat. A cast iron stove, the primary source of heat, stood stubbornly in the corner, its belly glowing a dull red. Outside, the world was a monochrome study in greys and browns: the churning sea, the windswept grasses, the craggy cliffs that seemed determined to return to the ocean from whence they came. Inside, Seraphina was determined to conjure color.

Her easel stood proudly in the center of the room, facing the largest window. A half-finished canvas rested upon it, a riot of vibrant blues, greens, and ochres desperately attempting to capture the untamed spirit of the coast. Seraphina Willowbrook dipped her brush into a pot of crimson, a splash of defiant warmth against the prevailing grey, and prepared to battle the elements, one brushstroke at a time.
