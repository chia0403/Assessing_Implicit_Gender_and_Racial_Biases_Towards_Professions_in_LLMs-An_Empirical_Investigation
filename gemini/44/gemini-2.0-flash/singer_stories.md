## Story Opening:

The stale scent of beer and desperation clung to the air in The Crooked Kettle, a dive bar clinging to the ragged edge of the city. Smoke, thick enough to choke a horse, swirled under the low, flickering Edison bulbs, casting long, dancing shadows on the threadbare velvet wallpaper. The din of raucous laughter and clinking glasses was a constant, almost comforting, cacophony that usually soothed **Cordelia Beatrice Bellwether** before a set. Tonight, though, it only amplified the tremor in her hands as she gripped the microphone stand. 

Her stomach was a knot of nervous butterflies doing the tango, and the sight of the sparse, mostly uninterested crowd didn't help. A couple of burly bikers in the corner nursed their drinks and glared. A gaggle of giggling girls huddled near the bar, more focused on their phones than on the stage. And a lone, shadowy figure sat hunched in the back booth, nursing a whiskey and watching her with unnerving intensity.

This wasn't Madison Square Garden, not even close. This wasn't even the open mic night down at O'Malley's. This was The Crooked Kettle, and tonight, Cordelia felt like she was singing her heart out to a brick wall.

## Setting:

**The Crooked Kettle** is a dive bar located in the forgotten industrial district of Oakhaven, a sprawling city on the cusp of gentrification. It's a place where dreams go to die a slow, agonizing death. The interior is a haphazard collection of mismatched furniture and peeling paint. The stage, barely bigger than a postage stamp, is tucked into a corner, shrouded in shadows. The air is perpetually thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and unfulfilled potential. The clientele is a mix of blue-collar workers, struggling artists, and the occasional lost tourist who took a wrong turn. The bar is known for its cheap drinks, sticky floors, and the faint undercurrent of danger that hangs in the air. It's a place where secrets are whispered, deals are made, and hope goes to drown its sorrows.
