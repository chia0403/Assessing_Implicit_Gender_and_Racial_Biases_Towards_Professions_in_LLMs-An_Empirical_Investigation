Maps of imaginary worlds, meticulously drawn by past students, adorned the walls, a vibrant contrast to the peeling paint and the cracked linoleum floor. A whiteboard, usually filled with sprawling notes on Shakespeare and grammar, stood blank, waiting to be resurrected with the promise of another school year. The setting wasnâ€™t glamorous, but it was home. And right now, Amelia needed all the comfort she could get. This year felt different, heavier, somehow.
