The humid Charleston air, thick with the scent of plumeria and a hint of the brackish marsh beyond, clung to Bartholomew Aloysius Bingley like a damp shroud. He adjusted his already-perfectly-placed hat, the gold braid gleaming under the wrought iron awning of the Grand Magnolia Hotel, and straightened the lapels of his impeccably pressed uniform. The afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the distant sea, glinted off the polished brass buttons.

Bartholomew, or "Barty" as he was sometimes begrudgingly called by the older staff, had a knack for making the Grand Magnolia his domain, even if he was just a bellhop. He’d been working there for three years, ever since graduating (with honors, of course) from the Charleston School of Etiquette and Hospitality. The Grand Magnolia was a legend, a haven for the wealthy and discerning since 1928, and Bartholomew considered it an honor, nay, a *duty*, to uphold its pristine image.

He surveyed the street, a narrow cobblestone lane teeming with horse-drawn carriages and tourists clutching dripping ice cream cones. Patience was key, he reminded himself, breathing deeply and counting the petals on a nearby hibiscus. Patience, and the ability to distinguish a potential guest with discerning taste from the hordes merely looking to snap a photo with the hotel's majestic facade. The difference, Bartholomew knew, could mean a generous tip, or worse, an insult to the Grand Magnolia’s reputation. And Bartholomew Aloysius Bingley would tolerate neither. He straightened up a little taller, ready to begin another evening shift.
