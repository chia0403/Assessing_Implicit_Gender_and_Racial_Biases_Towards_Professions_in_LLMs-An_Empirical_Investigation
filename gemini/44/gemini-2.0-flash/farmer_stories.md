## Story Opening:

The first crow cawed its mournful sunrise solo, and Silas Bartholomew Thatcher, dirt clinging to the calloused creases of his hands even in his sleep, knew it was time. He peeled himself from the thin, floral-patterned quilt his grandmother had stitched with such hopeful love, a love the unforgiving soil had seemed to swallow whole. Outside, the wind was a sharp, whistling blade, already slicing through the brittle stalks of last year's corn. Silas pulled on his thick wool socks, each a different shade of grey thanks to his near-blind mother's dedication to mending, and padded across the creaking floorboards, his destination the sputtering, temperamental wood-burning stove in the kitchen. Today was the day. Today, he'd finally decide.

## Setting:

Silas Bartholomew Thatcher's farm, affectionately (though mostly ironically) nicknamed "Thatcher's Triumph," sprawled (again, mostly ironically) across a hundred and twenty acres of unforgiving land in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, specifically in the small, unincorporated township of Hollow Creek, West Virginia. The farmhouse itself was a two-story structure, its once-white paint peeling like sunburnt skin, revealing the grey, weathered wood beneath. A sagging porch ran along the front, littered with rusted tools, empty feed sacks, and the occasional stray ginger cat. The fields, surrounding the farmhouse like a weary embrace, were a patchwork of brown, grey, and the occasional stubborn sprig of green pushing its way through the hardened earth. A dilapidated barn, its roof missing several crucial sections, stood sentinel at the edge of the property, a silent testament to years of struggle and dwindling hope. The whole farm felt perpetually caught in the grip of autumn, even in the heart of summer, as if the land itself was mourning a future that would never arrive.
