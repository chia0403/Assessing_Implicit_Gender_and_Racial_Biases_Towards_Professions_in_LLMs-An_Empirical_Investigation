**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, D.C., stared at the x-ray, the fluorescent light reflecting off her perpetually furrowed brow. A hairline fracture in the L5 vertebrae, almost invisible but undeniably there.  She sighed, a sound that was becoming all too familiar in the dimly lit confines of her office.  It wasn’t the complexity of the case that worried her; she'd seen far worse. It was the patient.  Mr. Henderson, a sprightly octogenarian who swore his pain originated from tending his award-winning petunias, was about to have his gardening dreams nipped in the bud, thanks to a poorly timed tumble he'd conveniently "forgotten" to mention during the initial consultation.

**Setting:**

Ellie's practice, "Vance Chiropractic & Wellness," was nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a charmingly antiquated town clinging to the edge of the Pacific Northwest coastline.  The building itself, a converted Victorian house painted a calming shade of seafoam green, was a haven of quirky charm and mismatched comfort.  A kaleidoscope of stained-glass windows filtered sunlight into the reception area, illuminating a well-worn leather armchair and a bookshelf overflowing with dog-eared medical journals and self-help guides.  

Her treatment room, where she stood now, was a less romantic affair. Practicality reigned supreme, with a sturdy chiropractic table dominating the space. The walls were painted a sterile beige, punctuated by anatomical charts and framed diplomas.  A faint scent of eucalyptus and liniment permeated the air, a constant reminder of the physical demands and satisfying rewards of her profession.  Outside the window, the roar of the ocean provided a constant, rhythmic soundtrack to her day, a calming counterpoint to the aches and pains she dedicated herself to alleviating.  Havenwood, with its quirky residents and its reliance on traditional remedies, was the perfect place for a chiropractor like Ellie Vance. It was just… sometimes, a little too quiet.
