**Setting:** The humid air of New Orleans hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine, decaying fruit, and something indefinably…unclean. It was late August, deep into hurricane season, and the city held its breath, awaiting the inevitable. Streetlights flickered weakly against the gathering dusk, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with secrets. Dilapidated Creole cottages, their wrought-iron balconies rusting under layers of humidity, lined the narrow street, their pastel colors peeling like sunburned skin. The music from a nearby jazz club, a mournful trumpet solo, drifted on the wind, a poignant counterpoint to the uneasy quiet that had settled over the Vieux Carré.

**Story Opening:**

The scalpel slipped in Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Moreau's sweaty hand. She cursed under her breath, a low, guttural sound barely audible over the whirring of the makeshift generator powering the operating lights. The power grid had gone down hours ago, leaving the Charity Hospital, already stretched thin by the relentless influx of patients, clinging to life support. The hurricane, which had been a mere whisper on the radar yesterday, had roared into a Category 4 monster, and the city was paying the price. Eleanor stared down at the open wound on the young man's chest, a gaping cavity torn open by flying debris. His face, streaked with grime and dried blood, was pale and slack. She had to stop the bleeding, find the source of the internal hemorrhage before... Before she lost another one. Another life swallowed by the insatiable maw of the storm.
