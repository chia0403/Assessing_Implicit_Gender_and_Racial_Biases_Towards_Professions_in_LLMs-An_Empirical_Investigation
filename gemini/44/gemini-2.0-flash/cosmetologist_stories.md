The fluorescent lights of "Glamazon Salon & Spa" hummed a dissonant lullaby as Seraphina Willowbrook surveyed her domain. It was 7:30 AM, far too early for any sane person, but Seraphina wasn't sane when it came to her craft. She was a cosmetologist, a sculptor of hair, a painter of faces, a magician of self-esteem. The salon, nestled in the up-and-coming arts district of Asheville, North Carolina, was her sanctuary, her canvas.

The walls were painted a calming sage green, adorned with framed prints of vintage Vogue covers and quirky local artwork. Rows of brightly colored bottles – shampoos, conditioners, dyes, and serums – stood like miniature soldiers, ready for battle against bad hair days. Manicure stations, pristine and polished, gleamed under individual spotlights, promising transformation with every stroke of a brush. The air hung thick with the sweet scent of rosewater and the faint, metallic tang of hairspray. Seraphina ran a hand along the smooth, black granite of the reception desk, its surface reflecting her own tired but determined face. Today was Friday, which meant the salon would be buzzing from open to close, a whirlwind of blow dryers, gossip, and the intoxicating promise of a weekend ready to be conquered, perfectly coiffed.
