The humid air hung thick and heavy over the cobblestones of Marseille’s Vieux Port, carrying the scent of brine, diesel, and something else, something sharper, more primal. It was the scent of blood. Not fresh, arterial spray, but the lingering, metallic tang of a well-cleaned blade after a hard day's work. This was the territory of Henri Dubois, and he breathed it in like the salty air of his childhood.

Henri Dubois stood in the doorway of his boucherie, "Au Cochon Heureux" – a name that always brought a wry smile to his face. The morning light, already fierce at 8 AM, glinted off the meticulously arranged cuts of meat displayed in the window: rosy legs of lamb, marbled slabs of beef, plump chickens trussed and ready for the spit. Henri, wiping his hands on his stained, white apron, surveyed his kingdom. Inside, the shop was cool and dim, a welcome respite from the heat outside. Rows of sausages, hanging from the rafters, cast long shadows across the butcher block, worn smooth with decades of use. His grandmother, God rest her soul, had first swung an axe in this very place.

Henri ran a hand through his close-cropped, salt-and-pepper hair. He was a broad-shouldered man, his physique honed by years of lifting sides of beef and wielding heavy cleavers. His face, etched with the lines of hard work and quiet contemplation, was framed by a thick, handlebar mustache that gave him an air of old-world charm. But beneath the mustache, his lips were set in a thin, tight line. Today, something was different. The usual cacophony of the port felt muted, almost menacing. And Henri, a man who could tell a story with a single cut of meat, felt a prickling unease crawl up his spine.
