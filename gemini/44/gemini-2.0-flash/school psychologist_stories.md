## Story Opening:

The chipped paint on the door of Room 108 seemed to mock Dr. Eleanor Vance, a tiny rebellion in the otherwise sterile, beige landscape of Crestwood Elementary. Eleanor, a school psychologist known for her calm demeanor and unsettlingly accurate insights, sighed, adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, and pushed the door open.

The small room, typically a refuge of mismatched furniture and discarded art projects, was unnaturally empty. Only a single, child-sized chair sat opposite her own desk, bathed in the stark fluorescent glow. The air hung heavy with the quiet anticipation that always preceded a particularly difficult session. Today's difficulty came in the form of eight-year-old Leo, a boy who, according to his exasperated teacher, Mrs. Henderson, had started talking to the birds again. And not just talking, but arguing.

Eleanor ran a hand through her short, auburn hair, a nervous habit she hadn’t managed to break even after ten years of listening to the anxieties and heartaches of Crestwood's children. She checked the time. Two minutes to Leo. Two minutes to gather her composure and prepare to navigate the murky waters of a child’s inner world.

## Setting:

**Location:** Crestwood Elementary School, a sprawling, brick building nestled in the quiet, suburban town of Crestwood, Ohio.

**Time:** Late October, a Tuesday afternoon, just after the last recess bell. The crisp air outside held the scent of decaying leaves and the promise of Halloween, a combination that always seemed to amplify the children's energy, and subsequently, the school psychologist's workload.

**Atmosphere:** A blend of institutional blandness and childlike vibrancy. The hallways are lined with colorful student artwork and motivational posters, yet the underlying architecture feels sterile and impersonal. A constant hum of activity – children's chatter, the clatter of cafeteria trays, the occasional shrill whistle of a teacher – permeates the building, creating a low-level hum of background noise.
