## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air in the attic was thick with dust motes dancing in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the grime-coated window. Cobwebs, like discarded lace, draped themselves across forgotten treasures: a moth-eaten taxidermied owl perched precariously on a stack of sheet music, a chipped porcelain doll missing an eye staring blankly at the rafters. The oppressive silence was broken only by the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hawthorne's antique typewriter. Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the panes in their frames and promising a storm.

**Story Opening:**

Amelia Hawthorne chewed the end of her pen, the bitter taste of desperation coating her tongue. Three weeks. Three weeks she'd been staring at the same blank page, haunted by the ghost of a brilliant idea that had evaporated like morning mist. Her publisher was breathing down her neck, the advance she'd received dwindling faster than her inspiration. The words, usually so eager to leap from her mind onto the page, were now locked behind a steel door, guarded by apathy and a healthy dose of self-doubt. She slammed her fist on the desk, causing the typewriter to jump and the owl to wobble precariously. "Damn it," she muttered, her voice echoing in the cavernous space. "Come on, Amelia. You've stared down writer's block before. You've stared down worse." She picked up a photograph from the corner of the desk, a faded image of a woman with kind eyes and a mischievous smile. Her grandmother, Elsie. "What would you do, Nana?" she whispered to the photograph. Elsie Hawthorne, the woman who'd taught her to see the magic in the mundane, the stories hidden in the shadows. As if in answer, a sudden gust of wind slammed the attic door shut with a resounding *boom*, plunging the space into near darkness. Amelia jumped, heart hammering against her ribs. Then, she saw it. A sliver of light peeking from beneath the floorboards in the corner of the room, illuminating something she'd never noticed before. Something that gleamed with an unnerving, ethereal glow.
