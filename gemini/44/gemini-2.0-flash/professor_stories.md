The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's cheeks as she hurried across the University of Chicago campus. Her scarf, a particularly vibrant shade of emerald green, billowed behind her like a stubborn flag. The Gothic architecture, normally a source of solace, seemed to loom even more menacingly beneath the grey sky, its gargoyles leering down at her with what Eleanor could only interpret as disapproval. She was late. Terribly, unforgivably late.

Eleanor Ainsworth, Professor of Ancient Languages and Literature, was known for many things: her encyclopedic knowledge of obscure Sumerian dialects, her uncanny ability to decipher even the most fragmented Mycenaean texts, and, unfortunately, her utter lack of punctuality.

Her office, tucked away in a dimly lit corner of Harper Memorial Library, was a testament to her scholarly passions and her chaotic lifestyle. Stacks of books, precariously balanced, lined every available surface. Papyrus scrolls spilled from overflowing shelves. Ancient clay tablets, dusted with the remnants of millennia, sat nestled amongst half-eaten bagels and overflowing coffee mugs. It was a sanctuary, a haven from the modern world, and, today, it was a scene of impending academic doom. Her star student, the precocious and relentlessly punctual Arthur Jenkins, was undoubtedly already waiting for her, his face a portrait of polite, but palpable, disappointment. Eleanor just hoped he hadnâ€™t left yet.
