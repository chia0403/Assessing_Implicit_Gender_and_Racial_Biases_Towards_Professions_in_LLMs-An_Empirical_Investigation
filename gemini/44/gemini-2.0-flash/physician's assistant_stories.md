Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a physician's assistant named Eleanor Faye Davies:

**Setting:** The story opens in the small, sun-drenched coastal town of Seabrook, Maine. Seabrook is a place where the air smells perpetually of salt and pine, and where the rhythm of life is dictated by the tides and the lobster season. The heart of the town is the Seabrook Family Clinic, a charming but slightly dilapidated Victorian house painted a cheerful (if slightly faded) shade of seafoam green. The waiting room is eternally filled with locals swapping gossip, children tracing patterns on the worn rug with their fingers, and the distinct, comforting aroma of lavender hand sanitizer.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Faye Davies smoothed down the lapel of her freshly-ironed white coat, a familiar gesture that still felt somewhat performative after five years. From her position at the nurse's station, she could see Mrs. Higgins regaling young Timmy Johnson with a particularly vivid tale about a rogue seagull that had stolen a hot dog right out of her hand. Eleanor stifled a smile. Seabrook, she thought, was never short on interesting stories.

"Eleanor, dear," Dr. Peterson's voice, a low rumble seasoned with a New England twang, cut through the murmur of the waiting room. "Could you pop into my office for a moment? Got something I want your input on."

Eleanor felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach. Dr. Peterson rarely asked for her *input*. Usually, she was the one bringing him the problems, the odd rashes, the persistent coughs, the worrisome lab results. What could possibly be occupying the good doctor's mind that he needed *her* assistance? She flashed Mrs. Higgins a reassuring smile and headed towards Dr. Peterson's cluttered office, the linoleum cool beneath her sensible shoes. The faint smell of pipe tobacco hung in the air, a comforting, yet slightly unnerving, prelude to whatever lay ahead.
