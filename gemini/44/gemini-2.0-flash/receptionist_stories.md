## Story Opening:

The incessant beeping of a microwave sliced through the relative quiet of the reception area, causing Eleanor Iris Finch to flinch. She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Three minutes. Three minutes and forty-seven seconds, to be exact, until she could liberate her reheated lentil soup from its nuclear imprisonment. And three minutes and forty-seven seconds too long to continue enduring the relentless muzak rendition of "Eye of the Tiger" bleeding from the office speakers.

She glanced at the clock above the potted ficus tree - 12:53 PM. Almost lunch. Almost peace. Almost.

The heavy glass doors of the lobby slid open with a whoosh, announcing the arrival of another soul into the meticulously curated realm of "Innovative Solutions," a name Eleanor found increasingly ironic considering their biggest innovation seemed to be finding new and exciting ways to bore her into a coma. She plastered on her most professional smile, the one that promised efficiency and competence, a smile that could convince even the most disgruntled client that their problems were mere pebbles in the face of Innovative Solutions' towering expertise.

"Good afternoon," Eleanor greeted, her voice warm and practiced. "Welcome to Innovative Solutions. How may I help you?"

## Setting:

The reception area of Innovative Solutions was a study in sterile modernism. Gleaming white walls were punctuated by the occasional abstract painting featuring strategically placed squares of primary colors. Polished concrete floors reflected the harsh fluorescent lighting. A single, oversized leather couch offered seating, but its stark, minimalist design seemed to discourage actual lounging.

Behind the reception desk, Eleanor Finch presided over her domain. Her desk, a pristine expanse of white lacquer, held only the bare necessities: a sleek, minimalist phone, a pristine notepad, a company-branded pen, and a small, framed photograph of her cat, Mr. Fluffernutter, who offered a much-needed dose of fluffy, feline chaos to the otherwise hyper-organized space.
