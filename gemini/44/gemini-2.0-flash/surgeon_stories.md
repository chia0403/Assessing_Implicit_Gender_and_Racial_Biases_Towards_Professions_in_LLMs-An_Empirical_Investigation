## Story Opening:

The cloying sweetness of antiseptic clung to the air, a grim perfume Dr. Vivian Holloway had grown to associate with the precipice. Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the windows of the operating theater, a relentless rhythm mimicking the frantic beat of the heart monitor beside her. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed, casting an unforgiving glare on the open chest before her.

Sweat beaded on Vivian's brow, beading that threatened to sting her eyes beneath the surgical loupes. Her focus was laser-sharp, narrowed to the intricate dance of her fingers wielding the delicate instruments. Time seemed to warp and bend, minutes stretching into eons, punctuated only by the rhythmic hiss of the ventilator and the scrub nurse's whispered counts.

He was young. Too young. And she, Dr. Vivian Holloway, had to fix him.
## Setting:

The story opens in Operating Theater 7 of the **University of Washington Medical Center** in Seattle, Washington. The time is approximately 10:30 PM on a relentlessly rainy Tuesday evening in late October. The sterile, almost clinical, atmosphere is punctuated by the advanced medical equipment surrounding the operating table: monitors displaying vital signs, infusion pumps, and a complex array of surgical instruments laid out with precision. The overall impression is one of controlled chaos, a high-stakes environment where life hangs in the balance. The constant backdrop of rain outside adds to the sense of urgency and isolation within the operating room.
