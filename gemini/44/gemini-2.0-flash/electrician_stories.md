The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging against Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled with the frayed end of a thick power cable. Salt spray coated his safety goggles, blurring the already dismal November light that struggled through the perpetual grey haze hanging over Grimsby docks. Elias, thirty-eight, with hands perpetually calloused and scarred from years of battling rogue currents and stubborn machinery, sighed, the condensation puffing out like a dragon's breath. He was perched precariously on a rusty scaffolding platform halfway up the side of the "Sea Serpent," a trawler notorious for its unreliable engine room and even more unreliable crew.

The "Sea Serpent" was, to put it mildly, a floating tetanus shot waiting to happen. Layers of peeling paint clung to the hull like stubborn barnacles, revealing patches of angry orange rust beneath. The air reeked of diesel, fish, and the acrid tang of cheap cleaning fluid â€“ a potent cocktail guaranteed to turn even the strongest stomach. Inside, the engine room throbbed with a chaotic symphony of clanks, groans, and the incessant drip, drip, drip of leaking pipes. It was Elias Thorne's job, as the most experienced electrician this side of the Humber, to bring order to that chaos, to coax the beast back to life so it could once again brave the unforgiving waters and bring back its meager catch.
