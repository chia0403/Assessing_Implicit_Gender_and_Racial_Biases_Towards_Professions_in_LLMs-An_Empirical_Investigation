## The Story Opening:

The flickering gaslight cast elongated, distorted shadows across the mahogany desk, pooling around the scattered legal documents like secrets huddled in the corners of a musty room. A lone rat, bolder than usual, scurried across the floorboards, its tiny claws clicking a frantic rhythm against the silence. Bartholomew Finch, Esq., normally a picture of unflappable composure, ignored it. He was too consumed with the yellowed parchment clutched in his trembling hand.

The ink blurred slightly under the persistent dampness that plagued London’s autumn, making the archaic script almost illegible. But even through the grime and age, the words burned into his consciousness: *“…condition of said will, that he shall reside in Blackwood Manor, without interruption, for the duration of one calendar year. Failure to comply will result in immediate and total forfeiture of all claims…”*

A cold dread coiled in Bartholomew’s stomach, a feeling he hadn't experienced since facing the venomous glare of Judge Abernathy after a particularly disastrous misreading of the Maritime Law in '87. Blackwood Manor. The very name conjured images of cobwebs, whispers, and a history so shrouded in darkness that even the bravest constable refused to patrol its perimeter after dusk. He ran a weary hand through his thinning hair, his reflection a gaunt and haunted figure staring back from the dusty windowpane. He’d handled countless inheritance disputes, argued for the righteous and the wronged, but he'd never, ever, expected to inherit a haunted house. And a very valuable one at that.

## The Setting:

The year is 1893. Bartholomew Finch's office is located in a narrow, three-story building on Chancery Lane, London. The street is choked with horse-drawn carriages, hawkers, and the general cacophony of a bustling Victorian city. Inside, his office is a testament to both his success and his meticulous, some would say obsessive, nature. Legal tomes line the walls, stacked floor to ceiling in perfectly ordered rows. A large, ornate globe sits in the corner, a silent witness to the countless hours he's spent poring over international law. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, beeswax polish, and a faint, lingering aroma of pipe tobacco. Despite its grandeur, a palpable sense of neglect hangs in the air – a chipped teacup on the desk, a cobweb clinging to the gas lamp, a persistent dampness that seeps in from the cobblestone streets outside, reminding Bartholomew of the cold, clammy hand that fate had just dealt him.
