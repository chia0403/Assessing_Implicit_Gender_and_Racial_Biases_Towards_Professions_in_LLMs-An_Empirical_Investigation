## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun slanted through the gauzy curtains of "The Zen Den," a massage therapy studio nestled above a bakery in the quaint coastal town of Seabreeze, Maine. The air, thick with the scent of lavender essential oil and freshly baked bread, usually calmed even the most stressed client. But today, a different kind of tension hung in the air, heavier than the aroma of rosemary focaccia drifting up from below.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, a jarring sound that sliced through the carefully curated tranquility. Cordelia Beauregard, her hands still slick with sweet almond oil from the previous appointment, sighed softly. She smoothed down the wrinkles on her linen tunic and pasted on her most welcoming smile. This was her last client of the day, and judging by the nervous energy swirling in the pit of her stomach, it was going to be a doozy. She braced herself, hoping this wasn't another case of "I need to tell you my entire life story and then complain about the pressure being too firm." Cordelia loved her job, loved helping people unwind, but sometimes... sometimes the energy vampires just drained her soul. "Come in," she called, her voice intentionally soothing. "The Zen Den is open."
