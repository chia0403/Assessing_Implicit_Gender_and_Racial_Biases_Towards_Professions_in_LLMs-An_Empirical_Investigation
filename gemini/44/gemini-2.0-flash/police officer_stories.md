The neon sign of "Rosie's Diner - Open All Night" buzzed erratically, spitting out a faint blue light that barely pierced the thick fog clinging to the asphalt. Detective Sergeant Amelia "Amy" Bellwether shivered, pulling her threadbare leather jacket tighter. It was 3:17 AM, the kind of hour where even the rats in the alley seemed to hold their breath, waiting for something terrible to happen. Rosie's, nestled on the grimy corner of 6th and Vine in Old Town, was Amy's usual graveyard shift haunt, a place of weak coffee and even weaker conversation. Tonight, the air hung heavy with the smell of burnt bacon and unspoken anxieties, thicker even than the fog outside. Three truckers nursed cups of coffee, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of the jukebox, and Rosie herself, a woman built like a brick shithouse with a heart probably just as tough, polished the counter with a weary sigh. Old Town, a section of the city forgotten by progress and riddled with the ghosts of its vibrant past, felt particularly ominous tonight, a stage set for a tragedy waiting to unfold.
