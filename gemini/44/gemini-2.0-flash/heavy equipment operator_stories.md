**Story Opening:**

The pre-dawn air hung thick and humid, a damp blanket clinging to everything, even the steel behemoths lined up in the equipment yard. The only sound was the rhythmic clang of the flag pole lanyard against the metal pole, a mournful counterpoint to the relentless chirp of cicadas just beginning their day's racket. Inside the cab of his D11 dozer, the "Iron Duke," as he affectionately called it, Silas "Si" Bartholomew traced the worn grooves of the steering wheel, his calloused thumb following a path he knew by heart. He was early, as always, but sleep had been a fleeting visitor. The image of twisted metal and shattered concrete, the aftermath of last night's storm, replayed behind his eyelids with a sickening clarity. Today, he wasn't just moving dirt; he was cleaning up someone's broken life.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the sweltering coastal plains of Louisiana, specifically in the small, unincorporated community of Bayou Pointe. Bayou Pointe sits nestled amongst cypress swamps and sprawling sugarcane fields, a patchwork of weathered clapboard houses, a lone general store, and the omnipresent, slow-moving waters of the bayou itself. The community's lifeblood is the combination of fishing, small-scale farming, and the ever-booming construction and maintenance of the coastal oil and gas infrastructure. Silas works for "Coastal Dredging and Demolition," a locally owned company contracted to handle everything from land clearing to disaster relief throughout the Gulf Coast region. The company's yard, a sprawling expanse of gravel and mud on the outskirts of Bayou Pointe, is filled with an array of heavy machinery: dozers, excavators, cranes, and trucks, all coated in a perpetual layer of red Louisiana clay. The air constantly smells of diesel, swamp gas, and the sweet, cloying scent of decaying vegetation.
