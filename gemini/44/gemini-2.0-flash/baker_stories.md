The aroma of toasted almond and caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind that rattled the stained-glass window of the bakery. Amelia Beatrice Thornton, flour dusting her rosy cheeks and a stray curl perpetually escaping her auburn braid, hadn't even bothered to light the gas lamps yet. She knew the dim, pre-dawn light was better for judging the golden-brown perfection of her croissants.

Amelia’s haven, "The Golden Crumb," was nestled on the cobbled street of Havenwood, a small, whimsical town clinging to the edge of the Blackwood Forest. Houses here leaned into each other like gossiping old women, and the air was perpetually laced with the scent of woodsmoke and something akin to magic – a feeling that clung to the ancient stones and whispered on the wind. Havenwood was known for its eccentric residents and its even more eccentric customs, a place where a talking raven at the town square was less remarkable than a perfectly ordinary teacup.

Amelia, however, prized normalcy. She valued the predictable rhythm of kneading dough, the reliable hiss of the oven, and the contented sighs of her customers when they bit into her creations. The Golden Crumb was her anchor in a town that often felt adrift on a sea of the unbelievable. She breathed deeply, savoring the familiar scent of her bakery, a small sanctuary against the approaching dawn and whatever strange happenings Havenwood might bring today.
