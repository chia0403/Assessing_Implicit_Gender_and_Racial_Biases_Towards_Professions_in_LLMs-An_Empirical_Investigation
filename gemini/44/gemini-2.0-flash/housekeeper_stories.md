The clatter of Mrs. Willowbrook's prized porcelain cockerel hitting the marble floor echoed through the silent mansion like a gunshot. Agatha Rose Ainsworth, her already pale face now the color of bleached linen, froze, dust rag clutched in her hand. The offending bird lay in a dozen pieces at her feet, its painted beak snapped clean off.

The setting was precisely the kind of place where a misplaced feather could cause a societal tremor. Stonehaven Manor, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, was a monument to generations of inherited wealth and exquisitely curated taste. Every room, from the grand ballroom adorned with portraits of stern-faced ancestors to the opulent library lined with leather-bound first editions, screamed of history, privilege, and, Agatha thought with a nervous gulp, extreme expense.

Agatha had been head housekeeper at Stonehaven for five years, a position she’d inherited from her own mother who had served the Willowbrooks with unwavering loyalty for thirty years before. It was a good job, paying well and offering a small cottage on the estate grounds. But good jobs came with responsibilities. And right now, Agatha was facing the sort of responsibility that made her want to pack her bags and disappear into the heather-clad hills behind the house. Mrs. Willowbrook had specifically, almost menacingly, emphasized the cockerel’s significance during Agatha's morning instructions. “Agatha,” she had said, her voice tight, “that bird is a Willowbrook heirloom, practically a member of the family. See that it receives the respect it deserves.”
