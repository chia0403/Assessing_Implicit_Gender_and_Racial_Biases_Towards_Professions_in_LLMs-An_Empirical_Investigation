## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, high-pitched drone, a sound that always seemed to amplify the anxieties swirling in Agnes Bellweather’s head. Today, however, the hum was a welcome distraction. It almost drowned out the gnawing guilt threatening to consume her. Agnes straightened the bib around Mrs. Higgins’ neck, forcing a cheerful smile that felt like a grotesque mask stretched across her face.

"Alright, Mrs. Higgins, how are we doing today? Flossing been keeping those pearly whites sparkling?" Agnes asked, her voice a practiced melody of professional concern.

Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose dentures looked perpetually surprised, mumbled something unintelligible through her pursed lips. Agnes nodded, her heart sinking. Another patient, another lie. She hadn't touched a floss pick in weeks, not since... well, not since the incident.

**Setting:**

Agnes Bellweather, a dental hygienist for the past fifteen years, worked at "Smiles & Sunshine Dental Clinic" in the sleepy coastal town of Seabreeze, Oregon. The clinic was a small, family-run practice owned by the affable but occasionally inept Dr. Theodore "Ted" Plumber. Seabreeze itself was a picturesque town known for its quaint shops, stunning sunsets, and a slightly unsettlingly high population of retired sea captains. The clinic was located just off Main Street, in a converted Victorian house painted a cheerfully optimistic shade of pale yellow. Inside, the waiting room was decorated with nautical-themed paintings and a bubbling fish tank that contained a surprisingly aggressive-looking clownfish named "Jaws." While the town exuded an air of idyllic tranquility, beneath the surface lay a network of secrets, small town rivalries, and the occasional washed-up something-or-other on the beach.
