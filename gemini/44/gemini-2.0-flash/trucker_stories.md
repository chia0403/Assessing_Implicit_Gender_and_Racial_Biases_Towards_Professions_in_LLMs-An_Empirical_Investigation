## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** A pre-dawn stretch of Interstate 80, just west of Des Moines, Iowa. The air is thick with a damp, earthy smell promising rain. Fields of corn, now skeletal and harvested, stretch into the grey horizon on either side of the highway. The only sound is the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tractor-trailers eating up the miles and the occasional bleat of a lonely sheep echoing from a distant farm. A Denny's sign glows like a beacon a couple of miles ahead, its promise of hot coffee and greasy comfort a siren song to weary truckers.

**Story Opening:**

"Damn rain," muttered **Wilhelmina "Willie" Jensen**, adjusting her trucker hat and squinting at the road ahead. The first fat drops were already splattering against her windshield, blurring the already faint taillights of the semi ahead of her. She flicked on her wipers, the rhythmic swoosh-swoosh a familiar soundtrack to her life. The dashboard clock read 4:17 AM. Des Moines was close, tantalizingly close, but Willie knew better than to let her guard down. The Midwest in October was a fickle beast; it could be sunshine and crisp blue skies one minute, and a blinding blizzard the next.

Willie patted the worn leather of her seat. Her faithful companion, a scruffy mutt named Earl, snored softly at her feet, oblivious to the impending downpour. He’d been riding shotgun with her for the past five years, ever since she’d found him abandoned at a truck stop in Oklahoma. Earl was good company, silent and undemanding, qualities Willie appreciated after a long day battling traffic and dispatchers. 

She glanced at the Denny's sign looming larger in the distance. Coffee. She desperately needed coffee. And maybe, just maybe, she'd treat herself to a stack of pancakes. This run, hauling a load of soybeans to Chicago, had been brutal, a never-ending symphony of delays and rude customers. A little bit of breakfast comfort might just be enough to keep her going.

But as she slowed down to take the exit, a flashing red light in her rearview mirror jolted her back to reality. Iowa State Trooper. Great. Just what she needed.
