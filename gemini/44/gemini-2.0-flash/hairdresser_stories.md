**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the hand-painted sign above "Waves & Wonders Hair Salon" in the small, stubbornly charming fishing town of Port Haven, Scotland. Cobblestone streets, glistening wet from a perpetual drizzle, led down to the harbour where brightly coloured fishing boats bobbed restlessly. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of hairspray, coffee, and a comforting, almost aggressive floral air freshener. The decor was an eclectic mix of seashell-encrusted mirrors, outdated hairstyling posters featuring gravity-defying perms, and modern, minimalist chrome styling chairs.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Beatrice Macleod, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, slammed the ancient cash register shut with more force than necessary. 8:15 AM. Fifteen minutes past opening, and the only sound was the rhythmic thump of the rain against the salon's large, fogged-over window. Port Haven was notorious for its unpredictable weather, but today was particularly grim. Eliza sighed, polishing the already gleaming chrome of her scissors with a practiced hand. She hated Mondays. And she *especially* hated Mondays when the haar, that thick sea mist, rolled in, effectively strangling any hope of walk-in customers. She'd been staring at the reflection of her own increasingly weary face in the mirror for far too long. Maybe she should just brew another pot of coffeeâ€¦ or, even better, sneak a wee dram from the emergency bottle of whisky she kept hidden behind the shampoo bottles.
