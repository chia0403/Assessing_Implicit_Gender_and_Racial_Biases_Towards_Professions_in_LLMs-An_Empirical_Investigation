## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Amelia Iris Thorne hated Tuesdays. Not because they were some mythical harbinger of bad luck, nor because they were the agonizing hump in the week. No, Amelia hated Tuesdays because Mrs. Higgins always scheduled her cleaning appointment for 9:00 AM, and Mrs. Higgins was a veritable fountain of conspiratorial whispers and unsolicited medical advice, all delivered between a mouthful of suction tube and the faint hum of the ultrasonic scaler. This Tuesday was proving to be particularly trying. Mrs. Higgins was currently convinced that the government was planting miniature tracking devices in fluoride toothpaste, and Amelia was struggling to maintain a professional smile while maneuvering around a particularly tenacious bit of spinach clinging stubbornly to Mrs. Higgins' lower incisor.

"I'm just saying, Doctor," Mrs. Higgins gargled around the suction tip. "You can't trust 'em! Look at the birds. All gone, I tell you. Gone! Replaced with...drones!"

Amelia sighed internally, the sound masked by the whirring of her tools. "Perhaps you're thinking of the pigeons, Mrs. Higgins? They're not exactly gone. In fact, they seem quite plentiful downtown."

Mrs. Higgins shook her head vehemently, a spatter of water hitting Amelia's protective eyewear. "No, Doctor. The pigeons are the *fake* ones. You need to *wake up*!"

Amelia considered abandoning the cleaning altogether and feigning a sudden, debilitating dental emergency of her own. But alas, Tuesdays, and particularly Mrs. Higgins, were just part of the job.

**Setting:**

Amelia's dental practice, "Thorne & Bloom Dentistry," occupied the second floor of a charming, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian building in the heart of Harmony Creek, Vermont. The building, painted a cheerful shade of robin's egg blue, was softened by overflowing window boxes bursting with petunias and geraniums. Inside, Amelia had strived to create a calming and inviting atmosphere, a stark contrast to the sterile and often intimidating environments often associated with dental offices. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the pastel-colored walls adorned with prints of botanical illustrations and whimsical landscapes. The air was fragrant with the subtle scent of vanilla and cloves, carefully chosen to mask the more clinical odors associated with dental procedures. The waiting room featured plush armchairs, a crackling electric fireplace, and a curated selection of magazines ranging from "National Geographic" to "Gardening Illustrated," hoping to offer something for everyone, even Mrs. Higgins and her conspiracy theories. Despite the charming exterior and carefully curated interior, a subtle undercurrent of quiet desperation hummed beneath the surface. Harmony Creek was a small town, fiercely loyal to its established businesses, and Thorne & Bloom Dentistry, while popular with the younger generation, struggled to compete with the older, more entrenched practice across town, owned by the formidable Dr. Abernathy, a man Amelia affectionately (and privately) referred to as "Dr. Grills of Steel."
