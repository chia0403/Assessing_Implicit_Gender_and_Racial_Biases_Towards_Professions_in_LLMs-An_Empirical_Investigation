## Story Opening:

The clang of metal on porcelain was the last thing Barnaby "Barney" Billingsworth needed on a Tuesday morning already threatening to unravel. He winced, pressing his forehead against the cool, grime-slicked metal of the water pipe. His wrench, the damn thing, had slipped again.

"Just breathe, Barney," he muttered, his voice muffled by the cramped space under Mrs. Higgins' sink. "Just breathe, and don't think about the overflowing toilet, the leaking faucet, or the fact that you’re probably going to miss your nephew’s school play again."

He took a shaky breath, laced with the distinct aroma of damp drywall and mildew, and repositioned himself. This wasn't just any plumbing job; this was the infernal Higgins House, a Victorian monstrosity that seemed to actively fight against modern plumbing with every creak and groan of its ancient bones.

## Setting:

The Higgins House was a three-story Victorian on Willow Creek Drive, in the sleepy, almost forgotten town of Havenwood. The house itself was a study in faded grandeur. Peeling paint clung to the ornate gingerbread trim like stubborn memories, and the sprawling, overgrown garden seemed to swallow the property whole. Ivy, thick as a python, snaked up the walls, obscuring stained glass windows that hinted at a bygone era of wealth and elegance. A rusty weather vane, shaped like a whimsical rooster, perpetually pointed towards a perpetually cloudy sky.

Inside, the house was a labyrinth of narrow hallways, dusty parlors filled with antique furniture shrouded in white sheets, and echoing staircases. The air hung thick with the scent of mothballs and decaying wood. The kitchen, where Barnaby currently wrestled with the rogue plumbing, was a particularly egregious example of Victorian neglect. The chipped linoleum floor was a chaotic pattern of brown and avocado green, and the cabinetry, though beautifully crafted, sagged under the weight of years and disuse. The only signs of recent life were a half-empty cup of tea, lukewarm and stale, and a scattering of crumbs on the counter, evidence of Mrs. Higgins' erratic snacking habits.
