## Opening:

The rain was a greasy curtain against the neon glow of "Big Tony's Rib Joint," each drop reflecting the sickly yellow light like a distorted mirror. Inside, the aroma of smoked pork and desperation hung heavy in the air. That's where I found him, slumped in a vinyl booth, a half-eaten rack of ribs congealing in front of him like a crime scene. He looked like he’d been chewed up and spat out by the city itself. And judging by the dark circles under his bloodshot eyes, he probably had been.

He’d called me, a garbled message left on my answering machine, something about a missing necklace and a woman in trouble. It was the kind of vague cry for help that drew me like a moth to a flickering flame. Not because I was a saint, or even particularly good at my job, but because sometimes, being needed was the only thing that kept the demons at bay. I cleared my throat, the sound echoing in the almost empty diner.

"Mr. Deluca?" I asked, my voice a rusty rasp after a day spent chasing shadows and broken promises. He barely registered my presence, his gaze fixed on some distant point beyond the rain-streaked window.

## Setting:

The story is set in the fictional city of **New Auburn**, a sprawling metropolis on the Eastern Seaboard, heavily influenced by both New York City and Philadelphia. New Auburn is a city of stark contrasts: gleaming skyscrapers cast long shadows over crumbling brownstones, and fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye. The city is notorious for its corrupt politicians, its thriving underground scene, and its stubborn resistance to change. Despite its grit and grime, New Auburn possesses a certain gritty charm, a palpable energy that pulsates beneath the surface, drawing in dreamers, schemers, and those with something to prove.

## Main Character:

The main character is a private detective named **Eleanor "Ellie" Vance.** Ellie is a woman in her late thirties, hardened by years on the streets but still carrying a flicker of idealism beneath her cynical exterior. She is a skilled investigator with a sharp mind and a knack for observation, but her personal life is a tangled mess of broken relationships and lingering regrets. She operates out of a small, cluttered office above a laundromat in the working-class neighborhood of Kensington, relying on a network of informants and a healthy dose of street smarts to solve her cases. Her trademark is a worn leather jacket, a pack of unfiltered cigarettes, and a dry wit that can cut through the thickest tension.
