The air in "The Sea Serpent's Sigh" hung thick and heavy, a humid broth of frying calamari, spilled beer, and the faint, lingering scent of desperation. Barnacles clung to the outside of the weathered clapboard building like stubborn memories, and the chipped, neon sign flickered intermittently, promising "FRESH SEAFOOD!" above the less-than-fresh reality within. The clatter of silverware, the booming laughter of fishermen celebrating a good catch (or drowning their sorrows after a bad one), and the mournful foghorn echoing from the harbor created a chaotic symphony that was as familiar to Genevieve Marie Dubois as her own heartbeat.

Genevieve, wiping down a sticky table with practiced efficiency, could practically navigate the narrow aisles blindfolded. She knew which floorboards creaked the loudest, which booths had the springs worn down, and which customers were likely to leave a generous tip versus the ones who'd complain about the price of the coleslaw. This Friday night was particularly brutal, the usual weekend rush amplified by a visiting yacht club in town for some sort of regatta. Each order she took, each plate she balanced precariously, was another small victory against the tide of chaos threatening to engulf her. She just needed to make it through the shift, count her tips, and maybe, just maybe, afford that new pair of boots she'd been eyeing in the window of the general store.
