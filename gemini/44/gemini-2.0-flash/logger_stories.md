## Story Opening

The first crack splintered through the pre-dawn air like a gunshot, echoing off the frosted peaks of the Cascade Mountains. Bartholomew "Bart" Finnigan spat a wad of chewing tobacco onto the snow-dusted ground, his breath puffing out in a white cloud. The sound had come from up the slope, the telltale sign of another giant bowing to gravity and the relentless bite of steel. Bart tugged at his thick, wool beanie, the familiar scratch comforting against the biting wind. Today was going to be a long one.

## Setting

The setting is a remote logging camp nestled high in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State in the late autumn. Towering Douglas firs and hemlocks, some hundreds of years old, loom over everything, their thick branches laden with a fresh dusting of snow. The air is perpetually cold and crisp, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. The camp itself is a rough-and-tumble collection of hastily constructed wooden cabins and sheds, clustered around a central mess hall. Heavy machinery - skidders, loaders, and chainsaws - sit idle, waiting for the day's work. A constant hum permeates the air, the low drone of generators struggling against the relentless cold to provide power to the camp. The ground is a muddy mess, churned by the constant passage of boots and heavy equipment, and marked with the tracks of deer and the occasional elk. Beyond the immediate clearing of the camp, the forest stretches out, a vast and unforgiving wilderness that both sustains and threatens the lives of the men who make their living within its embrace.
