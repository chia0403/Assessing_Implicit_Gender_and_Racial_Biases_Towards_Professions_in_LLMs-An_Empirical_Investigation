## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The rain hammered against the oversized windows of Dr. Amelia Chen's office, blurring the neon glow of the city skyline beyond. Her practice, "Clarity & Compassion Psychological Services," occupied the 17th floor of a pre-war building in the heart of Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood. The room itself was carefully curated: warm, inviting, and designed to inspire trust. A plush, oatmeal-colored sofa faced two comfortable armchairs, separated by a low mahogany coffee table adorned with a carefully arranged bouquet of lilies. Soft instrumental music, barely audible over the rhythmic drumming of the rain, filled the air.

**Opening:**

Dr. Amelia Chen, a clinical psychologist with a PhD in interpersonal neurobiology and a messy bun perpetually threatening to unravel, chewed on the end of her pen, her gaze fixed on the clock above the door. It was 6:58 PM. Two minutes. Two minutes until her last patient of the day, and quite possibly the most challenging one she'd encountered in her fifteen years of practice.

The email she'd received from the referral source, Dr. Evelyn Reed, still echoed in her mind: "Regarding Mr. Silas Blackwood. Highly intelligent. Profoundly disturbed. Approach with caution." Reed's curt tone hadn't exactly filled Amelia with confidence, but something about the case, the faint scent of desperation clinging to the words, had piqued her curiosity. Now, staring at the clock and listening to the furious rain, she wasn't so sure about that curiosity. She pushed back from her desk, the worn leather of her chair creaking in protest. Maybe she should have stuck to treating anxiety disorders. This Silas Blackwood felt different. This feltâ€¦ dangerous.
