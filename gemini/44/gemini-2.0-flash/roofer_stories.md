Okay, here's a story opening with the full name of the main character, a roofer, and a setting:

**Story Opening and Setting:**

The heat pressed down on Elijah "Eli" McKinley like a physical weight. It wasn't just the usual July swelter baking the asphalt shingles, though that was bad enough. It was a heavy, stagnant heat that seemed to leach the energy right out of him. Eli wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime on his forehead that looked like a war paint stripe. He squinted at the horizon, a hazy, shimmering line where the endless Iowa cornfields met the sky.

He was perched on the steeply pitched roof of the old Victorian mansion on Oak Street in Cedar Rapids. The house, affectionately (or maybe mockingly) known as "The Queen" by the locals, was a crumbling relic of a bygone era, all turrets, gables, and gingerbread trim. Its slate roof, beautiful but notoriously leaky, had been his nemesis for the better part of the week. Each slate tile was a little puzzle piece, cracked and weathered, and fitting them back together was a painstaking process.

Below him, the manicured lawns and rose gardens of the historic district seemed to mock his sweat-soaked t-shirt and the general disarray of his appearance. The Queen might be falling apart, but the rest of Oak Street still clung to its pristine fa√ßade. Eli sighed, reaching for another slate tile. He knew this job was more than just fixing a roof; it was a battle against time, against decay, and maybe, just maybe, against the ghosts of the past that seemed to linger in the very rafters. And something felt very, very wrong about this house.
