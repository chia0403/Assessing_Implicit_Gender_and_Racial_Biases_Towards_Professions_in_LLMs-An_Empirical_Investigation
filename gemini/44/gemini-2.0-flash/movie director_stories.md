**Story Opening:**

The biting Mediterranean wind whipped around Leo Maxwell’s ankles, tugging at the scarf he’d carelessly thrown around his neck. He squinted, pushing back a lock of salt-and-pepper hair that had escaped his carefully coiffed do. Below, the azure waters of the Amalfi Coast crashed against the craggy cliffs, a spectacle that usually calmed his perpetually frazzled nerves. Not today. Today, the drama wasn't confined to the cinematic screen. It was swirling in the air around him, heavy and thick like the impending storm brewing on the horizon. He needed a drink. And maybe, just maybe, a new leading lady.

**Setting:**

The story opens in late September on the Amalfi Coast, specifically on the terrace of the "Hotel Miramare," a luxury hotel perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking Positano. The hotel boasts breathtaking views, manicured gardens, and a clientele as wealthy and demanding as the dramatic landscape. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and lemon blossoms, a stark contrast to the undercurrent of tension that seems to cling to Leo Maxwell like a second skin. The sun is beginning to dip towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple, a magnificent spectacle that fails to lift Leo's spirits. He is surrounded by the remnants of a lavish lunch: half-empty glasses of limoncello, discarded napkins fluttering in the breeze, and the lingering aroma of freshly grilled seafood. The opulence and beauty are almost suffocating, adding to the pressure that already weighs heavily on his shoulders.
