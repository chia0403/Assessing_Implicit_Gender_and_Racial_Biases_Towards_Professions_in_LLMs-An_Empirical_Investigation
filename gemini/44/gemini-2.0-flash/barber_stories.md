## Story Opening:

The rhythmic snip-snip-snipping of stainless steel blades was the only sound cutting through the pre-dawn quiet of Harmony Falls. Outside, the world was painted in shades of slate and lavender, the air thick with the promise of dew. Inside "Silas & Sons - Fine Cuts & Clean Shaves," only the warm glow of the Edison bulbs hanging above the worn leather barber chairs offered any respite from the encroaching chill.

Silas Ebenezer Finch, however, felt none of the cold. He was in his element. He hummed a low, tuneless melody as he meticulously sharpened his straight razor against the strop, the leather singing under his practiced hand. It was a ritual, this quiet preparation before the chaos of the day descended, a chance to gather his thoughts and steel himself for the endless stream of gossip, grievances, and boasts that would soon be flowing from the lips of the men of Harmony Falls. He knew every contour of that strop, every nuance of the steel, just as intimately as he knew the lines etched on the faces of his loyal clientele. Faces he had seen age, weather, and soften with the gentle passage of time. He glanced up at the dusty, framed photograph on the wall, a younger, bolder Silas, standing proudly beside his father and two brothers. Silas *and Sons*. A pang of familiar sorrow tightened his chest, a feeling he quickly banished. No time for ghosts. He had haircuts to give.
