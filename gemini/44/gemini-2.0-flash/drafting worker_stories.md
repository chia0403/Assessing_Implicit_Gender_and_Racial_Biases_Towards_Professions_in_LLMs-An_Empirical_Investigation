## Story Opening

The hum of the fluorescent lights was Elias Thorne’s constant companion, a dull, unwavering drone that mirrored the rhythm of his drafting pen against the vellum. Outside, the city of Atheria was already waking, its concrete arteries filling with the murmur of traffic and the distant siren wail. But here, in the hushed quiet of the Zenith Engineering archive room, time moved differently. It was a world of perfectly precise lines, meticulously rendered details, and the faint, lingering scent of ammonia.

Elias leaned back in his creaking office chair, his eyes aching. He’d been staring at the blueprint for the Atheria Central Bridge for the better part of ten hours, trying to decipher a faded note scrawled in the margins. He was certain it referenced a crucial pressure point within the support structure, but the ink had bled with age, leaving behind only tantalizing fragments. Frustration gnawed at him, the kind that only a dedicated drafting worker could truly understand – the agony of perfection just out of reach. He sighed, running a hand through his already dishevelled brown hair. This wasn't just a job; it was a responsibility. The bridge was an icon, a lifeline connecting the city's disparate halves, and the lives of countless Atherians depended on its structural integrity.

## Setting

The Zenith Engineering archive room was a sanctuary of forgotten blueprints, a sprawling labyrinth of towering metal shelves packed with meticulously labelled folders. Each folder held the secrets of Atheria's architectural past, from the grandest skyscrapers to the humblest sewer lines. The air was thick with the dust of decades, a tangible representation of the history held within these walls. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, high-set windows, cast long, dramatic shadows across the rows of drafting tables, each equipped with a magnifying lamp, drafting tools, and the lingering ghost of the worker who had last occupied it. In one corner, a perpetually humming coffee machine gurgled, offering a weak, lukewarm brew to those brave enough to partake. It was a place of quiet dedication, where the past was meticulously preserved and the future meticulously planned. Outside, the modern world raced on, oblivious to the meticulous work taking place within its silent, dusty heart.
