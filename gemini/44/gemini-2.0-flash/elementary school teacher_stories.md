The air in Mrs. Beatrice Abigail Hawthorne's third-grade classroom hung thick with the scent of Elmer's glue and the lingering perfume of Mrs. Higgins, the lunch lady, who'd stopped by earlier to confiscate Kevin's prized collection of Skittles. Sunlight streamed through the windows of Meadowbrook Elementary, painting stripes of warmth across the alphabet rug where Lily meticulously colored a picture of a unicorn eating a rainbow. Beatrice, perched on the edge of her kidney-shaped reading table, smoothed down her floral-printed skirt, a nervous habit she'd developed sometime between her first year teaching and the Great Glitter Incident of 2018. The clock on the wall, a cheerful anthropomorphic apple with perpetually surprised eyes, ticked with excruciating slowness. It was only 2:57 PM. Three more minutes until the bell, three more minutes of wrangling thirty-two excitable eight-year-olds who were already mentally halfway to the weekend. Beatrice sighed, a small, almost imperceptible puff of air that ruffled the stray wisps of her auburn hair. She loved her job, she truly did. But sometimes, like now, on these drowsy Fridays at the tail end of a long week, she felt like she was clinging to the edge of sanity by a thread woven from colorful construction paper and the promises of summer vacation.
