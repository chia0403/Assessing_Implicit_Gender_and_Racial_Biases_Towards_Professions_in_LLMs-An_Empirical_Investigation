The scent of pressed wool and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had been ingrained in Bartholomew Finch's very being since he was a lad barely tall enough to reach the bottom drawer of his father’s pattern chest. Now, at the age of fifty-two, Bartholomew Finch presided over “Finch & Son, Tailors - Established 1898”, a tiny shop nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of York. The "Son" part was long gone, claimed by the Great War, but Bartholomew refused to alter the sign. It felt like erasing a piece of young Thomas, a boy who'd dreamed of fitting dukes and designing daring new waistcoat patterns.

Sunlight, filtered through the dusty lace curtains of the shop window, illuminated rows of spools in every conceivable shade, reflecting off the burnished brass fittings of Bartholomew’s trusty Singer sewing machine. Bolts of tweed, velvet, and linen stood stacked high along the walls, each fabric whispering tales of country estates, grand balls, and quiet evenings by the fire. Outside, the medieval city bustled with tourists snapping pictures of the York Minster and locals hurrying to market, oblivious to the meticulous artistry happening within the walls of Bartholomew's quiet haven. He, however, felt a pang of loneliness in the constant quiet. Lately, business had been slow, and even the familiar comfort of his craft couldn't quite dispel the nagging feeling that time, like an unraveled seam, was slipping away.
