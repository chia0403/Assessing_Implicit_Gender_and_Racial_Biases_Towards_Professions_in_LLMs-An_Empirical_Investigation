Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and the main character's full name:

**Setting:** The sprawling, pre-dawn metropolis of New Alexandria. Rain slicks the streets, reflecting the neon glow of late-night eateries and the flashing blue and red of emergency vehicles. The air is thick with the smell of exhaust, damp concrete, and the faint undercurrent of the sea just a few blocks away.

**Opening:**

The siren's wail, a banshee scream cutting through the urban symphony, was barely audible over the rhythmic *thump-thump* of the helicopter blades. Inside the MedEvac chopper, Dr. Evelyn Grace Ramirez braced against the turbulence, her gloved hands tightening on the gurney strap. Below, the city was a glittering labyrinth of lights, a network of arteries pumping life and, sometimes, death.

"ETA two minutes, Doctor," the pilot's voice crackled through her headset. "MVA on the Westside Viaduct. Multiple casualties reported. Looks messy."

Evelyn nodded, her gaze fixed on the approaching scene â€“ a twisted mass of metal and flashing emergency lights staining the dark horizon. She felt the familiar surge of adrenaline, the cold, focused calm that always settled over her before plunging into the chaos. Tonight, like so many other nights, she was the thin line between oblivion and a second chance. Tonight, Evelyn Grace Ramirez was going to fight.
