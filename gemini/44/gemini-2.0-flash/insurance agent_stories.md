The incessant drone of the fluorescent lights buzzed in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's ears, a soundtrack to the mundane symphony of her life. Rain lashed against the plate glass window of Hawthorne Insurance, blurring the already grey cityscape of Pittsburgh into an impressionistic wash of concrete and steel. It was Tuesday, 2:17 PM, and the only thing less inspiring than the weather was the stack of renewal applications sitting on her desk, each one a testament to the predictable, and often frustrating, realities of life. Amelia, however, found a strange comfort in the routine. Order, after all, was a bulwark against the chaos she sensed simmering just beneath the surface of things.

Hawthorne Insurance occupied a modest, though surprisingly prime, piece of real estate on Grant Street. Nestled between a struggling bakery and a perpetually vacant storefront promising “Artisan Leather Goods - Coming Soon!”, it was a bastion of beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, beige desks, all reflecting the unwavering commitment to neutrality that Amelia had carefully cultivated throughout her career. The only splash of color came from the wilting peace lily on the receptionist’s desk and the occasional, brightly colored brochure showcasing exotic travel destinations that were as far removed from Amelia's life as the moon. Today, however, the rain-streaked windows seemed to drain even the beige of its meager vibrance, leaving Amelia feeling as grey and damp as the city outside.
