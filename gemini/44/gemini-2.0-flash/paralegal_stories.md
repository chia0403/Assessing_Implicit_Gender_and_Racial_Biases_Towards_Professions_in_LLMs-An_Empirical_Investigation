Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a paralegal named:

**Story Opening:**

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Cassandra "Cassie" Bellwether's hands, but did little to thaw the icy knot in her stomach.  The rain outside was mimicking her mood, a relentless, grey drizzle that smeared the sodium glow of the streetlights across the rain-streaked windows of the 27th floor.  She took a long, shuddering sip of the lukewarm coffee – a habit she'd picked up from countless late nights spent deciphering legalese and chasing down obscure precedents for Mr. Abernathy – and stared at the stack of documents threatening to topple onto her already cluttered desk.  Tonight's task: finding the smoking gun in the Johnson & Miller merger.  The whole thing smelled fishy, like a week-old grouper left out in the Florida sun, and Cassie had a feeling Abernathy knew it too.  He just needed her to prove it, and preferably, before the SEC started poking around with their own team of overpaid lawyers.  Suddenly, her phone buzzed, the screen flashing the name of the person she least wanted to talk to: her mother.
**Setting:**

Cassie Bellwether works as a paralegal at the prestigious law firm of Abernathy, Sterling, & Finch, LLP, located in the heart of downtown Miami. The firm occupies several floors of a gleaming skyscraper, boasting panoramic views of Biscayne Bay and the vibrant cityscape. The offices are a study in corporate modernism: sleek glass, polished steel, and minimalist furniture punctuated by expensive artwork that Cassie suspects nobody actually looks at. Abernathy, Sterling, & Finch specializes in high-stakes corporate law, primarily mergers and acquisitions, and attracts a clientele of wealthy corporations and influential individuals. Cassie's specific workspace is a small, cramped office tucked away in a corner of the "Associate's Wing," barely big enough for her overflowing desk, a towering bookcase crammed with legal textbooks and files, and a temperamental computer that periodically threatens to crash during crucial moments. It feels a world away from the opulent partners' offices she occasionally glimpses during her endless coffee runs.
