The clock on the wall of "The Remedy Shoppe" chimed a melancholic seven times, each chime echoing in the quiet of the already-dark street outside. Behind the counter, Elias Thorne, a man whose perpetually tired eyes were the colour of weak tea, sighed and began tidying the shelves. He ran a calloused hand over a row of amber-coloured bottles, his fingers lingering on a vial of elderflower syrup, remembering his grandmother’s recipe. The Remedy Shoppe, located on the corner of Willow Creek and Elderberry Lane in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine, was his sanctuary, his burden, and his inheritance all rolled into one. Havenwood was a place where time seemed to move slower, where gossip travelled faster than the tide, and where everyone knew everyone else’s business. It was also a place where Elias felt perpetually stuck, caught between the ghost of his father who’d run the shop before him, and the yearning for something more that simmered just beneath the surface of his carefully controlled life. Tonight, a storm was brewing, the air thick with the promise of rain, mirroring the unsettling feeling that had been nagging at Elias all day. He just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to disrupt the quiet rhythm of Havenwood, and of his life.
