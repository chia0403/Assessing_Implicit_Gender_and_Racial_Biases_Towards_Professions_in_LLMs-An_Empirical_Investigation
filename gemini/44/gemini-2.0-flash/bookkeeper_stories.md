The fluorescent lights of Peterson & Sons Accounting hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the ceaseless clatter of adding machines and the rustle of tax forms. Mildred Abigail Weatherby, bookkeeper extraordinaire, barely registered it anymore. She was lost in a sea of numbers, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously tracked the expenditures of Old Man Hemlock's goat farm.

Her fingers, slightly arthritic but still nimble, danced across the keys of her well-worn calculator. Mildred preferred the physical click-clack to the silent tap of a computer. It felt more real, somehow, more tangible. Like she was actually wrangling the chaos of finance into something neat and orderly, something that made sense.

The setting was decidedly unglamorous. Peterson & Sons occupied the second floor of a brick building overlooking Main Street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Iowa. The office d√©cor hadn't been updated since the early eighties, a testament to Mr. Peterson Senior's pragmatic nature. Think faded floral wallpaper, mismatched office chairs scavenged from various yard sales, and a pervasive aroma of stale coffee and dust motes. Mildred's own desk, tucked away in a corner by the water cooler, was a meticulously organized fortress of ledgers, receipts, and color-coded sticky notes. It was her sanctuary, a small island of order in a sea of financial ambiguity. Outside, the relentless Iowan summer sun beat down, but Mildred barely noticed. She was in her element, surrounded by numbers, unraveling the mysteries of debits and credits. And right now, the mystery was why Old Man Hemlock had listed a suspiciously large expenditure for "goat hats."
