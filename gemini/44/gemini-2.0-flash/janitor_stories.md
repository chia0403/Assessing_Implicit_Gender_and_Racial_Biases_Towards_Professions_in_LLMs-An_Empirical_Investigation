Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, featuring a janitor named Arthur Penhaligon:

**Setting:** The Museum of Forgotten Wonders, a rambling, dust-choked edifice in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The museum’s glory days are long past, its exhibits a bizarre collection of moth-eaten taxidermy, chipped porcelain dolls, and vaguely disturbing artifacts donated by the eccentric descendants of the town's founding families. The air is thick with the scent of old wood, beeswax polish, and a faint, unsettling aroma that Arthur had long ago decided was simply "forgotten magic." The grand, echoing halls are perpetually dim, lit mostly by flickering gas lamps that hiss and sigh like restless spirits.

**Opening:**

Arthur Penhaligon, his thinning grey hair plastered to his forehead with a film of sweat, wrestled with the stubborn latch of the antique vacuum cleaner. He swore softly under his breath, a string of almost-forgotten Cornish curses his grandmother had taught him. The Museum of Forgotten Wonders, his domain for the past twenty years, was particularly stubborn tonight. Dust bunnies the size of small cats scurried across the floor, illuminated by the ghostly glow of the gas lamps, daring him to catch them. It wasn't just dust, though. Arthur had a feeling, a tingling at the back of his neck, that the museum was more restless than usual. He’d felt it all day, a low hum beneath the floorboards, a whisper carried on the drafts that snaked through the halls. Usually, the museum only stirred like this when a new, particularly potent artifact was brought in. But no new donations had arrived in weeks. Tonight, the forgotten wonders felt less forgotten, and more…awakened.
