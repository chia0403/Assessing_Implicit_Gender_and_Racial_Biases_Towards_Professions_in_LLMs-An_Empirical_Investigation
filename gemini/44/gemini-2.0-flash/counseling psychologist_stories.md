Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun, already beginning its descent, cast long, melancholic shadows across the worn Persian rug in Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office. The room, usually a sanctuary of calm, felt particularly heavy today. Her practice, nestled above a quaint bakery in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina, was a carefully curated haven of tranquility. Muted teal walls, soft lighting from antique lamps, and the gentle trickle of a small indoor fountain usually worked their magic, soothing anxieties and loosening tongues. But today, even the familiar comfort seemed to cling to the air like humidity.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth leaned back in her worn leather armchair, the springs groaning a faint protest. The scent of lavender, usually a comforting presence, felt almost cloying. Outside, the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages echoed on the cobblestones below, a sound that normally soothed her, but today only amplified the feeling of being trapped. Her last client of the day, a bright, anxious college student named Chloe, had left only moments ago, her anxieties temporarily abated after a session focused on stress-reducing mindfulness techniques. But Eleanor, despite her best efforts to compartmentalize, found herself unable to shake the residual tension. Chloe's worries, however mundane they seemed, had stirred something unsettling within her. It was a familiar disquiet, a sense of being adrift in a sea of other people's emotions, and recently, her own.

The blinking cursor on her laptop screen mocked her. She was supposed to be writing a chapter for a new self-help book on overcoming codependency, a topic on which she was supposed to be an expert. Yet, the words felt hollow, like borrowed phrases that had lost their meaning. She pushed away from the desk, the chair scraping against the floor, and walked to the window. The vibrant colors of the marketplace below, vendors packing up their wares for the day, momentarily distracted her. But even the beauty of Charleston at dusk couldn't quite penetrate the growing sense of unease that had been clinging to her for weeks. It was more than just professional burnout. It feltâ€¦personal. And that was a feeling Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman dedicated to understanding the depths of the human psyche, found herself increasingly ill-equipped to handle.
