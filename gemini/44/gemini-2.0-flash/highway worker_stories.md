Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a highway worker:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped across the asphalt of Interstate 80, just east of Laramie, Wyoming. It was a late October afternoon, the sun already beginning its descent behind the jagged peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains. Patches of stubbornly clinging snow lined the shoulders, a stark reminder of the early, ferocious winter that Wyoming was already bracing for. The highway itself was mostly clear, though a greasy sheen of road salt and grit coated the blacktop, promising treacherous conditions if the temperature dropped even a few more degrees. The air smelled of diesel exhaust, pine needles, and the faint, metallic tang of approaching snow. A lone raven, perched atop a twisted metal guardrail, watched the human activity below with a cynical eye.

**Story Opening:**

"Damn, another one," grumbled Eugene "Gene" Franklin Riley, his breath puffing out in a cloud of white against the frigid air. He kicked at a shredded tire carcass lying half-buried in the gravel along the shoulder. The rubber was hard and brittle, almost fossilized from months of exposure to the relentless Wyoming weather. Gene, his face weathered like a well-worn saddle, leaned on his orange-handled shovel, watching the steady stream of semi-trucks roar past, their air brakes hissing like angry snakes. He tugged the brim of his reflective yellow hard hat lower, shielding his eyes from the glare of the late-afternoon sun. This stretch of I-80 was known for its blowouts and accidents, and Gene, a highway maintenance worker for the Wyoming Department of Transportation for over twenty years, had seen more than his fair share of both. He hoisted the tire carcass onto his shovel, the effort causing a twinge in his lower back that reminded him he wasn't getting any younger. "Just another day in paradise," he muttered, before heading back towards the bright orange maintenance truck, its flashing lights a beacon against the gathering gloom.
