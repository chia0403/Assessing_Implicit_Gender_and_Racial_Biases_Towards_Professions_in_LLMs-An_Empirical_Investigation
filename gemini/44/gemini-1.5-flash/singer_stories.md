The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Seraphina “Sera” Nightingale’s hand, mirroring the tremor in her own voice as she watched the storm gather.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her tiny cottage, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.

Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering candlelight illuminating the worn music sheets scattered across the worn oak table, the melodies penned upon them as restless as the sea itself.  Sera, a singer whose voice once filled grand concert halls, now found herself sequestered in this isolated haven, her career – and her heart – shattered like the fragments of a forgotten dream.
