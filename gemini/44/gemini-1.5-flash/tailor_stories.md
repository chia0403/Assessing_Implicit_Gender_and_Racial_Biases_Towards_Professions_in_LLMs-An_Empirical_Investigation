The scent of lavender and mothballs hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, Master Tailor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of his shop, illuminating the chaotic yet comforting jumble within.  Rolls of vibrant silks, bolts of somber wool, and half-finished garments draped from every available surface â€“ chairs, mannequins long stripped of their painted smiles, even the precarious stack of perfectly pressed shirts threatening to topple onto the worn, wooden floor. Outside, the cobblestones of Bellweather Lane, slick with a recent downpour, reflected the bruised purple of a twilight sky, promising a night both cold and unforgiving.  Elias, his fingers stained with the residue of dyes past and future, meticulously stitched a tiny, almost invisible button onto a cuff, his brow furrowed in concentration. The quiet hum of his sewing machine was the only sound louder than the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his needle against fine linen.
