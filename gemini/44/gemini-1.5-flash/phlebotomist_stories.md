The fluorescent lights of the Redwood City Community Hospital hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Jean Cartwright's own pulse.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with eyes the color of faded denim and hands that moved with a practiced grace that belied their occasional tremor, meticulously checked the requisition slips. The sterile scent of antiseptic, usually a comforting constant, tonight felt sharp, almost aggressive, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the hospital windows, each drop a tiny, frantic percussion on the glass, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  She was short-staffed, already running behind, and the next patient on her list was notorious â€“  Mr. Silas Blackwood, a man whose veins seemed to vanish at the mere suggestion of a needle.
