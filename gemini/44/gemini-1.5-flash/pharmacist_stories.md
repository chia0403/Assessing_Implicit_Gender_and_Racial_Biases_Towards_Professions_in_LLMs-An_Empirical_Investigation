The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar felt cool against Elara Vance’s fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering gas lamp above, danced in the stagnant air of Vance Apothecary, a scent of dried herbs and aged parchment clinging to every surface.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the building, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Elara’s heart.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven were slick and deserted; a storm, both meteorological and metaphorical, raged through the town.  Inside, however, the only sound besides the rain was the soft hiss of Elara's breath as she meticulously examined the contents of the jar: a collection of iridescent, almost otherworldly, blue crystals.  This wasn't just any prescription; this was a request from Silas Blackwood, the town recluse and notorious collector of arcane artifacts, and Elara had a nagging feeling that filling it might just be the most dangerous decision of her life.
