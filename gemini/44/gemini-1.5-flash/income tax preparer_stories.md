The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's Tax Solutions hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  Mildred, a woman whose age was a carefully guarded secret (somewhere comfortably between fifty-five and sixty-five, she'd always say), perched on a stool so worn the vinyl was practically threadbare.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the air above the overflowing filing cabinets that lined the walls of her tiny office, each drawer bulging with the financial anxieties of her clients.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee, printer ink, and the lingering scent of fear – the kind of fear that accompanied the arrival of April 15th.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the sycamore trees that guarded the parking lot of the strip mall, a fitting soundtrack to the impending tax season deadline.  This year, however, felt different.  A cold dread, sharper than the usual pre-deadline jitters, coiled in Mildred's stomach. It wasn't the sheer volume of paperwork, though that was certainly substantial.  No, this felt…personal.
