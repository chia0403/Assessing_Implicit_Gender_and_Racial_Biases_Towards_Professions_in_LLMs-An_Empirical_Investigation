The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  She adjusted the tiny, almost invisible earpiece nestled in her hair, the faint hiss of static a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the Boeing 747’s engines.  Outside, a bruised purple sunset bled across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, painting the clouds in strokes of fiery orange and deep violet.  Inside, the cabin was a hushed chaos of dimmed lights, the gentle hum of conversation a stark contrast to the storm raging just beneath the surface – a storm of anxieties, expectations, and the lingering scent of expensive perfume and duty-free liquor.  Sera, perched on the jump seat in the galley, idly polished a already gleaming cocktail shaker, her gaze drifting towards the flickering city lights of Honolulu, a constellation of hope and escape spread across the velvet night.  Tonight’s flight from Tokyo to Honolulu was her last before a much-needed three-week break – a break she desperately needed, a break she couldn’t quite believe was finally here.
