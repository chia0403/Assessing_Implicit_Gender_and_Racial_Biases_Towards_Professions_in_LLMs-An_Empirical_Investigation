The clatter of the morning market – a symphony of bartering voices, the rhythmic thud of cleavers on wooden blocks, and the pungent perfume of a thousand spices – was Aurelia "Rella" Castiglione's alarm clock.  Rella, a chef whose reputation in the sun-drenched coastal town of Positano was as vibrant as the bougainvillea cascading down the whitewashed buildings, woke to the sounds with a contented sigh.  The air, thick with the salt spray from the Tyrrhenian Sea and the sweet scent of ripening lemons, drifted through the open window of her tiny, sun-drenched apartment perched precariously on the cliffside.  Below, the turquoise water lapped gently against the rocks, a constant, reassuring rhythm to the chaotic energy of her day.  Today, however, the usual tranquility was shattered by a frantic knocking at her door, a sound that promised anything but a peaceful start to Rella's culinary symphony.
