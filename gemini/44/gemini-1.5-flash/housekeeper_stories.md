The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Elara Vance's scrubbing.  Steam, thick and fragrant with lemon and pine, clung to the already damp air of the Blackwood Manor kitchen.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Elara’s movements.  Outside, the ancient oaks of the Blackwood estate clawed at the sky, their branches gnarled and skeletal against the bruised purple twilight.  Inside, the cavernous kitchen, usually a comforting haven, felt oppressive, the shadows stretching long and menacing across the polished oak floor.  This wasn't the usual pre-dinner rush; tonight, something felt… different. A prickling unease settled on Elara's skin, colder than the damp chill clinging to the stone walls.  The silence, broken only by the storm and the rhythmic scrape of her sponge, was a silence pregnant with unspoken dread.
