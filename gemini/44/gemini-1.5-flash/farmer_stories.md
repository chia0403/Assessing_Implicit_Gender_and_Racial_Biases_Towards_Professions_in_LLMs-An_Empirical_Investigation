The rasping cough that wracked Elias Thorne's body was as familiar as the smell of turned earth clinging to his worn overalls.  He spat a glob of phlegm onto the frost-covered ground, the spittle instantly freezing.  The pre-dawn sky over the Thorne family farm, nestled deep within the valley of Whispering Pines, bled from bruised purple to a hesitant, watery grey.  This wasn't the gentle grey of a spring sunrise, however; this was the unforgiving grey of a late November morning promising another day of biting wind and relentless snow.  The air, thin and sharp, stung his lungs, a painful counterpoint to the dull ache that settled in his bones with the coming of each winter.  The farmhouse, a weathered grey clapboard structure hunched against the onslaught of the elements, looked like a weary old dog, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the bleak landscape. Elias knew, with a chilling certainty, that this winter would be the harshest yet.
