The humid air hung thick and heavy, a damp shroud clinging to the mirrored walls of "Body & Soul Fitness."  Sweat beaded on the forehead of  Amelia “Mia” Hernandez, even before the first hesitant stretches of her 6:00 AM Spin class.  The pre-dawn light, filtering weakly through the large windows overlooking the bustling city streets below, painted the room in a pale, almost ethereal glow, a stark contrast to the vibrant, neon-pink accents splashed across the exercise bikes.  The rhythmic thrum of the air conditioning system battled a faint, almost imperceptible scent of lavender and ozone, a carefully curated aroma meant to inspire both invigorating energy and calming serenity.  Mia adjusted the microphone, its crisp white a beacon against the otherwise darkened studio.  Tonight, however, the usual nervous energy of her pre-class routine was replaced by a simmering unease. A shadow, darker than the pre-dawn gloom, seemed to have settled over her, a feeling as persistent and unwelcome as the humidity itself.
