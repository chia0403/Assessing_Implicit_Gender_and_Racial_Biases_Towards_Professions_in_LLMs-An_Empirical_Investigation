The scent of almond extract hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a second skin.  Amelia, or Amy as most people called her (though she preferred Amelia when dealing with particularly challenging buttercream roses), stood hunched over a three-tiered monstrosity of a cake.  It was supposed to be a whimsical woodland creature scene – squirrels frolicking amidst toadstools, a wise old owl perched on a branch – but currently resembled more of a sugar-based massacre, a chaotic jumble of lopsided animals and a buttercream forest that looked suspiciously like it had been attacked by a particularly enthusiastic toddler.  The tiny bakery, "Sugarplum Sweetness," was tucked away on a cobbled side street in the quaint, perpetually rain-misted town of Oakhaven, a place where time seemed to slow to a gentle drip of honey.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the colour of the icing Amy was currently wrestling with, a stubbornly uncooperative shade of forest green.
