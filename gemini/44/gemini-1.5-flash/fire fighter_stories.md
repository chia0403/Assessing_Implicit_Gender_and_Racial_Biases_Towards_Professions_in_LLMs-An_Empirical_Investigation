The roar of the flames was a relentless beast, its hungry maw consuming everything in its path – a relentless symphony of crackling timber and hissing water.  Evie, her face streaked with soot and sweat, adjusted the straps of her helmet, the familiar weight grounding her amidst the chaos.  Tonight, the fight was personal.  This fire, unlike the others, threatened not just trees and underbrush, but also the fragile cabin nestled deep within the heart of the ancient redwood grove – a cabin that held more memories than she cared to count.
