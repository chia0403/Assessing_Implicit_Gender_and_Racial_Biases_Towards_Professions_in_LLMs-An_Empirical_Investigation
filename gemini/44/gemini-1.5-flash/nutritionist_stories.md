The chipped paint of the "Eat Your Greens" sign flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance's sensible, beige cardigan as a gust of wind whipped through the alley.  Rain, the kind that smelled of petrichor and impending doom, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of her tiny nutrition clinic, nestled precariously between a laundromat perpetually smelling of bleach and a tattoo parlor boasting a frankly alarming collection of skulls in its window.
