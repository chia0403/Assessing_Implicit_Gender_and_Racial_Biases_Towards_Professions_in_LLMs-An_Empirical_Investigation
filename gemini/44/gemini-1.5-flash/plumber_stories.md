The biting November wind whipped around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's ankles as he wrestled a recalcitrant drainpipe back into place.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered his thick, ginger beard to his chest.  Above him, the gables of Number 13 Grimstone Lane loomed, gothic and ominous even in the weak light of a late afternoon rapidly surrendering to dusk.  Grimstone Lane itself was a narrow, cobbled alleyway, choked with overflowing bins and the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  It was the kind of place where shadows lingered long after the sun had set, and where, Barty suspected, more than a few secrets were buried, quite literally, beneath the cobblestones.  He shivered, pulling his threadbare oilskins tighter â€“ the cold was nothing compared to the feeling of unease that clung to the air like the clinging November fog.
