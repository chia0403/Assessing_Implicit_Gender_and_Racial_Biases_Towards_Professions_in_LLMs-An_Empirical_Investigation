The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's day.  Amelia, meticulously organized even down to the perfectly aligned pens in her ceramic holder, tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against the polished mahogany of her reception desk.  The air, thick with the scent of expensive leather and faintly stale coffee, hung heavy in the opulent lobby.  Sunlight, filtered through the cityscape-view windows, glinted off the brass nameplates affixed to the solid oak doors leading to the partner's offices.  Outside, the cacophony of downtown Chicago roared, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost reverent silence Amelia maintained within her perfectly ordered kingdom.  This was her domain, the first line of defense against the chaos that invariably attempted to breach the fortress of Sterling & Steele.  And today, she had a feeling it was going to be a particularly brutal siege.
