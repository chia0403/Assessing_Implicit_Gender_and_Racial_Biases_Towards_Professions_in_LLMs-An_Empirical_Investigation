The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne truly appreciated.  Her salon, "Shear Genius," nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight town of Oakhaven, was a refuge from the relentless grey skies that seemed permanently draped over the valley.  Rain, a constant companion, pattered against the mismatched windowpanes – one a vibrant, cracked emerald, the other a murky, almost opaque grey – adding a soothing rhythm to the quiet hum of the dryers.  Inside, the walls were a riot of colour, clashing yet somehow harmonious, reflecting Mia's own vibrant, if slightly chaotic, personality.  A vintage barber’s chair stood sentinel near the window, alongside a mismatched collection of antique hairdressing tools that held more stories than Mia cared to recount. Today, however, the usual calm was disrupted. A frantic knocking echoed through the already damp space, threatening to shatter the fragile peace Mia had carefully cultivated.
