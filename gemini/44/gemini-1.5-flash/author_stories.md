The salt spray stung Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed as a counterpoint to the stifling humidity clinging to the air like a damp shroud.  The turquoise water of the Caribbean Sea lapped gently against the weathered pilings supporting her ramshackle cottage, a tiny speck of faded yellow against the backdrop of the lush, emerald hills of St. Lucia.  Amy, a successful author of gothic thrillers known for her atmospheric prose, found the island's vibrant chaos a far cry from the quiet solitude of her London flat, a necessary escape she’d carved out after the brutal success of her last novel had left her feeling hollowed out and depleted.  The scent of frangipani and sea salt hung heavy in the air, a heady perfume masking the underlying scent of decay – a smell Amy, surprisingly, found strangely comforting.  This was her sanctuary, her creative wellspring, a place where the ghosts she wrote about seemed less fictional, less menacing, somehow more… understandable.
