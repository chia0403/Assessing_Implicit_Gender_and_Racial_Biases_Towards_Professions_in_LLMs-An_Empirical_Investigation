The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the sticky linoleum floor.  A faint smell of stale coffee and something vaguely chemical hung in the air, a familiar perfume to Elara Vance, who stared blankly at the rotating display of discounted candy bars.  Elara, all sharp angles and tired eyes behind her nametag that read simply "Elara," was a cashier, and tonight felt particularly long, even by Quick Stop Mart standards.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the strip mall outside, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the glass.  The only other sound was the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner and the occasional sigh, hers more often than not.
