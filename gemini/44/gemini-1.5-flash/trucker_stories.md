The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful tune around Ezekiel “Zeke” Stone’s rig, a song only a long-haul trucker could truly understand.  Ice clung to the cab’s windows like frozen tears, obscuring the already dwindling light of a late November afternoon.  Zeke, his breath misting in the frigid air, wrestled with the stubborn latch on his thermos, the metal biting into his numb fingers.  He was stranded, miles from anywhere, on a stretch of I-80 known locally as Devil’s Backbone – a serpentine ribbon of asphalt that snaked through the desolate landscape, notorious for its treacherous conditions and even more treacherous inhabitants.  The radio crackled with static, offering no solace, only a chilling reminder of his isolation.  Ahead, the towering, snow-laden peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains loomed like jagged teeth, promising nothing but more hardship in the encroaching darkness.
