The salt spray stung Dr. Elias Thorne's face as the Coast Guard helicopter bucked violently in the churning grey sea.  Rain lashed down, blurring the already indistinct shoreline of the Outer Banks into a watercolour smear of grey and white.  Below, the battered fishing trawler, *The Wandering Star*, pitched precariously, its mast snapped clean off like a child's twig.  The faint, erratic strobe of its emergency beacon was barely visible through the deluge.  Elias gripped the side of the helicopter, the wind roaring in his ears a counterpoint to the frantic thump-thump-thump of the rotors.  He was soaked to the bone, adrenaline a bitter tang on his tongue. This wasnâ€™t his usual Tuesday afternoon in the emergency room of Carteret General; this was a fight for survival, miles from shore, against the unforgiving fury of the Atlantic.
