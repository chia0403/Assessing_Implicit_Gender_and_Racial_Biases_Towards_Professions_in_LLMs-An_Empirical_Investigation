The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s charcoal grey coat around her legs as she hurried across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Edinburgh’s Old Town.

Above, the looming gothic spires of St. Giles' Cathedral pierced the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the churning grey clouds.  Eleanor, despite her hurried pace, felt the weight of the city pressing down on her, a palpable sense of history and secrets woven into the very fabric of the ancient stones. Tonight, however, those secrets felt less romantic and more menacing, a chilling premonition clinging to the damp air like the clinging mist.  The emergency call had been terse, the details scant, but the urgency had been unmistakable.  And Eleanor, renowned throughout Scotland for her unwavering precision and steady hand, knew this would be a night she wouldn't soon forget.
