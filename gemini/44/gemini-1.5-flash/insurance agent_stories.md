The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Mia" Holloway's hands, a stark contrast to the November chill biting at the exposed skin of her neck.  Rain lashed against the single pane window of her cramped, attic office, blurring the already dismal view of the grey, slate rooftops of Port Blossom, Maine.  The scent of damp wool and old paper hung heavy in the air, a fitting aroma for the dusty files stacked haphazardly on every available surface. Mia, a seasoned insurance agent with a penchant for sensible cardigans and an even more pronounced aversion to risk, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the storm.  The flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across her desk, illuminating the latest claim â€“ a rather dramatic tale involving a runaway llama and a particularly unfortunate gazebo.  It was, Mia thought, a Tuesday like any other in Port Blossom.
