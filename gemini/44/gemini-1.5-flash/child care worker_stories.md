The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overgrown petunias, a perfect metaphor for Amelia Grace Hawthorne's current mood.  A damp, November chill clung to the air, seeping through the ill-fitting windowpanes of the converted Victorian house that served as her workplace. Inside, the usual cacophony of preschooler shouts, crayon scribbles, and the rhythmic thump of tiny feet against wooden floors was strangely muted.  A thick silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hallway, hung heavier than the autumn air.  Amelia, a woman whose normally bright smile was overshadowed by a deep frown, rubbed her tired eyes, the scent of stale Play-Doh and vaguely unsettling wet dog lingering in the air.  This wasn't just a quiet morning; it feltâ€¦wrong.
