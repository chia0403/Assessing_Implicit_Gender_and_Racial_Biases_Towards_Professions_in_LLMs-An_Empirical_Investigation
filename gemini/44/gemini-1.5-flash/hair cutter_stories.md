Rella, with her own riotous mane of fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun, was known throughout the neighbourhood not just for her impeccable cuts, but for her uncanny ability to listen, to absorb the silent stories whispered in the strands of her clients' hair.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, broken only by the insistent drumming of the rain and the occasional sigh escaping Rella's lips as she worked.  The storm mirrored the tempest brewing inside her.
