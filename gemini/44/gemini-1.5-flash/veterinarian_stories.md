The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s coat tighter around her as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate open.  The rusted hinges groaned a mournful protest, mirroring the sigh escaping her lips.  Before her stretched acres of windswept, heather-purple moorland, the skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawing at a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Perched precariously on the highest rise, silhouetted against the fading light, stood the crumbling stone edifice of Blackwood Manor, its gothic turrets hinting at stories both grand and grim. Mia, a veterinarian whose practice usually consisted of pampered poodles and anxious Persian cats, felt a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold. Tonight, her patient wasn't waiting inside a warm clinic; it was somewhere out there, in the unforgiving expanse of the moor, and it was unlike anything she'd ever encountered.
