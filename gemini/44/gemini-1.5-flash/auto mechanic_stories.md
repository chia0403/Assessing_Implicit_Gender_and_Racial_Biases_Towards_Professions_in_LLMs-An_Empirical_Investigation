The grease-stained overalls of Amelia "Amy" Hernandez felt like a second skin, a comforting weight against the chill October wind whipping through the open bay door of Hernandez Auto Repair.  The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and something faintly floral – Amy’s attempt at masking the pervasive aroma with a potpourri she’d found at a garage sale.  Rust-colored leaves swirled across the cracked asphalt of the lot, mirroring the flaky paint on the ancient Ford pickup she was currently wrestling with.  Its engine, a stubborn, coughing beast, sat half-disassembled on a rickety workbench cluttered with tools that looked like they’d seen better decades.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered space, painting the scene in hues of orange and fading blue, a stark contrast to the grimy reality of Amy’s life and work.
