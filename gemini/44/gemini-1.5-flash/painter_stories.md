The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s unruly auburn curls across her face as she wrestled the easel into position.  Salt spray, tasting of brine and seaweed, stung her lips.  Perched precariously on the wind-battered cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the scene before her was a maelstrom of raw, untamed beauty.  Below, the jagged rocks, slick with relentless waves, clawed at the turbulent sea, a symphony of crashing water and howling wind composing a brutal, breathtaking composition.  The air hung thick with the scent of iodine and something else, something faintly sweet and decaying – the whisper of the hidden coves and the secrets they held. Amelia, however, was focused solely on capturing the untamed spirit of the storm on her canvas, a battle between her trembling hand and the ferocious power of nature.
