The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine “Amy” Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Wall Street, the roar of the city a symphony of sirens and shouting.  Rain, slick and relentless, plastered her impeccably tailored Burberry trench coat to her body.  Each gust felt like a personal affront, a reminder of the precariousness of her position – both literally, teetering on the edge of a flooded curb, and figuratively, perched precariously atop a volatile market.  The imposing granite canyons of the financial district, usually symbols of power and ambition, loomed over her, their shadows reflecting the gloom settling in her own gut.  Inside, the opulent, mahogany-paneled offices of Holloway & Finch were a haven of controlled chaos, a world away from the tempest raging outside. But Amy knew the storm brewing within the firm’s walls might prove far more destructive than any November downpour.
