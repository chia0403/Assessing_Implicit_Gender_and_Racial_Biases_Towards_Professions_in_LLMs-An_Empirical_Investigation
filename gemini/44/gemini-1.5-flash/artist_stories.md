The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Stone’s unruly auburn curls across her face as she wrestled the heavy canvas onto the easel.  Her small, cluttered studio, perched precariously on the clifftop overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, groaned in protest with every gust.  Salt spray, thick and insistent, peppered the already-damp cobblestones of the floor, a constant reminder of the ocean’s relentless power, a power Amelia sought to capture in her swirling, vibrant paintings.
