The chipped paint on the windowsill flaked onto Ms. Eleanor Vance's sensible cardigan, a tiny, insignificant snowfall mirroring the larger, more unsettling blizzard brewing in her office.  Rain lashed against the grimy panes of Northwood High's guidance counselling suite, a rhythmic percussion accompanying the frantic scratching of a pen against a notepad.  The room itself was a testament to a life lived amidst the tidal wave of adolescent angst â€“ half-empty coffee cups sat precariously balanced on stacks of college brochures, a crumpled tissue nestling amongst transcripts, and the faint aroma of stale pizza hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the relentless November wind howled a mournful dirge, perfectly complementing the palpable tension that clung to Eleanor like the damp chill seeping in through the ill-fitting window frame.  This wasn't just another Tuesday; this was the day Ethan Cole walked in, his eyes mirroring the storm raging outside, and everything changed.
