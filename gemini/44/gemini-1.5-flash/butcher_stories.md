The chill wind, a razor-edged thing whistling down from the glaciers of the Svartifoss, bit at Archibald "Archie" Blackwood's exposed cheeks.  He didn't mind.  The biting wind was preferable, in his opinion, to the cloying sweetness of the blood that still clung faintly to his apron, a persistent reminder of the morning's slaughter.  Archie pulled his thick wool cap lower, its worn bobble brushing against his frost-nipped ears.  He surveyed his domain: Blackwood's Butchers, a small, weather-beaten shop nestled on the edge of Vik í Mýrdal, a village dwarfed by the brooding majesty of Iceland's southern coast.  The shop's single, dusty window displayed a glistening array of lamb chops, their marbling a testament to the rich pastureland surrounding the village, and a plump, dark-furred Icelandic sheep's head, its glassy eyes staring out at the grey, turbulent sea.  The air, even at this early hour, hung heavy with the metallic tang of freshly-cut meat and the earthy scent of peat smoke from the nearby houses.
