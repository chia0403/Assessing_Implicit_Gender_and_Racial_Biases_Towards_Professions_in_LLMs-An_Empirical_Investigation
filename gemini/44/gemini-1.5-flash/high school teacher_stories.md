The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign peeled away like sunburnt skin, mirroring the slow, agonizing unraveling of Elias Thorne's patience.  It was the first day of September, the air thick with the cloying sweetness of overripe plums and the nervous energy of a thousand teenagers.  Elias, a man whose neatly pressed khakis and perfectly knotted tie betrayed a soul simmering beneath the surface, adjusted his glasses, the lenses reflecting the chaotic scene unfolding before him: a sea of backpacks, chattering voices, and the ubiquitous scent of Axe body spray.  Northwood High, nestled in the perpetually sun-drenched valley of San Fernando, was, to put it mildly, a challenge.  But Elias, despite the creeping dread in his gut, was ready.  Or at least, he told himself he was.  This year, things would be different.  This year, he wouldn't let the apathy of the students, the bureaucratic red tape, or the ever-present threat of a rogue stapler derail him. This year, Elias Thorne would conquer Northwood High.
