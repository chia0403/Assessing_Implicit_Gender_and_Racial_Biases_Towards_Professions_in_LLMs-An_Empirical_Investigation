The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, a damp shroud clinging to Elias Thorne's sweat-soaked shirt.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony from the cypress trees lining Bayou Lafourche, their drone a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of Elias’s power drill.  He perched precariously on a rickety ladder, the decaying wood groaning under his weight,  fifty feet above the murky water. Below, the dilapidated pier of the Dubois family shrimping boat, the *Sea Serpent*, swayed gently with the tide, its rotting pilings a testament to years of saltwater erosion and neglect.  The air smelled of salt, decay, and the faintly sweet aroma of decaying Spanish moss – a smell Elias Thorne, master electrician and self-proclaimed “Bayou Whisperer,” knew intimately.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting familiarity of the bayou was overshadowed by a creeping sense of unease. The Dubois's weren't known for their punctuality, but this was beyond even their usual laissez-faire attitude.  Elias was starting to wonder if this job was more than just rewiring a busted generator.
