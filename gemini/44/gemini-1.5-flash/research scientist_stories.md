The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorneâ€™s research station, a cacophony that mirrored the turmoil brewing within him.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung his exposed cheeks as he wrestled with the recalcitrant satellite dish, its frozen mechanisms stubbornly refusing to cooperate.  The Vostok Station, a lonely outpost nestled deep within the desolate expanse of the East Antarctic plateau, was a place where the silence could be deafening, broken only by the shriek of the wind and the occasional crackle of the radio.  Three months into his year-long solo research project studying the ancient ice core samples for signs of extraterrestrial life, Aris felt the crushing weight of isolation pressing down on him, a pressure almost as formidable as the miles of ice above him.  The failure of the satellite connection was the final straw.  He was alone, with only the ghosts of past expeditions and the secrets locked within the ancient ice for company.
