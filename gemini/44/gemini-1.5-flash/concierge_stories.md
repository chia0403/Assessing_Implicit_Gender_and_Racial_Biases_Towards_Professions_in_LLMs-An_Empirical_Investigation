The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft glow of the lobby's crystal chandelier:  *Augustine "Gus" Moreau, Concierge*.  Gus Moreau, however, was not admiring his own polished reflection.  He was hunched over a half-eaten croissant, its buttery crumbs scattered across the meticulously organized blotter, his brow furrowed in concentration as he deciphered a handwritten note penned in spidery script. The note, tucked into a faded, silk-lined envelope, smelled faintly of lavender and something indefinablyâ€¦ ancient.  The opulent lobby of the Hotel du Lac, a venerable Parisian establishment tucked away on a cobbled side street near the Seine, hummed with a quiet, luxurious energy.  The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the perfume of expensive leather and the faint, floral aroma emanating from the overflowing vases of lilies and roses that punctuated the space.  Despite the apparent serenity, Gus sensed a storm brewing, a tempest of secrets swirling just beneath the surface of this gilded cage.
