The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the lobby, reflecting the nervous tremor in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's hand as he polished it.  Barty, all elbows and knees in his ill-fitting bellhop uniform, wished he'd opted for the less strenuous job of shining shoes.  The Grand Majestic Hotel, a crumbling monument to a bygone era of gilded excess, hummed with a restless energy tonight.  Its once-opulent lobby, with its decaying frescoes of mythical creatures and chipped marble columns, felt more like a mausoleum than a place of luxury.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale perfume, damp carpet, and the faint, unsettling aroma of something metallic, a scent Barty couldn't quite place but that always seemed to precede trouble.  Tonight, trouble felt particularly close.
