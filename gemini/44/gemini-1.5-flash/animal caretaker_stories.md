The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant, angry red.  She pulled her worn, sheepskin-lined parka tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped chin.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, a familiar perfume that usually soothed her, but tonight, it only served to amplify the desolate feeling pressing down on her.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The vast, shadowed expanse of the Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary stretched before her, a kingdom of gnarled trees and frosted meadows, usually a comforting sight, tonight cloaked in an unnerving silence.  Only the rhythmic creak of an ancient oak branch, swaying in the wind like a skeletal arm, broke the stillness.  Tonight, Amelia wasnâ€™t just caretaker of the sanctuary; she felt like its prisoner, trapped within the chilling embrace of a deepening mystery.
