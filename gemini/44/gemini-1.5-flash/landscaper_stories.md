The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a reluctant ghost, refusing to relinquish its hold even as the sun, a reluctant giant, began to push its fiery head over the horizon.  Dew-laden spiderwebs glittered like miniature diamonds, catching the first rays of light.  This was Elara Vance’s favorite time of day.  The quiet before the suburban symphony of lawnmowers, leaf blowers, and barking dogs began its daily crescendo. Elara, owner and sole operator of Vance’s Verdant Visions, adjusted the strap of her well-worn tool belt, the weight of its contents – secateurs, trowel, and a well-loved pair of gardening gloves – a familiar comfort.  The air, still cool and crisp, carried the faint scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass, a fragrance that, to Elara, was as intoxicating as any perfume.  Her first client of the day awaited, a Mrs. Hawthorne, known for her exquisite rose garden and equally exquisite demands.
