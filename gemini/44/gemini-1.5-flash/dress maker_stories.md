The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Aurelia Clementine Thistlewick.  Dust motes, illuminated by the slanting afternoon sun streaming through the tall, arched window of her atelier, danced in the quiet space.  Aurelia, her nimble fingers flying across a swatch of emerald silk, hummed a lilting tune – a half-remembered melody from a forgotten opera – as she meticulously pinned the fabric to the dress form.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Montmartre buzzed with the usual chaotic symphony of Parisian life; the distant rumble of a delivery cart, the sharp call of a street vendor, the melodic strains of an accordion.  But within the four walls of "L'Atelier de la Fleur," Aurelia's world was a haven of calm creativity, a sanctuary dedicated to the art of transforming fabric into dreams.
