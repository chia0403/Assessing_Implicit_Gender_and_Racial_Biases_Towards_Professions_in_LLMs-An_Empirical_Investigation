The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau as her own reflection.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of her salon, "Shear Perfection," blurring the already twilight cityscape of New Orleans.

Sera, her fingers stained a vibrant crimson from a particularly stubborn client's henna treatment, sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Tonight, however, the storm felt more ominous than usual; a restless energy vibrated in the air, a premonition that something beyond a simple downpour was brewing.
