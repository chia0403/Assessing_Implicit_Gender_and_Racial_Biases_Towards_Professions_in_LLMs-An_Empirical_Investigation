Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop and purveyor of fine shaves since 1987, meticulously wiped down his antique straight razor, the polished steel gleaming under the single, dusty bulb hanging above his workbench.  Outside, the neon sign sputtering above his shop – a faded, chipped image of a stern-faced barber wielding shears – flickered intermittently, mirroring the uncertain rhythm of the approaching storm.  His shop, nestled on the corner of Bleecker and Mulberry, was a haven of quiet masculinity in the ever-shifting, vibrant chaos of Greenwich Village.  The walls, lined with faded photographs of long-gone clientele and yellowed newspaper clippings detailing local sporting events, whispered stories of bygone eras.  The worn leather chair creaked a gentle protest as Barty adjusted the neck rest, anticipating his next customer, a sound as familiar to him as the rhythmic snip-snip of his shears.
