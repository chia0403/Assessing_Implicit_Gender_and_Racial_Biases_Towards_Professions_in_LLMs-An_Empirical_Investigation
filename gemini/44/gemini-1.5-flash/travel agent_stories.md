The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Grace Hawthorne.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of "Wanderlust Travel," danced in the quiet hum of her ancient computer.

Amelia, a woman whose spirit far outweighed her diminutive frame, sighed contentedly.  The chaos was her comfort, the scent of adventure her everyday cologne.  It was, after all, just another Tuesday in the life of a travel agent who dreamt in faraway lands.
