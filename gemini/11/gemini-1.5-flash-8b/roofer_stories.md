The biting wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the corrugated iron sheets of the roof like frantic, caged birds.  Rain, driven by the relentless gale, hammered against the weathered wood, a constant, percussive drumbeat.  Elias Thorne, a roofer with calloused hands and eyes the color of storm clouds, clung precariously to the sloping, treacherous peak of the manor house, a crumbling edifice perched atop a windswept hill.  He was halfway through the perilous task of replacing a section of the decaying slate, the task made even more perilous by the ferocious weather.  The manor, known locally as Blackwood Manor, stood as a monument to forgotten grandeur, its shadowy windows like empty eye sockets staring out at the tempestuous landscape.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, carried the echoes of the manor's long and haunted history.

The year was 1898.  The countryside, a patchwork quilt of fields and forests, was shrouded in an eerie twilight, the only illumination coming from the flickering flames in the hearth fires of distant farmhouses and the occasional lightning flash that momentarily illuminated the desolate landscape.  Elias, despite the treacherous conditions and the ominous whispers surrounding Blackwood Manor, was focused on the task at hand, his mind a relentless calculator of angles and stress points.  He was a man of routine, of the tangible, of the practicalâ€”and today, the roof was his only reality.
