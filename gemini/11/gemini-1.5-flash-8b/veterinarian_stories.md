The biting wind whipped Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she squinted at the skeletal remains of a pine tree, its branches gnarled like skeletal fingers clawing at the bruised sky.  The year was 1937, and the vast, windswept plains of the Dakotas stretched before her like a canvas painted in shades of grey and burnt sienna.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling up clouds of fine, orange soil that stung her eyes and settled in the hollow of her throat.  This wasn't the pristine, manicured landscape of her previous clinic in the suburbs of Chicago.
