The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of Blackwood Forest, whipping rain against the corrugated metal of the firehouse.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of pine and stale coffee, a familiar comfort in the face of the encroaching storm.  Sergeant Alistair "Al" Finch, a seasoned firefighter with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands calloused from countless rescues, stared out the grimy window.  He watched the swirling grey sky, the tempestuous dance of nature mirroring the turmoil brewing inside him.  The forest, usually a vibrant tapestry of emerald and gold, was now a menacing silhouette against the tempestuous backdrop.  He felt a premonition, a gut feeling that something was terribly wrong.  This wasn't just another storm.  This was different.


The Blackwood Fire Station, a weathered relic of the 1950s, stood sentinel on the edge of town.  Its siren, a raspy, rusted beast, seemed to vibrate with the unspoken dread that clung to the air.  The small, isolated community of Blackwood, nestled between the forest and the sprawling, industrial sprawl of the city, was known for its quiet solitude and the deep, silent reverence for the ancient woods that surrounded it.  The station itself, a small concrete bunker with a handful of flickering fluorescent lights, was a testament to the dedication of those who stood guard against the unpredictable fury of the elements.  The scent of damp earth and impending disaster clung to the walls.  Within the station's spartan confines, the comforting presence of crackling fire, the sharp scent of disinfectant, and the clatter of gear were reminders of the dangers that lurked beyond the walls.
