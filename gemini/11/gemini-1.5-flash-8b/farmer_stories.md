The biting wind whipped across the parched fields of the Ashdown Valley, stinging Elara Blackwood’s cheeks.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the skeletal remains of last year’s crops.  Elara, her hands calloused and stained with the rich, dark earth, stared out at the desolate landscape.  September’s promised rains had yet to arrive, and the valley, once a vibrant tapestry of emerald green and golden hues, was now a canvas of muted, almost spectral, tones.  The air, thick with the scent of dry hay and impending doom, hung heavy and still, broken only by the mournful cry of a lone raven circling high above the Blackwood homestead.  The homestead, a weathered clapboard structure nestled precariously amongst the thinning trees, seemed to lean into the relentless wind, its once cheerful paint now faded and cracked like the earth itself.  Her family had farmed this land for generations, and this year felt different, profoundly so.  The very bones of the valley seemed to ache with the drought.
