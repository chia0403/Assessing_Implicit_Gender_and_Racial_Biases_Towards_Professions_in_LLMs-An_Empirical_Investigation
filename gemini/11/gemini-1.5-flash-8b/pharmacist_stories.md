The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" cast an eerie, antiseptic glow on Amelia Blackwood, PharmD.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a forgotten bottle of cough syrup that sat precariously on the overflowing counter.  The air, usually thick with the comforting aroma of lavender and peppermint, was today heavy with the cloying scent of disinfectant, a testament to the recent, unusually aggressive flu outbreak sweeping through the town of Oakhaven.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back tightly in a bun, meticulously tallied the dwindling stock of antiviral medications.  Each prescription, each request for a simple aspirin, felt like a small battle against the relentless virus. Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, was a town of weathered clapboard houses and winding, cobblestone streets, its charm often overshadowed by the pervasive feeling of isolation, particularly during the winter months.  The bustling town square, usually vibrant with Sunday market stalls and lively chatter, was strangely silent today, eerily reflecting the collective anxiety hanging in the air. Amelia, however, was used to the quiet.  It was in the quiet that she found the most potent ingredients of her craftâ€”the silent understanding between patient and practitioner, the quiet calculations behind every dosage, every compounding. This particular flu season, however, felt different.  A deep, unsettling unease had begun to fester within the familiar rhythms of her small town life.
