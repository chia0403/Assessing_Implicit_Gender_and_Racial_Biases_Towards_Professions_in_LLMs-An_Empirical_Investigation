The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy"  Everett's flight suit, stinging her cheeks and rattling the flimsy fabric of her oxygen mask.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas clawed at a bruised sky, the only visible sign of life a ribbon of shimmering glacial meltwater snaking down a mountainside.  Amy, pilot of the experimental Zephyr-7, felt a tremor run through the fragile craft, a shuddering vibration that resonated deep within her bones.  The altimeter read 28,000 feet, dangerously close to the invisible, yet terrifying, barrier of the jet stream.  This wasn't part of the approved flight plan.  It wasn't supposed to be this close to the mythical, forbidden upper atmosphere.

Amy piloted the Zephyr-7 from a tiny cockpit that felt more like a pressurized birdcage than a sophisticated aircraft.  The cockpit, with its glowing instruments and futuristic controls, was a stark contrast to the raw, untamed beauty surrounding her.  Every movement of the craft required precision and focused attention, every vibration a potential disaster.  The sky, a canvas of swirling grey and bruised purple, reflected the turmoil in her stomach.  For weeks, she had been pursuing whispers of a secret, an anomaly, a legend.  A legend that promised answers, and perhaps, a catastrophic end. The high-altitude winds screamed against the reinforced windows.
