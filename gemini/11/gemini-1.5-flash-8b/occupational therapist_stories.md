Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Hope Haven" rehabilitation center, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Blackwood, occupational therapist.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and damp wool, hung heavy in the tiny, sunless physiotherapy room.  Hope Haven, a ramshackle collection of bungalows clinging to the hillside overlooking the grey Atlantic, housed a motley crew of recovering soulsâ€”the elderly, the accident-prone, the broken-hearted. Each with their own battles, their own quiet cries for a life less fractured.  Amelia, at twenty-eight, felt the weight of those struggles pressing down on her, a tangible pressure against her weary shoulders. Today, it was particularly acute.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a patient's prosthetic limb against the metal bed frame echoed the frantic drumbeat in her chest.  Her patient, a grizzled fisherman named Finn MacDougall, was her latest challenge, a man whose body, though recovering, bore the scars of a life spent battling the unforgiving sea.
