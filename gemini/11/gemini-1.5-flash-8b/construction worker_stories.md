The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, a gusty, pre-dawn assault on the already frigid air.  He tightened his scarf, pulling it further up around his face, and stared out at the skeletal framework of the new skyscraper piercing the grey London sky.  Steel beams, like skeletal fingers, clawed at the clouds, their rusty patina reflecting the pale light of the rising sun.  He was high up, on the 15th floor, a dizzying height, the wind a constant companion.  Below, the city slumbered, a patchwork quilt of rooftops and illuminated windows, a million miniature lives unseen from this vantage point.  Elias, a seasoned construction worker with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of countless hours spent in the elements, felt a familiar mix of apprehension and exhilaration.  This project, the Zenith Tower, was different.  It wasn't just another building; it held a whisper of something more, something that resonated in the very bones of the unfinished structure, a sense of...promise.  It promised greatness, but also a threat. And something more than that.  Something more... ancient.
