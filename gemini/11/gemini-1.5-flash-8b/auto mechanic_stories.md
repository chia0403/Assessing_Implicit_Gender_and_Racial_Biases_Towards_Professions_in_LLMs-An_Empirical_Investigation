The greasy haze hung heavy in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny, cluttered garage nestled between a bustling bakery and a dilapidated antique shop.  Sunlight, fractured by grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the workshop floor.  Tools, wrenches, and sprockets lay scattered like fallen soldiers, testament to the countless mechanical battles fought and won (and sometimes lost) within these walls.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw, auto mechanic extraordinaire, or at least that's what he liked to think.  Today, however, a particularly stubborn problem was proving more than even Bartyâ€™s practiced hands could conquer.
