Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Hayesâ€™s own thoughts.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the sterile, beige walls, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the humid air.

Inside, a young man named Ethan Blackwood stared back, his face etched with a haunted sadness that felt almost familiar.  This case, like so many others, felt like a sinking ship, the only question being whether she could keep him from going down with it.  The office, small and cramped, was a microcosm of the city's anxieties:  a place where hope wrestled with despair, where the weight of the world felt acutely heavy.
