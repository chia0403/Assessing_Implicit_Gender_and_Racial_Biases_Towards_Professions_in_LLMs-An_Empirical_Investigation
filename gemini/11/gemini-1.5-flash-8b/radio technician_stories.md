The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Radio Shack" – a name practically an anachronism in this near-future world of holographic communication – cast long shadows across Elias Thorne's workbench.  Dust motes danced in the lone beam of the overhead, sputtering sodium-vapor lamp, illuminating a tangle of wires, salvaged circuit boards, and half-eaten takeout containers – the familiar detritus of a radio technician's life.  Elias, a man whose hands seemed perpetually coated in solder flux and whose eyes held a lifetime of static electricity, meticulously adjusted a miniature antenna, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The year was 2242.  Personal communicators were ubiquitous, their holographic displays dominating social life.  But Elias still cherished the tactile, the tangible connection to the ether, to the whispers of signals carried on the archaic electromagnetic waves.  His apartment, a cramped efficiency nestled above the fading remnants of a once-grand downtown, hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum – the restless heartbeat of the radio equipment he cared for, a collection of salvaged treasures from a forgotten era.
