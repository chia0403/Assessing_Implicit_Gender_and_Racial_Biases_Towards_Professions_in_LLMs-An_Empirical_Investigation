The biting wind whipped Amelia "Maisie" Cartwright's auburn hair across her face as she hunched deeper into the threadbare parka.  Dust devils, kicked up by the relentless desert wind, danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the skeletal remains of what had once been a thriving oasis.  The year was 2042, and the shimmering, turquoise waters of the now-vanished Lake Salton no longer reflected the cracked and barren landscape that surrounded it.  Maisie, a freelance investigative reporter for the online news platform "Echoes," pressed her battered laptop closer.  The faded screen displayed a single, haunting image: a satellite photo of the lake, a stark, lifeless blue scar on a sea of ochre.

This wasn't just another environmental disaster story. This was personal.  Maisie's grandfather, a renowned hydrologist, had dedicated his life to studying Lake Salton and had perished in a freak storm related to its drying up, five years prior.  Now, whispers of corruption and cover-ups were echoing through the desolate towns surrounding the dried lakebed, whispers she was determined to unearth.  The air, thick with the smell of alkali dust and the ghosts of forgotten civilizations, tasted like betrayal.  The local authorities, she already knew, were stonewalling any investigation.  This was a quest that would take her further into the heart of the poisoned desert than she ever thought possible, a desert that now mirrored the pain in her own heart.
