Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia "Amy" Hayes.

The rhythmic clang of the trading floor, punctuated by the occasional sharp, exasperated shout, was both the soundtrack and the chorus of a dangerous game.  Amy felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach, a physical manifestation of the volatility raging outside her window and within the intricate, interconnected systems of global finance.
