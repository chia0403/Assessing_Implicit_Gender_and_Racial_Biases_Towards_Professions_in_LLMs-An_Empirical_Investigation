The chill of the pre-dawn air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of blood, clung to Bartholomew "Barty"  Cullen as he unlocked the heavy oak door of "Cullen's Cleaver."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the gloom of the narrow street, illuminating the chipped paint of the storefront and the glint of steel on the butcher block that dominated the interior.  Barty, a man whose face, etched with the lines of both hardship and satisfaction, stood hunched over the gleaming blade in his hand.  The flickering gaslight cast long, theatrical shadows that seemed to dance with the whispers of the night, all a prelude to the day's work.

The shop itself was a small, cramped space, smelling perpetually of salt, herbs, and the reassuring weight of freshly cut meat.  A low hum of anticipation, a symphony of sharpening steel and the creak of old wood, filled the air.  Rows of polished butcher blocks, the edges of which showed a lifetime of careful cuts, extended into the far depths of the room.  Hanging from the rafters, plump hams and glistening sides of beef, suspended between flickering gaslight,  awaited their fate.  The rhythmic clang of the metal was a familiar counterpoint to the distant cockcrow, a sound that echoed the insistent pulse of Barty's own heart.
