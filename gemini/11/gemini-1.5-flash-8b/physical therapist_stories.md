The small, cluttered physiotherapy practice, tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast town of Ashwood, felt more like a pressure cooker than a place of healing.

The rain, drumming louder than ever, seemed to echo the pain radiating from his body.  Outside, the weeping willow branches, usually a graceful canopy, were now lashed into a furious frenzy.
