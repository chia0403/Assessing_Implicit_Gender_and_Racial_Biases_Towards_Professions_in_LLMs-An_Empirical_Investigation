The fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grimy window of her cramped cubicle, highlighting the scattered receipts and invoices that littered her desk.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of impeccable precision and a soul yearning for something more, meticulously entered a column of figures, each digit a small, silent rebellion against the relentless drudgery.  Her meticulously neat handwriting, a testament to her meticulous nature, contrasted sharply with the haphazard stacks of paperwork surrounding her.  The firm was located in a faded, stucco-clad building on Elm Street, a street that seemed to whisper tales of forgotten dreams and even more forgotten lunches.  The rhythmic clatter of keys echoed through the office, punctuated by the occasional exasperated sigh from a colleague, lost in the labyrinth of ledger entries.  Amelia felt a familiar pang of ennui, a dull ache that settled in her chest every Wednesday afternoon, a stark reminder of the life she wasn't living.
