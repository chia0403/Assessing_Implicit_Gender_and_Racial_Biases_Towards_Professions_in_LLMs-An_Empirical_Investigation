The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Seraphina Blackwood's cloak.  The frosted spires of the Citadel, gleaming like shattered glass under a bruised twilight sky, offered no warmth.  For Seraphina, a Sentinel Guard of the Obsidian Order, the cold was a constant companion, a reminder of the harsh realities of her duty.  The Citadel, perched precariously on the jagged peak of Mount Veridian, was a fortress of stone and steel, a testament to a forgotten age, and a constant vigil against the encroaching shadows.  Above, the swirling clouds seemed to hold their breath, mirroring the stillness that perpetually clung to the high plateau.  Below, the valley plunged into an abyss of inky blackness, concealing secrets and dangers only hinted at by the occasional, chilling howl that echoed across the empty plains.  Seraphina, her breath misting in the frigid air, tightened her grip on the hilt of her obsidian blade, its cool metal a reassuring weight in her numb hand.  Tonight, her patrol was particularly tense.  Rumours, whispered like frost on the wind, spoke of unrest stirring in the shadowed corners of the valley, of something… ancient… stirring.
