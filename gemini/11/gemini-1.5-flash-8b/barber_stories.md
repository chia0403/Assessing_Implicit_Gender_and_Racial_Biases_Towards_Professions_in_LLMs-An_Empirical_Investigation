The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, murky grey from years of soapy water and forgotten dreams, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of his tiny barbershop, "The Razor's Edge."  It wasn't a bustling salon;  more a hushed sanctuary of faded floral wallpaper and the comforting aroma of lavender-scented shaving cream.  Barty, a man whose face, etched with lines that told the stories of countless whispered confidences and the quiet anxieties of his clients, sighed.  Another Tuesday. Another day filled with the same rhythmic whisper of clippers and the low, contented murmurs of men seeking solace in the quiet precision of a good haircut.  The antique barber chair, upholstered in cracked brown leather, creaked beneath him as he adjusted the worn strap of his apron.  Outside, the bustling, noisy marketplace of the town of Oakhaven thrummed with the sounds of merchants hawking their wares, a stark contrast to the hushed intimacy within his shop.  The town square, with its weathered cobblestones and the looming clock tower, was a familiar presence, a comforting backdrop to Barty's life, despite the persistent thrumming of something unseen, something just beneath the surface, that hinted at trouble brewing beyond the edges of his small, quiet world.
