The chipped paint of the workshop door, a faded Prussian blue, seemed to sigh in the damp morning air.  Sunlight, struggling to pierce the thick canopy of ancient oaks that ringed the small village of Ashwood, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestones.  Elias Thorne, carpenter of Ashwood, adjusted the worn leather strap of his apron, a faint scent of sawdust and linseed oil clinging to his clothes.  He squinted, tracing the lines of the half-finished wooden chair propped against the workbench.  Today, the air hung heavy with the promise of rain, and Elias felt a familiar pang of foreboding, a sense of unease that mirrored the chill seeping through the gaps in the workshop's weathered walls.  This wasn't just another day of crafting intricate dovetails and mortise-and-tenon joints; this morning felt charged with an unspoken tension, a quiet hum of expectancy that echoed the whispers carried on the breeze from the village square.
