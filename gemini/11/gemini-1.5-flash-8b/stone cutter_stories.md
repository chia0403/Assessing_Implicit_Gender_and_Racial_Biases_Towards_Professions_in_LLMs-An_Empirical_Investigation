The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's leather jerkin as he chipped away at the stubborn grey stone.  Dust, fine as powdered charcoal, swirled around him, stinging his eyes and coating his rough beard.  The quarry, a yawning maw in the heart of the Blackwood Mountains, echoed with the relentless clang of hammer against stone.  Sun, a pale disc battling the encroaching twilight, cast long, dancing shadows that stretched and writhed like tormented spirits across the rough-hewn faces of the unfinished sculptures.  Elias, his back aching from hours of relentless labor, felt a familiar thrum of frustration.  This was no ordinary block of stone; it held a particular stubbornness, a resistance that mocked his skill.  He needed this piece for Lord Valeriusâ€™s new mausoleum, a monument to power and glory, but it felt as if the stone itself was trying to thwart him.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, held a whisper of ancient secrets, stories etched in the very rock around him.  He was just a stone cutter, a simple craftsman, but he carried the weight of the future, one chipped fragment at a time.
