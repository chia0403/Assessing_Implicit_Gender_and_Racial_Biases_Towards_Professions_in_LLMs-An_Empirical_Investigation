The chipped paint of the "Melody Mart" sign, peeling like sunburnt skin, offered a grim welcome to the rain-slicked street.  Beneath it, Amelia Nightingale, a singer with a voice like spun moonlight, huddled deeper into her threadbare coat.  Her name, Amelia Nightingale, felt oddly theatrical in this cramped corner of the city, a place where dreams were as fragile as the frost on the shop windows.  The Melody Mart itself, a small, almost forgotten music store, was the only place in this desolate part of the city that still held a flicker of musical hope. It smelled faintly of old sheet music and damp wood, a scent Amelia recognized as a comforting, if melancholic, familiar.  A single, flickering fluorescent light hung above the dusty display cases, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the loneliness of the street.  Today, the only other soul in sight was a towering, hunched figure that leaned heavily on the battered window display of a recently closed record shop next door; the proprietor, a legendary figure known only as the Shadowman. Amelia knew she needed to find him.
