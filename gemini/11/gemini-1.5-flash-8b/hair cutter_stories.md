The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose from years of lukewarm water and countless rinses, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the "Snip-Snap Salon."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the grime-coated window, illuminating a single strand of auburn hair clinging precariously to the worn linoleum floor.  This was the domain of  Anya Petrova, a woman whose sharp, scissor-wielding fingers had sculpted countless styles, but whose own hair, pulled back tightly into a severe bun, seemed to echo the austere nature of her salon.  The air hung thick with the scent of cheap hairspray and lingering anxieties, a scent Anya had come to recognize as the quiet hum of her little empire.  It was a Thursday, and the rhythmic *snip* *snip* of the shears punctuated the silence, punctuated even the murmur of the city outside.  Anya, hunched over her latest client, a young woman named Chloe, wrestled with a particularly stubborn curl.  The salon, though small and worn, held a surprising warmth, a warmth that only Anya seemed to notice. This, after all, was where she crafted beauty, one precise cut at a time.
