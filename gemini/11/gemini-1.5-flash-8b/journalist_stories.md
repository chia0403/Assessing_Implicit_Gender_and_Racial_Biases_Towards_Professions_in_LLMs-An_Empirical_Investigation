The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Galleon," a dive bar tucked away on a cobbled side street of Port Blossom, cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia  Everest, a seasoned investigative journalist.  Rain lashed against the grimy window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Port Blossom, a town clinging to the edge of the whispering Pacific, was notorious for its secrets, its shadows stretching long and menacing into the twilight hours.  Amelia, with her trench coat perpetually damp and her sharp gaze ever on the prowl, had arrived three days prior, drawn by a whisper of corruption that hung heavier than the salt air.  The town's esteemed Mayor, Silas Blackwood, was rumored to be laundering illicit profits from a clandestine, offshore shipping operationâ€”a rumor that had been brewing, like a storm cloud, on the periphery of her professional radar.  The Golden Galleon, with its sticky tables and the smell of stale beer and desperation, was her latest, and likely most perilous, hunting ground.  She pushed her worn leather satchel onto the barstool, the clinking of its contents echoing in the oppressive silence of the empty bar, and ordered a double whiskey.  The bartender, a gruff man named Finnigan with eyes like chips of ice, merely grunted in acknowledgement, his stare as hard as the chipped ceramic tiles lining the bar.  This was going to be a long night.
