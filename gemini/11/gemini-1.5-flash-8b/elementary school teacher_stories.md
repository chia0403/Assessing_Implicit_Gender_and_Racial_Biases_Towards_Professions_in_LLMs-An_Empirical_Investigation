The chipped paint on the walls of Miss Amelia Blackwood's classroom, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh with the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the late-afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a flurry of colorful drawings â€“ a fantastical dragon spewing rainbows, a spaceship soaring through a galaxy of crayon stars, a meticulously crafted portrait of a fluffy, orange cat.  Miss Blackwood, a woman with eyes the colour of polished amethyst and hair the shade of midnight, leaned against her desk, a half-eaten apple core nestled beside a stack of meticulously organized student work.  Her worn, leather-bound journal lay open on the desk, its pages filled with the intricate details of each child's unique learning style, their passions, their anxieties.  Today, however, a particular drawing, a crude but vibrant depiction of a towering, swirling vortex, felt particularly resonant, and not just in a purely artistic sense.
