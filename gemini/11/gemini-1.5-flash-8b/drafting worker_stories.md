The fluorescent lights of the "Precision Drafting Department" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of mechanical pencils across tracing paper.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker at the sprawling Zenith Industries facility, hunched over his drafting table, a tangle of blueprints and meticulously labeled components spread before him.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminating the intricate details of a complex hydraulic system â€“ a system that, if flawed, could send the entire assembly line into chaos.  The air, thick with the scent of ink and the faint metallic tang of old machinery, felt almost tangible, pressing against him, as if the very blueprints demanded his complete and unwavering attention.


The setting was the Zenith Industries factory in the rust-colored heartland of the American Midwest.  It was a sprawling, imposing structure, a monument to industrial might, built of steel and concrete.  The factory floors, vast and echoing, stretched beyond the confines of the drafting department, disappearing into a maze of moving machinery and whirring belts.  Outside, the relentless prairie wind howled, whipping dust across the desolate landscape.  The sun, a pale disc, cast long, skeletal shadows that seemed to swallow the factory in their embrace, while the faint rumble of distant freight trains echoed the constant, underlying rhythm of the industrial heart.
