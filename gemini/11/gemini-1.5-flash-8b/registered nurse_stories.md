The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the cardiac monitor beeping in the room next door.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, registered nurse, adjusted her Scrubs, the crisp, cotton fabric a stark contrast to the sticky sweat clinging to her brow.  The sterile white walls seemed to press in around her, reflecting the frantic energy of the room.  Outside, the city – a concrete jungle teeming with life – roared its anxieties through the open window.  It was a Tuesday night, a Tuesday night like any other, except this one held a particular tension, a palpable weight of unspoken dread.

The setting:  Metropolitan General Hospital, a sprawling institution in the heart of New York City, a place where the frantic pace of urban life collided with the quiet, life-saving work of its staff.  The emergency room, a whirlwind of activity, buzzed with the anxieties of the city's weary and wounded.  The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear.  A symphony of beeping machines and hurried voices played out around Eleanor, each a separate thread in a tapestry of human suffering.
