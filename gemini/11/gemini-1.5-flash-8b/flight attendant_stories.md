The fluorescent lights of the economy cabin hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's weary existence.  The recycled air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap perfume, clung to her like a second skin.  Outside, the jagged silhouette of the Andes Mountains sliced through the twilight sky, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic space within the Airbus A380.  Amy, 27, with a perpetually tired smile plastered on her face, meticulously folded a napkin, her movements practiced and precise.  This was her 13th flight of the week, and she was running on fumes, both literally and figuratively.  Her uniform, usually a source of pride, felt like a heavy cloak tonight.  She was bound for Lima, a city she barely knew beyond the blinking neon signs of the airport and the endless stretches of asphalt outside.  This particular flight, however, was carrying an extra weight, an unspoken anxiety that sat heavy in the humid air. Something about the passengers, the whispers, the way the window seat occupants kept their gazes fixed on the darkening landscape, felt strangely off.
