The fluorescent lights of the high school cafeteria hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Rodriguez's own heart.  Empty trays, chipped paint, and the persistent scent of stale pizza hung heavy in the air.  It was a Tuesday, the day she dreaded most.  Not because of the endless paperwork or the inevitable barrage of teenage angst, but because this was the day the 'big' announcements happened.  The day the whispers transformed into shouts. The day the school counselor, Miss Rodriguez, had to deliver the bad news.

Setting:  The bustling, yet strangely quiet, high school cafeteria on a Tuesday afternoon.  The worn linoleum floor, stained and scuffed, reflected the fluorescent light.  Outside, the autumn leaves crunched underfoot, a stark contrast to the suffocating silence of the room. The air hung thick with the aroma of old textbooks and despair, a scent Amelia had come to know intimately over the past five years.  A few scattered students, their faces illuminated by the harsh lights, munched on their lunches, seemingly oblivious to the unspoken tension that hung in the air.  The room itself, large and cavernous, felt oppressive.
