The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's weathered jacket around her, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Snow, thick and swirling, obscured the already-dim light of the early morning.  She squinted, trying to make out the skeletal outline of the sprawling estate, Blackwood Manor, through the swirling blizzard.  This wasn't exactly her favourite kind of job.  Landscaping in February, in the heart of the unforgiving Yorkshire moors, was a trial, even for someone as seasoned as Em.

The estate itself, nestled deep within the moorland, was a monument to forgotten grandeur.  Towering, dark grey stone walls, crumbling in places, enclosed the property, their edges flecked with frost.  Twisted, ancient oaks, their branches laden with ice, cast long, menacing shadows across the already barren landscape.  A single, flickering lantern swung precariously from a weathered post near the main entrance, its pale light struggling against the relentless onslaught of the storm.  Inside, a faint hum of activity, muffled by the howling wind, suggested life was somehow present, though it felt as remote and almost ghostly as the looming, skeletal trees.  Em shivered, pulling her scarf tighter around her face.  This job was more than just trimming hedges; it was about confronting the whispers of history that seemed to cling to the very stones of Blackwood Manor.
