The fluorescent hum of the "Tax Time Express" office buzzed, a relentless soundtrack to Amelia  Finch's Tuesday.  Paperclips clicked, staplers shrieked, and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of keyboards echoed against the walls, a cacophony orchestrated by the annual avalanche of tax forms.  Amelia, a petite woman with a perpetually worried frown and hair the colour of a freshly-fallen autumn leaf, hunched over a mountain of paperwork.  Across the small, crowded office, piles of folders, each a miniature Everest of financial woes, awaited their turn at her meticulously organized desk.  Outside, the crisp autumn air of  Oakhaven, a small, picturesque town nestled between rolling hills and a whispering creek, offered a stark contrast to the indoor frenzy.  The aroma of roasted chestnuts wafted in from the nearby farmer's market, a comforting reminder of the seasonal shift from busy work days to the cozy preparations for the approaching holidays.  Amelia, however, felt none of that seasonal cheer.  This year, the tax forms felt especially heavy, laden with an unspoken weight of economic uncertainty.
