The chipped paint on the wrought-iron gate to Blackwood Manor creaked a mournful symphony as Elara Blackwood, groundskeeper, pushed it open.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun, illuminating the sprawling lawns, their emerald hue a stark contrast to the muted greys and browns of the overgrown borders.  Dead leaves, like scattered confetti, littered the paths, a testament to the encroaching autumn.  Elara, her hands calloused and stained a deep, earthy brown, sighed, the sound swallowed by the whispering wind.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece of stone and shadow, loomed before her, a silent guardian of secrets whispered on the breeze.  The air, heavy with the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, felt thick and oppressive.  This was her nightly ritual, a silent vigil over a place she had known her whole life, a place where the boundaries between the living and the dead seemed to blur.
