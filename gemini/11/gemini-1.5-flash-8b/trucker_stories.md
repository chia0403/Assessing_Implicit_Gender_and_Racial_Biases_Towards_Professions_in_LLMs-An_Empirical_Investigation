The chipped paint of the "Highway Hawk" shimmered under the sickly yellow glow of the desert sun.  Dust devils, the size of miniature tornadoes, danced across the cracked asphalt of Route 66, swirling around Amelia "Ace"  Blackburn's rig.  Sweat, thick and caked, plastered her worn denim jacket to her skin.  Ace, a seasoned trucker with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a voice that could shatter glass, wrestled with the stubborn air-brake lever.  The 18-wheeler, groaning under the weight of a mountain of antique furniture, refused to cooperate.  

The setting was the desolate stretch of Route 66, somewhere between the petrified forests of Arizona and the shimmering heat haze of New Mexico.  Twisted, skeletal cacti pierced the pale sky, their silhouettes sharp against the relentless glare.  The only sounds were the rhythmic crunch of the tires on the cracked pavement, the howl of the wind whistling through the broken-down telephone poles, and the guttural engine-roar of the truck, fighting against the oppressive heat.  Time seemed to stretch and warp around Ace, melting into the unforgiving landscape.
