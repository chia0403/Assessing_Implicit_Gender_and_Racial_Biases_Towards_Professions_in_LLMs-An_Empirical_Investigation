The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, clinging to the cobblestone alleyways of Old San Juan.  Rain-slicked shadows danced on the walls of the crumbling colonial buildings, punctuated by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a leaky roof somewhere above.  Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez, her crisp white coat a stark contrast to the surrounding grey, adjusted her glasses, squinting at the name scrawled on the faded sign above the door – "Dr. Rodriguez: Spine-Straightening Solutions."  The clinic, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the historic district, hummed with the quiet, almost imperceptible sounds of a bustling city – the distant clang of a bell, the rhythmic chant of a street vendor, and the occasional, pained groan from within.  Izzy, with her quick, decisive movements and focused gaze, was a study in quiet efficiency as she wrestled with the insistent throbbing pain in her own lower back.  This was her sanctuary, her second home, but the tension still clung to her, as thick as the humid air.
