The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Blackwood's fingers on the worn keyboard.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that seemed permanently etched into a polite, yet weary, expression, was the receptionist.  Her domain was the cavernous, beige-walled reception area of Zenith, a sprawling multinational conglomerate specializing in advanced bio-technologies.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated skyscraper windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished reception desk, highlighting the dust motes suspended in the stale air.  A half-eaten granola bar, a discarded pen, and a stack of unread brochures littered the surface, a testament to the daily deluge of paperwork and hurried visitors.  Outside, the city thrummed with a restless energy, its relentless pulse a stark contrast to the muted calm within Zenith's sterile confines.  Amelia, however, felt neither calm nor controlled. Something was stirring, something unseen yet undeniably present, behind the hum of the fluorescent lights and the clatter of the coffee machine.
