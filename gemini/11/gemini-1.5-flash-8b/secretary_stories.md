The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's day.  Her small, windowless office, crammed with overflowing filing cabinets and the faint scent of stale coffee, was a microcosm of the corporate world's relentless rhythm.  Each click of the keyboard, each shuffle of papers, each polite phone call, was another tick in the clock, another step in the bureaucratic dance. Amy, a secretary for the Zenith Corporation's notoriously demanding Vice President, Alistair Finch, was the silent architect of his carefully constructed empire of deadlines and directives.  The year was 2042.  Modern skyscrapers, sleek and glass-encased, pierced the perpetually overcast sky of Neo-Tokyo, a metropolis where the lines between technology and humanity often blurred in a fog of shimmering neon and whirring machinery.  The air, thick with the scent of synthetic rain and recycled exhaust fumes, hung heavy in the humid afternoon.
