The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, coated the jagged peaks of the Matterhorn, casting long, skeletal shadows across the remote Swiss chalet.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the smell of antiseptic and pine, a stark contrast to the raw, mountainous elements outside.  Dr. Amelia Blackwood, a forensic pathologist with eyes the colour of glacial ice and a mind sharper than a scalpel, hunched over a metal table.  A single, stark-white, almost translucent, figure lay on its surface.  The body of a mountaineer, cold and stiff, a victim of the merciless mountain.  Amelia's focus, however, wasn't on the body itself, but the details surrounding it.  A strange, almost luminescent residue clinging to the frozen clothing, a peculiar fracture in the victim's skull, incongruous with typical high-altitude falls...  The air in the chalet crackled with an unspoken tension, a feeling of the unknown lingering in the very air. The silence was punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of the old timbers and the distant howl of a wolf.  This wasn't just another mountain tragedy.  This was a mystery, a puzzle wrapped in ice, and Dr. Blackwood was determined to unravel it.
