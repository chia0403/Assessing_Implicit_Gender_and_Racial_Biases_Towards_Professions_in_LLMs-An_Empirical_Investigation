The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Amelia Hayes's pen on her notepad.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, counseling psychologist, stared out the window, at the relentless grey of the overcast London sky mirroring the muted despair in the faces of the teenagers huddled in the plush, yet somehow sterile, armchairs.  Rain slicked the cobblestones of the ancient street below, mirroring the feeling of being perpetually trapped in the gloom that seemed to permeate the walls of her practice.  She had spent the last decade helping people navigate the complexities of their inner worlds; the joys, the sorrows, the bewildering tapestry of human experience.  But lately, the colours were fading, and the patterns blurring.

The waiting room was a small, boxy space on a quiet side street in Bloomsbury, tucked away between a historic bookshop and a bustling, artisan coffee shop.  Sunlight barely touched the space, except for a small, awkward patch piercing the dusty, grey windows.  The smell of old paper and slightly stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mixing with the faint scent of lavender from the subtle aromatherapy diffuser positioned near the reception desk.  A faded, hand-painted sign on the wall announced, in elegant script, "Inner Compass Counselling."  Each chair was upholstered in a muted, greyish-green fabric, each surface hinting at the stories untold and the journeys yet to come.  A row of neatly stacked books, mostly on psychology and self-help, lined the wall further reinforcing the space's clinical nature.
