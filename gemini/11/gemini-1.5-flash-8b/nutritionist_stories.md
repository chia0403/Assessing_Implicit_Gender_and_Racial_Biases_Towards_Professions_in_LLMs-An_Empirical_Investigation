The biting wind whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne's lab coat around her legs, each gust a tiny, icy fist against her exposed cheeks.  The aroma of fermenting yeast, a scent usually comforting, today felt acrid, almost mocking.  Outside, the sprawling, snow-dusted vineyards of the Loire Valley, normally a picturesque panorama of muted greys and whites, were obscured by a thick, swirling fog.  Inside the rustic stone chateau, Ameliaâ€™s small, cluttered office felt unusually cold, the warmth of the wood-burning stove failing to penetrate the pervasive chill. Amelia, a nutritionist specializing in the complex relationship between terroir and taste, traced a frustrated finger across a meticulously detailed chart depicting the nutrient content of local grapes, a chart that stubbornly refused to yield the answers she desperately sought.  For weeks, the local wineries had been reporting a strange dip in quality, a noticeable decrease in the sweet, nuanced flavours that were the very soul of their finest wines. The problem was confounding, seemingly defying every known principle of viticulture.  And Amelia felt the weight of it all, a palpable pressure in her chest that matched the tightening grip of the approaching winter.
