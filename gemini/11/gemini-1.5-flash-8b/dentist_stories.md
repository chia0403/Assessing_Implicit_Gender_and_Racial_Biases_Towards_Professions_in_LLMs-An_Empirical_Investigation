The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating a scattering of dental tools that lay discarded on the polished stainless steel tray.  Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, delicately maneuvered the drill bit, her movements precise and deliberate.  Her patient, a fidgety teenager named Liam, muttered under his breath, a low growl barely audible above the whirring machine.

The office, located in the heart of the dilapidated, yet somehow charming,  downtown district of Oakhaven, was a testament to its time.  Once a bustling hub, Oakhaven had weathered the tides of progress and now faced a silent struggle against encroaching sprawl.  The building itself was a grey, brick behemoth, its facade marked by faded signage and chipped paint.  Inside, though, the smell of antiseptic and old, slightly musty books lingered, a strange mixture that clung to the very air.  Eleanor, with her perpetually tired eyes and a worn but well-loved coat of navy blue that had seen better days, was a fixture in this little corner of a slowly fading city.
