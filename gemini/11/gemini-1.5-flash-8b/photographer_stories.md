The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  Above, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the bruised twilight sky, casting long, dancing shadows across the desolate moorland.  Fog, thick and clinging, hung like a shroud, obscuring everything but the jagged silhouette of the ruined stone circle, a silent sentinel etched into the heart of the mist. Em, her breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted the heavy leather strap of her camera bag.  The battered, vintage Leica felt reassuringly familiar in her hands.  Tonight, the moor held a promise, a whisper of secrets lost to the ages, and Em, a freelance photographer specializing in forgotten landscapes, was determined to capture it.  This wasn't just another assignment.  This was personal.
