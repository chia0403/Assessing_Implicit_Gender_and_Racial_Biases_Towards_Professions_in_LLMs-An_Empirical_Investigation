The chipped enamel of the sink, a faded robin's egg blue, reflected the frantic dance of Amelia Nightingale's hands.  She moved with a frenetic energy, a hummingbird flitting amongst the manicured nails, each one a tiny, delicate sculpture.  Her tiny scissors snipped, the delicate click echoing in the quiet, sterile space of "Nails by Amelia."  The tiny, almost silent whir of the electric file buzzed a constant, almost comforting hum, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump of her heart.  The scent of lavender polish and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony to the clientele that filled the small, cluttered salon.

Amelia, a young woman with eyes that held the storm of a thousand whispered secrets and a smile that could melt glaciers, was currently trying to coax perfection out of a set of acrylics that were stubbornly refusing to cooperate.  The salon, tucked away on a side street of the bustling city of Aethelgard, was a haven, a sanctuary from the relentless clamor of the outside world.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, rain-streaked windowpanes, painted a kaleidoscope of colours on the worn, linoleum floor. The muted glow of the fluorescent lights cast long shadows that danced around the chipped furniture and faded posters of famous celebrities, their hands meticulously manicured, a stark contrast to the sometimes unruly, always messy reality within the salon.
