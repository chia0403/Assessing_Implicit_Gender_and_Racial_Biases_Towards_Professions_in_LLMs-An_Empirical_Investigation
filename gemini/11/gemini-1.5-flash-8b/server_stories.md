The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the smudges of coffee already ingrained in her uniform.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and simmering stew, a familiar perfume in the small, dimly lit tavern.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia's heart.  It was closing time, and the last three patrons, a trio of burly lumberjacks, were still nursing their tankards, their conversations a low growl of boisterous camaraderie.  Amelia, however, wasn't feeling camaraderie.  She felt dread.  Tonight, something was different. The air, thick with anticipation, held a tangible tension that had nothing to do with the usual Friday night clientele.
