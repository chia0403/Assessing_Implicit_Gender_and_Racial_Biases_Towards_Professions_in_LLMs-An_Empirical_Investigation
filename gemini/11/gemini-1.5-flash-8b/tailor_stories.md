The scent of beeswax and aged linen clung to the air in Silas Blackwood's workshop, a comforting aroma that masked the faint, persistent tang of mildew clinging to the damp stone walls.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, leaded panes of the attic window, cast long, dancing shadows across the meticulously organized shelves of fabrics â€“ silks the colour of twilight, wools the deep shade of forest earth, and linens the pure, quiet white of freshly fallen snow.  Silas Blackwood, a tailor of exceptional skill and quiet renown in the shadowed alleys of Old Blackwood, meticulously measured a length of emerald green velvet, his fingers, nimble and precise, tracing the smooth, heavy weave.  The year was 1888.  London, shrouded in a persistent fog that clung to the cobbled streets like a second skin, was the backdrop to his carefully crafted world.  The city hummed with the restless energy of a million souls, but inside the small, dusty attic workshop, Silas was a world unto himself, a whisper in the clamor.
