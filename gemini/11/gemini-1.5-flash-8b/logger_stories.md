The biting wind, a relentless razor, whipped across the exposed plateau, stinging Silas Blackwood's cheeks and rattling the loose teeth in his jaws.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling the remnants of yesterday's fire into a suffocating haze.  The Blackwood Ridge, a jagged scar on the face of the Wasatch Mountains, was a place of raw beauty and brutal indifference.  Silas, a seasoned logger with eyes the colour of weathered pine and hands calloused to the point of numbness, stared out at the vast, unforgiving landscape.  He wasn't afraid, not exactly.  He wasâ€¦ weary.  Today, however, was different. Today, the air hung heavy with a subtle, metallic tang, a hint of something more sinister than the usual acrid scent of pine and smoke.  The sun, a pale disc sinking behind the jagged peaks, cast long, skeletal shadows that seemed to mock his loneliness.  He knew, deep in the marrow of his bones, that this wasn't just another day in the woods.  This was different.  Something... lurked.
