The flickering neon sign of "Fix-It Fritz's Plumbing Paradise" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alleyway.  Water, a constant companion, dripped from the eaves and pooled in the uneven cobblestones, mirroring the persistent drip, drip, drip of Amelia Penelope Fitzwilliam's frustration.  Amelia, a young woman with a determined set of brows perpetually furrowed and a mop of unruly auburn hair escaping her grease-stained cap, knelt beside a bubbling water main, her wrench digging into the cold metal with a dishearteningly ineffective crunch.  Her worn leather apron, perpetually stained with a rainbow of plumbing hues, clung to her, a testament to countless hours spent battling the city's subterranean plumbing nightmares.  The alley, a labyrinth of discarded pipes and overflowing bins, felt like a second skin, a constant reminder of the relentless demands of her job.  It was a Tuesday, and already the city's pipes were howling in protest against the approaching cold snap.
