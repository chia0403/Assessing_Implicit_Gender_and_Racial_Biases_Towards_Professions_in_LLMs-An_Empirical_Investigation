The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Carmichael's crimson parka around her as she stepped off the ambulance.  The snow, already several feet deep, crunched under her boots like shattered glass.  The small, isolated town of Havenwood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, seemed to hold its breath, a spectral silhouette against the bruised, gray sky.  This wasn't the predictable, bustling trauma center Amy was used to.  Havenwood's emergency calls were infrequent, often bizarre, and always chillingly remote.  The skeletal pines surrounding the town, their branches laden with ice, clawed at the sky like skeletal fingers.  The only sounds besides the wind were the distant howl of a wolf, and the rhythmic thudding of Amy's own heart, a frantic drumbeat against the stillness of the night.  Tonight, a call had come in for a "malfunction" at the Blackwood Manor, a historic, creaking estate rumored to be haunted.  Amy, a seasoned emergency medical technician with a practical outlook on the supernatural, felt a shiver run down her spine.  This one might be unlike any other.
