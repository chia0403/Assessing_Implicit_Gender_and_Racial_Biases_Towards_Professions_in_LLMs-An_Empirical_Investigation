The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's worn jacket, stinging his cheeks and rattling the loose rivets in the rusted metal toolbox strapped to his waist.  He hunched deeper into the battered denim coveralls, his breath clouding in the frigid air.  The desolate stretch of I-95 snaked before him, a ribbon of asphalt lost in the endless expanse of the Wyoming plains.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling miniature tornadoes around abandoned roadside signs and rusted guardrails.  This particular stretch, mile marker 287 to 293, had seen better days, and Elias had seen worse.  His fingernails, perpetually stained with the grime of asphalt and the melancholy of a life spent mending the nation's arteries, were more reminders than ornaments.  The pale, sickly sun, already sinking low on the horizon, cast long shadows that stretched and contorted the already lonely landscape.  This was his world, this was his penance.
