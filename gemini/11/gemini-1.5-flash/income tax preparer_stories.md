Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air, each one a tiny, shimmering testament to the long hours Mildred had spent hunched over W-2s and 1099s.

The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the lingering scent of desperation – the combined aroma of tax season in full swing in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio.
