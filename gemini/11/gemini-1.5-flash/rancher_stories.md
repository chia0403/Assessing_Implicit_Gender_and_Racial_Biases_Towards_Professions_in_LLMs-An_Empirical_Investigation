The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that blanketed the Broken Tooth Ranch.  Ice clung to the barbed wire fences like frozen tears, and the skeletal branches of the juniper trees clawed at the bruised, grey sky.  A thin, brittle sun, barely managing to pierce the gloom, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast expanse of frozen pasture.  This was February in Wyoming, a time when even the hardiest souls felt the bite of the unforgiving landscape.  Amelia "Mia" Calderon, her breath puffing out in ragged white clouds, squinted against the glare, her gaze sweeping over her herd of weathered Angus cattle huddled for warmth against the lee of a rocky outcrop.  The air bit with a ferocity that promised frostbite, and the silence, broken only by the mournful sigh of the wind, was heavy with the weight of a coming storm.
