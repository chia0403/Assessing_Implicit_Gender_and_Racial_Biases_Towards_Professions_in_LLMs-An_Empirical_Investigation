The fluorescent lights of Dr. Albright's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the polishing tool in Seraphina "Sera" Lancaster's hand.  Sera, a dental hygienist with a penchant for perfectly aligned floss and an even more pronounced aversion to coffee breath, meticulously worked on Mr. Henderson's lower molars.  The air, despite the industrial-strength air freshener battling the lingering scent of amalgam, smelled faintly of cinnamon and impending doom.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of suburban Pleasantville, a stark contrast to the sterile white of the dentist's office, where Sera felt a growing sense of unease that had nothing to do with Mr. Henderson's slightly stubborn plaque.  It was the frantic, almost panicked, text message she'd received from her younger sister, barely legible amidst a flurry of exclamation points, that thrummed beneath her professional composure.  The message simply read:  "Need you. Now.  Something's wrong with Dad."
