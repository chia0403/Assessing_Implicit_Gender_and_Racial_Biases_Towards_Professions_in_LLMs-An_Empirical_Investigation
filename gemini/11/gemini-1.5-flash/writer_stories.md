The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Blackwood's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the small, rocking deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  Amelia, or Amy as most people – those few who knew her well enough – called her, shivered, not entirely from the October chill biting at the exposed skin of her arms.
