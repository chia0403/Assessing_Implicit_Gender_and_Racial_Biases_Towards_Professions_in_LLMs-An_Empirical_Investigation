The humid Louisiana air hung heavy and sweet, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, almost frantic rhythm against the backdrop of a slow, mournful blues drifting from a nearby juke joint.  Dr. Evelyn Jean Dupree, DDS, wiped her brow with a tissue, the dampness clinging stubbornly to her skin.  The waiting room of Dupree Dental, nestled amongst a cluster of aging brick buildings on the edge of Lafayette's historic district, was thankfully empty.  For now.  The afternoon sun, filtering through the dusty lace curtains, cast long shadows across the worn floral carpet, highlighting the tiny imperfections in the faded rose pattern.  Evelyn sighed, the weight of a particularly challenging root canal still pressing on her shoulders, a lingering ache mirrored by the dull throbbing in her own aching tooth.  This was going to be a long afternoon.
