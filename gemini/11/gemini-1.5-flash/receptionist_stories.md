The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the staccato click-clack of Penelope "Penny" Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured fingernails against the polished mahogany of her desk.

Penny, a woman whose carefully constructed composure could withstand a Category 5 hurricane, adjusted the perfectly positioned silk orchid in its minimalist ceramic vase.  The air conditioning, always set to a precise 72 degrees Fahrenheit, did little to quell the simmering tension that, like a low-frequency hum, vibrated through the otherwise pristine reception area of Zenith's headquarters.  This wasn't just another Monday morning; the air crackled with the anticipation of a looming merger, a deal so significant it threatened to reshape the very landscape of the tech industry.
