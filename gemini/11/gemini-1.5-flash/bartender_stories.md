The chipped Formica countertop felt cold against Elara Vance's cheek as she rested her head, the rhythmic clinking of ice a dull counterpoint to the throbbing in her temples.  The air in "The Rusty Mug," thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled bourbon, and something vaguely floral that Elara suspected was desperation, hung heavy and stagnant.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the dive bar, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the melancholic jazz spilling from the worn-out jukebox in the corner.  Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow across the deserted alleyway.  Inside, only a single, solitary figure hunched over a glass of amber liquid, his face obscured by shadow, offered Elara any company.  Tonight, even the usual boisterous regulars of The Rusty Mug had stayed away, leaving Elara alone with her thoughts, the lingering taste of regret, and the ever-present weight of a secret she desperately needed to bury.
