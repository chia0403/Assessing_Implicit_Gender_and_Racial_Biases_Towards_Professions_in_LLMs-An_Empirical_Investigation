The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the arched windows of the Blackwood Public Library.  Rainwater cascaded down the leaded glass, each drop a tiny, glittering tear reflecting the gaslight glow within.  Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun that did little to soften her sharp, intelligent features, adjusted the spectacles perched on her nose and ran a gloved hand over the spine of a first edition Dickens.  The library, a gothic masterpiece of dark oak and whispering shadows, felt less like a place of work and more like a sacred sanctuary, a place where the echoes of countless stories whispered secrets only she could understand.  Tonight, however, a silence deeper than usual settled over the hallowed halls, a silence broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the foyer and the persistent drumming of the rain.  And tonight, Eleanor felt a prickling unease, a premonition clinging to her like the damp chill of the autumn air.
