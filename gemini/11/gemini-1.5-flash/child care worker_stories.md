The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the overgrown ivy clinging to the brick wall like stubborn freckles.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since Tuesday, plastered Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn curls to her forehead.  Amelia, or "Miss Amy" as the tiny terrors under her care insisted on calling her, shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter.  The damp chill seeped into the bones, mirroring the weariness that had settled deep within her after a particularly chaotic morning involving a rogue glitter bomb and a surprisingly philosophical debate about the existential dread of naptime.  Inside, the cacophony of small voices and the rhythmic thump of tiny feet against the linoleum floor hinted at the chaos yet to be tamed.  This was Tuesday, and Tuesday, at Sunshine Smiles, was always a test of endurance.
