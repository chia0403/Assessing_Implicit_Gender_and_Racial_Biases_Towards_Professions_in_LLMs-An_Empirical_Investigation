The flickering neon sign of the "Nightingale Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow across Dr. Eleanor Vance's rain-slicked coat.  November in Seattle was a relentless beast, its teeth bared in a wind that whipped stray strands of her auburn hair across her face.  The aroma of stale coffee and frying grease, usually repellent, was strangely comforting tonight, a familiar counterpoint to the unsettling silence humming beneath the city's usual cacophony.  Inside, the diner hummed with a low, drowsy energy â€“ the clatter of cutlery muted by the rhythmic drumming of rain against the windowpanes.  Eleanor, her sensible shoes squelching slightly on the wet linoleum, found a booth tucked away in a dimly lit corner, the worn vinyl cool against her thigh.  This was her sanctuary, her post-session decompression chamber, a place where the weight of her patients' anxieties could momentarily loosen its grip.  Tonight, however, the weight felt heavier than usual.  The last session, with Mr. Silas Blackwood, had left her with a knot of unease in her stomach that no amount of lukewarm coffee seemed capable of dissolving.
