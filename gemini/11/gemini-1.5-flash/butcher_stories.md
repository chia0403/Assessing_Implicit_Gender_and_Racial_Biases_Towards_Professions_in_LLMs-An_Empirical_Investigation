The chill wind, a razor-edged thing that sliced through even the thickest wool, whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Buttersworth's coat as he navigated the cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  It was a bleak November morning, the kind that painted the sky the colour of a bruised plum and frosted the breath clinging to his lungs like tiny, ephemeral ghosts.  Oakhaven itself, nestled in the shadow of the brooding Grimshaw Moors, was a town steeped in history â€“ and a healthy dose of superstition.  The butcher's shop, Buttersworth & Son (though "son" was a rather generous term, considering his only offspring was a perpetually grumpy ginger cat named Clementine), was nestled at the very edge of town, a ramshackle building with a blood-red awning that seemed to pulse faintly in the weak sunlight.  The air, even at this early hour, carried the rich, metallic scent of freshly-cut meat, mingling with the damp earthiness of the moors and the faint, lingering sweetness of woodsmoke from neighbouring chimneys. This was Barty's domain, a place where the rhythm of cleaver against bone was as familiar as his own heartbeat.
