The chipped Formica tabletop felt clammy under Elara Vance's hand, the faint scent of spilled beer clinging to it like a stubborn ghost.  Grease-stained menus lay scattered around her station at the "Rusty Mug," a dive bar clinging precariously to the edge of the city's forgotten waterfront.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the neighboring pawn shop and auto-repair garage into a hazy, watercolor mess.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smells of stale cigarette smoke, cheap whiskey, and desperation – a familiar perfume to Elara, who had spent the last five years navigating this particular brand of purgatory, one spilled drink and surly customer at a time.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A low hum of unease vibrated beneath the usual raucous din, a tremor that prickled Elara's skin and sharpened her already keen awareness of the bar’s dimly lit corners.
