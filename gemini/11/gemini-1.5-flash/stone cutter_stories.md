The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, howled across the desolate moorland, whipping Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and textured as the granite he shaped, paused his work, the rhythmic clang of his hammer momentarily silenced.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the half-finished tombstone before him, painting the bleak landscape in hues of bruised purple and fading gold.  This was the graveyard of St. Jude's, perched precariously on the windswept cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air, thick with the salty tang of the ocean and the earthy scent of damp peat, carried the mournful cry of gulls â€“ a constant, melancholic soundtrack to Elias's solitary existence.
