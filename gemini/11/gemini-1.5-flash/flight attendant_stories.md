Amelia Katherine Hayes, meticulously groomed despite the oppressive humidity clinging to the cabin of Flight 747 to Rio de Janeiro, felt the familiar tremor in her left hand.

She smoothed down the crisp, azure-blue uniform, the tiny silver wings pinned to her collar feeling heavy, almost leaden. Outside, the storm raged, a furious ballet of lightning and rain swallowed by the inky blackness of the South Atlantic.  Inside, the passengers, mostly oblivious to the brewing tempest, were glued to their in-flight entertainment, their faces illuminated by the flickering glow of personal screens, each a small, isolated island in a sea of indifferent calm.  But Amelia knew.  Something was wrong.  Something was deeply, unsettlingly wrong.
