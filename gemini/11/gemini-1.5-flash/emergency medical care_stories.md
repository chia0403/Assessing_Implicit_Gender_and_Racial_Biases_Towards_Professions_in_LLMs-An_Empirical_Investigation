The siren’s wail was a familiar lullaby to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ambulance’s aging engine. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the city’s late-night sprawl.  Eleanor gripped the wheel, the slick leather cold against her palms, her breath misting in the confined space.  She navigated the treacherous, rain-slicked streets of Seattle, the city’s iconic Space Needle a skeletal silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard Seattle; this was the underbelly, a labyrinth of dimly lit alleys and overflowing dumpsters, where emergencies unfolded in the shadows, far from the tourist gaze.  Tonight, the call was a suspected overdose, somewhere deep in the Belltown district – a place Eleanor knew all too well, a place where even the rain felt tainted.
