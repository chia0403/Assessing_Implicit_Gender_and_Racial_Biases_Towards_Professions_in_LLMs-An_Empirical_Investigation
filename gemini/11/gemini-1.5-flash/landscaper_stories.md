The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a reluctant shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of Kentucky bluegrass and obscuring the perfectly placed rose bushes until the sun finally burned through.  Amelia Katherine "Amy" Finch, her breath puffing white clouds in the crisp morning air, surveyed her domain.  Her battered work boots crunched on the gravel path winding between the identical, ostentatious houses, each a testament to the nouveau riche who'd flocked to this planned community on the edge of the sprawling city. Amy, owner and operator of Finch's Fine Landscaping, however, preferred the quiet beauty of the untamed wilderness that still whispered just beyond the manicured edges of Willow Creek â€“ a wildness that was, ironically, the source of much of her current frustration.  This morning's frustration specifically involved a rogue raccoon, a missing gnome, and a very angry Mrs. Vandergelt.
