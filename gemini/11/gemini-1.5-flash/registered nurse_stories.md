Eleanor, perched on a rolling stool, charted notes with the practiced efficiency of a seasoned professional, her brow furrowed in concentration beneath the harsh glare of the overhead lights.  The rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of a nearby cardiac monitor seemed to mirror the relentless drumming of the rain, a relentless soundtrack to the human drama unfolding around her.
