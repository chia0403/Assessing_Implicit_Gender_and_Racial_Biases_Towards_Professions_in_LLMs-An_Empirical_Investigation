The scent of rain-soaked petrichor and jasmine hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne truly appreciated.  It clung to the damp cobblestones of Willow Creek, a town so small its single traffic light seemed perpetually stuck on yellow, and mirrored the dampness clinging to her own spirits.  Mia’s fingers, stained a kaleidoscope of greens and blues from handling the day’s lilies and hydrangeas, traced the condensation on a chipped teacup.  Inside “Petal Pushers,” her tiny, flower-filled shop, the only sound louder than the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner was the soft hiss of the leaky tap in the back room.  Outside, the grey sky threatened another downpour, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  This wasn't just another Tuesday in Willow Creek; it was the day the annual Bloom Festival judged the entries, and Mia’s carefully cultivated masterpiece, a breathtaking arrangement of moon orchids and night-blooming jasmine, was about to be unveiled – or potentially, utterly demolished by the notoriously harsh critiques of the festival’s head judge.
