The aroma of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume only Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez truly appreciated.  Izzy, a cosmetologist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and a laugh that could charm the birds from the trees, surveyed her salon, "Izzy's Indulgence," with a critical but affectionate eye.  The space, nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, was a riot of colour and texture.  Deep crimson walls were adorned with vintage mirrors, their gilded frames reflecting the flickering candlelight strung haphazardly across the ceiling.  Mismatched velvet armchairs, each a different shade of jewel-tone, huddled around low tables piled high with glossy magazines and half-empty glasses of champagne.  Outside, the sounds of the city – the distant clang of a streetcar, the rhythmic beat of jazz spilling from a nearby club, the murmur of tourists’ voices – blended with the gentle hum of her hair dryers, creating a uniquely New Orleans symphony.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos felt… different. A nervous energy thrummed beneath the surface, a tremor Izzy couldn't quite place.
