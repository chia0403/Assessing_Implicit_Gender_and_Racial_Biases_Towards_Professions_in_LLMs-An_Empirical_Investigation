The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and something faintly…rotten.  Amelia Hernandez, her crisp white linen shirt clinging damply to her skin, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar.  The midday sun beat down on the crumbling Mayan ruins of Ek' Balam, baking the ancient stones to a near-unbearable temperature. Tourists, a motley crew of sunburnt faces and wide-brimmed hats, shuffled behind her, their murmurs a low hum against the chirping of unseen cicadas.  Amelia inhaled deeply, trying to ignore the growing unease that tightened in her chest – a feeling that went far beyond the usual summer heat of the Yucatan Peninsula.  This wasn't just another day leading a tour through the past; something felt profoundly…off.
