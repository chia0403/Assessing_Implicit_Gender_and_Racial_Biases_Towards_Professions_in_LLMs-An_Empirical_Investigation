He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, the "Lone Star Wanderer," its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple of a twilight sky threatening rain.

Giant redwoods, their ancient bark a tapestry of time, loomed like silent sentinels on either side, their branches intertwined in a cathedral of shadow and fading light.  Zeke squinted through the windshield, the wipers fighting a losing battle against the first fat drops of rain, each one a tiny drumbeat against the already tense rhythm of his journey.  His destination: Eureka, a city shrouded in mist and mystery, and a delivery that felt heavier than any load he'd ever hauled.
