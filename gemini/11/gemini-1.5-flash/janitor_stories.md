The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a discordant symphony, their flickering glow reflecting off the polished parquet floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the slow, deliberate sweep of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's mop, danced in the pale light like tiny, ethereal fireflies.  Barty, a man whose life was as meticulously ordered as the rows of bleachers he cleaned each night, hummed a low, mournful tune – a counterpoint to the relentless whir of the machinery that kept the school running even while it slept.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, linoleum, and something vaguely chemical that always seemed to cling to the gym’s deep-pile carpets, a testament to countless basketball games, pep rallies, and the occasional unfortunate spilled juice box. Tonight, however, a different scent, sharp and metallic, prickled at Barty's nose, a scent that hinted at something far more unsettling than spilled Gatorade.
