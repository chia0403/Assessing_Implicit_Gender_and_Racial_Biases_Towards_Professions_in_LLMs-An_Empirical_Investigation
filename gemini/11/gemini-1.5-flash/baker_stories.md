The aroma of sourdough, sharp and yeasty, hung heavy in the pre-dawn air, clinging to the cobblestones of Rue Saint-Antoine like a second skin.  A lone gas lamp flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the rain-slicked street, illuminating the steam rising from the chimneys of the boulangerie.  Inside,  Ã‰lise Antoinette Dubois, her flour-dusted apron a stark white against the warm, ochre walls, kneaded dough with the practiced rhythm of a seasoned conductor leading an orchestra.  The rhythmic thud of her hands against the yielding mass was a counterpoint to the gentle hiss of the ancient oven, already roaring to life, promising a day filled with the comforting scent of freshly baked bread.
