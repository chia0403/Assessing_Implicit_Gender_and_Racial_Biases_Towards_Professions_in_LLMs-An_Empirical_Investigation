The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath rattling the thin metal skin.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their snow-laden peaks jagged teeth against a backdrop of bruised purple and fading orange.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit air, checked her instruments one last time – altimeter, compass, fuel gauge – each a silent promise against the unforgiving wilderness that stretched before her.  The radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the relentless wind.  Her destination: a remote research station nestled deep within the glacial valley, a speck of human habitation swallowed by the vast, unforgiving Alaskan landscape. This flight, however, felt different, heavier than the usual cargo runs. A sense of foreboding, as sharp and cold as the Arctic air, clung to her like frost.
