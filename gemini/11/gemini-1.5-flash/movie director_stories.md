The salt spray stung Isabella “Izzy” Moreau’s face as the relentless Atlantic wind whipped her hair across her vision.  She squinted, the setting sun painting the churning grey water in fiery oranges and bruised purples, a dramatic backdrop that would have been perfect for a final shot… if only she weren't currently wrestling with a rogue boom mic threatening to take a swan dive into the unforgiving ocean.  The wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the panicked shouts of her crew, a symphony of chaos that perfectly mirrored the state of her latest film, "Siren's Call," a historical epic about a 17th-century pirate queen, currently three weeks behind schedule and spectacularly over budget.  The remote Irish coastline, once a breathtakingly beautiful location, now felt more like a cruel mistress, determined to sabotage Izzy's ambition.  The air smelled of brine and impending doom.
