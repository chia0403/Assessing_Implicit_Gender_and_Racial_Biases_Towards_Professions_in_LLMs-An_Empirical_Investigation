The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Jones's otherwise silent existence behind the chipped Formica counter.  Amelia, or Amy as everyone insisted on calling her despite the formal name stitched onto her faded blue name tag, stared blankly at the rotating display of day-old pastries, their once-vibrant glazes now dull and weeping.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume in this forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of a sprawling metropolis. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful song, rattling the already-loose windowpanes and whipping stray leaves into frenzied dances across the cracked asphalt parking lot.  This was Amyâ€™s nightly ritual:  the hum, the pastries, the wind, and the slow, agonizing creep of another Tuesday night towards its inevitable conclusion.
