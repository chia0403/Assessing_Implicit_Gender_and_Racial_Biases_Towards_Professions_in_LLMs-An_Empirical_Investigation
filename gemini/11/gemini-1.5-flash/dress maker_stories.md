The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill October wind rattling the windowpanes of the little shop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy glass, danced in the quiet space.  Spools of silk thread, vibrant as jewels, were scattered across mahogany counters, alongside bolts of velvet, brocade, and taffeta â€“ a rainbow of potential held captive by pins and needles. This was the domain of  Seraphina Evangeline Thistlewick, a dressmaker whose nimble fingers could coax breathtaking gowns from the most unassuming fabrics.  Her shop, "Seraphina's Stitches," nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient town of Oakhaven, was as much a sanctuary as a business; a place where secrets whispered amongst the rustling silks and where the clinking of scissors was a rhythmic counterpoint to the murmur of the town beyond.
