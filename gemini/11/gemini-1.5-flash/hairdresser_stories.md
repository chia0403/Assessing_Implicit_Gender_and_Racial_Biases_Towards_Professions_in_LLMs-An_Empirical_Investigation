The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Relia" Blackwood.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of her salon, "Shear Genius," blurring the neon glow of the city lights into hazy streaks of crimson and emerald.  Inside, however, the space hummed with a different kind of energy: the low thrum of conversation, the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of shears, and the hairdryer's insistent roar, a comforting soundtrack to Relia's evening.  Shear Genius wasn't just a salon; it was a sanctuary nestled in the heart of bustling, rain-soaked  Manchester, a haven for the city's weary souls and their even wearier hair.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos felt strangelyâ€¦charged.  A nervous energy crackled in the air, thicker than the lingering aroma of Relia's signature Moroccan argan oil treatment.
