The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, stretching the already imposing brick façade of the St. Martinville courthouse into an almost gothic silhouette.  Inside, the air conditioning fought a losing battle against the relentless heat, a battle mirrored in the simmering tension that permeated the hushed courtroom, where a case that threatened to unravel the fragile fabric of the community waited to be heard.
