The salt spray stung Elias Thorne’s face as he wrestled the recalcitrant antenna cable.  Wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate, windswept cliffs of Cape Wrath, whipping his already-chapped lips raw. Below him, the churning North Atlantic roared its displeasure at the encroaching twilight.  Elias, a radio technician for the remote meteorological station perched precariously on the cliff edge, fought the elements with grim determination.  His fingers, numb with cold despite thick gloves, fumbled with the corroded connectors, the biting wind threatening to rip the entire assembly from its moorings.  The station, a squat, concrete bunker clinging to the cliff face like a barnacle, hummed with the low thrum of aging equipment – a symphony of static punctuated by the occasional crackle of distant, distorted weather reports. Tonight, however, the symphony was threatened with a silent encore. The main transmitter was failing, and Elias was the only one who could fix it before the storm truly broke.
