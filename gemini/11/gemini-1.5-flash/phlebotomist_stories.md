The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez's own heartbeat.  It was a sound she'd grown accustomed to, a constant companion throughout her ten years as a phlebotomist.  This morning, however, the usually soothing rhythm felt frantic, a frantic drumbeat echoing the rising anxiety coiling in her stomach.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky bled pale grey, mirroring the unsettling pallor of the patient file clutched in Amelia's hand.  It detailed the case of Mr. Silas Blackwood, a renowned recluse and, according to the accompanying notes scribbled in hurried, shaky handwriting, a man whose blood was, quite literally, unlike anything the hospital had ever seen.
