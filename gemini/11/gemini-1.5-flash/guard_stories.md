The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate plains of Xylos, whipping snow into frenzied spirals that stung Sergeant Valerius Thorne’s cheeks.  He pulled his thick, fur-lined cloak tighter, the rough wool scratching against his chainmail.  The biting cold, however, was a far lesser discomfort than the gnawing emptiness in his stomach, a feeling far more persistent than the icy wind.  Xylos’s infamous Greystone Garrison, a squat, brooding fortress carved into the side of a jagged cliff face, offered little in the way of warmth or comfort.  Only the dull, rhythmic clang of the sentry’s hammer against the iron gate offered any semblance of consistent sound amidst the howling wilderness.  Valerius, his breath misting in the frigid air, shifted his weight, the cold seeping into the very bones of him.  Another night, another lonely vigil guarding the edge of civilization against whatever lurked in the shadowed wastes beyond.
