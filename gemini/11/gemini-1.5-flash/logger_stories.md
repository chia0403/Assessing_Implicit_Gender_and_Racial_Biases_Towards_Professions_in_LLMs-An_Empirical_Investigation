The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes with icy needles as he surveyed the ancient Douglas fir.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and angry oranges, the light barely piercing the thick fog that clung to the slopes of Mount Rainier like a shroud.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, held a chilling stillness, broken only by the occasional creak of groaning timber under the weight of the accumulating snow. Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, ran a calloused hand across his beard, the worn leather of his gloves a familiar comfort against the cold.  He was perched precariously on a rocky outcrop, a thousand feet above the logging camp nestled deep within the whispering woods below â€“ a king surveying his domain, a domain of towering giants soon to be felled.  This was his life, his legacy carved into the heart of the Cascade Mountains, a life as unforgiving and beautiful as the wilderness itself.
