The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled with her tripod, its legs sinking slightly into the shifting sand.  The desolate beach stretched before her, a canvas of charcoal grey under a sky the colour of bruised plums.  A storm, the kind that whispered promises of destruction and breathtaking beauty in equal measure, was brewing on the horizon, its vanguard a furious, frothing wave that gnawed at the cliff face a hundred yards away.  Jagged, black basalt rocks, polished smooth by centuries of relentless ocean, jutted from the turbulent water like the teeth of some slumbering beast.  Mia, bundled in layers of wool and waterproofs, adjusted the aperture on her Hasselblad, her breath misting in the frigid air. This was it. The perfect shot.  The one she'd travelled halfway across the world to capture.  The one that would, she hoped, finally cement her reputation as more than just a promising young photographer.
