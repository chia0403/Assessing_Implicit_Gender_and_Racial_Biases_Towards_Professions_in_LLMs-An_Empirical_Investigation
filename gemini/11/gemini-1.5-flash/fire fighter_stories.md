The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Reed's nostrils, a familiar discomfort that did little to prepare her for the inferno unfolding before her.  It wasn't the size, though the flames licking at the ancient redwoods of Redwood National Park were impressive enough to swallow a small town whole. It was the silence.  The eerie, unnatural quiet that clung to the scene like a shroud, broken only by the frantic crackle of the fire and the occasional, unsettling groan of a stressed tree.  This wasn't a typical lightning strike; this feltâ€¦intentional.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic and sharp that prickled at the edges of Evie's awareness, a premonition settling cold in her gut.  The last fading light of the setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the burning giants, painting the landscape in hues of orange and ominous black.  Her crew, faces grim and etched with the same unsettling feeling, stood ready behind her, their own reflections flickering in the hellish glow.
