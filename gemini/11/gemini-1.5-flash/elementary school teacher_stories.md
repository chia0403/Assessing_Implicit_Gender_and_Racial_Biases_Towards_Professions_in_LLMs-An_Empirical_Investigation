The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the cracked asphalt of the playground like a miniature, melancholic snowstorm.  October in Harmony Creek, Ohio, had a particular bite this year, a wind that seemed to whistle through the gaps in Eleanorâ€™s already frayed optimism.  Leaves, the color of bruised plums and fading sunsets, swirled around her ankles as she surveyed her domain: a chaotic kaleidoscope of shrieking children, rusty swings, and a climbing frame that looked suspiciously like it was held together by hope and chewing gum.  The scent of damp earth and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, slightly antiseptic smell of the classroom she was about to enter.  This year, however, felt different.  A weight, heavy and undefined, pressed down on Eleanor's chest, a feeling that extended beyond the usual first-week anxieties of a teacher whose patience was constantly being tested.
