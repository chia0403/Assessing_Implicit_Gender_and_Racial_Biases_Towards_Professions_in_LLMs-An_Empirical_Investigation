## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Leo's Lines" chimed a weary, late-afternoon tune, momentarily drowning out the raspy baritone of Frank Sinatra crooning from the antique radio nestled amongst the shaving creams. Leo Anthony Moretti, the proprietor and namesake, barely looked up. His hands, calloused and stained with hints of bay rum and hair dye, continued to meticulously layer hot lather onto Mr. Henderson's jowl.

"Almost there, Mr. Henderson," Leo murmured, his voice a low, comforting rumble. He glanced at the clock above the mirror - 4:57 PM. Five minutes until closing. Thank God. The relentless summer heat had been seeping into the shop all day, making even the simplest fade feel like a Herculean task. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, careful not to smear the creamy lather.

Outside, a sudden downpour erupted, drumming a frantic rhythm against the plate glass window. A young woman, clutching a wilting bouquet of sunflowers, scurried past, her soaked hair plastered to her forehead. Leo sighed. Another day ending, just like the last, and probably just like the next. He just hoped the rain wouldn't scare away old Mr. Peterson, who always came in on Thursdays for his weekly trim and a dose of Leo's questionable jokes.

## Setting:

**"Leo's Lines"** is a small, unassuming barbershop nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the heart of **Oakhaven, Ohio.** The town itself is a picture of quaint Americana – tree-lined streets, white picket fences, and a general sense of quiet, almost suffocating, normalcy. The shop itself is a time capsule.

The interior is dominated by two well-worn barber chairs, their leather cracked and softened by decades of use. A large, ornate mirror, etched with the faded logo of a long-defunct razor blade company, hangs behind them. The walls are a patchwork of faded wallpaper, sporting a pattern of vaguely floral swirls, and framed photographs – mostly snapshots of Leo's family, interspersed with black-and-white portraits of iconic figures with impeccable haircuts: Sinatra, Brando, Elvis.

Beneath the mirror, a long, wooden counter displays a collection of antique shaving mugs, vintage hair tonics in ornate glass bottles, and a rotating selection of dusty paperbacks. The air is thick with the comforting aroma of sandalwood aftershave, freshly cut hair, and the lingering scent of Leo's mother's homemade biscotti, which he occasionally bakes and shares with his regulars. The linoleum floor is scuffed and worn, bearing the silent testament of countless haircuts and conversations. Despite its age and imperfections, "Leo's Lines" possesses a certain undeniable charm, a feeling of history and warmth that makes it more than just a barbershop; it's a haven, a community hub, a place where the past and present subtly intertwine.
