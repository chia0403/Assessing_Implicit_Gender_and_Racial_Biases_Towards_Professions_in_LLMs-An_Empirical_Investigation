The scent of beeswax and despair hung heavy in the air of The Gilded Gull. Outside, the relentless Norfolk wind howled a mournful tune, whipping rain against the leaded glass windows and rattling the frames like bony fingers. Inside, Mrs. Agatha Plumtree sighed, adding another dollop of polish to the already gleaming mahogany banister.

Agatha had been housekeeper at The Gilded Gull, a sprawling, eccentric mansion clinging to the windswept cliffs of Happisburgh, for twenty-seven years. She knew every nook and cranny of the rambling estate, every creak and groan of its ancient timbers. She knew where the dust devils liked to gather in the vast, echoing halls, and which windowpane buzzed annoyingly when the sea was particularly rough. More importantly, she knew the habits, quirks, and secrets of its inhabitants: the notoriously reclusive, and frankly bizarre, family known as the Ravenwoods. The present occupant, the last of the line, was Mr. Thaddeus Ravenwood, a man Agatha suspected spent more time talking to the stuffed puffins that adorned his library than he did to actual human beings.

Agatha Plumtree, with her sensible shoes, her tightly pinned grey bun, and her perpetually worried expression, was the steadfast anchor in a sea of Ravenwood eccentricity. And today, as the wind howled and the house seemed to shiver around her, she had a feeling that something, perhaps something quite unpleasant, was about to break.
