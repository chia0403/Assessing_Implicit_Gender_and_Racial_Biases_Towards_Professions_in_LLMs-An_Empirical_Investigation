The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights in the waiting room was the soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Grace Hawthorne’s Tuesdays. Tuesdays meant parent-teacher conferences at Oakwood Elementary, and parent-teacher conferences meant a waiting room full of fidgeting children, anxious mothers, and fathers who looked like they’d rather be anywhere else. This particular Tuesday morning, however, the hum seemed particularly loud, almost amplified by the knot that had been steadily tightening in Eleanor’s stomach since breakfast.

Oakwood Elementary was nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a quaint, picture-postcard town where secrets festered beneath the surface of meticulously manicured lawns. The school itself was a sprawling brick building, its aged facade softened by ivy and a vibrant mural depicting scenes of children reading and playing – a mural Eleanor had ironically helped to conceptualize. Inside, the halls were painted a cheerful, albeit institutional, shade of pale yellow, and the air perpetually smelled of floor wax and lukewarm pizza. It was a comforting, familiar space, one that usually soothed Eleanor's anxieties.

But lately, Oakwood felt different. The cheerful mural seemed to mock her, the pale yellow halls felt claustrophobic. Something was brewing in Willow Creek, something more than just the usual childhood squabbles and teenage angst. And Eleanor, as the school psychologist, felt like she was standing on the precipice, about to be swept away by a wave she couldn’t quite see coming.
