The aroma of burnt coffee hung thick in the air, a testament to Amelia "Millsy" Miller's perpetually rushed mornings. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, promising a sweltering July day in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. Amelia, hair pulled back in a messy bun that was more functional than fashionable, surveyed the deserted studio with a critical eye. Sunlight, filtered through the palmetto trees lining King Street, painted dancing shadows on the polished wooden floor. The "Sweat Equity" studio, her pride and joy, was quiet now, but in an hour, it would be filled with the grunts, groans, and surprisingly cheerful chatter of her 6 AM HIIT class. Amelia glanced at the clock, a digital monstrosity she'd inherited from the previous owner, and sighed. Just enough time to down another lukewarm coffee and mentally prepare herself to unleash her brand of high-energy, no-nonsense motivation on a gaggle of sleepy Southerners. Today's focus: glutes. She could already feel the collective grumbling in her bones.
