## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, the color of faded apricot jam, slanted through the narrow windows of Atelier Lumière, painting dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, shimmering secrets. It was precisely this light that Eliza Bellefontaine, a pin perpetually lodged between her lips, was cursing under her breath. The light was beautiful, yes, but it also revealed every tiny flaw in the delicate silk she was manipulating. A stray thread, a slightly uneven seam - all magnified under its unforgiving gaze.

Eliza sighed, pushing a stray tendril of auburn hair, perpetually escaping its intricate bun, behind her ear with the back of her hand. The Madame Dubois gown, a cascade of ivory silk destined for the most exclusive ball of the season, was almost complete. Almost. Just the intricate lace detailing around the neckline remained. And with the light shifting like this, it was proving to be an exercise in maddening precision.

She squinted, her brow furrowed in concentration. "Blast this light," she muttered, pricking her finger for the third time in as many minutes. A tiny bead of blood bloomed on her fingertip, the crimson a stark contrast against the pristine fabric.

## Setting:

**Atelier Lumière, Paris, France, 1888.**

The atelier itself was a haven of organized chaos, a space breathing with creativity and the scent of beeswax, lavender, and fine fabrics. Bolt upon bolt of velvet, silk, and lace lined the walls, arranged by colour and texture. Mannequins, draped in half-finished creations, stood like silent muses in the corners, their blank stares reflecting the endless possibilities held within the room.

Sunlight, when it wasn’t being antagonistic, streamed through the high, arched windows, illuminating the cluttered worktables. Each table was a miniature universe, overflowing with spools of thread, pincushions bristling with needles, rolls of measuring tape, sketches scribbled on parchment, and the remnants of discarded ideas. A large, ornate mirror, its silver frame tarnished with age, hung on one wall, reflecting the flurry of activity within.

The air was thick with the quiet hum of concentration, occasionally punctuated by the snip of scissors, the whir of Eliza’s beloved sewing machine, and the faint, melancholic strains of a Debussy melody drifting from a gramophone in the corner. It was a space where dreams were woven into reality, thread by painstaking thread, and Eliza Bellefontaine was its mistress, its architect, its heart.
