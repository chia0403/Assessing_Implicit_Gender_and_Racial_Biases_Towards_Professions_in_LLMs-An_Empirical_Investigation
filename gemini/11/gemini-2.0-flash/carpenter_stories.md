The bite of the late October wind whipped at Elias Thorne's beard as he navigated the narrow, cobblestone street of Oakhaven. His thick calloused fingers, stained with linseed oil and the ghosts of sawdust, fumbled with the worn leather strap of his toolbox. The late afternoon sun, a diluted honey through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that gave the town its name, cast long, dancing shadows that made the already uneven ground a treacherous obstacle course.

Oakhaven was a town steeped in tradition and quiet desperation. The once-thriving lumber mill had shut down years ago, leaving many of its residents clinging to the edges of poverty, their lives as weathered and worn as the clapboard houses that lined the streets. Elias, a master carpenter by trade, was one of the few who still found consistent work, patching up the cracks and groans of the aging buildings, keeping the past from crumbling completely into dust.

Today, he was headed to the old Blackwood estate, perched precariously on the hill overlooking the town. The Blackwoods, a family shrouded in whispered rumors and long-forgotten fortunes, had finally decided to fix the rotting porch of their ancestral home. Elias knew it would be a demanding job, the wood warped and riddled with decay, but he was grateful for the work. He was, after all, Elias Thorne, and a man was only as good as his ability to provide for his family, even in a town as unforgiving as Oakhaven.
