The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Evaline Rousseau like a damp velvet curtain. Cicadas buzzed a frantic symphony just outside the open windows of the Starlight Lounge, a symphony Evaline couldn't quite drown out, even with the vintage microphone pressed close to her lips. Tonight, the place was practically deserted. A lone trucker nursed a beer in the corner booth, his eyes glazed over, lost in a world far away from the chipped formica tables and the sticky, half-cleaned dance floor. A couple, dressed in their Sunday best, huddled near the back, whispering secrets and occasionally stealing glances at Evaline with a pitying, almost apologetic air.

Evaline took a deep breath, the scent of stale beer and cheap perfume stinging her nostrils. She smoothed the shimmering silver sequins of her dress – her only good one, painstakingly sewn by her grandmother before she passed – and forced a smile that felt brittle and unnatural. This was the fifth night in a row she'd played to an empty house, and the weight of it was beginning to crush her.

She signaled to Bernard, the aging, slightly deaf piano player, with a weary nod. He responded with a toothy grin and a flourish, launching into the melancholic opening chords of "At Last," a song she'd sung a thousand times, each rendition a little more desperate than the last.

"At last, my love has come along..." Evaline Rousseau sang, her voice, usually a powerful instrument capable of filling a stadium, now thin and strained, lost in the cavernous emptiness of the Starlight Lounge, a forgotten roadside dive just outside of Opelousas, Louisiana. This wasn't the grand stage she'd always dreamed of, but it was the only stage she had. And tonight, just like every night, she was going to give it everything she had left.
