The Dewey Decimal system was Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth's second language. Not literally, of course. She spoke fluent English, passable French (rusty after a decade away from Europe), and understood enough Spanish to help the occasional tourist navigate the biography section. But the organization, the logic, the beautiful, predictable order of the Dewey Decimal system resonated within Beatrice like a perfectly tuned string quartet. It was a comfort, a balm against the chaotic cacophony that was life outside the hallowed halls of the Willow Creek Public Library.

Willow Creek, nestled deep in the rolling hills of Vermont, was a postcard town. Picture-perfect colonial houses, a babbling brook that ran through the town square, and a Main Street dotted with quaint shops selling artisanal cheeses and maple syrup. The library, a squat brick building dating back to the early 1900s, sat just off the square, its ivy-covered walls whispering stories of generations past. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aging paper and beeswax polish, a smell that Beatrice found infinitely comforting.

This Tuesday morning, however, the scent was fighting a losing battle against the acrid tang of burnt coffee. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly volunteer who usually manned the front desk on Tuesdays, had apparently tried to brew a pot while simultaneously attempting to alphabetize the large-print romance novels. The result: a scorched carafe and a pile of paperbacks in delightful disarray. Beatrice, perched on a stool behind the information desk, sighed and resigned herself to another morning of chaos masked by the quiet order she worked so hard to maintain.
