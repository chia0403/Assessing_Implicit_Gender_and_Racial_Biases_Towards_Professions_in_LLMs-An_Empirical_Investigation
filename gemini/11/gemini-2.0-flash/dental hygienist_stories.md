## Story Opening:

The metallic tang of fluoride varnish hung thick in the air, a familiar, almost comforting scent to Amelia Grace Harding. She adjusted the overhead light, its beam focusing on the cavernous expanse of ten-year-old Ethan Miller's mouth. "Okay, Ethan," she said, her voice soft and reassuring, "just a little bit more gargling, okay?"

Ethan mumbled something unintelligible, a mixture of protest and minty antiseptic, before dutifully spitting into the suction tube. Amelia sighed inwardly. It was her last patient of the day, and the exhaustion that had been simmering beneath the surface of her professional cheerfulness was threatening to boil over. She loved her job, truly, the satisfaction of knowing she was helping people maintain their smiles. But some days, the constant parade of plaque-covered teeth and anxious faces felt like an endless, gleaming, and slightly terrifying abyss.

Especially today. Because today, a cryptic postcard had arrived at her tiny, rent-controlled apartment, a postcard that resurrected a past Amelia had thought she'd buried deep, a postcard that promised trouble was brewing on the horizon. She forced a smile for Ethan as she finished polishing his canines. "All done! You were a super star."

## Setting:

The office of Dr. Leonard Billings, DDS, was nestled in the heart of sleepy Havenwood, Maine. The quaint town, known for its picturesque harbor and annual lobster festival, was a far cry from the bustling city Amelia had escaped five years ago. The dental practice itself reflected the town's charm â€“ a cozy, if slightly dated, space with floral wallpaper, framed prints of antique dental tools, and a waiting room that always smelled faintly of cinnamon potpourri. Amelia's own small, but functional, hygiene room was painted a calming pale blue and overlooked a small, well-maintained garden where Dr. Billings occasionally grew tomatoes in the summer. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home. A quiet, predictable home. Until the postcard arrived.
