## Opening:

The rhythmic chip-chip-chip of steel against granite was the only sound that truly mattered to Silas Blackwood. It was a sound he’d known since childhood, a sound as ingrained in his bones as the coal dust that perpetually clung to his fingertips. He wasn’t thinking, not really, just letting the hammer find its mark with practiced precision. The morning light, a pale, watery grey, caught the rising dust, turning it into a momentary halo around his rugged head. He barely noticed. He was deep in the heart of the stone, coaxing out the figure trapped within. Today, it was a snarling wolf, destined to guard the gate of the newly-built manor house on the hill.

## Setting:

Silas Blackwood's stone yard, a chaotic symphony of raw materials and meticulous craftsmanship, nestled in the shadow of the Grey Ridge Mountains. It was a place of stark beauty, born from the clash of the natural world and the tireless efforts of human hands. Jagged blocks of granite, quarried from the very mountains that loomed above, were scattered across the yard like fallen giants. Half-finished sculptures, ranging from ornate gargoyles to simple grave markers, littered the space, each a testament to Silas’s skill and his relentless pursuit of perfection.

A small, weather-beaten wooden shack served as his workshop and meager living quarters. Tools, worn smooth with use, hung from the walls like macabre decorations. The air inside was thick with the scent of stone dust and linseed oil, a comforting, familiar aroma that had permeated every fiber of Silas's being. Outside, a rusty wheelbarrow stood perpetually overflowing with granite chips, a silent reminder of the endless work that lay ahead. Beyond the yard, the small village of Hollow Creek huddled together, a scattering of grey stone houses huddled in the valley, their existence intrinsically linked to the stones Silas shaped and sold. Life in Hollow Creek was simple, hard, and unforgiving, but for Silas Blackwood, it was home.
