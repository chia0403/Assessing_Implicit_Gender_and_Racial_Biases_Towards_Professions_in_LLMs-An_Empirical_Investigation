Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a logger named:

**Full Name:** Silas "Silas" Blackwood

**Setting:** The misty, rain-soaked Olympic Peninsula, Washington State. Specifically, a steep, thickly forested hillside overlooking the Sol Duc River.

**Story Opening:**

The chainsaw screamed, a high-pitched, metallic wail that bounced off the towering cedars and firs. Rain, a constant companion on the Olympic Peninsula, plastered Silas Blackwood's beard to his weathered face, making it hard to see. He ignored it, his focus laser-sharp as he guided the blade through the trunk of the old-growth hemlock. The air, thick with the scent of wet earth and pine resin, vibrated with the raw power of the machine and the ancient defiance of the tree.

Silas wasn't a romantic about trees, not anymore. He'd seen too many fall. He respected them, understood their intricate life, their slow, patient growth. But respect didn't fill the woodstove in winter, and understanding didn't pay the mortgage on the ramshackle cabin down by the river. He needed this tree. He needed a lot of trees.

Sweat mingled with the rain as the notch widened, sawdust flying in a wet cloud. Silas paused, adjusting his grip, feeling the subtle shift of the massive tree as its balance began to falter. He took a quick drag of the cigarette perpetually tucked behind his ear, the ember glowing orange in the gloom. This one was a widow-maker, no doubt about it. Old, rotten in places, unpredictable. He'd have to be quick.

He glanced down the steep slope, the churning, grey-green waters of the Sol Duc a dizzying drop below. A lifetime ago, Silas had promised himself he'd leave this life behind, escape the endless cycle of felling giants. He'd dreamed of sunny beaches, bustling cities, somethingâ€¦ different.

He crushed the cigarette butt under his boot and revved the chainsaw again. Dreams, like old growth, rotted from the inside out. Today, he was just Silas Blackwood, a logger on a rain-slicked hillside, betting his life against the fall of a dying giant. And today, he had to win.
