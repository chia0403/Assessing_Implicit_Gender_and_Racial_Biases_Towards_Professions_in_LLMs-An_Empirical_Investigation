Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant named:

**Full Name of Main Character:** Genevieve Eleanor Riley

**Setting:** A bustling, brightly lit gate area at Frankfurt Airport (FRA), Germany. The air is thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, duty-free perfume, and the faint, almost metallic tang of jet fuel drifting in from the tarmac.  Families clutching oversized teddy bears jostle for space alongside harried business travelers barking into their phones.  Giant screens flash flight information in a dizzying array of languages, accompanied by the incessant, rhythmic chirping of gate announcements.

**Story Opening:**

Genevieve Eleanor Riley, a flight attendant with Edelweiss Air for the last eight years, checked her watch for the fifth time in as many minutes.  Flight LX 154 to Zürich was already running ten minutes behind schedule, and the knot of tension in her stomach tightened with each passing second. It wasn't just the late departure.  Genevieve had a particularly unsettling premonition about this flight, a cold prickle on the back of her neck that she couldn’t quite shake.  She smoothed down the crisp lapels of her navy blue uniform, her practiced smile feeling brittle and forced.  "Keep it together, Ginny," she muttered under her breath, using the nickname only her closest friends dared to utter.  "Just another routine hop across the Alps."  But even as she said the words, the shrill chime of the gate phone, a sound that usually heralded just another mundane announcement, sent a fresh wave of anxiety washing over her. This time, it felt different. This time, it felt like something was terribly, irrevocably wrong.
