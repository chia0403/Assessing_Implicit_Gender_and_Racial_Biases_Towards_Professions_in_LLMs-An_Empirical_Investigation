## Story Opening:

The lobby doors swished open with a sigh of polished chrome, spitting out a gust of salt-tinged wind and a woman draped head-to-toe in what looked suspiciously like edible flowers. Her tiny, yapping dog, a Pomeranian the color of a sunset, nearly tripped over her avant-garde footwear, a pair of glass slippers that shimmered precariously.

"Oh, my dear!" she exclaimed, her voice a theatrical trill that bounced off the marble floor. "Is there someone who can assist with my, ah, accoutrements?"

Standing rigidly at attention beside the luggage carousel, **Bartholomew "Bart" Archibald Finch**, bellhop extraordinaire, swallowed his disappointment at missing the final play of the basketball game on the lobbyâ€™s hidden television. He pasted on his most welcoming smile, the one he'd meticulously practiced in the breakroom mirror, and stepped forward.

"Certainly, madam. Welcome to the Grand Oceanic Hotel. I'm Bart, and I'll be delighted to take care of your, uh, things." He subtly tilted his head, trying to decipher if the edible floral arrangement was actually secured with anything other than hope and a prayer.

## Setting:

The **Grand Oceanic Hotel** loomed over the Atlantic coastline in the vibrant, slightly eccentric seaside town of Seabrook. A testament to a bygone era of opulent travel, the hotel boasted a soaring, art deco facade, all gleaming white stone and shimmering gold accents. Inside, the lobby was a cavernous expanse of polished marble floors, punctuated by towering palm trees in ornate ceramic pots. A massive, crystal chandelier dripped from the high ceiling, casting shimmering rainbows across the room.

Giant windows offered panoramic views of the restless ocean, where waves crashed against the rocky shoreline. The air hummed with the distant cry of seagulls, the gentle murmur of conversation, and the faint, ever-present melody of a pianist tinkling on the grand piano nestled beneath the sweeping staircase. The scent of expensive perfume, salty air, and freshly brewed coffee hung thick in the air, a constant reminder of the luxurious, if sometimes absurd, world Bart inhabited. The hotel, a beacon of glamour and a haven for the wealthy and eccentric, was more than just Bart's workplace; it was a stage upon which he witnessed a never-ending parade of human dramas, each one a fleeting glimpse into a life far removed from his own.
