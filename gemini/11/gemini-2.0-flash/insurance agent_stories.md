The air inside Harold Bartholomew Finch's office smelled perpetually of old paper and regret, a scent amplified by the August humidity clinging to every surface. Located on the third floor of the "Historic" (meaning "leaky" and "infested") Finch Building in downtown Oakhaven, Ohio, Harold's workspace was a testament to the steady decline of his insurance business. He’d inherited it from his grandfather, another Harold Finch, who’d likely be spinning in his grave had he seen the dismal state of affairs.

Outside, the midday sun beat down on the brick facade, reflecting in the grime-coated windows, painting stripes of hazy light across the worn, floral-patterned carpet. A single, oscillating fan hummed a monotonous tune, offering little solace from the oppressive heat. The silence, broken only by the occasional wheeze of the building’s antiquated plumbing, was almost deafening, a stark reminder of the clients who were *not* calling.

Harold Bartholomew Finch, his tie loosened and clinging damply to his pale neck, stared out the window at the pigeons perched precariously on the neighboring building. He was a man of routine, a man of habit, a man desperately trying to avoid the inevitable realization that his legacy, the family business, was about to crumble around him.
