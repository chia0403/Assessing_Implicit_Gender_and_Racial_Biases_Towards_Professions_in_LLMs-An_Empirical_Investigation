**Setting:** A creaky, Victorian-era seaside cottage perched precariously on the cliffs of Port Dusk, a town perpetually shrouded in mist and the melancholic cries of gulls. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of brine, old paper, and pipe tobacco. Bookshelves, crammed with dusty volumes bound in leather and cloth, line every wall, reaching towards the high, vaulted ceiling. Rain lashes against the stained-glass windows depicting scenes from gothic novels, casting dancing, distorted shadows across the cluttered room. A crackling fire struggles against the damp chill in the hearth, providing a flickering light source alongside the single, shaded lamp on a large, mahogany writing desk.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of the keys was the only sound competing with the raging storm outside. Eleonora Abigail Blackwood, her silver hair escaping the loose bun at the nape of her neck, stared intensely at the half-finished manuscript lying on the desk before her. "The Shadow of Coldharbour," it was tentatively titled, and it was proving to be a far more stubborn beast than any she'd wrestled onto the page before. Three weeks. Three weeks she'd been holed up in this damp, drafty excuse for a cottage, and all she had to show for it was a mountain of crumpled papers and a growing suspicion that her muse had abandoned her for a sunnier, less miserable clime. She took a long drag from her pipe, the cherry glowing momentarily in the dim light, and exhaled a cloud of smoke that mingled with the swirling mist outside. This wasn't like her. Eleonora Abigail Blackwood, the doyenne of gothic thrillers, the Queen of the Quirk, never suffered from writer's block. But Coldharbour, with its whispers of madness and its looming presence over the fictional village she'd crafted, had seized her imagination and refused to relinquish it, leaving her a prisoner in her own carefully constructed world.
