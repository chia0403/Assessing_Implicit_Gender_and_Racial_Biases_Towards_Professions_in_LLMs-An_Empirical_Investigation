The morning dew clung to the meticulously trimmed blades of Kentucky bluegrass, each shimmering drop reflecting the nascent sunrise. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, groundskeeper of the prestigious Oakwood Country Club, inhaled deeply, the crisp air filling his lungs with the familiar scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth. He squinted at the horizon, where the sun was finally beginning to bleed a fiery orange onto the canvas of the sky.

Oakwood wasn't just any country club; it was a bastion of old money, where generations of blue bloods teed off on the hallowed greens, forged business deals in the opulent clubhouse, and gossiped over mint juleps on the sprawling veranda. It was a world Bart observed from the periphery, a silent custodian of its manicured beauty. The sprawling 18-hole course, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York, was his domain. He knew every contour, every hazard, every subtle undulation of the greens better than the club members knew their own handicaps.

Bart, however, wasn't concerned with golf scores or social standing. He was concerned with perfection. He was a craftsman, a sculptor of the earth, and Oakwood was his masterpiece. He ran a calloused hand over the dew-laden grass, a satisfied sigh escaping his lips. Today, like every day, was a chance to further refine his creation, to ensure that when the first members arrived for their morning tee time, they would be greeted by a landscape so flawless it bordered on the surreal. But little did Bart know, the perfection he so diligently sought would soon be shattered by a discovery that would forever alter his perception of Oakwood Country Club and its esteemed members.
