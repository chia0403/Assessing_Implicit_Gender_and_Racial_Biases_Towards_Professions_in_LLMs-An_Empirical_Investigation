The bell above the door chimed, a tinny, almost apologetic sound that barely registered over the low hum of the refrigerators. Margie O'Malley, her name emblazoned on her faded blue name tag, barely glanced up. Another Tuesday, another parade of weary faces and hastily scribbled shopping lists.

The setting was "The Daily Grind," a corner grocery store nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a town that had seen better days. Its once-grand Victorian houses were now chipped and peeling, their lawns overgrown, and the air hung thick with the scent of damp leaves and the faint, metallic tang of the nearby abandoned steel mill. Inside, The Daily Grind reflected the town's decline. Fluorescent lights buzzed erratically, casting a harsh, unforgiving glare on the linoleum floors worn thin with age. Shelves, stocked haphazardly with a mix of expired goods and dented cans, leaned slightly under their burdens. A single, dusty spider plant hung precariously from the ceiling near Margie's register, a testament to someone's long-abandoned attempt to brighten the place.

Margie, with her perpetually tired eyes and the beginnings of crow's feet etched around them, had worked here for fifteen years. She knew every crack in the linoleum, every creak in the floorboards, and the stories, or at least pieces of them, behind most of the faces that shuffled through her line.
