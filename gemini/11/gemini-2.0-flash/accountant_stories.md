The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a symphony of drudgery that echoed the rhythm of Elias Thorne's life. He sat hunched over his desk, a monument of mahogany and meticulously stacked spreadsheets, the glow of the monitor reflecting in his perpetually tired eyes. Elias Thorne, Certified Public Accountant, was a man defined by numbers. Numbers controlled his waking hours, populated his dreams, and dictated the very lines etched upon his forehead.

The setting was the third floor of Thorne & Bailey, a small, unassuming accounting firm nestled in the heart of the financial district of Providence, Rhode Island. The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, a brick edifice with ornate cornices and windows that had seen better days. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, dust, and the faint, lingering aroma of toner. The year was 2023, and while the world outside buzzed with the promise of technological advancement and innovation, the atmosphere within Thorne & Bailey remained stubbornly stuck in the previous century. The faded floral wallpaper, the clatter of manual adding machines (still stubbornly used by Mr. Bailey himself), and the general air of quiet desperation all contributed to a sense of timeless, soul-crushing routine. Even the view from the windows – a panorama of grey skyscrapers and bustling streets – felt muted and monochrome, a reflection of Elias's own increasingly colorless existence.
