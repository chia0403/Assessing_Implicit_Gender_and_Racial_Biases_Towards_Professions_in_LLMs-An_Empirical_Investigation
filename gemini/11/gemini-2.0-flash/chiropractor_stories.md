Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a chiropractor:

**Story Opening:**

The familiar scent of peppermint oil and sterilized towels hung heavy in the air, a small comfort against the November chill seeping in through the drafty windows of the old Victorian house. Dr. Eleanor Vance, D.C., sighed, adjusting her oversized glasses with a gloved hand. Outside, a grey sky threatened snow, mirroring the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. She wasn’t worried about the weather, not really. It was the empty appointment book staring back at her from the reception desk that was causing her the most discomfort. Three cancellations in one morning. Three people avoiding her touch, her adjustments, her help. And on top of it all, a gnawing ache in her own lower back she hadn't been able to shake for days. She leaned against her adjusting table, its smooth surface cold against her palm. She was starting to feel like the only one in Harmony Creek who actually *needed* a chiropractor.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Harmony Creek, Maine**, a small, picturesque town known for its stunning autumn foliage and fiercely independent, some might even say stubborn, residents. Eleanor's chiropractic office, "Vance Chiropractic and Wellness," is located in a lovingly restored (though perpetually in need of more repairs) Victorian house on Main Street. The house, built in the late 1800s, still retains much of its original charm, with stained glass windows depicting local flora, creaky wooden floors, and a wrap-around porch that is usually draped with colorful flower baskets in the warmer months. The interior is decorated in a soothing, earth-toned palette, with comfortable, albeit slightly worn, waiting room furniture and anatomical charts adorning the walls. While Eleanor strives to create a welcoming and modern environment, the weight of the building’s history is palpable, a constant reminder of the generations that have lived and worked within its walls. The town itself is surrounded by dense forests and rolling hills, fostering a sense of isolation that, while beautiful, can sometimes be stifling, especially when business is slow.
