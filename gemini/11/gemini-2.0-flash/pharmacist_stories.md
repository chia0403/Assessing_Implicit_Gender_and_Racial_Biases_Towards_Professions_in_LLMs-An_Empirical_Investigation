**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan and rattled the neon sign of "O'Malley's Pharmacy" hanging precariously over the storefront. It was a late Tuesday evening in November, the kind where the air hung thick with the promise of snow and everyone hurried home, heads down, seeking warmth. Inside O'Malley's, the fluorescent lights buzzed a monotonous counterpoint to the holiday Muzak playing softly from a hidden speaker. The linoleum floor, worn smooth in front of the prescription counter, felt perpetually cold even through thick socks. The shelves, crammed with everything from cold remedies to discount candy canes, stood like silent sentinels against the encroaching darkness.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, a sound that usually brought a flicker of mild annoyance to *Eleanor Rose Thorne's* face. Tuesdays were invariably slow, and she was already mentally composing her grocery list for the week. However, tonight, the sound resonated with a different quality â€“ a sharp, almost urgent peal that cut through the hum and Muzak. Eleanor, perched on a stool behind the prescription counter, squinted. A figure, cloaked in a dark, oversized coat and hunched against the wind, stumbled inside, shaking off a flurry of snowflakes. They looked less like a typical patron and more like a fugitive from a bad weather forecast. Eleanor straightened up, her pharmacist's instincts kicking in. She smoothed down the lapel of her cardigan and prepared for whatever the night had decided to throw her way.
