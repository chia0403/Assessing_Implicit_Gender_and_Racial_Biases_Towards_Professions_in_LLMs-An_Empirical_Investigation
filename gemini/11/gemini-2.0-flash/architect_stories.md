## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The sun bled crimson onto the Seattle skyline, painting the Space Needle a fiery orange. A thick, swirling fog was beginning to creep in from the Puget Sound, softening the harsh edges of the city and promising a chilly evening. Rain, of course, was never far away.

**Opening:**

The blueprints were a battlefield. Crumbled coffee cups formed defensive perimeters around meticulously sketched elevations. Eraser shavings lay scattered like fallen snow. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose sharp cheekbones and even sharper mind had earned her both admiration and envy in the architectural world, stared at them, her brow furrowed in frustration. The rhythmic click of the vintage Olivetti typewriter on the corner of her desk punctuated the silence of her loft apartment.

She took a long drag from her cigarette, the smoke swirling around her head like the fog outside. The nicotine did little to calm the frantic energy that thrummed beneath her skin. This wasn't just another project; this was the culmination of everything she'd ever worked for. The prestigious Hawthorne Museum competition. The commission that could cement her legacy. And tonight, as the deadline loomed, the design feltâ€¦ wrong. Fundamentally, tragically wrong.
