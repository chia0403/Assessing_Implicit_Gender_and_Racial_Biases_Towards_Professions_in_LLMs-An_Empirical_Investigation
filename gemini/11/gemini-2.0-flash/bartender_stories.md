The thick, humid air hung heavy in the Salty Siren, clinging to the nautical-themed decor like seaweed to a buoy. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on South Beach, but inside, the dim lighting and the rhythmic whoosh of the overhead fans offered a brief respite. A reggae beat pulsed softly from the hidden speakers, a subtle counterpoint to the clinking of glasses and murmur of conversation. It was early afternoon, a lull between the frantic lunch rush and the impending tidal wave of the after-work crowd.

Behind the burnished mahogany bar, a small universe of bottles glinting under the recessed lights, stood Alistair Frederick Finch. Alistair wasn't your typical Miami bartender. He was a quiet, introspective man, more likely to be found discussing existentialism than mixing a Mojito. His thinning, sandy blonde hair was usually slicked back, though a few rebellious strands perpetually escaped to frame his kind, but perpetually worried, blue eyes. Today, he was meticulously polishing a highball glass, his brow furrowed in a way that suggested he was contemplating the mysteries of the universe, rather than simply ensuring the glass was spotless. He preferred it this way, the quiet, the routine. It gave him time to think, to observe, to be a silent, unnoticed witness to the human drama that played out before him every single day.
