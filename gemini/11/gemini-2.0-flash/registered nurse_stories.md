## Story Opening:

The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a silent testament to the night shift's slow, agonizing burn. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne, RN, winced, pushing stray strands of her salt-and-pepper hair behind her ear. 4:17 AM. Only another hour and forty-three minutes until sunrise, until the blessed shift change, until she could escape the fluorescent hum of Mercy General. She took a slow, steadying breath, the air thick with antiseptic and the faint, underlying scent of stale fear. Her back ached, her feet throbbed, and her patience felt thinner than the hospital-issue paper gown she’d seen ripped earlier in a dementia patient’s agitated fit. She was supposed to be writing up patient notes, but instead, she found herself staring out the grimy window at the pre-dawn gloom, the city lights painting an oily sheen on the damp asphalt below. It was a Tuesday, but lately, every day at Mercy felt like a Monday after a particularly brutal weekend.

## Setting:

The story opens in **Mercy General Hospital, located in the industrial outskirts of Havenwood, a rust-belt city struggling to stay afloat.** The hospital, once a beacon of hope and healing, now shows its age in cracked tile, peeling paint, and the weary faces of its staff. It's a level-two trauma center, meaning it handles a wide range of emergencies, from car accidents and gunshot wounds to heart attacks and overdoses. Evelyn is stationed on **the second floor, in the general medical/surgical unit, specifically at the nurses' station overlooking a row of rooms housing acutely ill patients.** The area is bathed in harsh, unforgiving fluorescent light, barely softened by the faint glow of monitors and the occasional blinking Christmas lights still clinging precariously to a wilted plastic plant - remnants of a holiday long past. The atmosphere is a somber mix of exhaustion, desperation, and a quiet, underlying hum of activity that never truly ceases, even in the dead of night.
