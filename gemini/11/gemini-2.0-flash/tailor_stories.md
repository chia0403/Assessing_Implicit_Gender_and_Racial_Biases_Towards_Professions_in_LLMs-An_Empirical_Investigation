The midday sun, a relentless hammer on the tin roof of his workshop, forced Bartholomew "Bart" Quillington to wipe the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. The aroma of freshly pressed linen and beeswax, usually a comforting balm, felt oppressive in the heat. He sighed, setting aside the half-finished waistcoat he was meticulously crafting. Bart was perched on a high stool in his small, cluttered shop, "Quillington's Creations," nestled on the bustling corner of Cobblestone Lane and Merchant's Row in the port city of Aethelburg.

Aethelburg was a city of contradictions, a swirling tapestry woven with the threads of industry, opulence, and a simmering undercurrent of discontent. Ornate guildhalls, dripping with gargoyles and gold leaf, jostled for space with ramshackle tenements where coal dust clung to everything like a second skin. The air, thick with the tang of salt, coal smoke, and spices from distant lands, hummed with the constant cacophony of cart wheels, shouting merchants, and the rhythmic clang of hammers from the nearby docks. 

Bart, however, was insulated from the city’s grander narratives within the four walls of his shop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating shelves overflowing with bolts of vibrant silks, sturdy woolens, and shimmering brocades. A well-worn measuring tape lay coiled on his worktable, next to a collection of thimbles, each worn smooth with years of use. Outside, the cries of the fishmongers rose and fell, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Bart’s scissors, a sound that usually brought him a sense of calm. But today, even that familiar rhythm felt off-key, a discordant note in the simmering heat. He felt a restlessness he couldn't quite name prickling at the back of his mind, an itch that even the finest needle couldn't scratch.
