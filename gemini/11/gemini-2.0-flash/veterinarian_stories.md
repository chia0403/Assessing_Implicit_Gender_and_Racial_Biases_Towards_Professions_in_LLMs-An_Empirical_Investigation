**Setting:** The wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the Sugar Maple Veterinary Clinic, a sturdy, two-story building nestled in the heart of Havenwood, Vermont. Snow, thick and relentless, had been falling since dawn, transforming the picturesque town into a monochrome wonderland, beautiful but isolating. Inside, the warmth of the wood-burning stove in the waiting room battled against the chill seeping in from the outside, and the aroma of disinfectant mingled with the comforting scent of pine. Outside, the sign above the door, usually vibrant in summer green, was now half-obscured by clinging snowdrifts, its familiar maple leaf logo barely visible.

**Opening:** Dr. Eleanor Rosemary Ainsworth sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in her office. Five o'clock. Supposedly the end of her work day. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of antiseptic clinging to her fingertips. The last appointment, a nervous tabby with a suspected urinary tract infection, had finally been discharged, its owner bundled in more layers than a Siberian explorer. Eleanor should be packing up, heading home to a roaring fire and a steaming mug of chamomile tea. But the flashing red light on her answering machine stubbornly refused to let her rest. With a groan, she pressed play, bracing herself for another emergency call in the teeth of this blizzard.
