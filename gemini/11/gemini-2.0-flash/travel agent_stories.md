Okay, here’s a story opening with a travel agent protagonist:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of "Wanderlust Adventures" hummed a discordant tune above Eleanor Grace Ainsworth's head, a melody that perfectly mirrored the state of her afternoon. Another cancellation, another disgruntled client, another Tuesday. She stared at the crumpled cruise brochure featuring a smiling couple on a pristine beach in the Bahamas, the turquoise water practically taunting her from the glossy paper. The image felt impossibly far removed from the drab reality of her small, cluttered office, where the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and dashed dreams. Eleanor pinched the bridge of her nose, the ghost of a headache throbbing behind her eyes. She loved travel, truly she did. It was the *selling* of it, the constant firefighting of delayed flights, overbooked hotels, and misplaced luggage, that was slowly sucking the joy out of her soul.

"Another one bites the dust?" a voice chirped, and Eleanor looked up to see her colleague, Marcus, leaning against the doorframe, a mischievous glint in his eyes. He was holding a half-eaten bag of potato chips, crumbs clinging to his perpetually stained tie.

Eleanor sighed, pushing the brochure away. "The Millers bailed on their Alaskan cruise. Said they heard about a bear attack and are now terrified of… nature. Apparently, bears are new to Alaska."

Marcus chuckled, crunching loudly. "Well, their loss is our… well, our continued mortgage payment, I suppose. Speaking of which, Mrs. Periwinkle is back. Says her safari was 'entirely too dusty' and wants a full refund."

Eleanor closed her eyes briefly. Dust. Of all the things to complain about on a safari… "Right. Send her in. Just… give me five minutes to mentally prepare for the onslaught."

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. "Wanderlust Adventures," the travel agency where Eleanor works, is located on Main Street, sandwiched between a bakery and a quirky antique store. The agency itself is a testament to bygone travel eras, filled with vintage posters of exotic locales, faded maps, and dusty globes. While Havenwood attracts a fair share of tourists looking for scenic hiking trails and cozy bed-and-breakfasts, "Wanderlust Adventures" primarily serves the local community, most of whom are looking for affordable family vacations or retirement getaways.
