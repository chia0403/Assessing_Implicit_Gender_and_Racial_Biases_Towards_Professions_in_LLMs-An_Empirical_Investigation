The chipped mug, stained perpetually with the ghosts of Earl Grey tea, warmed Miss Eleanor Penelope Fairchild's hands as she stared out the window. Outside, a swirling blizzard had transformed the town of Havenwood, Maine, into a monochrome landscape. Fat snowflakes clung to the branches of the ancient oak that stood guard outside Havenwood Elementary, its gnarled limbs like skeletal fingers reaching towards the leaden sky. Inside, the school was a haven, comparatively warm and echoing with the quiet hum of anticipation before the storm.

The setting was Eleanor's classroom, a haven of her own making. Room 203, home to the rambunctious but endearing third grade, was usually a riot of color: brightly colored posters displaying the alphabet, student artwork depicting fantastical creatures, and a reading corner overflowing with well-worn books. Today, however, the muted light filtering through the snow-laden windows cast a softer, more ethereal glow over everything. The desks were neatly arranged in rows, ready for the students who were already trickling in, bundled in oversized coats and snow boots. On the blackboard, in Eleanor's elegant script, was the day's schedule, culminating in "Story Time - The Legend of the Snow Dragon." A story she knew would captivate their imaginations and, hopefully, chase away the winter gloom.
