## Story Opening:

The chipped porcelain of her "World's Best Secretary" mug warmed Amelia Penelope Pruitt’s hands as she stared out the grimy window of her office. Rain, the relentless kind that seemed to permeate bone, hammered against the glass, blurring the already depressing cityscape of Providence, Rhode Island. It was Tuesday, which in Amelia’s world, meant two days closer to Friday but also, critically, the day Mr. Bartholomew "Barth" Barrington III requested she translate his rambling stream-of-consciousness thoughts into coherent, legally-sound memos. A task akin to herding cats…if the cats were lawyers on caffeine withdrawals.

Amelia sighed, the scent of stale coffee and desperation clinging to the air around her. Barrington Barrington Law might be a prestigious firm in these parts, but her office, tucked away on the sixth floor next to the perpetually malfunctioning printer and the storage closet overflowing with outdated legal briefs, felt less like a pinnacle of legal excellence and more like a forgotten annex.

She took another sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter tang failing to invigorate her. Today, however, felt different. A thick envelope, creamy white and undeniably expensive, rested precariously on the mountain of paperwork threatening to consume her desk. It wasn't addressed to the firm. It was addressed to *her*. And the elegant, almost archaic script hinted at a secret, a secret that buzzed under her skin like a live wire.

The rain intensified, mirroring the growing unease in Amelia's stomach. What could possibly be waiting for her within that pristine, forbidden envelope?

**Setting:**

*   **City:** Providence, Rhode Island
*   **Location:** Barrington Barrington Law, a prestigious law firm, specifically Amelia's small, unglamorous office on the sixth floor.
*   **Time:** A rainy Tuesday morning in late October. The atmosphere is gloomy and slightly claustrophobic.
*   **Details:** The office is cluttered with overflowing filing cabinets, stacks of paperwork, and a perpetually malfunctioning printer. The view from the window is of a dreary cityscape obscured by rain. The overall ambiance is one of stagnation and quiet desperation.
