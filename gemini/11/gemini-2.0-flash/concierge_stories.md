## Story Opening:

The stale scent of disinfectant and expensive air freshener did little to mask the underlying musk of stale despair that clung to the lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel. A symphony of hushed conversations in a dozen different languages, the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of expensive heels on marble floors, and the muted clang of bellhop carts vying for attention formed a constant, low hum. For Bartholomew "Bart" Abernathy, Head Concierge of the Grand Majestic, it was the soundtrack of his life. He adjusted his impeccably tailored navy suit, straightening the already perfectly centered carnation in his lapel, and plastered on his most reassuring smile. Tonight was going to be one of those nights. He could feel it in the tightening in his chest, the subtle twitch in his left eye.

His first omen arrived in the form of a disgruntled poodle named Princess wrapped in a cerise cashmere sweater, held aloft by a woman whose face was stretched so tight it threatened to crack at the corners. "Mr. Abernathy," she chirped, her voice a high-pitched warble, "Princess simply *refuses* the doggie spa. She says their hydrotherapy pool gives her the vapors!"

Bart inhaled deeply, the scent of lilies from the enormous floral arrangement behind him momentarily calming his frayed nerves. "Of course, Madame Dubois," he said, his voice smooth as aged brandy. "Perhaps Princess would be more comfortable with a private aromatherapy massage and paw-dicure in her suite? I know just the mobile therapist..."

He glanced at the reservations ledger, already mentally preparing his list of 'crisis' contacts. Tonight, the Grand Majestic was hosting the International Summit on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. A gathering of brilliant, eccentric, and often utterly bonkers individuals, all vying for his attention and demanding the impossible. He just hoped he had enough aspirin and patience to make it to morning.

## Setting:

**The Grand Majestic Hotel, Paris, France:**

A monument to Belle Époque grandeur, the Grand Majestic Hotel stands proudly on the prestigious Avenue Montaigne. Its ornate facade, adorned with sculpted cherubs and cascading flower boxes, overlooks the bustling city. Inside, the lobby is a testament to opulence, boasting soaring ceilings, shimmering crystal chandeliers, and intricately patterned marble floors. Richly upholstered furniture in jewel tones invites guests to relax and soak in the atmosphere. The concierge desk, a magnificent mahogany structure polished to a mirror shine, is Bart's domain. Behind it, shelves are filled with guidebooks, theater tickets, and a vast Rolodex containing the phone numbers of everyone who is anyone in Paris – and beyond. Discreet hallways lead to luxurious suites, each decorated in a unique style reflecting the history and artistry of France. The hotel is a haven for the wealthy and influential, a place where dreams are indulged, secrets are whispered, and Bart Abernathy keeps the whole chaotic, glamorous ecosystem running smoothly.
