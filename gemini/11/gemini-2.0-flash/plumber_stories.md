The stench of stagnant water and something vaguely resembling kimchi was the first thing John Michael Kowalski noticed, even before the swarm of gnats decided his nostrils looked like a promising buffet. He grimaced, pulling the collar of his worn Kowalski Plumbing t-shirt higher up his neck. The humidity in the crawlspace under Mrs. Hawthorne's Victorian monstrosity was thick enough to choke a badger, and judging by the sounds emanating from somewhere deeper within, there was probably a badger-sized problem waiting for him down there, too.

The setting was the sprawling, albeit decaying, neighborhood of Oakhaven Heights in Providence, Rhode Island. Known for its historic architecture, sprawling lawns, and a peculiar tendency for the plumbing systems to spontaneously rebel against the laws of physics, Oakhaven Heights kept John Michael Kowalski in business. Most houses were at least a century old, a beautiful testament to craftsmanship, but also a breeding ground for corroded pipes, rogue tree roots, and the occasional, highly motivated rat. Mrs. Hawthorne's house, a three-story behemoth painted a rather alarming shade of lilac, was a prime example. Built in 1923, it boasted original (and probably lead-lined) pipes, a labyrinthine network of plumbing that had probably confused engineers in its prime, and now, a full-blown crisis involving what Mrs. Hawthorne described as "an ungodly bubbling from the powder room fixture." John Michael Kowalski just hoped it wasn't anything worse than a blocked vent. He already had three overflowing septic tanks and a collapsed sewer line on the docket for the week, and a full-blown plumbing apocalypse was the last thing he needed.
