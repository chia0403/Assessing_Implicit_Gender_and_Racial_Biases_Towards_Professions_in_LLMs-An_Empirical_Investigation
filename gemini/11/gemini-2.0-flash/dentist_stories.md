The low hum of the suction, punctuated by the occasional high-pitched whine of the drill, usually soothed Dr. Amelia Beatrice Davies. Today, however, it felt like a personal assault. Sweat beaded on her forehead, clinging to the stray tendrils of auburn hair that had escaped her surgical mask. Even the crisp, sterile scent of clove oil mouthwash couldn't mask the undercurrent of panic churning in her stomach.

The setting was the small, meticulously clean operatory of Davies Family Dental, located on Elm Street in the quaint town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Sunlight streamed through the large window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a soft glow on the framed diplomas and smiling patient photographs that lined the walls. It was a scene of domestic tranquility, a carefully curated image of trust and comfort. But right now, Amelia felt anything but tranquil.
