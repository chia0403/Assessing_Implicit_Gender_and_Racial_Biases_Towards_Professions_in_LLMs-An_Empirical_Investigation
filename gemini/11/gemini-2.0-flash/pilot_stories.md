## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The shimmering, pre-dawn air hung thick and humid over the dusty airstrip of Isla Perdida, a forgotten sliver of land in the Gulf of Mexico. Mangrove trees clawed at the edges of the runway, their gnarled roots disappearing into the brackish water. The skeletal remains of a hurricane-ravaged lighthouse stood sentinel on the far shore, a stark reminder of the island's isolation and the capricious nature of the sea.

**Opening:**

Sweat beaded on Amelia "Ace" Corvus's brow, despite the early hour. The rhythmic whirring of the Cessna 185's engine was a familiar lullaby, a constant companion in this remote corner of the world. She adjusted her worn leather cap, pulling it lower to shield her eyes from the first faint blush of sunrise bleeding across the horizon. The air tasted of salt and decay, a smell she’d come to associate with both freedom and the heavy weight of secrets. Another day on Isla Perdida. Another day playing ferryman between paradise and purgatory. Amelia ran a calloused hand over the worn control panel, a silent checklist running through her mind. Fuel: topped off. Engine: purring (mostly). Passenger: hopefully not bringing more trouble than he’s worth. Because on Isla Perdida, trouble, like the relentless humidity, always found a way to seep in.
