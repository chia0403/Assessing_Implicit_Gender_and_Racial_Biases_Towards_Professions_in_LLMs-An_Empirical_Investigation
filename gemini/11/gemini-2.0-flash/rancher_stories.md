## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The sun was a bruised peach hanging low on the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the Joshua trees that clawed at the dusty earth. Jeremiah Ezekiel Calhoun, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by the relentless Nevada sun, spit a stream of tobacco juice into the red dirt. He squinted, his calloused hand shielding his eyes from the glare, his jaw working slowly, ruminatively.  Something was off. Not just the usual desert stillness, the kind that prickled the skin and hinted at rattlesnakes lurking under every sun-baked rock. No, this was heavier, a silence pregnant with… unease. Even the coyotes were quiet.

**Setting:**

Calhoun Ranch, nestled (or more accurately, clinging stubbornly) to the edge of the Valley of Fire, Nevada. It wasn't much to look at. A weathered, one-story ranch house built of sun-baked adobe brick, its paint peeling like sunburned skin. A ramshackle barn, its corrugated metal roof groaning under the weight of years. A rusty windmill that still creaked out its mournful song, even when the wind wasn't blowing. The corrals, built of rough-hewn logs and barbed wire, were empty at this time of day, the cattle already bedded down in the lower pasture, seeking shade under the sparse cottonwoods that lined the dry creek bed. The landscape was harsh, unforgiving – a tapestry of red rock canyons, thorny scrub, and endless stretches of cracked, barren earth. It was a land that demanded respect, and Jeremiah Calhoun had given it his all for the past sixty years.  It was a land he loved, despite its brutal indifference.
