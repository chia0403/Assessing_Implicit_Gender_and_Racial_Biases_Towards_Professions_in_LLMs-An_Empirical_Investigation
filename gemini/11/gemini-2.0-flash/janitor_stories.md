The fluorescent lights of the "Data Stream Dynamics" headquarters hummed with a relentless, low-pitched buzz, a soundtrack to the late-night solitude Elias Thorne knew so well. He pushed the industrial-sized mop bucket across the polished linoleum of the 47th floor, its wheels squeaking a mournful counterpoint to the electronic drone. Elias, a man whose fifty-three years had etched fine lines around his kind, hazel eyes and sprinkled silver dust through his thinning brown hair, wasn’t particularly fond of heights, and the vast, window-walled office overlooking the glittering sprawl of Neo-Manhattan felt more like a glass cage than a testament to human ingenuity. 

Tonight was particularly quiet, even for a Friday. The usual gaggle of overworked programmers and perpetually caffeinated executives had apparently succumbed to exhaustion or found refuge in the city's pulsating nightlife. Only the soft glow emanating from under the closed doors of the "Algorithm Alchemy" division offered any indication of remaining life.

He paused, leaning on the mop handle, and let out a weary sigh. The scent of lemon-scented cleaner was momentarily overpowered by something else…something sharper, metallic, and faintly acrid. It tickled at the back of his throat, a nagging, unsettling presence that had nothing to do with spilled coffee or forgotten takeout containers. Elias Thorne, head janitor of Data Stream Dynamics and, unbeknownst to its high-powered occupants, a man with a past he’d hoped to leave buried, knew that scent. It was the ghost of trouble, and it was clinging to the air like a phantom limb.
