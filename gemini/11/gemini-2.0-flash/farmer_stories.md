The wind, a gnawing, persistent thing, howled through the skeletal branches of the apple trees, mimicking the low ache in Silas Bartholomewâ€™s back. He hunched deeper into his worn denim jacket, his calloused hands tightening around the handle of his shovel. The late afternoon sun, a bruised purple and orange, painted the November sky with promises of another hard frost, another night of shivering livestock and anxious pacing.

Silas Bartholomew, a man whose face mirrored the rugged contours of the land he tilled, surveyed his farm. "Bartholomew's Bounty," the sign declared, though lately, the bounty had been more meager than bountiful. The fields, usually brimming with golden corn stalks and plump pumpkins at this time of year, were now barren and brown, scarred by the drought that had gripped Hemlock County for the past three months. Even the normally vibrant red barn, a legacy passed down through generations of Bartholomews, seemed to have faded, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. He felt a kinship with the barn, both of them bearing the weight of time and the burden of a difficult harvest.
