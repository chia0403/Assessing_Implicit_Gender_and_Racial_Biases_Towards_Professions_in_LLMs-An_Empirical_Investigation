The salt spray kissed Elara Beatrice Moreauâ€™s face as she wrestled open the stubborn door of "Mermaids' Mane," her small, turquoise-painted salon. The wind, a blustery beast today, howled past the whitewashed cottages that clung to the cliffside like barnacles, promising a day of tangles and weather-whipped hair. This was Port Blossom, a haven carved into the rugged Cornish coast, a place where the sea held more power than the land, and the secrets of generations were whispered on the tide. Elara, with her sea-green eyes and the scent of lavender and sea salt permanently clinging to her clothes, felt as much a part of the landscape as the granite cliffs themselves. Despite the constant threat of gales and the isolating distance from city life, she wouldn't trade her little sanctuary for anything. Today, however, a sense of unease, sharper than the sea breeze, prickled at the back of her neck. It was the kind of feeling that usually preceded a surprise visit from her eccentric Aunt Agatha, or worse, Mrs. Periwinkle complaining that Elara hadn't cut her poodle, Mr. Fluffernutter, in quite the "avant-garde style" she'd requested.
