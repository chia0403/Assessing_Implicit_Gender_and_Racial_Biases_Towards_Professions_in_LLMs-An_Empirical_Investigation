## Story Opening:

The screech of the shop door, a mangled symphony of metal and desperation, sliced through the relative quiet of Beatrice "Bea" Bellweather's wrench symphony. She didn’t even flinch. It was a Tuesday, which meant, predictably, trouble had arrived.

A rust-colored pickup, coughing smoke like a chain smoker's last breath, lurched into the bay, its driver a woman with hair the color of overripe corn and eyes brimming with barely contained frustration. Bea, wiping grease from her forehead with the back of her calloused hand, straightened up from the disassembled carburetor she’d been wrestling with.

"Morning," she said, her voice rough around the edges like a well-loved grinding wheel. "Something giving you grief, ma'am?"

The woman pointed a shaky finger at the truck. "Grief? Honey, grief barely scratches the surface. This…this *monstrosity*," she spat the word out, "decided to take a permanent vow of silence approximately five miles outside of town. Left me stranded with a trunk full of prize-winning petunias baking in the midday sun. So yeah, you could say it’s giving me grief.”

Bea just nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. Another day, another disaster delivered to the doorstep of Bellweather's Garage. This was, after all, Havenwood.

## Setting:

**Havenwood, Oregon** was the kind of town where everyone knew everyone, their secrets, and the make and model of their first car. Nestled deep in the Willamette Valley, surrounded by rolling hills of vineyards and forgotten logging roads, Havenwood was a town clinging to a bygone era. The only thing that changed faster than the weather was the price of gas.

**Bellweather's Garage**, a sprawling, ramshackle affair, stood on the edge of town, a testament to Beatrice’s grandfather’s grit and her own stubborn dedication. The building itself was a mishmash of corrugated metal, salvaged wood, and pure, unadulterated ingenuity. Tools hung from every conceivable surface, casting intricate shadows in the dusty light that filtered through the greasy windows. The air hung thick with the aroma of motor oil, welding fumes, and the faint, sweet scent of honeysuckle that crept in from the overgrown garden Beatrice's grandmother had planted years ago and that Bea stubbornly refused to let die. A faded sign, painted with a cheerful, if slightly inaccurate, depiction of a classic car, proclaimed in bold, peeling letters: "Bellweather's Garage - We Fix Anything (Almost!)"
