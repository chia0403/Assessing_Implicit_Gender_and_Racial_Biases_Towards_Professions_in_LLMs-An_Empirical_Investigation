**Opening:**

The scent of a thousand blooms hung heavy in the air, a sweet, intoxicating perfume that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin. It was a Tuesday, the day after the whirlwind that was Monday, and the shop hummed with a gentle, industrious energy. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows of Hawthorne & Bloom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the vibrant colours of the bouquets that lined the shelves. Amelia, perched on a stool behind the counter, meticulously stripped thorns from a particularly prickly stem of 'Black Baccara' rose, her brow furrowed in concentration.

**Setting:**

Hawthorne & Bloom wasn't just a flower shop; it was a haven, a fragrant sanctuary tucked away on a quiet, cobbled street in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. The building itself was old, its brick fa√ßade softened by climbing wisteria and a wrought-iron balcony overflowing with petunias. Inside, the air was cool and damp, a welcome respite from the humid Charleston heat.

Exposed brick walls were painted a soft, calming shade of sage green, providing a backdrop for the riot of colour that was the floral arrangements. Antique furniture, salvaged from local estate sales, served as display tables, showcasing everything from delicate sprigs of lily-of-the-valley to flamboyant arrangements of orchids and Birds of Paradise. The floorboards, worn smooth by years of foot traffic, creaked with every step. A vintage gramophone sat in the corner, occasionally spinning crackly jazz records that filled the space with a nostalgic charm.

Beyond the front retail area, a large, open workspace bustled with activity. Two other florists, both younger than Amelia, were busily assembling bouquets, their hands moving with practiced ease. Buckets overflowing with every imaginable bloom lined the walls, creating a vibrant, chaotic tapestry of colour and texture. In the back, a small, sun-drenched conservatory housed a collection of rare and exotic plants, a testament to Amelia's passion for all things botanical.
