The air in the rehearsal room hung thick with the ghosts of countless productions. Dust motes danced in the weak winter sunlight filtering through the tall, grime-streaked windows of the Grand Majestic Theatre’s annex, illuminating the faded grandeur of peeling wallpaper and threadbare rugs. It smelled of old wood, stale coffee, and a faint, lingering perfume that might have been worn by Sarah Bernhardt herself, back when this room was a haven for pre-show nerves and celebratory champagne toasts.

"From the top, ladies and gentlemen! And this time, with feeling!" bellowed **Montgomery Alistair Fitzgerald**, clapping his hands together with a theatrical flourish that would have seemed ridiculous had it not been so inherently...him. He perched precariously on the edge of a wobbly, decades-old director’s chair, the script for "A Midsummer Night's Dream" clutched in his hands like a lifeline. His silver hair, usually meticulously coiffed, was slightly disheveled, evidence of the long hours he'd been pouring into this production. The sharp lines of his tailored suit, usually impeccable, bore the tell-tale signs of hurried meals and impromptu naps.

Montgomery Alistair Fitzgerald, artistic director extraordinaire, was, to put it mildly, teetering on the edge of madness. Opening night was less than a month away, his star Titania had just come down with a mysterious rash, and the actor playing Puck was convinced he was allergic to fairy dust, a claim Montgomery strongly suspected was fueled by a potent combination of stage fright and cheap gin. The Grand Majestic Theatre, his beloved but perpetually cash-strapped artistic home, was counting on this production to save them from the looming threat of closure.

He took a deep breath, straightened his shoulders, and smiled, a dazzlingly bright, albeit slightly manic, expression. "Right then," he said, his voice regaining its characteristic booming resonance. "Let's make some magic happen."
