The smell of tempera paint, glitter glue, and tiny, unwashed hands hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that usually soothed Miss Eleanor Ainsworth. Today, however, it felt stifling, a thick blanket suffocating the tiny seed of hope she was trying to nurture in her chest. It was Tuesday, and Tuesdays were always tricky. They were far enough away from the weekend to have lost all residual joy, but too far from Friday to offer any hope of respite.

Eleanor stood perched on a miniature chair in the corner of her classroom, the "Reading Nook" she'd painstakingly decorated with fairy lights and beanbag cushions. She watched her students, a kaleidoscope of bright colors and boundless energy, buzzing around like bees in a particularly sticky, sugary hive. Mrs. Higgins, her co-teacher, was attempting to orchestrate a rendition of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" on a collection of mismatched plastic instruments, the cacophony threatening to shatter the already fragile peace of Eleanor's morning. The bright, sunshine-yellow walls of Room 4 at Meadowbrook Elementary School, usually a beacon of cheerful learning, felt oppressive, the crayon drawings and finger-painted masterpieces mocking her current, overwhelming lack of enthusiasm.

Eleanor sighed, a tiny puff of air that did little to disturb the swirling chaos around her. She loved these children, truly she did. But today, even the prospect of story time felt like climbing Mount Everest in flip-flops.
