## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds, painted zebra stripes across Amelia Grace Kensington's massage table. She hummed a low, almost tuneless melody as she smoothed the crisp, clean sheet, the lavender scent of the linen spray momentarily overpowering the deeper, more grounding aroma of the essential oils simmering in the diffuser in the corner. Amelia ran a practiced hand over the firm surface, checking for stray creases, a nervous habit born from years of wanting everything to be perfect for her clients, even the things they wouldn't consciously notice.

She sighed, the sound a puff of quiet anticipation. Amelia loved the lull between appointments, the still space where she could reset her energy and prepare for the next person who would lay their burdens, both physical and emotional, onto her table. Today, that burden belonged to Mrs. Eleanor Albright, a woman whose tension knots were as legendary as her prize-winning roses. Amelia hoped she could coax them both to bloom a little brighter.

## Setting:

Amelia's practice, "The Healing Hand," occupied the second floor of a charming, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian building in the heart of Harmony Creek, Vermont. Harmony Creek was precisely the kind of town you'd imagine from its name - quaint, nestled amongst rolling hills, and full of friendly faces who all knew each other's business. The building itself had seen better days; the peeling paint hinted at a once-grand past, and the creaking floorboards whispered secrets with every step. But Amelia had infused the space with her own warmth and personality. The waiting room was a cozy haven of mismatched armchairs, overflowing bookshelves filled with self-help guides and aromatherapy encyclopedias, and a perpetually bubbling pot of herbal tea on a small side table. The massage room, where Amelia worked her magic, was bathed in soft, natural light and decorated with calming watercolors of the surrounding Vermont landscape. It was a sanctuary, a place where the weary could find respite from the relentless demands of life.
