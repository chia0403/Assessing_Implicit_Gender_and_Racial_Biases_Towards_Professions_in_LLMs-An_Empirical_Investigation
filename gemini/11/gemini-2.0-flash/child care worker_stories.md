## Story Opening:

The scent of spilled apple juice and lavender-scented wipes clung to Bethany Anne Miller like a second skin. It was a smell she usually found comforting, a testament to a day successfully navigated, but today it felt more like a brand, marking her as the last line of defense against the creeping dread that had been building all week. Bethany stood at the window of the brightly coloured "Busy Bees" room, watching the last parent hustle their giggling toddler into a waiting car. The car door slammed shut, cutting off the sound, and she was left alone in the echoing silence of the empty classroom.

## Setting:

The "Busy Bees" classroom was located in the "Little Sprouts Childcare Center," a converted Victorian house on a quiet street in the quaint, somewhat eccentric, town of Havenwood. The center prided itself on its nurturing environment and emphasis on "nature-based play." Think lots of wooden toys, organic snacks, and a sprawling, if slightly overgrown, garden where the children were encouraged to explore. The classroom itself was a kaleidoscope of primary colours and handmade artwork. Finger-painted sunflowers clung to the walls alongside carefully constructed collages made of dried leaves and glitter glue. A play kitchen dominated one corner, while a sprawling rug covered with alphabet letters took up the center of the room. Even now, in its empty state, the classroom thrummed with the energy of the children who had filled it just hours before, their laughter and chatter echoing in the silent air. Outside, the garden was starting to fade under the amber glow of the late afternoon sun, casting long, dancing shadows through the window. The air was crisp with the scent of damp earth and blooming honeysuckle, a seemingly idyllic scene that felt, to Bethany, like a fragile mask concealing something unsettling lurking just beneath the surface.
