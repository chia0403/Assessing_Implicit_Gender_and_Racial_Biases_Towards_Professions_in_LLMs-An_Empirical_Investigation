The fluorescent lights of "Accountable Assets, Inc." hummed a relentless, irritating tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Beatrice Bellweather's life. Outside, a blustery November wind rattled the panes of her tenth-floor office window, threatening to loosen the cheap aluminum framing. Amelia, however, was oblivious, her entire world reduced to the spreadsheet glowing on her monitor. Numbers, columns, and decimal points danced before her eyes, demanding order, demanding balance. A misplaced comma could ruin her morning, a transposed digit, her entire week.

Amelia Beatrice Bellweather, bookkeeper extraordinaire, was a creature of habit and precision. Her desk, though small, was meticulously organized. A stack of neatly labeled invoices sat to the left of her monitor, ready for processing. A small, framed photograph of her tabby cat, Clementine, perched on a windowsill, guarded the right. Even her stapler was a specific shade of teal, purchased for its ergonomic design.

Today's task: reconciling the petty cash expenses for the month of October. A seemingly simple undertaking, yet one that had already revealed a discrepancy of $3.17. Amelia had spent the better part of the morning chasing down receipts for coffee refills and emergency stationery, feeling like a detective on a very small, very boring case. The scent of stale office coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of printer toner, a smell that Amelia had somehow come to find comforting.

She was a cog in a well-oiled, albeit slightly dusty, machine. Accountable Assets, Inc., a small accounting firm specializing in small-business tax preparation, was hardly glamorous, but it was stable. And stability, for Amelia Beatrice Bellweather, was everything. Or, at least, it *had* been everything until the mysterious hand-delivered package had arrived that morning, addressed in elegant calligraphy she didn't recognize.
