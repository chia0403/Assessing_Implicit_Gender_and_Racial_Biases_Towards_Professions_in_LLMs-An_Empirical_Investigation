## Story Opening:

The rain was a percussion section hammering on the corrugated iron awning of The Lucky Strike, the kind of relentless rhythm that burrowed into your bones and amplified every ache. Inside, the air was thick with cheap whiskey, stale cigarette smoke, and the unspoken desperation of men who’d gambled away more than just their lunch money. It was Tuesday night, and the particular brand of lowlifes this place attracted were licking their wounds, nursing their drinks, and waiting for a miracle that wasn't coming.

Arthur Reginald Finch, private detective, wasn't waiting for a miracle. He was waiting for his client.

The lukewarm beer in his hand tasted vaguely of rust, but he barely noticed. His gaze, the color of weathered granite, scanned the room, picking out the tell-tale signs of trouble: the jittery twitch of a man nursing a near-empty glass, the nervous glances of a woman clutching a worn handbag, the heavy-lidded stare of a bouncer who looked like he ate iron for breakfast. This wasn't his usual clientele. Arthur preferred the well-heeled, the discreet, the ones who could afford to pay handsomely for his services. But sometimes, a case was a case, and even Arthur Reginald Finch needed to pay the rent.

## Setting:

The Lucky Strike was located in the heart of **District 13, a grimy, industrial section of New Birmingham, a city still clinging to the fading glory of its steel-manufacturing past.** The district was a warren of decaying factories, dilapidated tenements, and dimly lit alleyways where shadows danced with the ghosts of broken dreams. The air hung heavy with the scent of coal dust, exhaust fumes, and the metallic tang of the nearby canal, nicknamed “The Iron Lung” for its supposed ability to clean the city’s polluted air, a claim disputed by anyone who had ever breathed it in. The year was 1957, and New Birmingham, like District 13, was teetering on the brink of obsolescence, a rusting cog in a machine that was slowly grinding to a halt.
