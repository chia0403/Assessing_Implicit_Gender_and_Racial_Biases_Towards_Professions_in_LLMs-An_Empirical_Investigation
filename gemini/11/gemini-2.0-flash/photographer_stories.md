Okay, here's a story opening with setting and a main character who is a photographer:

**Setting:** The crumbling, vibrant district of Little Havana, Miami, Florida. Specifically, a sun-drenched alleyway just off Calle Ocho, thick with the scent of roasting coffee, sweet plantains, and exhaust fumes.

**Story Opening:**

The heat shimmered off the peeling paint of the building across the alley, turning the already dizzying murals of Celia Cruz and Che Guevara into swirling psychedelic visions. Amelia Rodriguez, perched precariously on a stack of discarded milk crates, squinted through the viewfinder of her beloved Hasselblad. The humid air clung to her skin like a damp shroud, plastering strands of her dark hair to her forehead. She didn't mind. This was her happy place, this chaotic, beautiful, decaying corner of Little Havana.

Today, Amelia was chasing light. The early morning sun, still low enough to cast long, dramatic shadows, was painting the alley in hues of gold and deep purple. She needed to capture it, to bottle it up before the merciless midday sun bleached everything into a washed-out, tourist-friendly postcard.

She adjusted the aperture, the familiar click a comforting counterpoint to the rumble of a passing guagua and the rhythmic salsa music spilling from a nearby open doorway. The subject of her attention was old man Hector, perched on a folding chair outside his bodega, meticulously hand-rolling a cigar. His face, a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and years of hard work, was momentarily caught in a shaft of light, illuminating the deep-set lines around his eyes and the proud set of his jaw.

"Almost... almost..." Amelia murmured to herself, her finger hovering over the shutter release. Just then, a bright red rooster strutted into frame, its iridescent feathers flashing in the light. Hector, without missing a beat, chuckled, a deep, rumbling sound that vibrated in the muggy air.

Amelia's finger froze. This wasn't the perfectly composed portrait she'd envisioned, but something... richer. Something real. Something that smelled like coffee and sunshine and the stubborn soul of Little Havana. She exhaled slowly, a faint smile playing on her lips, and pressed the shutter.
