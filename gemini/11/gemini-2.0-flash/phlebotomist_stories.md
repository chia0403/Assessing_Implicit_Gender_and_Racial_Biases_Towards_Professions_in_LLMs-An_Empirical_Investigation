Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist:

**Setting:** The dimly lit, slightly claustrophobic blood draw room in the St. Jude's Urgent Care, located in the aging, but still vibrant, neighborhood of Little Italy, Baltimore. The air smelled faintly of rubbing alcohol, stale coffee, and a lingering hint of pizza from the shop next door. It was a Tuesday evening, about an hour before closing, and the usual rush of after-work ailments was beginning to wind down.

Sweat prickled at the nape of her neck as she meticulously tightened the tourniquet on the elderly man's arm. Mr. Bellini. Sweet, but with veins that hid like shy children playing hide-and-seek.

Izzy plastered on a practiced smile. "Well, we like to think we've made a few improvements since then, Mr. Bellini." She gently palpated his arm, her fingers tracing the faint blue roadmap beneath his paper-thin skin. This was her art, her small, everyday miracle: coaxing the lifeblood from reluctant veins. Tonight, however, her touch felt clumsy, unsure. Tonight, the familiar routine felt like an insurmountable hurdle. Because tonight, the news her sister had given her was a brick in her stomach, heavy and cold, threatening to shatter the careful structure of her life.
