## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The air in the remodeled kitchen hung thick with the scent of industrial-strength lemon cleaner and unfulfilled dreams. Beatrice Eleanor Albright, clutching a lukewarm coffee in a chipped mug, squinted at the gleaming, stainless steel refrigerator. "Charming," she murmured, more to herself than the empty room. Charming, as in, charmingly overpriced for a neighborhood teetering on the edge of gentrification and charmingly small for a family of, say, more than two goldfish. She sighed, the sound escaping her like a deflated balloon. Another Saturday, another open house, another potential buyer who would inevitably wrinkle their nose and whisper about "potential" that Beatrice just wasn't seeing.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Bloomfield, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**, in the year 2023. Bloomfield, a vibrant, densely packed neighborhood known for its Italian heritage, is undergoing a slow but steady transformation. Longtime residents, clinging to their traditions and familiar shops, are slowly being displaced by younger professionals and artists drawn to the area's proximity to downtown and its burgeoning arts scene. The houses, a mix of brick row houses and small, single-family dwellings, are often in need of repair, but their inherent charm and potential for revitalization make them prime targets for savvy real estate investors. The street scenes are a vibrant tapestry of old and new: the aroma of freshly baked bread wafts from Italian bakeries alongside the clatter of construction crews renovating a century-old building into trendy lofts; grandmothers gossip in Italian on stoops next to young couples sipping lattes at sidewalk cafes. The crisp autumn air carries the faint scent of woodsmoke and the distant rumble of the city, a constant reminder of the pressures of progress that are slowly reshaping the neighborhood. The open house Beatrice is currently hosting is located on **Liberty Avenue**, the main artery of Bloomfield, right across from a family-owned Italian grocery that has been a staple of the neighborhood for over fifty years.
