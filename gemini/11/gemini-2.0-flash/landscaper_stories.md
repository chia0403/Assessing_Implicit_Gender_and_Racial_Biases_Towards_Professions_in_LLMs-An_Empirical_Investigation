## The Story Opening:

The scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass hung heavy in the morning air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, leaving a smear of soil across his forehead. The rising sun, a fiery orb peeking over the manicured hedges, cast long shadows across the sprawling lawn of the Ashton estate. He adjusted the strap of his backpack sprayer, the rhythmic whir of the engine a comforting drone amidst the otherwise silent world. A world that, at this early hour, felt entirely his. For Elias, landscapes weren't just places; they were living canvases, breathing artworks he meticulously shaped and maintained. But this morning, something felt different. A subtle discordance, a prickle on the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the sun. The birds were quiet. The breeze was still. And a single, crimson rose, unlike any heâ€™d seen before, lay wilting at the base of the ancient oak tree that dominated the property, its petals bruised and blackening at the edges.

## The Setting:

The story begins in **Oakhaven, a wealthy suburb of a bustling city on the East Coast of the United States**. Oakhaven is characterized by its stately homes, meticulously landscaped gardens, and an air of understated elegance. The **Ashton Estate** is one of the largest and most prestigious properties in Oakhaven. It boasts acres of manicured lawns, formal gardens, a shimmering koi pond, and towering, centuries-old trees. The house itself is a grand Victorian mansion, its white clapboard facade gleaming in the sunlight. While visually stunning, the Ashton Estate also exudes a sense of coldness and aloofness, a feeling only exacerbated by the ever-present security cameras discreetly nestled amongst the foliage.
