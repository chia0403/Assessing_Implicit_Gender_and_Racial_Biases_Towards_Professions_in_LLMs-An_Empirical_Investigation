## Story Opening:

The sharp tang of blood and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a smell Elias Theodore Blackwood had known since he was barely tall enough to see over the butcher block. He hummed a tuneless melody, the rhythmic thud of his cleaver a counterpoint against the early morning chatter filtering in from the street. The fluorescent lights, always a little too bright, buzzed above him, casting a sterile sheen on the glistening cuts of meat laid out before him like precious jewels. He paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm, a smear of crimson staining the faded blue fabric of his apron.

"Bloody hell," he muttered to himself, a grimace tugging at the corner of his mouth. "Another Tuesday."

## Setting:

Elias Theodore Blackwood's butcher shop, "Blackwood & Sons," was a fixture on the corner of Bleecker and Carmine in the heart of Greenwich Village. The shop, though passed down from his grandfather and father, now stood in stark contrast to the trendy boutiques and artisanal coffee shops that had sprung up around it. Its chipped, emerald green paint was peeling, revealing glimpses of a faded red beneath, and the gold lettering above the door was worn, the 'S' in 'Sons' barely visible.

Inside, time seemed to have stood still. Walls lined with aging photographs of prize-winning livestock and Blackwood men holding cleavers looked down on the well-worn marble countertops. Behind the counter, a row of gleaming knives, each meticulously sharpened, hung in silent anticipation. The sawdust-covered floor, worn smooth by generations of footsteps, smelled of earth and blood, a scent that both repelled and attracted the neighborhood locals who had relied on the shop for decades. Blackwood & Sons was more than just a butcher shop; it was a piece of living history, a stubborn holdout against the relentless tide of change washing over the Village.
