The insistent clang of steel against steel sliced through the pre-dawn chill, waking Michael Anthony Rossi more effectively than any alarm clock ever could. He lay in his small, one-bedroom apartment above Mama Rosa's Pizzeria – a place he'd lived in since he was a kid, the scent of garlic and oregano woven into the very fabric of his dreams – and groaned, already feeling the ache in his lower back that would become his constant companion for the next ten hours.

He knew it wasn't going to be a good day. The humidity was thick enough to chew on, promising a sweltering afternoon, and the news last night had been grim: another delay on the city budget, another round of potential layoffs looming at Rossi Construction, the company his grandfather had built from the ground up.

Michael, a third-generation Rossi, understood the weight of that name. He pulled himself out of bed, the worn springs protesting with a familiar creak, and walked to the window. Below, in the quiet predawn glow of the city of New Haven, Connecticut, the pizza ovens were already heating up. He could smell the faint tang of yeast and tomatoes, a small comfort against the anxieties that churned in his gut.

Today, he was back at the Elm Street Project: a new luxury condominium complex that was, in his humble opinion, a gaudy, soulless monstrosity. But it was a job, and jobs were scarce. As foreman, Michael was responsible for keeping the crew moving, ensuring the concrete was poured right, the steel beams were hoisted safely, and that the damn yuppies who would eventually inhabit the building wouldn't have anything to complain about (except, probably, the pizza smell drifting up from below).

He splashed cold water on his face, stared at his reflection in the cracked mirror – a face etched with worry lines that belied his 32 years – and hardened his resolve. Today, he would build, he would lead, and he would keep Rossi Construction, and his grandfather's legacy, standing tall. Even if it killed him.
