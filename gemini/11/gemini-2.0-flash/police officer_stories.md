The rain, a relentless, icy curtain, plastered Officer Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez's dark hair to her forehead. It dripped off the brim of her worn, navy-blue patrol cap, blurring the already hazy neon glow of The Rusty Nail Bar sign across the street. Little Havana, Miami, crackled with a restless energy even at this late hour, the salsa music thumping from within the bar a vibrant counterpoint to the grim scene unfolding before her. Izzy, a veteran of five years on the force, chewed on her lower lip, the metallic tang of anxiety a familiar taste.

A yellow police tape ribboned haphazardly around the entrance to Abuela's Botanica, a small, unassuming shop crammed between a bustling bodega and a discount cell phone store. The scent of damp earth, sweet herbs, and something distinctly metallic hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume that did little to mask the grim reality inside: another victim. This one, old man Hector, the owner, lay sprawled amongst his dried roots and charms, a single crimson stain blooming on the front of his guayabera. Tonight, the rain wasnâ€™t just washing the streets; it was washing away a piece of Izzy's already dwindling hope.
