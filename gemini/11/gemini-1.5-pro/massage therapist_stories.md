The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast striped shadows across Elias Thorne’s worn leather massage table.  The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a carefully cultivated calm at odds with the simmering anxiety knotting Elias’s stomach. Serenity Now, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed fortune teller’s shop on the less glamorous end of Magnolia Boulevard in Burbank, was usually a haven of tranquility. Today, however, the usual hum of the dryer next door was replaced by a persistent, rhythmic thumping that resonated through the thin walls, a disconcerting counterpoint to the gentle panpipe music Elias favored.  He glanced at the clock – 4:57 pm.  Mrs. Henderson, his 5 pm, was late, and the thumping next door was growing louder, more insistent, almost…tribal.
