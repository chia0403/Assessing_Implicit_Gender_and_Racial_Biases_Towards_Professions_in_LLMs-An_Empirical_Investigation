Rain lashed against the ornate, bay windows of Amelia Priscilla Hawthorne's office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon.  The rhythmic drumming on the glass was almost hypnotic, a stark contrast to the rigid order of Amelia's meticulously organized desk.  Ledgers lined up like obedient soldiers, each perfectly squared with the blotter, pens arranged by size and colour, and a small, silver calculator nestled in its designated spot.  Her office, perched high on the twelfth floor of the Wainwright Building, overlooked the churning grey waters of Lake Michigan and the hazy skyline of Chicago, a city usually brimming with vibrant energy but now subdued by the encroaching gloom.  The only other sound, aside from the storm, was the gentle hum of the radiator battling the creeping chill.  Amelia, a woman of precise habits and even more precise calculations, tapped a final figure into the calculator and leaned back in her leather chair, a slight frown creasing her brow.  Something wasn't adding up.
