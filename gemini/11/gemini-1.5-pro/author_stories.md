Rain lashed against the attic window, a frantic drummer keeping time with the creaking of the old house.  Dust motes, disturbed by the drafts snaking through the ill-fitting panes, danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy glass.  Eleanor Vance Holloway, a woman whose name graced the spines of several moderately successful historical fiction novels, huddled deeper into her worn armchair, a threadbare tartan blanket pulled tight around her shoulders.  The attic room, usually her sanctuary, a space overflowing with books and the comforting smell of aged paper, felt oppressive tonight.  The shadows seemed deeper, the silence between the gusts of wind more pregnant with unspoken anxieties.  Pine Ridge Manor, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, had always possessed a certain melancholy, but tonight, it felt less like a home and more like a cage.  Eleanor, normally soothed by the isolation, felt the walls closing in, the relentless rhythm of the storm mirroring the frantic beat of her own worried heart.  Her latest manuscript lay abandoned on the small writing desk, the words blurring into meaningless ink blots beneath the flickering light of a single, dusty lamp.  Something was wrong.  Deeply wrong. And it wasnâ€™t just the approaching storm.
