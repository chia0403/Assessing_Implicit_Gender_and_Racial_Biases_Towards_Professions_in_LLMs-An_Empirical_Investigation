The biting November wind whipped around Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Thorne as she navigated the cobbled alleyway, the scent of woodsmoke and stale beer thick in the air. Her crimson beret, perched precariously on her head, threatened to take flight with every gust. Above her, a sliver of bruised sky peeked between the towering brick buildings of Prague’s Lesser Town, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering gaslights.  Bea clutched the worn, leather-bound script of "The Winter’s Tale" tighter, her knuckles white against the cold. Tonight was the premiere, and the dilapidated, yet charming, Divadlo Pod Zvonem theatre, tucked away like a hidden secret, thrummed with a nervous energy that both exhilarated and terrified her.  This production, her most ambitious yet, was a gamble. A reimagining of Shakespeare, set against the backdrop of a Bohemian winter, infused with puppetry and haunting folk melodies.  Its success or failure rested entirely on her shoulders.
