Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon glow of the "Cocktails & Dreams" sign hanging precariously above the door. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her dark hair pulled back in a severe knot, polished glasses with a practiced hand, the clinking a rhythmic counterpoint to the mournful saxophone solo wheezing from the jukebox.  The Lily, nestled in a forgotten corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, wasn't much to look at – peeling wallpaper, uneven floorboards, a persistent damp patch in the corner that stubbornly refused to dry – but it was Eleanor's domain.  And tonight, like most nights, it was her sanctuary from the ghosts that haunted the streets outside.
