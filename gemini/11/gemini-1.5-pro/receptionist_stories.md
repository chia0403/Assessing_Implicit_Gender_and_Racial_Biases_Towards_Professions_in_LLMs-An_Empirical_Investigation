The insistent chirping of the intercom sliced through Elara Vance’s carefully constructed calm.  It was 8:57 AM, three minutes before Vance and Lockwood, Attorneys at Law, officially opened its doors, and already the world was demanding her attention.  She smoothed the front of her crisp navy blazer and adjusted the headset nestled against her auburn curls. The lobby of Vance and Lockwood was a testament to understated wealth: polished marble floors, abstract art that probably cost more than Elara's car, and the hushed murmur of the central air conditioning.  Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a bustling Chicago street, twenty-two stories below. From her perch behind the curved mahogany reception desk, Elara felt a strange disconnect from the city’s vibrant energy, encased as she was in this pristine, sterile environment. Today, however, a faint tremor of anticipation buzzed beneath her usual composure.  Today was different. Today, Alexander Vance himself was returning from his extended sabbatical in Tuscany.
