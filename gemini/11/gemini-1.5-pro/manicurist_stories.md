The bell above the door to "Nailed It" tinkled a discordant melody, announcing the arrival of yet another desperate soul seeking salvation for their chipped, neglected fingertips.  Rain lashed against the large plate glass window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign and the grey November sky beyond.

Her salon, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery in the heart of dreary, down-at-heel Port Blossom, Maine, wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was hers.  Elara, perched on a rolling stool, meticulously applied a swirling galaxy design onto Mrs. Henderson's gnarled thumb, her own vibrant turquoise nails flashing with each precise movement.  The radio burbled softly in the background, playing a melancholic sea shanty that somehow suited the relentlessly damp atmosphere.  Little did Elara know, the gentle chime of the door had just ushered in more than just a client; it had ushered in a secret, one that threatened to shatter the quiet rhythm of her life like a dropped bottle of top coat on a freshly polished floor.
