The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vanceâ€™s Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked window of her office, blurring the already fading view of the football field.  October in the Pacific Northwest had a way of leeching the color from everything, turning the vibrant greens of summer into a muted, melancholic grey.  Eleanor, wrapped in a thick cardigan despite the stuffy office air, sipped lukewarm tea from a chipped mug that read "World's Okayest Guidance Counselor."  It was a gift from a student who, she suspected, hadn't actually meant it as a compliment.  Still, she found a strange comfort in the understated sentiment.  This Tuesday, however, felt anything but okay.  A stack of college applications sat on her desk, untouched.  A single, unopened manila envelope lay on top, addressed in spidery handwriting that sent a shiver down her spine. It was from the juvenile detention center, marked "Urgent - Regarding Daniel Hayes."
