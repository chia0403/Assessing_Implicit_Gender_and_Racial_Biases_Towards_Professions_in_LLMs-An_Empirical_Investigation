The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the melancholic drizzle painting the streets of Little Puddleton grey.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour and fragrance, Elsie Amelia Hawthorne, her apron speckled with pollen and stray fern fronds, hummed along to a scratchy Ella Fitzgerald record.  The shop, crammed with buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, roses bursting from their papery cocoons, and lilies reaching for the weak November sunlight filtering through the large bay window, was Elsie’s haven.  It was a world away from the muted tones and hushed whispers of the library where she’d spent most of her life, a life she was now determined to rewrite, one fragrant petal at a time. The aroma of damp earth, cut stems, and the subtle sweetness of freesia mingled in the air, a heady concoction that promised solace and new beginnings.  But Elsie knew, with a shiver that had nothing to do with the chill outside, that even in this vibrant sanctuary, the past had a way of finding you.
