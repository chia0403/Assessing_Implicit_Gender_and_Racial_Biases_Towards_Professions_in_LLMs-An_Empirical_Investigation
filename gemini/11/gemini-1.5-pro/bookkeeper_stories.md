The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows across Amelia Grace Holloway's neatly organized desk, making the columns of figures in her ledger dance like skeletal fingers. Outside, the November wind howled through the narrow cobbled streets of Lower Manhattan, rattling the windowpanes of her small office above O'Malley's Pub. The year was 1888, and the air hung thick with the scent of coal smoke and damp wool, a familiar aroma that clung to everything in the burgeoning metropolis. Amelia, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, dipped her quill in the inkwell and meticulously recorded the latest shipment of Irish whiskey received by Mr. O'Malley.  The pub downstairs rumbled with the boisterous laughter of dockworkers and the rhythmic clinking of beer mugs, a constant soundtrack to her solitary evenings.  She preferred the quiet hum of numbers, the predictable logic of credits and debits, a world far removed from the chaos and uncertainty brewing just beyond her door.
