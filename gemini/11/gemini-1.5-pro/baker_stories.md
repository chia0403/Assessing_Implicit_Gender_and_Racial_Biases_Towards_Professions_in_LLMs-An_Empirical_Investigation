The aroma of burnt sugar and simmering resentment hung heavy in the air, thicker than the November fog clinging to the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Elara Thistlewick, her flour-dusted apron askew and a smudge of chocolate stubbornly clinging to her cheek, slammed the oven door shut with a force that rattled the mismatched teacups hanging above the counter.  Her bakery, "The Whispering Dough," usually a haven of warm light and the comforting scent of yeast and cinnamon, felt more like a dungeon this morning.  Outside, the rain hammered against the large bay window, mimicking the persistent thrum of a headache pounding behind Elara's eyes.  It was the third burnt batch of croissants that week, and frankly, she was starting to suspect sabotage.  Not by a rival baker, mind you, but by the very oven itself â€“ a temperamental, antique monstrosity she'd inherited from her grandmother.
