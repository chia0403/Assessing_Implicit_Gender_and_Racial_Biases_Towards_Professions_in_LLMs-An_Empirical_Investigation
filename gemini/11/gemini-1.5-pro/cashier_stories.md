The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Inside, the air conditioning battled valiantly, but only managed a fragile truce against the desert heat. Amelia, perched on her stool behind the register, idly tapped a chipped, cherry-red nail against the worn countertop. The Quick Stop, nestled between a boarded-up laundromat and a perpetually flickering "Loans" sign, wasn't glamorous, but it was hers â€“ or at least, it was where she spent forty hours a week pretending it was.  The scent of stale coffee and hot dogs lingered in the air, punctuated by the occasional whiff of gasoline from the pumps outside.  A fly buzzed lazily near the overflowing candy rack, oblivious to the sticky demise awaiting it on the flypaper dangling precariously above.  Amelia sighed, the sound swallowed by the whir of the refrigerated drink case.  This was her life, a predictable loop of scanning barcodes, making small talk, and counting down the minutes until her shift ended. But today, something felt different.  A low growl, like distant thunder, vibrated through the floor, making the plastic lottery tickets tremble on their hooks.
