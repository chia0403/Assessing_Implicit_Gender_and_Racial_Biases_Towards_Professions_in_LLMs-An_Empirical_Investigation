Rain lashed against the arched windows of Elias Thorne's attic apartment, mimicking the tempest brewing inside him.  The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows across the room, highlighting the stacks of manuscripts piled precariously on every available surface â€“ chairs, tables, even the chipped porcelain bathtub. Elias, his full name Elias Finch Thorne, a man whose neatly trimmed beard and tweed jacket belied his perpetually frazzled state, ran a hand through his thinning hair. The scent of old paper and pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that did little to soothe his anxiety.  It was nearing 3am in the grimy heart of 1888 London, a city cloaked in fog and whispers, and Elias, editor for the prestigious, yet increasingly financially precarious, literary journal *The Gilded Quill*, was facing a deadline more terrifying than any Jack the Ripper headline.
