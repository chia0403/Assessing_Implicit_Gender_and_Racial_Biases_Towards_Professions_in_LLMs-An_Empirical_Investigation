The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts clinging to the air. Greenwich Village, usually a vibrant tapestry of artists and eccentrics, was hunkered down against the early winter chill.  Amelia clutched her oversized tote bag, its contents – a stack of patient files, a well-worn copy of "Nourishing Traditions," and a half-eaten apple – jostling with each step.  Her destination was number 123½, a quirky little brownstone tucked between a bustling Italian trattoria and a dusty antique shop.  Here, nestled in a cozy basement apartment, was Amelia's nutrition practice, a sanctuary of wholesome advice and personalized meal plans in a city obsessed with the latest fad diets.  The flickering gas lamp in the window, its warm glow a beacon in the gathering dusk, beckoned her forward. Inside, a peculiar aroma – a mix of ginger, turmeric, and something faintly… metallic? – hung in the air, hinting that her next client might be more challenging than usual.
