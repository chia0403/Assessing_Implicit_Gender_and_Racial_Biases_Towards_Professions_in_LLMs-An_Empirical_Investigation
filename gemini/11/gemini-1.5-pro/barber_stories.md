The rusty bell above the door of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" jangled a mournful tune as the first customer of the day entered.  Thick fog, the kind that clung to the cobbled streets of Galway like a damp shroud, still choked the air, muting the usual morning clamour of the fish market just around the corner.  Finnian O'Malley himself, a man whose neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard echoed the swirling greys of the dawn sky, wiped down his already spotless barber chair with a practiced hand.  The Parlour, a small, snug space dominated by the imposing oak chair and the faint, lingering aroma of bay rum, felt like a sanctuary against the chill and the damp. Sunlight, watery and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-streaked windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden shafts.  Outside, the melancholic cry of a gull sliced through the stillness. It was going to be one of *those* days, Finnian could feel it in his bones.
