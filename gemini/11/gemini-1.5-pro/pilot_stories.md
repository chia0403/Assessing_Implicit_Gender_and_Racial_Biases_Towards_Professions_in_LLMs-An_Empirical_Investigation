The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's parka, stinging her cheeks even through the thick layers of fleece.  The sun, a pale ghost in the pre-dawn sky, cast long, distorted shadows across the frozen expanse of Lake Hood, Anchorage.  Its surface, normally a churning mess of floatplanes in the summer months, was now a solid sheet of ice, scarred by snowmobile tracks and the occasional pressure ridge.  Ace exhaled, a plume of white vapor momentarily obscuring her view of the de Havilland Beaver, its skis gleaming under the faint light.  This was her office, her domain, and this morning, it was her escape route.  The radio crackled to life, a gruff voice breaking the icy silence.  "N427AB, you ready to copy your clearance?"  Ace keyed her mic. "Ready when you are, Anchorage Ground." This wasn't just another flight; this one was personal.
