The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn canvas hat and stinging his cheeks. Frost crunched under his boots as he surveyed Mrs. Hawthorne’s sprawling garden, now a tapestry of muted browns and golds.  The grand Victorian house loomed behind him, its gables and intricate gingerbread trim stark against the iron-grey sky of Hollow Creek, Massachusetts.  This small, secluded town nestled in the Berkshire foothills, a place where autumn lingered like a stubborn houseguest, was where Elias had built his landscaping business, Thorne & Green, brick by carefully placed brick. He’d pruned and shaped these gardens, these lives, for nearly two decades, and he knew the secrets hidden beneath the fallen leaves as well as he knew the lines etched on his own weathered hands. But this year, the chill in the air carried more than just the promise of winter; it carried a premonition, a sense of unease that settled deep in Elias’s bones. The Hawthorne house had always been… different.
