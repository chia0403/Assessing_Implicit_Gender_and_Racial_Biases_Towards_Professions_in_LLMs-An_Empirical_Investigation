The salt-laced wind whipped at Eliza Vivienne Hollowayâ€™s easel, threatening to tear the canvas from its moorings and send it spiraling into the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea.  Perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the whitewashed village of Oia on the Greek island of Santorini, Eliza anchored the easel with one hand, her paintbrush clutched tightly in the other. The caldera, a vast, flooded volcanic crater, stretched before her, a breathtaking panorama of sapphire and cobalt under a sky the color of a robin's egg. The late afternoon sun cast long, dramatic shadows across the cascading layers of white-painted houses that clung to the cliffside like barnacles to a ship's hull.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and wild oregano, vibrated with a quiet energy, a hum that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the island. This was Eliza's third attempt to capture the ephemeral light, the almost mythical quality of Santorini, and she knew, with a painter's instinct, that this time, she might finally succeed.
