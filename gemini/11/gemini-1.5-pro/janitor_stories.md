The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished linoleum floor.  Elijah Vance, a man whose name suggested a prophet but whose life resembled more a forgotten footnote, pushed his cleaning cart along the deserted corridor.  It was 2:17 am, the quietest hour in the building, a time when even the genetically modified lab rats seemed to hold their breath. Outside, a thin, icy rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Kyoto.  The city, a neon labyrinth of towering skyscrapers and shimmering holographic advertisements, was a world away from the sterile, antiseptic environment Elijah inhabited each night.  His cart, a rattling collection of disinfectant sprays, microfiber cloths, and biohazard waste bags, was his only companion in this lonely domain of scientific pursuit.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A low hum, almost imperceptible, vibrated through the floor, and a faint, coppery scent hung in the air, a scent Elijah knew wasn't part of the usual bleach and formaldehyde cocktail.
