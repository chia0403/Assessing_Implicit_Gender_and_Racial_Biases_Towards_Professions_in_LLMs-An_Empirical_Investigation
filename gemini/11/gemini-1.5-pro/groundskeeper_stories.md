The damp earth clung to Elias Thorne's worn leather boots as he trudged across the sprawling lawns of Athelney Manor.  A mist, thick as a shepherd's fleece, draped itself over the manicured hedges and ancient oaks, muting the vibrant colours of the autumn dawn to muted pastels. Athelney, once the jewel of the Somerset countryside, now sat in a state of gentle decay, its grandeur faded like a watercolour left in the sun.  Elias, the manor's sole groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every twist of its overgrown paths, every hidden grotto, every whispering secret the ancient stones held. He carried the weight of the estate's decline as surely as he carried the weathered watering can in his calloused hand, a constant reminder of both its past glory and his quiet, solitary present. This morning, however, the air hung with an unusual stillness, a premonition that settled on Elias like the clinging mist, hinting that something within the familiar confines of Athelney was about to change.
