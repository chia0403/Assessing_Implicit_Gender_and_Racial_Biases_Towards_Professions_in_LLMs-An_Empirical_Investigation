Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Clarion, blurring the neon glow of the "24-Hour Diner" sign across the street.  Inside, Amelia "Millie" Reyes-Hernandez hunched over her desk, the flickering fluorescent lights overhead casting harsh shadows on the piles of crumpled newspapers and half-empty coffee cups that surrounded her.  It was 2:17 AM in Port Blossom, Oregon, a town clinging to the edge of the Pacific like a barnacle on a rusting hull, and Millie, the Clarion's sole remaining reporter, was chasing a story that smelled fishier than the trawlers down at the docks. The air hung thick with the scent of saltwater and secrets, a familiar aroma in this town where everyone knew everyone, and everyone seemed to have something to hide.  Her phone buzzed, a grainy photo appearing on the cracked screen â€“ a picture of a fishing boat, the 'Sea Serpent', engulfed in flames against the backdrop of a stormy night sky.  This was it. The story that could finally get her out of this town.  Or, perhaps, drag her deeper into its murky depths.
