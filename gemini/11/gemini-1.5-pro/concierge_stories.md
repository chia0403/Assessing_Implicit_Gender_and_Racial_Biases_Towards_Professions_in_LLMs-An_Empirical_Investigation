The rain hammered against the arched windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, mirroring the frantic rhythm tapping in Beatrice "Bea" Dubois's chest.  Neon signs from the bustling Parisian street below bled through the downpour, casting a kaleidoscopic glow across the opulent lobby.  Marble gleamed under the crystal chandeliers, and the air hung thick with the scent of lilies and old money.  Bea, perched behind her polished mahogany desk, felt the familiar pre-shift hum of anticipation.  Tonight was the Grand Majestic’s annual Masquerade Ball, a swirling vortex of champagne flutes, secrets, and silk masks – and Bea, as the hotel's head concierge, was at the eye of the storm.  She smoothed down her impeccably tailored navy suit, the tiny silver Eiffel Tower pinned to her lapel winking in the light.  The calm veneer she projected, however, belied the flutter of unease that had taken root in her stomach.  A single, anonymous note sat on her desk, the stark white a jarring contrast against the dark wood.  It read simply: "Tonight, the secrets will be revealed."
