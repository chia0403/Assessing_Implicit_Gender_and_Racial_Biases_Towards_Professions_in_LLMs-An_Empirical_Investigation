The biting wind whipped off Lake Erie, carrying the scent of stale beer and regret.  The rusty, skeletal remains of the Euclid Beach Park Grand Carousel, a ghost of Cleveland’s happier past, creaked mournfully in the distance. This wasn't the backdrop Eleanor "Ellie" Vance had envisioned for her triumphant return to coaching, but then again, very little about the past five years had gone according to plan. She tugged her threadbare Cleveland Indians cap lower over her ears, trying to block out both the cold and the gnawing feeling of unease.  The flickering sodium lights of the nearly empty Edgewater Park parking lot cast long, distorted shadows, making the scattered groups of teenagers huddled around bonfires look less like innocent revelers and more like figures in a dystopian film. Ellie shifted her weight, the worn leather of her coaching clipboard digging into her hip, and focused on the dilapidated baseball diamond beyond the parking lot, its chain-link fence rusted and gaping like a missing tooth.
