The wind, sharp and smelling of approaching snow, whipped at Amelia Jane Cartwright's thick wool coat as she surveyed the vast expanse of the Cartwright Ranch.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color low on the horizon, cast long shadows across the frost-covered fields of  southeastern Montana.  The Rocking C brand, burned deep into the weathered wood of the fence posts, stretched as far as the eye could see, bordering the rolling hills that bled into the imposing silhouette of the Beartooth Mountains.  Winter was coming fast to the high plains, and Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, knew there was still much to be done before the first heavy snowfall.  A lone coyote howled in the distance, a mournful sound that echoed Amelia's own sense of unease. This winter felt different, heavier somehow, and a knot of worry tightened in her stomach.  It wasn't just the weather; something else was stirring in the air, something cold and predatory.
