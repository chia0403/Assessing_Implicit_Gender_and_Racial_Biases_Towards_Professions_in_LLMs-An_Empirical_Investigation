The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in his gut.  His office, usually a sanctuary of polished chrome and sterile white, felt oppressive tonight.  The Portland, Oregon, fog, thick as cotton wool, had swallowed the city whole, blurring the neon glow of the distant Pioneer Courthouse Square and muffling the usual clatter of the streetcar.  Elias adjusted his tie, the Windsor knot feeling too tight against his throat. He glanced at the antique clock ticking on the wall, its golden hands inching towards 8 pm.  His last patient, a particularly nervous Mrs. Henderson, had left an hour ago.  He should have gone home too, joined his wife, Clara, for their usual Tuesday night takeout and bad reality TV. But tonight, he couldn't bring himself to leave. Something felt wrong.  A prickling unease, like the phantom ache of a pulled tooth, lingered in the air.
