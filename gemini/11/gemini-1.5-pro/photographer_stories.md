The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, stinging Amelia Reyesâ€™s cheeks and making the tripod legs tremble beneath her vintage Hasselblad.  Grey cliffs, streaked with white guano, plunged dramatically into the churning turquoise waters below.  The air, thick with the salty tang of the sea and the pungent aroma of seaweed, vibrated with the cries of thousands of gannets nesting precariously on the narrow ledges.  Skellig Michael, a jagged, emerald-green island rising from the ocean some eight miles off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, felt like the edge of the world.  Amelia, hunched against the gusts in a thick Aran sweater, adjusted her lens, seeking to capture the untamed beauty, the raw power of this isolated sanctuary.  This was the culmination of a year-long project, documenting the lives of these magnificent seabirds, and she was determined to get the perfect shot, one that conveyed the fragile balance between life and the elements on this windswept outpost.
