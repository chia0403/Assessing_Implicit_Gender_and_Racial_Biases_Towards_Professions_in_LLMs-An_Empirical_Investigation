The insistent Florida sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's pearl-white sedan, the heat shimmering off the asphalt of Biscayne Boulevard.  Palm trees swayed lazily in the humid breeze, offering little respite from the oppressive July weather. Amy, her crisp white blouse clinging uncomfortably to her back, tapped her perfectly manicured nails against the steering wheel, waiting for the light to change. She checked her reflection in the rearview mirror, smoothing down a stray strand of her dark hair.  Another claim to file, another unhappy customer to placate. This was the glamorous life of an insurance agent in Miami, or at least, that’s what she’d told her abuela back in Hialeah. The reality was less postcard-perfect and more perspiration-soaked paperwork.  Today's client, a Mr. Horacio Silva, had reported his prized yacht, the "Siren's Song,"  stolen from its mooring in the exclusive marina just off Star Island.  Amy sighed.  Stolen yachts weren't exactly covered by the standard homeowner’s policy, and explaining that to Mr. Silva was likely to be as pleasant as wrestling an alligator.
