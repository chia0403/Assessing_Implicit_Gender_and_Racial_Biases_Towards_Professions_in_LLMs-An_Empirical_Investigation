The recycled air hummed a monotonous C-sharp, a lullaby only Amelia Grace Hawthorne could truly appreciate after fifteen years serenading the skies.  Outside, the bruised purple of a pre-dawn sky bled into the inky blackness, the curvature of the earth a subtle, breathtaking reminder of the sheer improbability of flight.  Amelia, perched on the jumpseat in the galley of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, sipped lukewarm coffee from a chipped mug, the airline's logo barely visible beneath a constellation of scratches. Flight 42 from Tokyo Narita to New York JFK was almost full, a mix of weary businessmen, excited tourists, and a handful of crying babies â€“ the usual symphony of transpacific travel.  The cabin lights were dimmed, mimicking the slumbering world below, but for Amelia, the real journey was just about to begin. A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, something beyond the usual sterile scent of disinfectant and reheated meals. It prickled her senses, a dissonant note in the otherwise familiar rhythm of the flight.  And Amelia, with her years of experience navigating the pressurized metal tube hurtling through the stratosphere, knew something was off.
