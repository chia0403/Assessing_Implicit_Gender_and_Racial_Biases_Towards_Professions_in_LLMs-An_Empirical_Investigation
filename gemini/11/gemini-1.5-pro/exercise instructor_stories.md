The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically, offering little respite from the oppressive humidity. Inside "Body By Beatriz," the air conditioning struggled valiantly against the Florida heat.  Sweat slicked the polished wood floors, a testament to the energy radiating from  Beatriz "Bea" Rodriguez, whose booming voice cut through the pulsating Latin rhythms.  Bea, a whirlwind of toned muscle and vibrant energy, bounced in front of her class of twenty-odd souls, her black ponytail whipping back and forth like a metronome.  "And one! Two! Feel the burn!  Three! Four! Like a firework, explode! Five! Six!  Don't quit now, mis amores!"  Her smile, as dazzling as the South Beach sunshine, never faltered, even as she pushed her class to their limits.  Outside, the rumble of a lowrider passing by punctuated the rhythmic grunts and gasps emanating from the studio. It was just another Wednesday morning in Bea's world â€“ a world of squats, salsa, and the relentless pursuit of physical perfection.
