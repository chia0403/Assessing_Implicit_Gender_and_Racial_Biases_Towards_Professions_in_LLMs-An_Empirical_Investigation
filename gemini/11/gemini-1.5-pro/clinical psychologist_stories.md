Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his latest patient. The room, usually a sanctuary of calm with its muted earth tones and strategically placed ferns, felt charged with a nervous energy.  Located on the fifth floor of a converted brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined street in Brooklyn Heights, the office overlooked the churning gray waters of the East River. The Manhattan skyline, normally a vibrant spectacle, was shrouded in mist, its iconic towers reduced to ghostly silhouettes.  Elias, a man of meticulous habits, adjusted the brass lamp on his oak desk, its warm glow casting long shadows across the Persian rug. He glanced at the antique clock ticking softly on the mantelpiece â€“ 7:58 pm. Two minutes until his most enigmatic patient, Ms. Seraphina Bellweather, was due to arrive.
