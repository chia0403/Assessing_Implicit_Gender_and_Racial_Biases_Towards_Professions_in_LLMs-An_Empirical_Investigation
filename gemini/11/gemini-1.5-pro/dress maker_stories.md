The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the open window of Genevieve Beaumont's atelier, a melodic counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and freshly pressed linen, hung heavy in the small, second-story room overlooking Rue de la Paix in Paris, 1888.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace curtains, dappled the polished wood floor, illuminating bolts of silk and satin stacked neatly against the far wall. Genevieve, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical knot, pinned a length of emerald green velvet to her dress form, her brow furrowed in concentration.  A half-finished ball gown of ivory silk, destined for the Comtesse de Valois, lay draped over a nearby chair, a testament to Genevieve's burgeoning reputation as the most sought-after dressmaker in the fashionable 1st arrondissement.  Outside, the bustling city pulsed with life, but within the confines of her atelier, Genevieveâ€™s world revolved around the whisper of fabric and the precise artistry of her needle.
