The clatter of mismatched plates and the sizzle of a thousand frying pans formed the soundtrack of Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's life. The Golden Spoon Diner, a chrome-plated behemoth squatting on the edge of Highway 17 in dusty Harmony Creek, Nevada, was her kingdom, or at least, her fiefdom.  The air, thick with the scent of coffee, bacon grease, and Mrs. Higgins' infamous cinnamon rolls, hung heavy, clinging to Amy's starched uniform like a second skin.  Sunlight, weak and watery from the late November sky, filtered through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating booths upholstered in cracked vinyl the color of a faded sunset. It was a Tuesday, slow even for Harmony Creek, and Amy leaned against the counter, idly polishing a coffee cup and watching tumbleweeds skip across the empty highway.  She knew every crack in the linoleum floor, every stain on the Formica tables, and the precise caffeine tolerance of every regular who graced (or disgraced, depending on their tip) her section. This wasn't the life she'd envisioned for herself, not by a long shot, but for now, it was all she had.
