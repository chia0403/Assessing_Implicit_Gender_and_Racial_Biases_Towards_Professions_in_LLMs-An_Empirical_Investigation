The salt spray stung Amelia Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Cornish coast a familiar lullaby.  Her cottage, perched precariously on the cliff edge outside the tiny village of Portwenn, was a whirlwind of organised chaos.  Stacks of manuscripts teetered on every surface, interspersed with overflowing ashtrays and mugs stained with the ghosts of countless cups of tea.  A battered typewriter sat on a small table by the window, its keys dusty and expectant.  November had arrived in a flurry of grey skies and biting winds, driving Amelia, a writer of gothic thrillers, further into her self-imposed exile. This isolation, she claimed, was essential for nurturing her creativity, though the villagers whispered it was more likely a consequence of the strange, unsettling stories she penned and the even stranger life she led within the confines of Seawhisper Cottage.
