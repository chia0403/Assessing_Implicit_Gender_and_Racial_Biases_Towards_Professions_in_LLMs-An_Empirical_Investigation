The wind, sharp as a chisel, whipped through the valley of Aosta, carrying the scent of pine and freshly fallen snow.  Nestled against the foot of Monte Emilius, the village of Charvaz huddled beneath a sky the colour of bruised slate.  Here, amidst the granite giants that dwarfed even the oldest churches, Elias Thorne, a man whose hands were as rough and weathered as the stone he worked, plied his ancient craft.  His workshop, little more than a lean-to built against the cliff face, was filled with the rhythmic ring of hammer against chisel, a sound that echoed through the valley like the heartbeat of the mountain itself.  The first light of dawn, pale and hesitant, illuminated the intricate floral motif Elias was coaxing from a block of rose-coloured marble, destined to become the lintel of the new chapel in the village square.  He paused, his breath clouding in the frigid air, and ran a calloused thumb over the delicate petals, a flicker of pride softening the hard lines of his face. This commission, the most prestigious of his career, was more than just another job; it was a testament to his lifelong dedication, a love letter carved in stone to the mountains he called home.
