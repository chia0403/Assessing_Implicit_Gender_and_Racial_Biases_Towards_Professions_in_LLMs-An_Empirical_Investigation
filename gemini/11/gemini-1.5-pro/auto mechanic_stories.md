The rusty tang of old motor oil clung to the air like a second skin in the Grease Monkey Garage, a ramshackle building nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bowling alley on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada.  Dustbowl lived up to its name, a sun-baked town where tumbleweeds outnumbered people and the wind howled a mournful tune across the cracked asphalt.  Inside the garage, flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the concrete floor, illuminating a chaotic jumble of toolboxes, spare parts, and half-disassembled engines. Cassandra "Cassie" Jane Holloway, her grease-stained hands clasped behind her back, surveyed the latest victim of Dustbowl's unforgiving roads: a 1978 Ford Bronco, its once-proud turquoise paint now faded and peeling, its front bumper crumpled like a discarded beer can.  A trail of rusty brown fluid snaked from its undercarriage, leaving a tell-tale mark of its internal injuries. Cassie sighed, the sound swallowed by the whirring of the ancient ceiling fan overhead.  This was going to be a long one.
