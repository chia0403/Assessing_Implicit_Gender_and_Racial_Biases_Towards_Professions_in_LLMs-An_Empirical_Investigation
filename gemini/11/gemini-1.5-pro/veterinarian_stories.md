The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's dark hair across his face as he trudged across the frozen farmyard.  The sky above the remote Welsh valley was a bruised purple, promising snow.  Each footfall crunched on the thin layer of ice coating the mud, a sound swallowed by the vast, echoing silence of the surrounding mountains.
