The tar hissed and bubbled, a miniature black lake reflecting the distorted image of Elias Vance.  He knelt, the gritty shingles biting into his knee through his worn jeans, the July sun beating down on his back with a malicious glee.  From his vantage point atop the three-story Victorian, Elias could see the whole of Harmony Bay spread out beneath him â€“ a postcard-perfect New England town, all weathered clapboard houses and sprawling hydrangea bushes. The salty air, thick with the scent of low tide and frying clams, did little to cut through the oppressive heat radiating from the roof. Harmony Bay might look picturesque, but up here, on the scorching black shingles, it felt like the surface of the sun.  Elias wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his tar-stained hand and sighed.  This was the third roof he'd tackled this week, and it was only Wednesday.
