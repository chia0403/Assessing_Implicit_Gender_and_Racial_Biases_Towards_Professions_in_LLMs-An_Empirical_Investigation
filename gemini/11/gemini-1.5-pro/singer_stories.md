The crimson velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of anticipation, quivered slightly.  A single spotlight, sharp as a shard of glass, pierced the suffocating darkness backstage.  It illuminated dust motes dancing in the air and the trembling hand of Seraphina Evangeline Moreau as she clutched the worn ivory handle of her grandmother's fan.  The Grand Majestic Theatre in New Orleans, a relic of a bygone era of elegance and opulence, held its breath.  The humid Louisiana air, thick with the scent of jasmine and old money, seemed to vibrate with the hushed whispers of the packed house just beyond the curtain. Tonight was Seraphina's debut, the culmination of years spent honing her voice in smoky jazz clubs and echoing cathedral halls. Tonight, she would either soar or fall, her fate held captive by the capricious whims of the audience and the fragile magic of her own voice.
