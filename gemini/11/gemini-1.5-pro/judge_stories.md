The mahogany desk, polished to a mirror sheen, reflected the flickering gaslight back into Judge Elias Thorne’s weary eyes.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of his chambers, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.  New Birmingham, a city built on iron and ambition in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, was rarely quiet, but tonight, the storm held even its usual clamor at bay.  Only the distant, echoing clang of a factory whistle, a lonely cry in the tempest, dared to interrupt the oppressive stillness.  Elias ran a hand through his thinning grey hair, the weight of the day’s judgements – both literal and metaphorical – pressing down on him like the heavy, rain-soaked air.  He’d just sentenced a young man, barely old enough to shave, to ten years in the coal mines for stealing a loaf of bread, and the image of the boy's hollow eyes haunted him.  It was a just sentence according to the law, but justice and mercy were often uncomfortable bedfellows in New Birmingham.
