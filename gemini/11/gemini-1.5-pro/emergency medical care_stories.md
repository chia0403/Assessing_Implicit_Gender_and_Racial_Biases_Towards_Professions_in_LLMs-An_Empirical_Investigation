The siren wailed, a high-pitched keen slicing through the thick, humid New Orleans air.  Inside the speeding ambulance, Amelia “Amy” LaRue, Emergency Medical Technician, braced herself against the dashboard as they swerved around a pothole the size of a small dog.  Rain hammered against the windshield, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon. The French Quarter, normally vibrant with music and laughter, was subdued, the streets glistening under a sheen of water and reflected neon signs.  Amy tightened her grip on the strap of her jump bag, the rhythmic thump of her own heart echoing the frantic rhythm of the dispatch call:  unresponsive male, possible overdose, location: Pirate’s Alley.  She glanced at her partner, Marcus “Mac” Thibodeaux, his face grim as he navigated the treacherous streets.  This wasn’t going to be a good one. The air in the ambulance crackled with anticipation, heavy with the weight of the unknown.
