Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Wainwright Building, turning the Chicago cityscape into a shimmering blur of grey and ochre.  Inside, the Art Deco lobby, usually buzzing with the hushed energy of lawyers and financiers, felt strangely subdued.  Agnes Periwinkle Butterfield, secretary to Mr. Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling, the notoriously demanding senior partner of Sterling, Sterling & Stern, perched on the edge of her plush velvet chair, the rhythmic tapping of her manicured nails on her mahogany desk the only sound breaking the quiet.  The oversized clock above the reception desk ticked towards 6:00 PM, but Agnes showed no sign of packing up. Her perfectly coiffed auburn hair gleamed under the lobby's ornate chandeliers, a stark contrast to the stormy world outside.  A half-eaten tuna salad sandwich lay forlornly on a china plate beside her typewriter, a testament to a workday that had devoured any semblance of a proper lunch break.  Tonight, however, Agnes wasn't just working late. She was waiting.  And she had a feeling tonight would be anything but ordinary.
