The fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Leed Law Offices hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the frantic clicking of Amelia Reyes’ keyboard. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Chicago, blurring the glittering skyline into a hazy impressionist painting.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, barely registered the storm.  Deadlines loomed, and the senior partner, the notoriously demanding Mr. Kressler, expected the meticulously organized discovery documents for the Peterson vs. City of Chicago case on his desk by 8:00 am sharp.  It was already 7:15, and Amelia still had to cross-reference the final batch of witness testimonies. The Styrofoam cup of lukewarm coffee beside her keyboard offered little comfort.  The air in the office, usually stale with the scent of old paper and ambition, was thick with the metallic tang of impending panic.  A single red light blinked malevolently on her phone – a voicemail from Mr. Kressler, no doubt.  Amelia took a deep breath, pushed the thought of the message aside, and refocused on the blinking cursor on her screen.  Tonight, sleep was a luxury she couldn't afford.
