The neon glow of the Desert Rose Diner spilled across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, painting the dust devils a lurid pink.  The air, still shimmering with the day's brutal heat, hung heavy with the scent of diesel and frying onions.  Inside, Loretta Mae "Lettie" Higgins, her blonde hair pulled back in a tight bun, nursed a lukewarm coffee and stared out at her rig.  A Kenworth W900, gleaming emerald green even in the fading light, it was her pride and joy, her rolling fortress against the loneliness of the endless highways.  Tonight, though, even the familiar rumble of the idling engine couldn't drown out the gnawing unease in Lettie's gut.  She was three days into a haul from El Paso to Reno, halfway across the Nevada desert, and the quiet was starting to feel less like peace and more like a suffocating blanket. The last town she'd seen was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it collection of boarded-up buildings and a gas station with a single, flickering fluorescent light.  This stretch of Route 50, aptly nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America," was living up to its name.
