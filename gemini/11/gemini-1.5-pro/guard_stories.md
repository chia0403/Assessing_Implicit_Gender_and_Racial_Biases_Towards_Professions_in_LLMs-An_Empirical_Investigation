The rusted iron gate groaned like a dying beast as Elias Thorne, a man built like an oak and weathered like driftwood, heaved it open.  The hinges, thick as a man's wrist, protested with a shriek that echoed through the fog-choked alleyways of Duskhaven.  A biting wind, smelling of brine and decay, whipped through the narrow passage, tugging at Elias's thick wool cloak.  Duskhaven, a port city clinging precariously to the cliffs overlooking the turbulent Gray Sea, was perpetually shrouded in a damp, clinging mist. The fog obscured the ramshackle buildings that leaned against each other like drunken sailors, their windows dark and unwelcoming. Tonight, it was thicker than usual, swallowing the flickering gas lamps and muffling the usual cacophony of the docks.  Even the distant cries of gulls were swallowed by the oppressive silence.  Elias gripped the hilt of his sword, the cold steel a familiar comfort in the unsettling stillness. Something was wrong.
