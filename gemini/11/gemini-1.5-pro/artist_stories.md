The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rossi's auburn braid across her face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliff edge. Below, the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, sending plumes of white spray skyward.  Her easel, a battered wooden contraption held together by hope and duct tape, threatened to take flight, but Mia anchored it with one hand, her fingers stained a vibrant cerulean blue.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the whitewashed village of Oia, clinging to the caldera's rim like a flock of doves. This was Mia's haven, her obsession â€“ the impossible, ever-shifting light of the Greek islands, a canvas of color she could never truly capture, but strived endlessly to emulate.
