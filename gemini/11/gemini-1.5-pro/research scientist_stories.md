The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne’s parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  He adjusted his goggles, the swirling snow momentarily obscuring the desolate landscape.  The McMurdo Station, a cluster of brightly colored buildings clinging to the edge of Ross Island, was a distant beacon of warmth and humanity, a pinprick of civilization in a vast expanse of white.  Aris, however, was far from the relative comfort of the station.  He stood precariously on the lip of a newly discovered crevasse, its deep blue depths hinting at the ancient secrets hidden beneath the ice.  His breath plumed out in frosty bursts as he meticulously lowered a sensor probe on a winch, the whirring of the small motor a lonely sound against the backdrop of the howling wind. This crevasse, designated X-47 by the research team, was unlike any Aris had encountered in his fifteen years studying glacial formations.  The preliminary readings had hinted at an anomaly, a thermal signature emanating from deep within the ice that defied all known scientific explanations. It was this enigma that had drawn Aris out into the frozen wilderness, driven by a burning curiosity that even the Antarctic’s brutal chill couldn’t extinguish.
