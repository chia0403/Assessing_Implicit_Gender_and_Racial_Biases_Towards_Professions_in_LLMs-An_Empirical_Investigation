The biting November wind whipped across the parched fields of Thistlebrook Farm, whistling a mournful tune through the skeletal remains of corn stalks.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling around Elias Thatcher's worn leather boots.  He stood at the edge of his property, his calloused hands shoved deep into the pockets of his threadbare overalls, his gaze fixed on the horizon where the bruised purple sky met the ochre line of the withered hills.  Thistlebrook, nestled in the heart of the Oklahoma panhandle, had once been a vibrant tapestry of green and gold. Now, after three merciless years of drought, it was a landscape of muted browns and grays, mirroring the growing despair in Elias's heart.  The only splash of color came from the rusty red of his dilapidated barn, a testament to better days, and the stubborn patch of sunflowers by the porch of his farmhouse, clinging to life with a tenacity that Elias himself was struggling to maintain.
