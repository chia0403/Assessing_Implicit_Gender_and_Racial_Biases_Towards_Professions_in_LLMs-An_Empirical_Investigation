The insistent dripping from the ancient, wall-mounted air conditioner unit mirrored the slow, gnawing anxiety in Dr. Elias Thorne's stomach.  It was a humid Thursday evening in July, the kind that clung to the brick buildings of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia like Spanish moss. Elias’s office, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling gelato parlor, was usually a haven of calm, filled with the soothing scent of lavender and the gentle hum of a white noise machine. Tonight, however, the air was thick with something else – a palpable tension that even the tinkling wind chimes hanging by the entrance couldn't dispel. Elias, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, stared out the window at the deserted cobblestone street, a half-eaten turkey and swiss sandwich abandoned on his desk.  He had a feeling tonight was going to be anything but ordinary.
