The clatter of pots and pans was a symphony to Elias Thorne. Not the crashing cymbal and blaring trumpet kind, but a more subtle melody of clinking chimes and whispering woodwinds. The kitchen of the Wandering Wisp Inn, nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Silverwood Forest, was his stage, and the scent of simmering rosemary and roasted garlic his overture.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass depiction of a mischievous wisp chasing fireflies, splashed across the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the crisp autumn air nipped at the edges of the leaded panes, promising the first frost of the season.  Elias, a sturdy man with flour dusting his apron and a mischievous glint in his hazel eyes, hummed a tuneless ditty as he stirred a pot of hearty venison stew, the centerpiece of tonight's feast for the Inn's eclectic clientele.
