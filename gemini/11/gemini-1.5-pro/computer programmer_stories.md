Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the Seattle skyline into a hazy wash of grey and neon.  The twenty-seventh floor offered a spectacular view on clear days, a perk Elias rarely appreciated.  Tonight, the only illumination came from the flickering glow of his multiple monitors, reflecting in his tired eyes.  Empty takeout containers littered the surface of his expensive, custom-built standing desk, remnants of a marathon coding session fueled by lukewarm coffee and the desperate hope of meeting tomorrow's deadline.  Elias, fingers hovering over the keyboard, wore the uniform of the modern tech worker: a faded band t-shirt, stretched yoga pants, and a three-day-old growth of beard.  He hadn't left his apartment in 48 hours, a fact made evident by the rising tide of laundry threatening to spill out of the overflowing hamper in the corner. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt electronics and unfulfilled potential.  Tomorrow, "Project Chimera" was due, and a vital piece of code remained stubbornly elusive.
