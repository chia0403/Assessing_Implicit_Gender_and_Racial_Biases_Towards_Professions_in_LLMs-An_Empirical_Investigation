Tonight was the launch of her highly anticipated autumn menu, a culmination of months of planning and a testament to her passion for Flemish cuisine with a modern twist.  The soft glow emanating from the restaurant's mullioned windows promised warmth and the controlled chaos of a busy kitchen, a sanctuary Eleanor both cherished and commanded.
