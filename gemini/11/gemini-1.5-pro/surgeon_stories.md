The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne’s office window.  Rain, sleet, and something akin to frozen mist swirled outside, obscuring the usually breathtaking view of the Olympic Mountains. Inside, the room was warm, the air thick with the scent of old books and antiseptic.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, traced the jagged line of a fractured humerus on a backlit X-ray. The case was complex, involving a shattered bone and severed nerves.  He’d scheduled the surgery for the following morning at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, a towering monolith of steel and glass that seemed to defy the very weather battering its windows. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a stark contrast to the howling wind outside, and Elias felt the familiar pre-operative tension knotting in his stomach.  This wasn't just another surgery; this was a chance to reclaim a life, to mend what seemed irreparable.  And for Elias, failure wasn't an option.
