The cleaver, heavy in Elias Thorne's hand, glinted under the single bare bulb dangling from the low ceiling.  Frost rimed the edges of the block, clinging stubbornly even in the stifling heat radiating from the back room of Thorne's Quality Meats.  Outside, the asphalt shimmered in the relentless July sun baking the small town of Harmony Creek, Georgia.  The cicadas buzzed their incessant song, a droning counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of Elias's cleaver against bone.  Harmony Creek might be named for tranquility, but inside Thorne's, nestled between a wilting florist and a perpetually dusty antique shop, there was a different kind of harmony â€“ the balance between sharp steel, yielding flesh, and the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.  Today, however, the harmony was off-key.  A fly, fat and sluggish with the heat, buzzed incessantly around Elias's head, and a strange, coppery tang hung in the air, something other than the usual iron scent of the shop.
