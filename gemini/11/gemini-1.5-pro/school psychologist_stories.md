Gargoyles perched on the parapets, their granite faces seemingly sneering at the swirling leaves below.  Amelia tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and adjusted the satchel slung across her shoulder.  Inside, nestled amongst observation notes and assessment forms, was a half-eaten granola bar, a testament to the rushed breakfast she'd grabbed between mediating a sibling squabble at home and braving the icy roads.  This was Amelia's third year as the school psychologist at Ashworth, a prestigious boarding school nestled deep in the Vermont woods, a place where old money whispered secrets behind ivy-covered walls and the rustling leaves seemed to carry the echoes of generations past.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of academic rigor was replaced by a palpable tension, a static in the air that Amelia couldn't quite place. It prickled her skin and made the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.  Something was wrong at Ashworth, and she knew, with a chilling certainty, that it was more than just typical adolescent angst.
