The aroma of burnt sugar and almonds hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume that clung to Elara Thistlewick's apron and the cobblestones of Whispering Lane.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges above the crooked, half-timbered houses of Oakhaven, a village nestled deep within the Whispering Woods. Elara, her freckled nose dusted with flour, stood in the doorway of Thistlewick's Treats, her bakery, a beacon of warmth and light in the pre-dawn chill.  A single flickering lantern illuminated the sign above the door, a whimsical carving of a squirrel holding a miniature loaf of bread. Inside, the ovens, still radiating heat from the night's baking, hummed a low, comforting song.  But Elara's brow was furrowed, a worry line etched between her eyebrows. This morning, the usual symphony of birdsong that greeted the sunrise was strangely absent.  Only the rustling of leaves in the whispering woods and the distant, rhythmic thudding of something unseen broke the silence.
