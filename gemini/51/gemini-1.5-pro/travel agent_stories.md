Rain lashed against the window of "Flights of Fancy," blurring the neon pink flamingo perched precariously on the sill. Inside, Amelia Iris Thorne, her name as vibrant and exotic as the destinations she peddled, sighed, the warm, spiced scent of her chai latte doing little to dispel the November gloom clinging to the small travel agency.  Tucked between a dry cleaner and a perpetually empty storefront advertising "Psychic Readings," Flights of Fancy wasn't exactly bustling, even for a Tuesday afternoon. The only sound besides the relentless drumming of rain was the rhythmic click of Amelia's keyboard as she scrolled through yet another list of all-inclusive resorts in the Maldives, each more impossibly turquoise and pristine than the last.  She longed to trade the damp chill of coastal Maine for the sun-drenched beaches she so expertly curated for her clients, but the reality was far less glamorous.  Rent was due, bookings were slow, and the flamingo's paint was starting to chip.  Amelia took a sip of her latte, the cinnamon catching in her throat as the bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer and, perhaps, a flicker of hope in the grey afternoon.
