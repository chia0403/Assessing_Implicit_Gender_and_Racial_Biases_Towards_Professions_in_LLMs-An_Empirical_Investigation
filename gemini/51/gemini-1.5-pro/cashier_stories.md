The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Elara Josephine Reyes had grown accustomed to over her three years of employment.  Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied spirals against the grimy glass doors.  Inside, the air hung thick with the commingled scents of stale coffee, hot dogs rotating endlessly on the metal rollers, and the faint, ever-present tang of desperation.  Quick Stop wasn't much, perched on the edge of Highway 17 just outside the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, but it was Elara's little corner of the world.  And tonight, with the rain drumming a restless rhythm against the roof and the highway stretching out before her like a dark, glistening ribbon, she had a feeling her little corner was about to get a whole lot more interesting.
