The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Inside "Sculpt & Sweat," the air conditioning fought a losing battle against the humid air and the radiating heat from twenty bodies engaged in a high-intensity interval training session.

Clad in a neon-pink sports bra and black leggings, her dark curls pulled back in a high ponytail, she moved with an effortless grace that belied the punishing routine she was putting her clients through.  Sweat glistened on her sculpted arms as she demonstrated a particularly brutal burpee variation, her voice a mix of encouragement and playful challenge. "Come on, team!  Dig deep!  Feel the burn!  Think of those mojitos you'll be enjoying later!"  A collective groan, followed by a renewed burst of effort, rippled through the room.  Alana smiled.  This was her kingdom, her sanctuary, her happy place.  Little did she know, this sanctuary was about to be invaded.
