The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones was a constant rhythm outside Elias Thorne's small tailoring shop.  He hummed along to it, a low, almost mournful tune, as he meticulously stitched the sleeve of a gentleman's coat. The shop, nestled on a narrow, gaslit street in the perpetually shadowed Clockwork Alley of New Birmingham, was crammed with the tools and trappings of his trade: bolts of vibrant silks and sturdy wools stacked high, half-finished garments draped over dress forms, and the glint of needles and thimbles scattered across his worn workbench.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windowpane, illuminating the intricate clockwork mechanisms that whirred and ticked within the walls â€“ a strange feature of every building in the Alley, their purpose a mystery to most.  Outside, the perpetual smog of the industrial city clung to everything, a gritty reminder that even the finest tailoring could not fully escape the grime of New Birmingham. Elias, with his neatly trimmed brown beard and perpetually ink-stained fingers, seemed almost out of place amidst the chaos, a quiet island of order in a sea of gears and steam.
