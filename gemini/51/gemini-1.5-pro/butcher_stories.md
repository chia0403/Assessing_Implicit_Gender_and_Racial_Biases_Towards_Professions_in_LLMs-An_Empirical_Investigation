The biting wind whipped around Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Harding's thick apron, smelling of sawdust, salt, and something indefinably metallic. It was a smell Fitz had grown accustomed to, a smell he associated with the honest labor of his trade.  The sky above the small town of Oakhaven, nestled in the shadow of the Greystone Mountains, was the colour of a bruised plum, promising snow before nightfall.  Fitz, his breath clouding the frosty air, surveyed his shop, "Harding's Fine Meats."  The warm, yellow light spilling from the windows cast long shadows onto the snow-dusted street, illuminating the hanging carcasses of expertly butchered pigs and the neat rows of sausages displayed in the window.  It was a Tuesday, typically a slow day, but Fitz had a feeling in his bones, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with the dropping temperature.
