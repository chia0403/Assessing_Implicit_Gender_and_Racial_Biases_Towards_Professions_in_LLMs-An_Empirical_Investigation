Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the frantic tapping of his fingers on the worn mahogany desk.  His study, tucked away in a turret of the sprawling, gothic monstrosity that was Castlemere University, overlooked the manicured lawns and skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that dotted the campus.

Alistair, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose as he hunched over a faded parchment, was oblivious to the tempest raging outside. His entire focus was consumed by the cryptic symbols inked onto the brittle document, a puzzle that had plagued him for months.
