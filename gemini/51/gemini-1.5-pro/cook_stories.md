The clatter of pots and pans was Eleanor Ainsworth's morning symphony.  Her small kitchen, tucked away in the back corner of the Wandering Star, a ramshackle freighter plying the spice routes between the ochre deserts of Xylos and the ice-choked harbors of Nordhavn, was a cacophony of fragrant chaos. Cinnamon and cardamom danced in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of ginger and the earthy aroma of roasting yams.  Outside, the rhythmic chug of the engine and the mournful cry of gulls heralded the dawn breaking over the turquoise expanse of the Cerulean Sea. Eleanor, freckled face flushed from the heat of the stove, hummed along to the ship's rhythm, a melody as familiar to her as her own heartbeat.  She flipped a vegetable pancake with a practiced flick of her wrist, a splash of oil sizzling on the hotplate. This was her domain, a haven of warmth and nourishment amidst the cold steel and unpredictable currents of her nomadic life.
