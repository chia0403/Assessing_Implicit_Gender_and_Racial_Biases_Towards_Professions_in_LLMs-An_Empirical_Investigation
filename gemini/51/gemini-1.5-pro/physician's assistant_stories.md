The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, PA-C, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck and sighed, watching the swirling leaves dance like frantic ghosts against the darkening sky. The quaint, brick building, nestled in the heart of Alder’s Bend, Vermont, usually exuded a comforting, small-town charm.  Tonight, however, the encroaching darkness and the unsettling quiet felt ominous. Dr. Vance, Amelia's mentor and the town's only physician, was two days overdue from a medical conference in Boston, and Amelia, left in charge of the practice, felt the weight of the entire valley’s well-being resting squarely on her shoulders.  The waiting room was empty save for a flickering fluorescent light buzzing like an angry insect and a copy of "Vermont Life" magazine from June 2017, its pages curled and worn.  A shiver snaked down Amelia's spine – a premonition, perhaps, of the long and unsettling night ahead.
