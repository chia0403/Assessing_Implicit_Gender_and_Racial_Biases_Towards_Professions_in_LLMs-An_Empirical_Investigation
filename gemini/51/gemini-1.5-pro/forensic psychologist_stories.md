The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, plastering his dark hair against his forehead as he stared at the scene before him.  A dilapidated Victorian mansion, perched precariously on the bluff overlooking the churning grey waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, seemed to exhale a palpable sense of unease.  Rain lashed against the weathered clapboard, mimicking the frantic drumming of Elias's own heart.  The yellow police tape, fluttering in the gale like a macabre party streamer, cordoned off the overgrown front yard, where a lone forensics tent stood sentinel.  This was the third such incident in the secluded coastal town of Port Blossom in as many months, each victim found in their own home, each death marked by an unnerving theatrical flourish.  And each time, Sheriff Davies had called Elias, whispering his fears into the phone, begging for the doctor’s unique brand of insight.  This case, however, felt different.  This time, the chill that ran down Elias’s spine wasn’t just from the wind.
