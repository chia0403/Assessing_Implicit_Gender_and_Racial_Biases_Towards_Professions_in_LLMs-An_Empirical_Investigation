The fluorescent lights of Mr. Silas Finch's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the frantic scribbling of his Advanced Placement English students.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of St. Jude's Preparatory Academy, blurring the view of the manicured lawns and turning the gothic stone buildings into shadowy behemoths.  October in the Hudson Valley was a capricious mistress, capable of delivering summery warmth one moment and biting, wintry blasts the next.  This particular afternoon, she had opted for the latter, and a damp chill permeated even the hallowed halls of St. Jude's. Silas, a man more accustomed to tweed jackets and elbow patches than Gore-Tex, pulled his cardigan tighter around him and surveyed the room, his gaze lingering on a particular student hunched in the back corner, seemingly oblivious to the literary tempest brewing around him.  The air crackled with the unspoken tension of impending deadlines, college applications, and the ever-present weight of expectation that clung to the students like the clinging ivy on the chapel walls.
