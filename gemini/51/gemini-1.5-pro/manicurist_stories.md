The bell above the door to "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a halal cart on Bleecker Street, jingled merrily, announcing Mrs. Periwinkle's arrival. Eliza Jane O'Malley, the salon's sole proprietor and manicurist extraordinaire, sighed inwardly.  Mrs. Periwinkle was notorious for her exacting standards (the left pinky nail always half a millimeter shorter than the right) and her penchant for gossip, both of which made a simple manicure feel like running a marathon in quicksand.  The November air, biting and sharp even inside the cozy salon, carried the scent of acetone and Mrs. Periwinkle's overpowering lilac perfume. Eliza Jane plastered a smile on her face and gestured towards the plush pedicure chair, its faux-leather already cracked and worn from years of pampering demanding feet.  Outside, the city thrummed with the usual cacophony of honking taxis and distant sirens, a soundtrack that blended seamlessly with the whirring of Eliza Jane's electric nail file. This was a Tuesday, much like any other Tuesday, in the heart of Greenwich Village.  But Eliza Jane had a feeling, a prickling at the back of her neck, that this particular Tuesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
