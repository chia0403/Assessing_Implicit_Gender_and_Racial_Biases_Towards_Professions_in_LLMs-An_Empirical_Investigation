The biting wind whipped off the East River, carrying the scent of stale beer and something vaguely metallic that Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz had learned to associate with the underbelly of New York City.

It was 3:17 am, the kind of hour that swallowed sound and amplified the city's lonely hum.  Izzy, her breath misting in the frigid air, pulled her collar tighter and surveyed the alleyway, a narrow chasm between buildings overflowing with overflowing dumpsters and the discarded detritus of city life.  This was her crime scene.
