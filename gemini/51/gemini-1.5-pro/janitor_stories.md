The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research facility hummed a monotonous B flat, the only sound besides the rhythmic squeak of Elias Thorne’s mop bucket wheels. It was 3:17 am, the pre-dawn hush settling over the sprawling complex nestled in the redwood forests north of Santa Cruz.  Fog, thick as cotton wool, clung to the gigantic windows, obscuring the usually breathtaking view of the Pacific. Elias, in his faded blue Zenith uniform, two sizes too large, pushed his mop across the polished concrete floor of Lab 42, the faint chemical tang of antiseptic battling the pine-scented air wafting in through the barely cracked window.  Lab 42 was special. It was where the *really* weird stuff happened, the kind of research even a lowly janitor like him wasn’t supposed to know about. But Elias saw things. Heard things. Things best left unmentioned, locked away in the quiet corners of his mind, next to the half-eaten ham sandwich he’d salvaged from the break room bin. Tonight, however, something felt different.  The air was charged, buzzing with an almost palpable energy, and a faint, rhythmic pulsing emanated from behind the locked door of the climate-controlled storage room. A pulse that echoed strangely in Elias’s own chest.
