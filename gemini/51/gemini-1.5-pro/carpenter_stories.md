The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, snatching at the sawdust clinging to Elias Finch's thick wool coat.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the worn leather strap of his toolbox as he surveyed the half-finished frame of the Widow Hawthorne's new porch.  Perched precariously on a ladder against the peeling clapboard of the old Victorian house, he could see the steely grey expanse of Lake Superior churning restlessly beyond the rooftops of Port Blossom, Michigan.  The approaching winter promised to be a harsh one, and Elias hoped to have the porch completed before the first heavy snowfall. The rhythmic clang of a hammer echoed from a nearby street, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of a gull circling overhead.  Port Blossom, a town built on timber and fishing, was slowly settling into its winter slumber, and a sense of quiet anticipation hung in the air, as palpable as the wood smoke curling from chimneys.
