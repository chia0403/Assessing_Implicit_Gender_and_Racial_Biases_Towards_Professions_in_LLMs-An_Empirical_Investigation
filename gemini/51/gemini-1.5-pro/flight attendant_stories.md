The cabin air, recycled and sterile, hummed around Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau as she secured the galley for landing. Outside, the lights of Hong Kong shimmered through the pre-dawn haze, a jeweled tapestry draped over the dark velvet of Victoria Harbour.  Cassie, her French-braided auburn hair impeccably secured beneath her navy blue cap, smoothed nonexistent wrinkles from her crisp uniform.  Flight CX881 from Paris had been a relatively uneventful one, aside from a minor turbulence spell over the Himalayas and the usual chorus of snoring passengers.  But something about the thick, humid air pressing against the aircraft as they descended into Hong Kong felt different, charged. It wasn't just the humidity; it was a prickly feeling on her skin, a low thrum of anticipation that settled deep in her bones.  As the wheels kissed the tarmac with a gentle bump, Cassie felt a flutter of unease, a sense that this particular layover in Hong Kong was going to be anything but ordinary.
