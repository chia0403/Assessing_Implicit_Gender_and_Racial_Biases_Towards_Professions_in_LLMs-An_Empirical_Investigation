The sugary scent of buttercream hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to Beatrice "Bea" Flournoy.  Bea's Cake Boutique, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on Lavender Lane, was a kaleidoscope of pastel frosting, edible glitter, and the soft hum of a vintage KitchenAid mixer.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the shop's checkered floor, illuminating shelves crammed with piping bags, fondant molds shaped like whimsical animals, and towers of cake boxes in every conceivable size. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, Pennsylvania was preparing for its annual Founder's Day Festival, and Bea, despite the mountain of custom cake orders piled high on her counter, felt a familiar flutter of excitement. This year, she was determined to win the coveted Golden Whisk award for the most creative cake design.
