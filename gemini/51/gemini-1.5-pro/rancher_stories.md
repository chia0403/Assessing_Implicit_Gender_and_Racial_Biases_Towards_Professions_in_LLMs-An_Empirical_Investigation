The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped at Amelia Grace Hollowayâ€™s thick brown braid as she surveyed the rolling hills of the Broken Spur Ranch.  The sky, a bruised purple, pressed down on the Montana landscape, the first flakes already dusting the tawny grasses.  November in the Bitterroot Valley was a fickle beast, capable of sunshine one moment and blizzard conditions the next. Amelia, bundled in a worn sheepskin coat and sturdy boots, knew this better than anyone.  The Broken Spur, nestled deep in the valley, had been in her family for five generations, a legacy carved out of hard work and a stubborn refusal to yield to the harsh whims of nature.  This year, however, the whims felt particularly pointed, like the valley itself was testing her resolve.  The cattle were restless, the hay stores lower than usual, and a gnawing unease settled in Amelia's gut, a feeling deeper than the coming winter.
