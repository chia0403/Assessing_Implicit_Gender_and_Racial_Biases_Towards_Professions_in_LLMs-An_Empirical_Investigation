The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the "Open" sign that hung precariously from the door of Aligned Spine & Wellness.  Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., cradled a mug of lukewarm chamomile tea, his breath fogging the window.  The November dusk had settled early over the sleepy town of Havenwood, Illinois, casting long shadows across Main Street. Havenwood, a town known more for its antique shops and annual pie-baking contest than its need for spinal adjustments, wasn't exactly a chiropractic goldmine.  But Elias had inherited the practice, and the quaint two-story building that housed it, from his grandfather, and leaving had never really been an option.  He was a creature of habit, much like the town itself, and the predictable rhythm of Havenwood suited him just fine.  Until tonight.
