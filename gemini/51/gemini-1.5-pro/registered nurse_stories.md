The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Grace Holloway's cheeks as she hurried across the deserted parking lot toward Mercy General.  The pre-dawn sky, a bruised purple streaked with icy pink, reflected in the slick blacktop.  Chicago in January was a cruel mistress, but Amelia had seen worse. She’d seen the inside of operating rooms during mass casualty events, held the hands of dying patients, and delivered babies in the back of ambulances. A little wind and cold wouldn't break her.  Tonight, however, a different kind of chill ran down her spine.  It wasn't the weather; it was the unnerving silence of the usually bustling hospital.  The emergency room entrance, typically a chaotic symphony of sirens and hurried footsteps, was eerily still.  Even the automatic doors seemed to hesitate before whooshing open, admitting Amelia into the unsettling quiet of Mercy General’s sterile, fluorescent-lit interior.
