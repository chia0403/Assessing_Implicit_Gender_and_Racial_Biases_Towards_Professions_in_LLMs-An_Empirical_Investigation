The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne’s parka, stinging his exposed cheeks a fiery red.  He adjusted his goggles, the frosted lenses obscuring the already limited visibility.  The McMurdo Station, a vibrant hub of activity just hours ago, was now a faint orange glow swallowed by the swirling grey blizzard.  Aris, however, was not headed back to the relative warmth and safety of the station.  He trudged onwards, the crunch of his boots on the packed snow the only sound besides the relentless wind.  His destination: Observation Post Zeta, a lonely, prefabricated structure perched precariously on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, five kilometers out in the desolate white expanse.  Inside Zeta, encased within a specially designed, temperature-controlled vault, rested the object of his two-year research project: a perfectly preserved, extraterrestrial artifact unearthed just months prior, its origins and purpose still a captivating mystery.  Tonight, Aris was conducting a solo experiment, one he hadn’t dared share with his colleagues, an experiment driven by a gut feeling, a hunch that could rewrite human understanding of the cosmos, or end his career in ignominious failure.
