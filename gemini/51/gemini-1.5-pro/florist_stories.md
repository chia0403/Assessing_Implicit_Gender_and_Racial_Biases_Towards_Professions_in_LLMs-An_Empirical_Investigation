The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, Vermont, shimmered under a fresh coat of November snow.  Inside, the air hung thick and fragrant, a heady mix of pine needles, cinnamon sticks, and the earthy scent of damp soil. Eliza, her cheeks flushed from the cold, hunched over a workbench overflowing with eucalyptus branches and velvety crimson roses, meticulously crafting a centerpiece destined for the Mayor's annual Thanksgiving gala.  The shop, a riot of color even in the bleak mid-autumn, was her sanctuary, a place where thorny problems could be pruned away and beauty cultivated, one delicate bloom at a time. But little did Eliza know, a thorny problem unlike any she'd faced before was about to walk through her door, carried on a gust of icy wind and the scent of something far more sinister than winter roses.
