Dust devils danced across the flat gravel roof of the Peterson Mini Mart, swirling grit into Elias Finchâ€™s already sweat-streaked face.

A lone buzzard circled high above, its shadow a fleeting darkness against the blinding blue.  Elias wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, the gesture revealing a faded tattoo of a swallow on his forearm.  He had a long way to go before he could call it a day, and the heat was only intensifying. This was just another scorching Tuesday in the life of a roofer, but Elias had a feeling this one was going to be different.
