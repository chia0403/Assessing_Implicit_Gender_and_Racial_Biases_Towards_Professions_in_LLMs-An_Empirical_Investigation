The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled the heavy oak door of Hemlock House closed.  Dead leaves, the color of rust and bruised plums, swirled around her ankles like resentful spirits. Hemlock House, perched atop Widow's Hill overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a grand, albeit decaying, Victorian mansion.  Its gables and turrets were cloaked in creeping ivy, and the once-vibrant stained glass windows were now mostly obscured by grime and salt spray.  Eleanor, her hands raw and chapped despite the thick wool gloves, pulled her worn cardigan tighter around her. This was her domain, six days a week, from sunrise to sunset.  She dusted the endless mahogany furniture, scrubbed the vast, echoing kitchen, and polished the silver that hadn't seen a proper dinner party in decades.  The only other resident was the house's owner, the reclusive Mr. Silas Blackwood, a man Eleanor rarely saw and even more rarely spoke to.  Today, however, was different. A telegram had arrived that morning, crisp and urgent, announcing the imminent arrival of Mr. Blackwood's nephew, a man Eleanor had never met but whose presence she already felt like a creeping shadow in the drafty halls.
