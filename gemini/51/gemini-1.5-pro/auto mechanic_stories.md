The rusty tang of brake fluid hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of honeysuckle drifting in from the overgrown verge beyond the garage.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised orange orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains, cast long, distorted shadows across the concrete floor of Montoya's Motors.  Inside, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights and the occasional shower of sparks from a welding torch,  Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez, knuckles raw and hair streaked with grease, wrestled with the stubborn lug nuts of a '67 Mustang. The radio, perched precariously on a stack of worn tires, blared a classic rock anthem, competing with the rhythmic clang of Izzy's wrench against metal.  Montoya's Motors, a small, independent garage nestled in the heart of the sun-baked California town of Agua Dulce, was Izzy's sanctuary, her inheritance, and her constant headache.
