Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic thump of Amelia Thorne's heart.  Loose papers, covered in her spidery scrawl, danced across the dusty floorboards as the wind, sneaking through gaps in the warped wood, whipped around the cramped space.  Amelia, hunched over a battered oak desk beneath a single bare bulb, chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Around her, stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously, forming a papery fortress against the encroaching gloom.  This converted attic, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Brooklyn brownstone, served as both her home and the headquarters of Thorne Editorial, a small but fiercely independent editing business.  The air smelled of old paper, printer ink, and the faintest hint of burnt coffee – a testament to Amelia’s late-night editing binges. Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos felt oppressive, the silence between gusts of wind pregnant with a nervous energy Amelia couldn't quite place.  The manuscript in front of her, a gothic thriller titled "The Raven's Lament," lay open, but her eyes weren’t focused on the words. Instead, they darted towards the flickering shadows that danced in the corners of the room, as if expecting something – or someone – to emerge from the darkness.
