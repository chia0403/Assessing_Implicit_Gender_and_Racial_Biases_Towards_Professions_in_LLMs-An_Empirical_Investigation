The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" cast a lavender glow onto the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, amidst the hum of hair dryers and the snip of scissors, Amelia Rose Hawthorne surveyed her domain.  The salon, a vibrant splash of turquoise and sunshine yellow, was her sanctuary, a place where split ends were banished and worries were momentarily forgotten.  Tonight, however, a different kind of tension hung in the air, thicker than hairspray. The relentless Oregon rain seemed to mirror the anxiety churning in Ameliaâ€™s stomach.  It wasn't just the usual Tuesday night lull; something felt off, like the calm before a storm, and Amelia, with her uncanny intuition and a sixth sense for bad dye jobs, knew it was about to be more than just a wash and blow-dry kind of night.
