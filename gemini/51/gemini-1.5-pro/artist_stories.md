The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her sketchbook balanced on her knees. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock formations of Santorini, a symphony of white foam and cerulean shadows.  The village of Oia, a cascade of whitewashed houses clinging to the caldera rim, shimmered in the afternoon sun, its blue-domed churches like sapphires scattered across a bridal veil. Elara, her auburn braid whipping in the wind, squinted, trying to capture the precise shade of lavender that kissed the distant islands as the sun began its descent.  Her fingers, stained with charcoal and paint, itched to translate the breathtaking scene onto the textured page, to somehow capture the raw, untamed beauty that stole her breath away each and every day.  But something was missing. A certain vibrancy, a pulse of life that lay just beyond her grasp.
