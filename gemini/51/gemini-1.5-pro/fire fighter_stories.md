The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she stood on the precipice of the old quarry, the fractured slate glittering like obsidian under a bruised, pre-dawn sky.

But this morning, the usual peace was shattered. A plume of thick, acrid smoke snaked its way upwards, staining the sky a sickly yellow and carrying with it the unmistakable scent of burning pine.  Mia gripped her helmet tighter, the reflected orange glow highlighting the grim determination etched on her face. This wasn't just a campfire gone rogue. This was something bigger, something far more dangerous.
