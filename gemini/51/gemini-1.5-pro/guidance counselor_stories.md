The fluorescent lights of McKinley High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance’s Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large window of her office, turning the football field beyond into a blurry green and brown smear.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, sipped lukewarm tea from a chipped mug that read "World's Okayest Guidance Counselor."  Her office was a carefully curated chaos: college pennants jostled for space with inspirational posters, while a precarious stack of student files threatened to topple onto a plush, worry-worn frog named Horatio. The air smelled faintly of lavender and old textbooks, a comforting scent that had become synonymous with hope and second chances within these walls.  This Tuesday, however, felt different. A heavy, expectant silence had settled over McKinley, a silence that prickled Eleanor’s skin and whispered of a storm brewing beyond the meteorological one.
