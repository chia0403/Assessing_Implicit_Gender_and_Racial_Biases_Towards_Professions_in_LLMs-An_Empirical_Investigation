The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Reyes's face as she wrestled the pre-flight checklist against the gale.  Ice crystals, fine as powdered sugar, dusted the wings of her de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, clinging to the rivets like stubborn barnacles.  The sun, a pale, watery disc barely crested the jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains, casting long, skeletal shadows across the frozen expanse of Lake George.  It was 5:17 am, twenty-three minutes before sunrise, and already Amy felt the familiar thrum of anticipation in her chest. Today's flight was a particularly challenging one: delivering essential medical supplies to a remote research outpost nestled deep in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, a land of glaciers, unforgiving terrain, and weather that could shift from tranquil to treacherous in a heartbeat.  The air crackled with the static of impending snow, and Amy, her breath clouding in the frigid air, knew this flight wouldnâ€™t be a walk in the park.
