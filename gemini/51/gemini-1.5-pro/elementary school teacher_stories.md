The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom, announced the arrival of another crisp autumn morning in Maplewood.  Sunlight, filtered through the fiery hues of the changing leaves outside, painted dappled patterns across the worn wooden floorboards of Room 2B at Maplewood Elementary.  Crayon drawings, vibrant and slightly askew, adorned the walls, showcasing the artistic endeavors of her second-grade class.  A faint scent of apple juice and construction paper hung in the air, a familiar and comforting aroma that Eleanor had come to associate with the start of each school day.  This particular morning, however, a palpable sense of unease throbbed beneath the usual cheerful hum of anticipation. A note, folded neatly and placed squarely in the center of her desk, awaited her.  It wasn't addressed to her, but the single word scrawled across its front - "Help" - sent a shiver down Eleanor's spine.
