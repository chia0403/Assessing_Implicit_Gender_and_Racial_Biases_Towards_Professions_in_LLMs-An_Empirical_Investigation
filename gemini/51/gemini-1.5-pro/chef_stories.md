He tasted a spoonful of the bouillabaisse, his dark eyes narrowing in concentration. A flick of the wrist, a pinch of saffron, and a satisfied nod. Tonight’s special, a pan-seared halibut with truffle risotto, was also nearing perfection.  Le Poisson Magique, nestled in a quiet corner of Brooklyn Heights, was Elias’s sanctuary, his canvas, his life's work.  He’d poured his heart and soul, not to mention his inheritance, into transforming this once-drab storefront into the culinary gem it was now, a beacon of innovative seafood cuisine in a neighborhood dominated by Italian trattorias and burger joints.  But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the edge of his awareness, a discordant note in the otherwise harmonious rhythm of his kitchen.
