The biting wind whipped across the frost-kissed fields of Abernathy Farm, stinging Elias Thatcher's cheeks as he surveyed his winter wheat.  Dawn was just beginning to bleed colour into the vast, iron-grey sky above the rolling hills of Derbyshire, England.  November had arrived with a vengeance, clutching the land in its icy grip. Elias, his breath clouding the air before him, pulled his thick wool cap further down over his ears.  The farmhouse, a sturdy stone structure that had stood for generations, hunched against the wind like an old man bracing himself against a storm.  Smoke curled invitingly from its chimney, a promise of warmth and the strong, sweet coffee his wife, Martha, always had ready.  But Elias lingered, a knot of worry tightening in his stomach.  The wheat, usually a vibrant green even this late in the year, looked sickly, a dull yellowish-brown.  He knelt, brushing away the frost to reveal the brittle leaves beneath. Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
