The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Reyes's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson berries clinging to the bare branches of the holly bushes she was pruning.  The late November air in Hollow Creek, Oregon, carried the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues of the autumn leaves she was raking into neat piles.  Amy, bundled in a thick flannel shirt and worn leather gloves, surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye.  The sprawling Victorian manor known as Whisperwind House loomed behind her, its gingerbread trim frosted with a thin layer of early morning ice.  This was her latest project, a complete overhaul of the neglected gardens surrounding the mysterious house.  Hollow Creek was a town steeped in whispers and shadowed by the dense evergreen forests that hugged its borders. Whisperwind House, with its history of eccentric owners and rumored hauntings, was no exception.  Amy, ever the pragmatist, paid little mind to such tales, focusing instead on coaxing beauty from the slumbering earth.  But as the sun finally broke through the grey skies, casting an ethereal glow on the frost-covered grounds, she couldn't shake the feeling that something in Hollow Creek was different. Something was watching.
