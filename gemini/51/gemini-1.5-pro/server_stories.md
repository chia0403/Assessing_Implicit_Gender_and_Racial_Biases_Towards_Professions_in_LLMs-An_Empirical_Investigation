The stale air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the cracked vinyl booths of the Busy Bee Diner. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a hazy smear.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, sighed, wiping a damp rag across the sticky Formica countertop.  It was 11:57 pm on a Tuesday, the slowest night of the week, and the only other occupants of the diner were a snoring trucker slumped over a half-eaten plate of scrambled eggs and a couple arguing in hushed tones in the back booth.  Eleanor glanced at the clock, willing the minutes to tick by faster.  She had a double shift tomorrow, and the knot of anxiety in her stomach tightened with each passing second. This place, with its chipped mugs and perpetual smell of burnt coffee, was her life, and tonight, it felt smaller and more suffocating than ever before.
