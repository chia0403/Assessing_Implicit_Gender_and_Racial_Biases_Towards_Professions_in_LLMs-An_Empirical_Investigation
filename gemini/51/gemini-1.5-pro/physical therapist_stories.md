The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of the historic Thornewood Rehabilitation Center, clutching his worn leather satchel.  Ivy, crimson with autumn's touch, clung to the aged brick walls of the building, a stark contrast to the sterile white of the physiotherapy wing where Elias spent most of his days. Thornewood wasn't just any rehabilitation center; nestled in the heart of the remote coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, it was a sanctuary for patients recovering from debilitating injuries, both physical and emotional. The salty air, tinged with the scent of pine from the surrounding woods, was said to have healing properties, a belief Elias secretly subscribed to, despite his scientific training. Today, however, the wind felt less restorative and more like an icy premonition, a feeling that something in the usual quiet rhythm of Thornewood was about to be irrevocably disrupted.
