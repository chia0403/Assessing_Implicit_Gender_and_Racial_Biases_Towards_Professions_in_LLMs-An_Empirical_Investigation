Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon sign's reflection in the slick cobblestones outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and a faint whisper of desperation.  Eliza Jane Dubois, her dark hair pulled back in a severe knot, polished a glass with the practiced ease of someone who'd spent half her life behind a bar.  The Lily, nestled in a forgotten corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, wasn't much to look at, but it was Eliza's domain. She knew the creak of every floorboard, the rhythm of the dripping faucet, the secrets whispered in hushed tones in the shadowed booths.  Tonight, however, felt different. The usual Friday night buzz was absent, replaced by a heavy, expectant silence broken only by the rhythmic clang of the streetcar passing a block away.  Eliza felt a prickle of unease, a premonition that the storm brewing outside was just a prelude to something bigger, something darker, brewing within the walls of The Gilded Lily itself.
