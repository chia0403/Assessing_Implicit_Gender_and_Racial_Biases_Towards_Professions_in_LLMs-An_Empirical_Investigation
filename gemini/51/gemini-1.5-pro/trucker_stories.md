The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 379, baking the dashboard until it radiated a dull, oven-like heat.  Dust devils danced across the shimmering asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," and the air thrummed with the low growl of the engine.  Inside, Amelia “Milly” Jean Blackwood squinted against the glare, her calloused fingers drumming a restless rhythm on the worn leather of the steering wheel. The CB radio crackled with static punctuated by the occasional burst of chatter from other truckers, miles apart yet connected by the thin thread of shared highway solitude.  Milly was hauling a load of electronics from Reno to Kansas City, a long haul even for a seasoned trucker like her. This particular stretch of Nevada, with its miles of empty desert and the occasional skeletal remains of a long-forgotten town, always brought a peculiar sense of both freedom and unease.  She’d seen things out here – strange lights flickering on the horizon, unexplained shadows flitting across the road, enough to make even a hardened soul question what they thought they knew.  This trip, however, felt different.  A prickly feeling crawled at the back of her neck, a sense of being watched, and it had nothing to do with the occasional hawk circling high above.
