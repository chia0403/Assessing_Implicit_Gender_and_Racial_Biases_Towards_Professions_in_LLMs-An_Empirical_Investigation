The biting wind whipped off the Obsidian Cliffs, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks raw beneath his helmet.  He stamped his feet, the heavy steel of his boots echoing against the slick, black stone.  Far below, the churning grey waters of the Shadow Sea crashed against the cliff base, a constant, restless murmur that had become the soundtrack to Elias's solitary vigil.  He was stationed on the Raven's Perch, a precarious guard tower clinging to the cliff face like a petrified bird of prey, its single, narrow window offering a breathtaking, if terrifying, view of the vast, empty expanse of the sea.  For five years, Elias had been a watchman of the Obsidian Cliffs, guarding the westernmost border of the Kingdom of Aeridor againstâ€¦well, nothing. No enemy had ever been sighted in these desolate reaches, and Elias suspected there never would be.  His duty was a tradition, a relic of a forgotten war, a lonely, thankless task.  And tonight, the monotony felt heavier than usual.
