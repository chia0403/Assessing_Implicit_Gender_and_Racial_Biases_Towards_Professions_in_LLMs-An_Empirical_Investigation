The insistent London drizzle seemed determined to seep into Amelia Grace Hawthorne's bones, a chilling counterpoint to the vibrant hues blazing on her laptop screen.  Her small flat, tucked above a bustling bakery in Notting Hill, usually felt cozy and inspiring, a haven filled with the aroma of warm bread and the comforting hum of city life. But tonight, the rain hammered against the skylight, mirroring the frantic rhythm of Amelia's own heart.  Deadlines loomed, a particularly demanding client was proving impossible to please, and the glow of the screen cast long, distorted shadows across the room, turning her carefully curated collection of vintage movie posters into menacing figures.  A half-eaten pot of yogurt sat precariously on the edge of her drafting table, a testament to a forgotten dinner.  Outside, the neon signs of Portobello Road reflected in the wet pavement, a kaleidoscope of colour that mocked the stark white canvas on Amelia’s screen.  This was not how she’d envisioned her Friday night.
