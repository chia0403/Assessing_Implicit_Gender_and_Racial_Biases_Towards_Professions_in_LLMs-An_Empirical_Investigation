The biting wind whipped down from the Greyfang Mountains, stinging Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks and chapping his lips.  He ignored it, his calloused hands steady as he guided the chisel along the surface of the granite block.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, billowed around him, catching the pale light filtering through the canvas roof of his makeshift workshop.  The workshop itself, little more than a lean-to constructed against the cliff face overlooking the sprawling quarry of Whisperwind Valley, was cluttered with the tools of his trade: hammers, chisels of varying sizes, mallets, and a worn leather-bound book filled with sketches and calculations.  The valley, normally a hive of activity with other stone cutters, lay silent and deserted.  The annual Swallowtail Festival was only three days away, and everyone, it seemed, had abandoned their work to prepare for the festivities in the nearby town of Oakhaven.  Everyone but Elias. He had a deadline, a commission more important than any festival.
