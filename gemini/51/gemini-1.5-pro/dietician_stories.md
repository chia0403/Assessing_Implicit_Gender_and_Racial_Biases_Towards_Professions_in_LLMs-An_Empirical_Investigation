The fluorescent lights of the "Nourish & Thrive" clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayesâ€™ Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the view of the bustling Boston street below. Amelia, a registered dietician with a nametag perpetually askew on her crisp white coat, tapped a pen against her teeth, studying the nutritional breakdown of a new protein bar with a skeptical frown.  Her office, a small but meticulously organized space, was dominated by anatomical charts, motivational posters featuring vibrantly colored fruits and vegetables, and a bookshelf overflowing with texts on everything from gut health to mindful eating.  A half-eaten container of Greek yogurt with berries sat precariously perched on a stack of patient files, a testament to her perpetually busy schedule.  The air smelled faintly of lemon disinfectant and, oddly, cinnamon, a lingering scent from the batch of healthy oatmeal raisin cookies she'd baked for a client struggling with sugar cravings the previous day.  This was Amelia's domain, a sanctuary of nutritional wisdom where she battled misinformation and championed the power of balanced eating, one meal plan at a time.  Little did she know, a consultation later that morning would upend her carefully curated world and challenge everything she thought she knew about the delicate science of nutrition.
