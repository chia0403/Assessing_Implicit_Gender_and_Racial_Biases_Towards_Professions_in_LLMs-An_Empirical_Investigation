The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn hadn't fully broken over the Tanglewood Wildlife Sanctuary, painting the frosty Virginia landscape in shades of pre-dawn blue and grey. The sanctuary, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was a haven for rescued and rehabilitated animals, from majestic bald eagles to playful river otters.  Amy, the head primate caretaker, always arrived before sunrise, a ritual she found both peaceful and invigorating.  This morning, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. The chimpanzee enclosure was eerily silent.  Usually, by now, she'd be greeted by a chorus of hoots and screeches, a boisterous welcome from her beloved charges. Today, only the mournful coo of a distant mourning dove broke the stillness.
