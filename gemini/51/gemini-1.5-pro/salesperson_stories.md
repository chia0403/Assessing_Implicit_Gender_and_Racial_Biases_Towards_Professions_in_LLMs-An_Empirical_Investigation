Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Sleep-Tite Mattress Emporium," blurring the neon "SALE!" sign into a pulsating smear of pink. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of new foam and the faint tang of despair.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile could sell sand to a sheik, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against a laminated price tag.  The Emporium, nestled between a laundromat and a bail bonds office in the less-than-glamorous part of downtown Zenith, Missouri, wasn't exactly her dream posting.  But rent was rent, and Eleanor had a knack for making even the most reluctant customer believe they desperately needed an orthopedic pillow top.  This Tuesday, however, the only customer was a potted fern with a distinct air of melancholy, and Eleanor was starting to wonder if she'd have better luck selling comfort and support to the overflowing storm drain outside.
