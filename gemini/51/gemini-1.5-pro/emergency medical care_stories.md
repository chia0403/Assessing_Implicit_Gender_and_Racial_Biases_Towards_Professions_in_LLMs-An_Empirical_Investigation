The siren wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the ambulance windows. Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  The flashing blue and red lights painted the slick, black asphalt of Highway 1 in fragmented bursts, illuminating the rugged California coastline.  Jagged cliffs plunged down to the churning Pacific, shrouded in a thick, grey fog that seemed to swallow the world beyond a few feet.  Tonight, the beauty of Big Sur was a menacing backdrop to a desperate race against time. The dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio, relaying fragmented information about a climber stranded halfway down a notoriously treacherous section of the coast known as Devil's Slide.  Amy, a seasoned paramedic with the Monterey County EMS, knew every twist and turn of these roads, every hidden danger. But tonight, even she felt a chill crawl down her spine, a premonition that this call was unlike any she had faced before.
