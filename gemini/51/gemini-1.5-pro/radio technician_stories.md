The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, rattling the corrugated iron shack that doubled as Amelia "Amy" Reyes's workshop and home.  Inside, tubes glowed warmly in the dim light, casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workbench.  Soldering irons rested in their cradles, radiating a faint metallic tang into the air that mingled with the sharp scent of pine-scented cleaner Amy used on her vintage equipment. Outside, the setting sun painted the sky in streaks of vibrant orange and purple, a stark contrast to the grey, monotonous landscape that stretched out in every direction.  Her nearest neighbor, old man Hemlock, lived a good fifteen miles down a rutted dirt road.  Amelia, however, preferred the solitude. It allowed her to focus on her true passion: coaxing life back into broken radios, breathing music and voices into the silence of the desert.  Tonight, however, the silence was different.  It was an oppressive, expectant silence, the kind that precedes a storm. Not a meteorological one, but somethingâ€¦ else.
