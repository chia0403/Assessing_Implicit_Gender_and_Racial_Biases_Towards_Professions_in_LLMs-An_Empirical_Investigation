The stale, recirculated air of the Franklin County Courthouse hummed a low, monotonous C-sharp. Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the already grey cityscape of Columbus, Ohio.  Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed in counterpoint to the drumming rain, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Amelia Reyes, Franklin County Probation Officer. Amelia, perched on the edge of her desk, tapped a chewed-down pen against a thick file labeled "Harlan, Samuel J."  The file detailed a litany of petty thefts, escalating from shoplifting candy bars to boosting car stereos.  Now, Samuel J. Harlan, twenty-two and sporting a pathetic attempt at a handlebar mustache, sat slumped in the chair opposite her, reeking of cheap cologne and stale cigarettes. He avoided eye contact, picking at a loose thread on his worn jeans.  Amelia sighed. This was her fourth client of the morning, and it was barely 9:30.  Outside, the rain showed no signs of letting up, mirroring the persistent drizzle of disappointment Amelia felt settling over her day.
