The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, plastering his charcoal grey overcoat against his lean frame.  He tugged his cashmere scarf higher, the rough wool scratching against his jaw.  Below him, the city of Valoria sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of gothic spires, art deco skyscrapers, and the occasional stubbornly surviving medieval tenement.  Gargoyles perched on centuries-old buildings leered down at the sleek, driverless cars zipping along the cobbled streets. Elias, however, focused his gaze on one specific structure: the half-finished shell of the Zephyr Tower, its skeletal metal frame rising from the heart of the Old Quarter like a futuristic ribcage. This was his magnum opus, a testament to his vision of blending the old with the new, and the source of both his greatest pride and his deepest anxieties. The setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows across the cityscape, painting the scene in shades of violet and burnt orange, a breathtaking spectacle that did little to ease the knot tightening in his stomach. Tonight was the unveiling of the Zephyrâ€™s design to Valoria's notoriously discerning Architectural Council, and Elias knew his career hung in the balance.
