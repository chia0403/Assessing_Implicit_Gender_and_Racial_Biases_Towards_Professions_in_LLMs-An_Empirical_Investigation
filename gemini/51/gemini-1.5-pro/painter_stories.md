The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes’s face as she wrestled with her easel, the wind a playful antagonist tugging at the canvas. The rusty legs sank deeper into the sand, finally finding purchase.  Isla Mujeres, off the coast of Cancun, hummed with a lazy energy this October afternoon.  The turquoise water, usually a riot of activity with snorkelers and fishing boats, lay almost still, reflecting the cloudless sky like a giant, shimmering mirror. Amelia, perched precariously on a weathered driftwood log, surveyed the scene, her paintbrush held aloft like a conductor’s baton.  Playa Norte, usually bustling with tourists, was blissfully empty, save for a lone pelican perched atop a thatched palapa roof and a mangy dog scavenging near a stack of discarded lobster traps. This quiet solitude was precisely what Amelia had sought.  This, and the elusive light that bathed the island in a golden haze just before sunset – a light she had been chasing across the Caribbean for months, hoping to capture its magic on canvas.
