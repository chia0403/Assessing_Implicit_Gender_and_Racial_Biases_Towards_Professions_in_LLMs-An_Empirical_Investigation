The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a gentle, almost comforting song, a stark contrast to the cacophony of tiny voices bouncing off the brightly colored walls.  Rainbow-painted handprints adorned every available surface, evidence of countless artistic endeavors.  Outside, fat snowflakes danced in the crisp December air, clinging to the branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the playground of Maplewood Elementary.  Inside, a miniature blizzard of glitter and construction paper scraps swirled around Eleanor's ankles as she herded her charges towards the designated rug area for story time. A single, defiant red mitten lay abandoned beneath the miniature easel, a silent testament to the morning's chaotic art project. The air smelled faintly of Elmer's glue and impending holiday excitement.  Eleanor, despite the slight crease of exhaustion between her brows, smiled. It was, after all, her favorite time of year.
