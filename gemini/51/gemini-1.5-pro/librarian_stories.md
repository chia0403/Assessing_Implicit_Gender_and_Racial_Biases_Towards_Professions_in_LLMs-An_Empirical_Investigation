The perpetually misted windows of the Athelney Public Library wept condensation onto the brick sill, a melancholic counterpoint to the cheerful crackling of the fire in Eleanor Vance's small office.  Eleanor, whose full name was Eleanor Rose Vance, preferred the formality of it even in the privacy of her own thoughts, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the room.  Stacks of returned books awaited shelving, their spines a comforting rainbow against the dark oak of her desk.  Athelney itself, nestled deep in the Somerset Levels, was a town steeped in damp and history, a place where the mists clung to the fields long after sunrise and the air hummed with the ghosts of King Alfred and his improbable victory. The library, a converted Victorian schoolhouse, was its quiet heart, and Eleanor, its steadfast keeper.  The clock above the fireplace chimed four, its sound swallowed by the thick silence of a Tuesday afternoon in November.  It was a silence Eleanor usually relished, but today, a disquiet, as fine and pervasive as the mist outside, prickled her skin.
