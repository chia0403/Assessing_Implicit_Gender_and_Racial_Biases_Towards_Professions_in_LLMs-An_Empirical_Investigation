The air in the Bumblebrook Nursery smelled of sweet potato and stale crayons.  Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow film clinging to the window, painted kaleidoscopic patterns across the nap mats. Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne knelt amongst a gaggle of toddlers, patiently helping four-year-old Leo reconstruct his crumpled drawing of a fire-breathing dragon.  Outside, beyond the brightly painted picket fence surrounding the playground, the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Vermont, basked in the warm glow of an early autumn afternoon.  The nursery, a converted Victorian farmhouse nestled at the edge of town, hummed with the quiet murmur of children’s chatter and the rhythmic creak of the porch swing.  It was a typical Tuesday at Bumblebrook, or so Amy thought, until Leo’s dragon drawing spontaneously burst into flames.
