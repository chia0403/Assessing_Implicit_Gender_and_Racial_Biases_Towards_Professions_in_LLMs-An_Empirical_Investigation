The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s office, blurring the normally crisp view of the San Francisco skyline.  Fog clung to the Transamerica Pyramid like a damp shroud, making the city feel miles away, even though the Financial District was just a short cable car ride down the steep incline of Nob Hill.  Her office, nestled in a grand Victorian building painted a deep, brooding burgundy, offered a stark contrast to the steely modern structures in the distance.  Antique Persian rugs muffled the footfalls of her clients, and the scent of jasmine and sandalwood lingered perpetually in the air, a carefully cultivated haven from the city's frenetic energy.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a pen against her leather-bound notebook, the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* echoing the steady drumming of the rain.  5:57 pm. Three minutes until her final appointment of the day, and the unsettling silence that preceded it felt heavier than usual.
