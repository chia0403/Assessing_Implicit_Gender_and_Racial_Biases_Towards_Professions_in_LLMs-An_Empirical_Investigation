Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of damp straw and something distinctly lemur-esque hung heavy in the air as Eliza Mae Blackwood unlocked the last bolt on the enclosure door. A chorus of squawks, chirps, and the low rumble of a lion's greeting filled the pre-dawn air, a sound that was both chaotic and comforting to Eliza's ears. She adjusted the thick woolen cap perched precariously on her head, a futile attempt to ward off the morning chill that seeped from the ground, and stepped inside, a metal bucket clanking softly against her worn jeans. Today, like every other day, belonged to the animals.

**Setting:**

The story takes place at **Havenwood Animal Sanctuary**, a sprawling, privately-funded refuge nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Western North Carolina. It's a patchwork landscape of rolling meadows, dense forest, and rocky outcroppings, carved out of what was once a struggling tobacco farm. The sanctuary is home to a diverse array of rescued and rehabilitated animals, from endangered snow leopards and majestic eagles to orphaned raccoons and abandoned pot-bellied pigs.

The main structures consist of:

*   **The Central Barn:** A converted tobacco barn that now serves as the sanctuary's headquarters, complete with offices, a small clinic, a kitchen for preparing animal diets, and a supply storage area.
*   **Individual Enclosures:** Varied and carefully designed habitats tailored to the needs of each species. These range from large, naturalistic enclosures for predators to smaller, more contained spaces for birds and smaller mammals.
*   **The Rehabilitation Center:** A separate building dedicated to the care of injured or sick animals, equipped with examination rooms, quarantine areas, and specialized medical equipment.
*   **Staff Housing:** A cluster of small, rustic cabins located a short distance from the main sanctuary area, providing on-site accommodation for the core team of animal caretakers and veterinarians.

Havenwood is not a zoo. It's a place of healing and second chances, where the focus is always on the well-being and natural behavior of the animals. The sanctuary's philosophy emphasizes minimal human interference and strives to provide a life as close to natural as possible for its residents, whether they will eventually be released back into the wild or remain at Havenwood for the rest of their lives.
