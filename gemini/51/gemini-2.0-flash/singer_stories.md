## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The screech of feedback ripped through the velvet hush of The Blue Moon, a sound so jarring it almost drowned out Amelia Iris Stone’s own racing heartbeat. Her hands, usually graceful and precise on the microphone stand, tightened until her knuckles shone white. She hadn't anticipated this – not the stage fright, not the glitch in the sound system, and certainly not *him* sitting front and center, radiating disapproval like a heatwave off asphalt. 

Amelia took a slow, measured breath, the familiar scent of stale cigarettes and expensive perfume doing little to calm her. Years on smaller stages, countless open mics, even a few almost-breakthrough moments hadn't prepared her for this particular brand of pressure. This wasn't just a gig; it was a chance. And he was the gatekeeper.

**Setting:**

The Blue Moon, nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, was a legend whispered among musicians. Not for its size – it was intimate, almost claustrophobic – but for its reputation. Dimly lit by flickering candles and bathed in the bluesy hues of stage lights, the club was a haven for jazz, blues, and the kind of soulful melodies that seeped into your bones. Red velvet drapes framed the tiny stage, and the air hung thick with the ghosts of legends who had graced its hallowed ground. Tonight, however, the legendary aura felt less inspiring and more intimidating. The clientele was a mix of tourists drawn by the promise of authentic New Orleans music, and seasoned locals with an ear for talent and a low tolerance for mediocrity. The tables were small and round, packed close together, forcing conversations to overlap and create a low, constant hum, a symphony of expectation that both thrilled and terrified Amelia. Outside, the raucous energy of Bourbon Street pulsed, a stark contrast to the expectant stillness within The Blue Moon's walls.
