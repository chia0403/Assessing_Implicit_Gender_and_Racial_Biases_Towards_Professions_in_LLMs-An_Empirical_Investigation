## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of H&R Block hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation that permeated the air on a cold March evening. Mildred Beatrice Higgins sighed, pushing her spectacles further up her nose as she squinted at the tangled mess of receipts, forms, and hastily scribbled notes that lay before her. Another client, another potential headache. Outside, a gust of wind rattled the plate-glass window, momentarily silencing the hum and reminding Mildred of the biting Chicago wind that awaited her walk home. She rubbed her temples, the scent of stale coffee and processed cheese snacks clinging to the air. Just seven more weeks until tax season mercifully ended. Seven more weeks of unraveling financial chaos, decoding government jargon, and politely explaining to people why they owed more than they thought. Tonight's chaos belonged to a Mr. Ronald Pinter, a man who, judging by the sheer volume of paperwork, seemed to think deductions grew on trees.

## Setting:

The story primarily takes place within the H&R Block office located at 423 North Lincoln Avenue in the heart of Lincoln Park, Chicago. The office itself is a typical franchise location, instantly recognizable with its bright green branding and predictable layout. Rows of cubicles, each housing a tax preparer and their inevitable mountain of paperwork, stretch across the main room. A cramped waiting area, adorned with generic motivational posters and outdated magazines, sits near the entrance. The constant clatter of keyboards and the hushed tones of conversations fill the air, punctuated by the occasional ring of the phone. Outside, Lincoln Avenue bustles with activity, a mix of students, young professionals, and families navigating the trendy shops and restaurants that line the street. The dichotomy between the vibrant outside world and the sterile, anxiety-ridden atmosphere inside the H&R Block office provides a constant subtle tension. The season is early March, meaning late winter in Chicago; the days are slowly getting longer, but the threat of a sudden blizzard always looms.
