The piercing shriek of the alarm ripped through the pre-dawn stillness of Fire Station 12, scattering the remnants of uneasy dreams. Outside, a biting January wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the frosted window panes. The metallic clang of the pole echoed through the building as men, heavy with sleep, scrambled for their gear. Among them was Captain Alistair James Riley, a man whose face was a roadmap of wrinkles earned not from age (he was only 38), but from years spent staring into the inferno's maw.

He pulled on his bunker pants, the Nomex rough against his sleep-warmed skin, the familiar weight a strange comfort in the chaos. The red glow of the emergency lights painted everything in a flickering, surreal hue. Grabbing his helmet, etched with the station number and his last name in bold, worn lettering, he glanced at the chalkboard. A crude drawing of a burning building, accompanied by the address: 14 Elm Street, Rosewood.

Rosewood was a district clinging precariously to the edge of the city, a forgotten tapestry of aging Victorian houses, boarded-up storefronts, and whispered tales of forgotten lives. Most of the houses were far too close together, tinderboxes waiting for a stray spark. Alistair felt a cold knot tighten in his stomach. Elm Street. That meant Mrs. Gable, the elderly woman who always left cookies for the firefighters during the annual holiday drive, likely lived nearby. He prayed it wasn’t her house. He just prayed it wasn’t someone’s worst day.
