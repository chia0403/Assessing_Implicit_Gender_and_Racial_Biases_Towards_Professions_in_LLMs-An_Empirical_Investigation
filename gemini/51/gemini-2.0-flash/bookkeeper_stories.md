Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of the adding machine was a comforting rhythm, a steady pulse in the otherwise silent office. Margaret Eleanor Ainsworth, her brow furrowed in concentration, tapped a final figure into the machine, a long strand of her silvering auburn hair escaping her tightly wound bun to tickle her cheek. She blew it away with a sigh. Another invoice, another small victory against the creeping chaos of the Crescent City Emporium's accounts. Outside, the summer humidity hung heavy, a tangible pressure that even the rattling window unit couldn’t quite dispel. But here, in the fluorescent-lit sanctuary of her bookkeeping nook, Margaret was queen. Queen of debits, credits, and the exquisitely satisfying balance sheet. Today, however, even the perfect alignment of columns couldn't quite soothe the gnawing unease that had been growing in her stomach for the past few weeks. Something was off. Something beyond the usual end-of-quarter scramble and Mr. Dubois's perpetually misplaced receipts. Something…rotten.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the back office of the **Crescent City Emporium**, a large, slightly dilapidated department store in the heart of the French Quarter of **New Orleans, Louisiana**. It's July, and the heat is oppressive.

Margaret's office is a small, windowless space carved out of a larger storage area. It's crammed with filing cabinets overflowing with paper, stacks of invoices precariously balanced on shelves, and a sturdy, well-worn wooden desk that has clearly seen better days. A vintage adding machine and a rotary phone are the main pieces of technology. The walls are painted a faded, institutional green, and a single, buzzing fluorescent light fixture provides illumination. The overall impression is one of organized chaos, a haven of order in the face of the Emporium's sometimes eccentric operations. The air smells faintly of old paper, ink, and a hint of the sweet, almost cloying scent that drifts in from the perfume counter in the main store. The only personal touches are a framed photograph of Margaret with her late husband, Samuel, on their honeymoon and a small, potted African violet struggling for survival on her desk. The sounds are dominated by the click of the adding machine, the rumble of delivery trucks outside, and the distant, muffled sounds of tourists and the occasional jazz riff drifting in from the street.
