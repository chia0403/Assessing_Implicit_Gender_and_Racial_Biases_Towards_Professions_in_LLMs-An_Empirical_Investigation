## The Setting:

The year is 1937. A biting October wind whips through the cobbled streets of Prague's Old Town, carrying the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp leaves. Across from the towering astronomical clock, its intricate gears whirring with the promise of another hour, sits "Maso a Uzeniny u Vávry," the butcher shop owned and operated by Jan Vávra. The shop, though small, is a monument to meat. Ham hocks hang like macabre ornaments from the rafters, their cured scent mingling with the tang of smoked sausages that coil in gleaming rows on the countertop. The floor is sawdust-covered, perpetually damp, and ingrained with the ghosts of countless slaughtered creatures. A heavy, oak chopping block sits center stage, bearing the deep scars of years of tireless service. The walls are lined with white tile, recently scrubbed but still showing the faint, stubborn stains that hint at the shop's vibrant history. Outside, the gaslights flicker, casting long, dancing shadows that play across the butcher shop window, reflecting the glistening carcasses within.

## The Opening:

Jan Vávra, Jan Miloslav Vávra to be precise, slammed his cleaver down onto the chopping block with a force that reverberated through the small shop. The dull thud echoed the growing unease in his gut, a feeling as unwelcome as gristle in a fine sausage. He stared at the plump, pink pork loin lying before him, the cold, impersonal flesh suddenly seeming…ominous. It wasn't the meat itself, of course. Jan had been butchering since he was a boy, the scent of blood and bone marrow as familiar as his own breath. No, it was the shadow that had fallen across his doorway just minutes ago, a shadow that had lingered a beat too long, a shadow that had belonged to a man he knew, not by name, but by reputation: a man whose presence always heralded trouble, like a swarm of flies around a summer carcass.
