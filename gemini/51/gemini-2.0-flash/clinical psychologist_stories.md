**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of Dr. Vivian Holloway's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Rain lashed against the panoramic window, blurring the city skyline into an impressionistic watercolor of gray and shimmering gold. Inside, however, the atmosphere was far more subdued. A single lamp cast a warm glow on the worn leather armchair where her patient, a gaunt man named Arthur, sat hunched, his hands clasped so tightly his knuckles were white.

"Tell me again, Arthur," Vivian said gently, her voice a calming balm against the tempest both inside and outside the room. "From the beginning. What did you see?"

**Setting:**

Dr. Vivian Holloway's private practice, "Holloway & Associates, Clinical Psychology," occupied the 17th floor of a nondescript office building in downtown Chicago. Despite the uninspiring exterior, Vivian had poured her heart into creating a space that felt safe, welcoming, and conducive to healing.

The waiting room was painted a soft, muted green, adorned with abstract art chosen specifically for its calming effect. A small, bubbling fountain provided a constant, soothing background noise. Her office, though, was where she felt most at home. Sunlight, when it wasn't obscured by Chicago's notoriously gloomy weather, streamed through the large window offering a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan. The room itself was a carefully curated collection of comfort and professionalism: a plush, oversized rug in muted earth tones, a well-stocked bookshelf overflowing with psychology texts and novels, and a strategically placed bowl of fresh orchids, a gift from a grateful former patient. The centerpiece, of course, was the comfortable leather armchair facing her own, smaller, but equally supportive, seat. On her desk, amidst stacks of files and research papers, sat a framed photograph of Vivian, smiling brightly, arm-in-arm with her late husband, a constant reminder of the joy, and the loss, that life held.
