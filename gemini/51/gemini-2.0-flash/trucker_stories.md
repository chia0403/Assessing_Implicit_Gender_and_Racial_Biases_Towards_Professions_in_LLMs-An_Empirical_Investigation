## Opening:

The hiss of air brakes was Delia Mae Johnson's favorite sound in the world. A sigh of relief, a promise of rest. Tonight, that sigh came laced with an extra tang of satisfaction. She'd hauled a full load of frozen blueberries from Maine all the way to Atlanta, Georgia, and even with the usual I-95 traffic snarls, she’d made damn good time. As she shifted into park, the rumble of her Kenworth W900L, affectionately nicknamed "The Blue Moon," quieted to a contented purr. She patted the dashboard, a well-worn gesture of gratitude to her trusty steed. "Good job, girl. You earned your rest."

## Setting:

Delia found herself parked at a sprawling Petro truck stop just outside of Atlanta. The air was thick with humidity, a stark contrast to the crisp Maine air she’d left behind a couple of days ago. The sprawling parking lot was a glittering galaxy of chrome and running lights, a temporary home for countless weary travelers. The hum of idling engines, the clatter of wrenches, and the murmur of CB radios created a constant, low-frequency symphony.

Inside, the fluorescent-lit diner buzzed with activity. The smell of greasy bacon, burnt coffee, and industrial-strength cleaner mingled in the air. Red vinyl booths lined the perimeter, worn smooth by countless backsides. Truckers, sporting everything from faded band t-shirts to crisp denim jackets, sat hunched over steaming plates, trading stories and complaining about dispatch. A battered jukebox in the corner coughed out a mournful country ballad, adding another layer to the already dense atmosphere. Outside, the neon signs of the truck stop pulsed with a relentless, hypnotic rhythm, beckoning travelers in from the long, dark road.
