The smell of antiseptic and desperation clung to Dr. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne like a second skin. Outside, a relentless June drizzle hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Hawthorne Veterinary Clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the ragged, shallow breaths coming from the creature on the examination table.

Eleanor had inherited it from her father, a gruff, beloved man who had patched up generations of Oakhaven's pets, livestock, and even the occasional wild creature stumbled upon in the woods. The linoleum floor, perpetually sticky despite her best efforts, bore the scars of countless muddy paws and panicked claws. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home, and tonight, it was a battlefield.
