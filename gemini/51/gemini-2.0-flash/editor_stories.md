Okay, here's a story opening, complete with the setting and the main character's full name and role:

**Opening:**

The scent of old paper and burnt coffee was as much a part of Abigail "Abby" Eleanor Thorne's morning as the sunrise. Stacks of manuscripts, some dog-eared and stained with the ghosts of forgotten spills, threatened to topple from her desk. Outside, the relentless hum of New York City was a muffled roar through the thick glass of her eleventh-floor office window, a sound sheâ€™d long since learned to filter out. Today, though, the din felt especially intrusive, grating against the tight knot of anxiety in her chest. Deadline day. And not just any deadline. This was *the* deadline for "The Obsidian Labyrinth," the debut novel from wunderkind author, Rhys Davies, and Abigail, senior editor at prestigious literary house, Sterling & Bloom, had a sinking feeling that the manuscript was far from ready.

**Setting:**

The scene is set in Abigail Thorne's office at Sterling & Bloom, a venerable publishing house located in a pre-war building in midtown Manhattan. The office is a testament to a certain kind of organized chaos: overflowing bookshelves line the walls, filled with both published works and towering piles of submissions. A vintage typewriter sits on a side table, a relic from a bygone era that Abigail occasionally uses for inspiration or when she wants to unplug from the digital world. The overall feel is intellectual, slightly cluttered, and imbued with the weight of literary history. The large window offers a panoramic view of the city, though much of it is currently obscured by the encroaching shadows of skyscrapers.
