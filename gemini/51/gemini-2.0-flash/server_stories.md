## Story Opening:

The smell of stale coffee and regret hung thick in the air, clinging to everything like the fine layer of sugar dust on the pastries. Amelia Claire Bellweather sighed, pushing a stray strand of blonde hair behind her ear with a weary hand. 6:17 AM. The early morning sunlight was just starting to bleed through the grimy windows of the "Good Morning, Sunshine" diner, painting the vinyl booths in a sickly orange hue.

Amelia hated mornings. And she especially hated mornings at the "Good Morning, Sunshine." It was a cruel irony, she thought, forcing her to be chipper and upbeat before her first cup of coffee, serving lukewarm promises of a brighter day to people who looked about as thrilled to be alive as a soggy pancake.

## Setting:

The "Good Morning, Sunshine" diner was a relic, a time capsule stubbornly clinging to the 1950s. Think checkered linoleum floors, chrome-edged tables, and vinyl booths in various shades of faded turquoise and cherry red. A long counter dominated one side, adorned with a row of chipped ceramic coffee mugs and a spinning rack of sugary pastries.

A faded, hand-painted mural depicting a ridiculously cheerful cartoon sun graced one wall, its perpetual grin mocking Ameliaâ€™s current state of sleep-deprived misery. The air conditioning wheezed and sputtered, more of a suggestion of coolness than an actual attempt to combat the summer heat creeping in.

Behind the counter, a perpetually greasy grill hissed and popped, tended by the short, stout owner, Mr. Henderson, a man whose gruff demeanor was only matched by his talent for flipping pancakes. A jukebox stood silent in the corner, promising a bygone era of rock and roll but more often playing polka music at Mr. Henderson's insistence.

Outside, Main Street was slowly waking up, the rumble of delivery trucks and the occasional car horn punctuating the pre-dawn stillness. The "Good Morning, Sunshine" was a haven (or perhaps a trap) for early risers, truckers passing through, and those who simply had nowhere else to go. And, of course, for Amelia Claire Bellweather, a girl just trying to make enough money to escape.
