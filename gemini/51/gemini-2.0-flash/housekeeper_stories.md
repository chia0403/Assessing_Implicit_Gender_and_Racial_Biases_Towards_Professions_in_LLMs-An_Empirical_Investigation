Okay, here's a story opening and setting, keeping in mind your request for a housekeeper main character with a full name:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of beeswax and lemon hung heavy in the air, a testament to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's relentless pursuit of cleanliness. But today, the familiar aroma did little to soothe the knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. Usually, the vast emptiness of Blackwood Manor held a certain peaceful charm for Amelia. Now, it felt like a mausoleum holding secrets she wasn’t sure she wanted to unearth. Lady Blackwood hadn't returned from her 'retreat' to the Scottish Highlands a week ago as expected, and the silence of the manor, usually punctuated by the distant clatter of china or the rustle of her employer's silk dressing gown, was becoming unbearable. Amelia wiped a stray bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, smearing a faint line of polish across her skin. This wasn't just about dusting furniture and scrubbing floors; it was about the unsettling feeling that something was deeply, terribly wrong.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, Gothic Revival estate nestled deep within the dense, ancient woodland of the English countryside. Think rolling hills, perpetually overcast skies, and an air of hushed mystery.

*   **Exterior:** The manor is imposing, built from dark grey stone, its facade adorned with intricate carvings and pointed arches. Ivy clings to the walls, softening the starkness but also contributing to a sense of age and decay. Gargoyles leer from the rooftops, their stony faces perpetually watching. A long, winding driveway, lined with ancient oak trees, leads to the imposing front doors. The gardens, once meticulously manicured, are now showing signs of neglect, mirroring Lady Blackwood’s recent disinterest in her estate.

*   **Interior:** The interior of the manor is a labyrinth of grand halls, shadowy corridors, and opulent rooms. Heavy velvet drapes filter the light, creating an atmosphere of perpetual twilight. Antique furniture, covered in dust sheets, sits silently in the corners, like forgotten relics of a bygone era. The library, with its towering shelves filled with leather-bound books, is a particularly imposing space. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and musty leather. A grand, winding staircase dominates the main hall, leading to the upper floors where the bedrooms and private chambers are located. Despite Amelia's best efforts, the house seems to resist any true feeling of liveliness, clinging to its history and secrets.

I hope this provides a good jumping-off point for your story! Let me know if you'd like any alterations or further elaboration.
