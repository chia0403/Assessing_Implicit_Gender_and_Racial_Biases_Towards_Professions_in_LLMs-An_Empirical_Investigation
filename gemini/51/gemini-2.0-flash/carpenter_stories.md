## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of cedar and heartbreak hung heavy in the air, almost indistinguishable. Jedediah Silas Blackwood wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smudge of sawdust on his forehead. He hadn't touched his plane in days, not since… well, since the note. A single, elegant script etched onto crisp paper, informing him that Eliza had decided she needed… space. Space from him, space from the small mountain town of Havenwood, space from the life they were building together, plank by painstaking plank. He picked up a piece of scrap wood, turning it over and over in his hands, the smooth grain a painful reminder of the smooth curve of Eliza’s cheek. He should be finishing the rocking horse, the one he'd promised their nephew, little Samuel, for his birthday. But the idea of creating something filled with joy felt like a cruel mockery of the hollow ache in his chest.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in **Havenwood, North Carolina**, nestled deep within the Blue Ridge Mountains. Havenwood is a small, isolated town, clinging to the side of a steep valley. Life is simple, reliant on the land and the skills of its residents. Jedediah Silas Blackwood's workshop is a detached, weathered building behind his small, two-story cottage, which he built himself. The workshop is cluttered but organized, filled with the tools of his trade: saws of various sizes, planes, chisels, hammers, and a well-worn workbench. Racks of lumber line one wall, the wood radiating a fragrant perfume of pine, cedar, and oak. Through the single, dusty window, one can glimpse the verdant slopes of the mountains, often shrouded in mist, and the meandering ribbon of the Swannanoa River below. Outside, the air is crisp and clean, carrying the scent of pine needles and damp earth. The quiet is broken only by the chirping of crickets and the distant rush of the river. It is early autumn, and the leaves are just beginning to turn, painting the mountainsides in vibrant shades of red, orange, and gold, a stark contrast to the somber mood within the workshop.
