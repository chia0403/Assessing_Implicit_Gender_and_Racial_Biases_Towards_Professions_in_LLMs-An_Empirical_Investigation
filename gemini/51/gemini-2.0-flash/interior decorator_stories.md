Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an interior decorator named Vivian Holloway:

**Opening:**

The scent of fresh-cut eucalyptus, a wilting battle flag in the face of the encroaching chaos, barely registered with Vivian Holloway anymore. She hadn't slept properly in three days, subsisting on lukewarm coffee and the sheer, white-knuckled determination to finish this project. Her usually pristine white linen jumpsuit was now a canvas of splattered paint, drywall dust, and the vague aroma of industrial-strength adhesive. The deadline was looming, a monstrous, tick-tocking beast that threatened to devour her reputation whole. Just then, her phone vibrated on the paint-splattered counter, flashing the dreaded name: Mrs. Penelope Van Derlyn, the woman whose whims were currently holding Vivian's sanity hostage.

**Setting:**

The project, and thus Vivian's current purgatory, was a sprawling, four-story Victorian mansion perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu, California. Purchased by Mrs. Van Derlyn (a newly minted tech mogul with a taste for the ostentatious and a pronounced allergy to compromise) after her divorce, the house was supposed to be a testament to her newfound freedom and independent wealth. "Bohemian Rhapsody meets Coastal Grandmillennial," Mrs. Van Derlyn had declared, a phrase that still sent shivers of creative dread down Vivian's spine.

Inside, the house was a whirlwind of competing styles and discarded ideas. Half-finished murals clashed with antique chandeliers. Rolls of expensive wallpaper lay scattered amongst discarded mood boards. A custom-built, peacock-themed reading nook sat forlornly in a corner, awaiting the arrival of a life-sized, taxidermied peacock that Vivian was fairly certain violated several local ordinances. Outside, the crashing waves offered a stark contrast to the manufactured drama within, a constant reminder of the natural beauty that Mrs. Van Derlyn, in her relentless pursuit of "unique," seemed determined to obliterate.
