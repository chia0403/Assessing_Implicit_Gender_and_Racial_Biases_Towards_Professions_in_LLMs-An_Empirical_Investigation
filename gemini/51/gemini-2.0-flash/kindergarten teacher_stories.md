The fluorescent lights of Room 10 buzzed overhead, a soundtrack to the orchestrated chaos that was a Tuesday morning in kindergarten. A faint aroma of crayons, spilled glue, and the underlying sweetness of spilled juice hung in the air. Miss Eleanor Abigail Hawthorne, more affectionately known as Miss Eleanor by her pint-sized charges, surveyed the scene with a practiced, almost superhuman calm.

Her classroom, nestled in the heart of Sunny Meadows Elementary, was a riot of color. Paper plate owls with googly eyes glared down from the ceiling, while construction paper chains, fashioned into haphazard rainbows, draped across the windows. The "Sensory Station," a small table dedicated to tactile exploration, was currently occupied by a gaggle of five-year-olds, their fingers deep in a bin of dyed rice, whispering conspiratorially. Outside, the crisp autumn air promised a day of sunshine and, if she played her cards right, minimal temper tantrums.

Eleanor, a woman whose kind eyes and gentle smile rarely faltered, even when faced with a particularly sticky situation, smoothed down her sunflower-print apron and took a deep breath. Today was the day they were going to attempt glitter. Oh, sweet heavens, glitter. It was a teacher's worst nightmare, a sparkling plague destined to follow her home and inhabit every crevice of her existence for weeks to come. But the children loved it, and seeing their faces light up was worth the effort… or at least, that's what she kept telling herself.

She glanced at the clock. 8:58 am. Two minutes until the second wave of miniature humans arrived. Time to brace herself. Today, Room 10, and indeed Sunny Meadows Elementary, was about to be sprinkled with magic… and a whole lot of glitter.
