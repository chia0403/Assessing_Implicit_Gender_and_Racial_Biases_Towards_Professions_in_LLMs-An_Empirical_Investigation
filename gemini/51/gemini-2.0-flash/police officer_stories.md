The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's cheeks as she surveyed the scene. The flashing blue and red lights painted the pre-dawn sky in a macabre disco, reflecting off the slick, icy pavement. A yellow tarp billowed ominously in the wind, revealing a sliver of something pale and unsettling underneath. 

Izzy pulled her collar higher, the thick wool offering little comfort against the Chicago chill. This wasn't the picturesque postcard version of the Windy City. This was Bridgeport, a neighborhood clinging to its gritty roots despite the gentrification creeping in from the North. The scent of coal smoke still hung heavy in the air, a ghostly reminder of the area's industrial past, now mixed with the metallic tang of blood and the sweet, sickly aroma of spilled liquor.

The victim lay sprawled halfway out of a dumpster behind O'Malley's Tavern, a local watering hole known for its cheap shots and even cheaper clientele. Izzy recognized the bar owner, a hulking man named Frankie "Fingers" DiMaggio, pacing nervously near the police tape, his face etched with a mixture of fear and irritation.

"Damn it, Izzy," he muttered as she approached, his voice gravelly. "Not again. Not at my place."

Izzy sighed. This was her third dumpster dive in as many months. Chicago was a beautiful city, a vibrant city, a city full of opportunityâ€¦ and also, a city with a particularly gruesome affinity for disposing of its less fortunate residents in garbage receptacles. She hoped this one, unlike the others, would give her more than just a bad smell and a headache.
