Okay, here’s a story opening and setting with a flight attendant as the main character:

**Setting:**

The bustling, chaotic pre-dawn hours of Denver International Airport (DIA). The air is thick with the aroma of stale coffee and the muffled rumble of rolling suitcases. The concourse is a blur of hurried travelers, bleary-eyed families, and the crisp uniforms of airline staff weaving through the throng. Outside the panoramic windows, the sky is just beginning to blush with the faintest hint of apricot, promising another day of breathtaking Rocky Mountain views—assuming the perpetually unpredictable weather holds.

**Opening:**

A nervous tremor ran through Arabella “Ara” Josephine Dubois’ hands as she smoothed down the navy-blue skirt of her Skybound Airlines uniform. It was 4:30 AM, and the fluorescent lights of Gate B37 felt particularly harsh, casting long shadows across the worn carpet. She inhaled deeply, trying to quell the rising tide of pre-flight anxiety. Denver to Boston, a red-eye special, was always a beast. The passengers were either desperate to get to the East Coast early, or simply hoping to sleep through the entire journey. Either way, they were rarely in a good mood. Ara glanced at her reflection in the polished metal of the boarding gate. Dark circles underscored her emerald-green eyes, a testament to the erratic sleep schedule that came with the job. “Another day, another sky,” she muttered under her breath, a mantra she’d repeated hundreds of times. Today, however, it sounded less like a hopeful affirmation and more like a weary resignation. She just hoped today wouldn't be "that" flight. The one that ended up in the dreaded flight attendant stories.
