The aroma of aging paper, bound leather, and a hint of vanilla candle wax hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the late October chill that seeped in from the perpetually shadowed corners of the Oakhaven Public Library. Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that gave the town its name, a sound that usually sent shivers down spines but was, for Dorothy Eleanor Ainsworth, as familiar and welcome as the click-clack of her worn-out sensible shoes on the linoleum floors.

Dorothy, standing a diminutive five-foot-two in her favorite cardigan (a mossy green with mismatched wooden buttons), surveyed her domain with a possessive air. The Oakhaven Public Library was her sanctuary, her kingdom, her lifeblood. Built in 1927, its imposing gothic architecture, complete with gargoyles leering from the eaves, always seemed to intimidate newcomers. But for Dorothy, it was a warm embrace, a haven filled with stories waiting to be discovered. Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of turning pages and hushed whispers was replaced by an unsettling stillness. The only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the main reading room, each chime a heavy, portentous beat in the deepening twilight. And tonight, that stillness felt less like peace and more like... something waiting.
