Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Vivian Holloway squinted at the overflowing recycling bin, a wave of familiar frustration washing over her. It was a monument to good intentions, piled high with wilted spinach containers, empty yogurt tubs, and the ghostly remains of "healthy" frozen meals she’d guiltily devoured after particularly grueling client sessions. Even a seasoned nutritionist, she thought wryly, succumbed to the siren call of convenience.

But the bin also represented something bigger, something that had been simmering in Vivian's mind for weeks: a disconnect between the idealized world of kale smoothies and sustainable farming practices she preached, and the messy, complicated reality of people’s lives. She crushed an empty avocado oil bottle with a defiant twist. Maybe, just maybe, the answer wasn’t just about telling people *what* to eat, but understanding *why* they weren't.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Beacon Falls, Oregon**, a picturesque town nestled in the Willamette Valley. It's a place where farm-to-table restaurants flourish, yoga studios are as common as coffee shops, and everyone *seems* to be perpetually pursuing optimal wellness. Beacon Falls attracts a mix of affluent retirees, young families seeking an idyllic lifestyle, and tech workers drawn to the area's growing innovation hub.

Dr. Holloway's practice, "Nourish & Thrive," is located on the charmingly named "Apple Blossom Lane," in a converted Victorian house. The exterior is painted a calming sage green, and the interior is decorated with natural light, calming earth tones, and prints of vibrant fruits and vegetables. It's a welcoming space, designed to inspire healthy habits, but it also carries a subtle air of unattainable perfection that Vivian is starting to question. Outside the office window, she can see the rolling hills, dotted with vineyards and organic farms – a constant reminder of the bounty (and the pressure) to live a "perfectly healthy" life.
