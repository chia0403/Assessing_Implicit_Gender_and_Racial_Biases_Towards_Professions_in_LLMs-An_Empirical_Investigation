The insistent chirp of the digital thermometer echoed in the cavernous, brightly-lit therapy gym. Sunlight streamed through the massive windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the chrome of the parallel bars. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, Occupational Therapist, suppressed a sigh and squinted at the reading: 99.2. Not quite a fever, but definitely trending in the wrong direction. The gym, usually a chaotic symphony of clanging weights, encouraging shouts, and the rhythmic squeak of therapy balls, was unusually quiet this morning. A thin haze of disinfectant hung in the air, a stark reminder of the respiratory virus that was slowly but surely thinning the ranks of patients and staff alike at the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center.

Amelia tucked the thermometer back into its charging station, the small click sounding deafening in the stillness. Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was supposed to be a haven, a place of healing and renewal for those recovering from strokes, injuries, and surgeries. Its sprawling campus, complete with a therapeutic garden and accessible hiking trails, boasted stunning views and a commitment to holistic wellness. But lately, the idyllic facade felt paper-thin, barely concealing the anxieties bubbling beneath the surface. The virus, coupled with the constant struggle for funding and the ever-present weight of her patients' hopes and fears, had begun to take its toll on Amelia. She rubbed her tired eyes, the ghost of a headache already forming behind them. Today was going to be a long one.
