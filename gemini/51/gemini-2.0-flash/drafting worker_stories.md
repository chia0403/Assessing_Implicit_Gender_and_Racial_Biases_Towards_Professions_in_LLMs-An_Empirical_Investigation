The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous drone, reflecting off the slick, vellum surface of Theodore Montgomery’s drafting table. He traced the precise curve of a roofline with his 0.5mm pencil, the lead biting into the paper with a satisfying scratch. Outside, the January wind howled a mournful tune against the grimy windows of the Pinedale Architectural Firm, a sound Theodore had grown accustomed to over the past seven years.

Pinedale, a town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a place of quiet, predictable routines. The kind of place where the biggest excitement was the annual chili cook-off and the most pressing architectural innovation was deciding between vinyl siding or brick veneer. It suited Theodore well enough. He’d arrived fresh out of trade school, full of naive dreams of designing soaring skyscrapers and innovative urban landscapes. Now, he mostly drafted blueprints for strip malls and gas stations, his dreams slowly fading with each meticulously rendered parking space. He wasn't unhappy, not exactly. Just…comfortable. Too comfortable, perhaps. A feeling that gnawed at the edges of his neatly organized life, like a persistent draught under a tightly closed door.
