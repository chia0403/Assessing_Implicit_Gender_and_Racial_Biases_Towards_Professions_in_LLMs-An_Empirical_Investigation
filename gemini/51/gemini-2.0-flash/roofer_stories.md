The setting was a Tuesday morning in Harmony, Ohio, population a little over three thousand and exactly as charming as a Norman Rockwell painting, if Norman Rockwell painted with a layer of grime. The kind of place where everyone knew your business, and if they didn't, they soon would. The air hung thick and humid, smelling of freshly cut grass and, unfortunately for Ezekiel "Zeke" Bartholomew, melting asphalt.

Zeke, all six-foot-four of him, perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of Mrs. Higgins' Victorian home, sweat already plastering his faded "Ohio Roofer's Local 42" t-shirt to his back. The sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky, beat down on the shingle-scarred landscape, making the already daunting task of replacing thirty-year-old shingles feel like a punishment from a vengeful god. He squinted, shielding his eyes with a calloused hand, as he wrestled a particularly stubborn nail free with his claw hammer.

"Damn thing," he muttered under his breath, the word swallowed by the hum of cicadas and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a lawnmower two houses down. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, had offered him lemonade – the kind that tasted suspiciously like water with a lemon wedge thrown in – but Zeke had politely declined. He knew from experience that too much liquid on a day like this meant only one thing: an urgent and embarrassing scramble down the ladder. And Ezekiel Bartholomew, the best roofer in Harmony, Ohio, valued his reputation above all else.
