## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Beatrice Harding's cheeks as she wrestled with her oversized portfolio bag. Chicago in February was a cruel mistress, especially when you were lugging your creative soul around in the hopes of impressing some jaded art director at a vaguely terrifying advertising firm. The "L" train screeched overhead, its metallic shriek a discordant symphony to Ameliaâ€™s already frayed nerves.

She hunched further into her parka, the collar scratching against the back of her neck. Across the street, the neon glow of "Duffy & Bloom Advertising: Making Your Dreams Sell" pulsed with an almost mocking vibrancy. This was it. Her Everest. Her career-making, or career-breaking, interview.

Taking a deep breath, Amelia straightened her shoulders, ignoring the tremor in her knees. She mentally reviewed her portfolio, the careful curation of vibrant posters, minimalist logos, and sleek website designs. She'd poured everything into this. Years of late nights, fueled by cheap coffee and a fierce determination to prove she wasn't just another small-town girl with big city dreams.

This interview wasn't just a chance for a job. It was a chance to prove she belonged. It was a chance to finally, definitively, say she was Amelia Beatrice Harding, Graphic Designer, and she was here to stay.

## Setting:

The story opens in **Streeterville, Chicago** in the dead of winter (February). The specific location is the street directly in front of **Duffy & Bloom Advertising, a mid-sized advertising agency located in a modern high-rise building with large, imposing windows.** The "L" train tracks run directly above the street, casting long, flickering shadows. The air is frigid, the wind relentless, and the city is a blur of grey buildings and hurried pedestrians bundled in winter gear. The overall atmosphere is one of cold, urban hustle, contrasting with the potentially warm and creative interior of the advertising agency. The scene is punctuated by the harsh sounds of the city - the screech of the train, the blare of car horns, and the wind whistling between the buildings.
