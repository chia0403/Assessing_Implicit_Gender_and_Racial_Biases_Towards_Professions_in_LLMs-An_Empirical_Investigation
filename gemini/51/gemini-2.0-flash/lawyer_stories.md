## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, oppressive heat of a late July afternoon clung to New Orleans like a shroud. The French Quarter, usually a vibrant cacophony of tourists, street musicians, and the clinking of glasses, was muted. Even the usually resilient cast iron balconies seemed to sag under the weight of the heat. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, jasmine, and something vaguely rotting.

**Story Opening:**

The shrill ringing of the landline sliced through the silence of the apartment, making Eleanor “Ellie” Rose DuBois jump. Sweat beaded on her forehead, plastered strands of her dark, curly hair to her temples. She’d been hunched over a stack of documents for hours, the rhythmic whir of her ancient oscillating fan her only company.

“Dammit,” she muttered, pushing back from her overflowing desk. The tiny, two-room apartment above a voodoo shop on Rue Royale was crammed with legal textbooks, case files, and overflowing ashtrays – a testament to both her dedication and her dwindling hope. She picked up the receiver, the plastic warm and slick in her hand.

"DuBois Law," she answered, her voice raspy from too much coffee and too little sleep.

A strangled sob echoed through the line. “Ellie… it’s… it’s Mama Odette. They… they found Marcel. He’s…” The voice broke down completely.

Ellie’s heart clenched. Marcel. Young, vibrant, full of life. Just a kid, barely out of high school. Mama Odette was a beloved client, a powerful Hougan (Voodoo priestess) who had always been a source of comfort and wisdom for Ellie. And now, she was falling apart.

“Mama Odette,” Ellie said softly, her lawyerly voice instinctively calming. “Take a breath. What happened to Marcel?”
