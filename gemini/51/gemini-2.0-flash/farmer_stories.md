The relentless morning sun, a malevolent orange eye, was already beating down on Jedediah Silas Harding’s neck, soaking the back of his blue work shirt before he’d even finished his first cup of coffee. He stood on the porch of his weathered farmhouse, the paint peeling in long, sun-baked strips like shedding skin, and surveyed his land.

**Setting:** Jedediah's farm, known locally as "Harding's Homestead," was a sprawling patchwork of fields carved out of the rolling hills of rural Oklahoma. Patches of vibrant green alfalfa and soon-to-be golden wheat stretched towards the horizon, bordered by rusty barbed wire fences that sagged with age. A small, gurgling creek, barely more than a trickle in the summer months, snaked its way through the property, providing life to the thirsty soil. The farmhouse itself, a two-story structure with a wide, inviting porch, sat nestled amongst a cluster of ancient oak trees that offered a welcome respite from the relentless sun. Beyond the fields, in the distance, rose the rugged, purple-tinged peaks of the Ouachita Mountains, a constant reminder of the wildness that still clung to the edges of Jedediah's cultivated world.
