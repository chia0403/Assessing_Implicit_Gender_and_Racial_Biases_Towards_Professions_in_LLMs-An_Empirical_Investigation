Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a forensic psychologist named Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance:

**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she stared at the monolithic stone structure. Grey light leached the color from everything, turning the already imposing prison into a spectral fortress against the bruised dawn sky. A flock of crows erupted from the skeletal branches of a nearby oak, their raucous cries swallowed by the echoing clang of a steel gate slamming shut.

Ellie shivered, not entirely from the cold. Even after years of working within the criminal justice system, the oppressive atmosphere of the "Ironwood Correctional Facility" always managed to raise the hairs on the back of her neck. Today, however, there was an added layer of dread, a primal instinct screaming for her to turn and flee.

She pulled her woolen scarf tighter around her neck, trying to ignore the premonition. She wasn't here to admire the architecture. She was here to understand it. And, more importantly, to understand the mind that had thrived within its walls.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is the Ironwood Correctional Facility, a high-security prison located in the remote, mountainous region of upstate New York. It is a stark, brutalist-style structure built in the early 20th century, known for its grey stone walls, narrow corridors, and imposing towers. The prison is surrounded by acres of dense forest, adding to the sense of isolation and confinement. Inside, the atmosphere is one of constant tension and suppressed violence. The air is thick with the smells of disinfectant, stale food, and despair. Individual cells are small and sparsely furnished, offering little comfort or privacy.

The prisonâ€™s isolation unit, where Ellie will spend most of her time, is particularly bleak, characterized by thick steel doors, minimal natural light, and an overwhelming silence punctuated only by the occasional muffled scream or the scraping of a chair in a neighboring cell.
