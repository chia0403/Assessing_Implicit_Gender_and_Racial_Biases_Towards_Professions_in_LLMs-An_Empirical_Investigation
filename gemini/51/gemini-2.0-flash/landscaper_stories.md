The August air hung thick and heavy, a damp blanket clinging to everything it touched. Beads of sweat trickled down the forehead of Eleanor Margaret Harding, blurring her vision as she wrestled a particularly stubborn juniper bush from its plastic container. The aroma of damp earth and freshly cut grass hung in the air, a familiar, almost comforting scent, yet today it felt suffocating.

Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, stood knee-deep in the parched, cracked earth of the Stonehaven estate, a sprawling testament to wealth and questionable taste located just outside the affluent town of Meadowbrook. The manicured lawns, punctuated by fountains that spewed water high into the wilting sky, and the meticulously sculpted topiaries, were Ellie's responsibility. Her small landscaping business, "Green Thumb Gardens," thrived on the whims of Meadowbrook's elite, and the Stonehaven estate was her biggest, and most demanding, client.

Today's task was to replace a row of dead junipers, victims of a particularly harsh winter and Mrs. Stonehaven's persistent overwatering. The sun beat down mercilessly on Ellie's back as she maneuvered the prickly shrub into its designated hole, already anticipating the aching muscles that would greet her tomorrow. But she wasn't just thinking about the physical labor. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach, a feeling that had been growing with each passing day for the last week. Something felt off in Meadowbrook, a subtle shift in the air that Ellie couldn't quite put her finger on, but that left her with a gnawing unease. And as she glanced up at the imposing, gothic-style mansion that loomed over her, she couldn't shake the feeling that whatever was coming, was somehow connected to the Stonehaven estate.
