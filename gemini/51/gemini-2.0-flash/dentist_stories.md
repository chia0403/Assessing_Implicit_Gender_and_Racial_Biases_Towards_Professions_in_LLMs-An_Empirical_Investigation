## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A humid, late afternoon in New Orleans, Louisiana. The air hangs thick and heavy, smelling of jasmine, river water, and the faint, metallic tang of freshly brewed chicory coffee. Shadows lengthen across the wrought-iron balconies of the French Quarter, painting intricate patterns on the cobblestone streets. The rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages competes with the distant blare of a trumpet practicing a mournful blues riff.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evangeline Marie Dubois felt the familiar sting of sweat bead on her forehead as she navigated the narrow, uneven sidewalk on Royal Street. Her crisp white coat, usually a source of professional comfort, now felt like a stifling straightjacket. The afternoon sun, even as it dipped towards the Mississippi, beat down with unforgiving intensity. She tugged at the neckline of her blouse, the starched fabric clinging uncomfortably. Evangeline sighed, her mind already back in the cool, antiseptic sanctuary of her practice, a haven of gleaming chrome and the soothing whir of dental drills. She had just finished a particularly grueling root canal on Mr. Henderson, a notoriously nervous accountant whose sweat rivaled the Louisiana humidity, and she desperately needed a distraction before tackling the stack of insurance paperwork that awaited her. A small, hand-painted sign hanging above a dimly lit antique shop caught her eye: "Fortune Teller - Readings by Madam Evangeline." A smile, wry and self-deprecating, touched her lips. Maybe, just maybe, Madam Evangeline could offer her something more than just a fleeting escape. Maybe she could offer a glimpse into a future less filled with teeth and tormented taxpayers. And maybe, just maybe, she could explain the unsettling dream Evangeline had been plagued with for the past week â€“ a dream filled with the glint of silver, the echo of a scream, and a single, perfectly extracted wisdom tooth lying on a bed of crimson velvet.
