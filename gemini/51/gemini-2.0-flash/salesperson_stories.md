Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a salesperson character:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt coffee and stale desperation hung thick in the air of the "Motivate & Dominate" seminar room, clinging to the polyester suits and forced smiles like a persistent rash. Bernadette Anya Moreau, account executive for Apex Office Solutions, tried to subtly adjust the scratchy material of her own power blazer. It was already clinging uncomfortably to her back in the oppressive heat. Tony Robbins-lite, a man named Brad from somewhere vaguely western, was pacing the stage, his voice booming through the tinny speakers. He was explaining, for the fourth time, the importance of "embracing the no." Bernadette suppressed a groan. She'd heard it all before. She knew the scripts, the techniques, the psychology. She could probably *teach* the seminar. But she was here because Reginald Finch, her perpetually disappointed manager, thought a little extra enthusiasm was the only thing standing between Bernadette and a President's Club nomination. Enthusiasm, and perhaps, a soul.

**Setting:**

The story begins in a generic, windowless conference room in the "Business Solutions Center" located just off the interstate in Des Moines, Iowa. Think fluorescent lighting, beige walls, and ergonomic (yet profoundly uncomfortable) chairs arranged in neat rows. The room is overcrowded with a mix of sales professionals from various companies â€“ mostly young, eager faces mixed with the hardened, jaded expressions of those who have seen better days and fewer rejections. There are motivational posters on the walls featuring stock images of eagles soaring and mountain climbers reaching summits. A half-eaten tray of lukewarm pastries and a coffee dispenser that gurgles ominously sit against one wall, serving as a pathetic attempt to fuel the sales force. Outside, the relentless drone of highway traffic underscores the feeling of being trapped in a cycle of endless pitching and quarterly targets.
