**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick with the scent of salt and something indefinable, something old and briny that permeated every cobblestone and creaking pier support.  For Margaret Eleanor Ainsworth, that scent was home. It was the smell of Port Blossom, Maine, a town clinging fiercely to its maritime history like a barnacle to a hull. This morning, however, that comforting aroma did little to soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach. She nervously straightened the lapel of her navy blue blazer, the official uniform of the Port Blossom Historical Society Tour Guides, and adjusted the microphone headset precariously perched on her ears. Today was different. Today wasn't just another gaggle of retirees and camera-wielding tourists; today, the renowned historian, Professor Alistair Finch, was expected. Margaret knew her history, knew Port Blossom like the lines on her own weathered hands, but impressing a man who practically *wrote* the book on the era she specialized in? That was a whole different sea to navigate.

**Setting:**

Port Blossom, Maine. A small, picturesque coastal town nestled on a rocky peninsula jutting into the Atlantic. Think postcard-perfect: whitewashed clapboard houses with vibrant window boxes overflowing with geraniums, a working harbor teeming with lobster boats and sailboats, and a historic downtown filled with antique shops, art galleries, and seafood restaurants. The tour begins on a cobbled square in front of the Port Blossom Historical Society building, a beautifully preserved brick edifice that once served as the town's customs house. The square overlooks the harbor, offering a panoramic view of the sparkling water and the distant islands that dot the horizon. The air is crisp and clean, typical of a late spring morning, with the promise of a warm, sunny day ahead, though a persistent salty breeze keeps the temperature refreshingly cool.
