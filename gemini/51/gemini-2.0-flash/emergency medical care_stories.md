Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and our main character, a seasoned Emergency Medical Technician (EMT):

**Setting:** A pre-dawn drizzle slicked the cracked asphalt of the Westside Trailer Park in Harmony, Illinois. The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth, diesel fumes from passing trucks on the nearby highway, and a faint undercurrent of simmering garbage. Streetlights cast a weak, yellow glow, barely piercing the persistent gloom that seemed to cling to the rundown mobile homes.

**Opening:**

The scream ripped through the quiet like a jagged tear in fabric. It was high-pitched, raw, and filled with a primal terror that sent a shiver crawling down **Genevieve Eleanor Riley's** spine.  Gen, as everyone called her, was already out of the ambulance, her boots splashing in a puddle that reflected the flashing red and blue lights.  She hadn't even heard dispatch fully articulate the address when the sound reached her. Years of responding to calls had honed her instincts; this wasn't just a routine domestic dispute. This was something far, far worse. Her hand tightened on the handle of her medical bag as she pushed past Officer Miller, who stood frozen near the open door of a trailer with peeling paint and a faded American flag flapping weakly above the entrance. "What have we got, Miller?" she barked, the urgency in her voice cutting through the pre-dawn silence.  He just shook his head, his eyes wide and unfocused, and gestured towards the doorway. "Inside... you gotta see this."  Gen took a deep breath, trying to steel herself for whatever nightmare awaited her on the other side. This was Harmony, Illinois.  Nothing was ever simple here.
