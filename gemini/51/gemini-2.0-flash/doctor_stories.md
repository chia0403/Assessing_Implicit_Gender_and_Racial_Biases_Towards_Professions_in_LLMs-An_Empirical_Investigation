Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a doctor:

**Story Opening:**

The persistent hum of the ventilator was Dr. Alistair Humphrey’s unwelcome lullaby. He hadn't slept properly in seventy-two hours, not since the first patients had arrived, gasping and blue, their lungs filled with an invisible enemy. The fluorescent lights of the makeshift ICU, carved out of the hospital gymnasium, buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, almost mocking glow on the rows of beds. Each bed contained a fragile life, tethered to machines that breathed, pumped, and monitored, offering a desperate defense against the relentless pneumonic plague. Alistair ran a weary hand through his thinning hair, the gesture barely registering as he scanned the monitors, searching for the slightest flicker of hope, a sign that at least one of his patients was winning. He found none. Just a chilling, steady decline.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in **St. Jude's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin** in the early spring of **2042**. The hospital, once a beacon of healing in the city's near-northwest side, has been overwhelmed by a novel respiratory virus, unofficially dubbed "Whisper Lung" by the exhausted staff. Normal hospital operations have ground to a halt. The ER is triage only, elective surgeries are canceled, and the corridors are filled with the hushed fear of a community on the brink. St. Jude’s, like many hospitals around the globe, is struggling with a shortage of PPE, overworked staff, and a general sense of impending doom. The hospital is a mix of modern and outdated architecture, the original brick structure having been added on to haphazardly over the decades. The makeshift ICU, housed in the echoing gymnasium, is a stark contrast to the rest of the facility: a cold, functional space filled with the relentless beeping of machines and the low, ragged breaths of the afflicted. Outside, the usually bustling city is eerily quiet, the fear of contagion keeping most people indoors.
