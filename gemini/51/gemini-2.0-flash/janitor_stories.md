Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a janitor named Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins:

**Setting:**

The story begins in the hushed, echoing corridors of the "Grand Aurora" - an Art Deco cinema palace in the heart of downtown Zenith City. Built in the roaring twenties, the Grand Aurora once hosted premieres for Hollywood's golden age, its velvet seats and glittering chandeliers reflecting the glamour of movie stars and champagne-soaked after-parties. Now, its glory days were long past. The plush carpets were threadbare, the chandeliers dimmed with dust, and the vast auditorium often sat half-empty, showing reruns and low-budget action flicks. The cinema had a lingering, almost ghostly atmosphere, a sense of faded opulence that clung to every surface. The air, even after the most thorough cleaning, always carried a faint scent of stale popcorn, spilled soda, and regret.

**Opening:**

The insistent *beep* of the automated locking system was Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' least favorite sound in the world. It meant another long night alone with the ghosts of the Grand Aurora. He switched off the vacuum cleaner, its roar dying down to a low hum, and sighed, the sound lost in the cavernous space. Outside, Zenith City was just beginning to wind down. Here, behind the heavy, fireproof doors of Screen Three, time felt suspended.

Bart wiped a sheen of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a faint streak of cleaner residue. At fifty-seven, his back wasn't what it used to be, and the vastness of the Grand Aurora was a constant challenge. Tonight, he was wrestling with a stubborn stain on the worn velvet of seat D14 â€“ a sticky patch of what he suspected was melted gummy bears.

"Honestly," he muttered to the empty rows, his voice echoing back at him. "Do people have no respect?"

He attacked the gummy bear residue with renewed vigor, the small brush scratching against the fabric. It was a losing battle, he knew. The Grand Aurora was slowly succumbing to the wear and tear of years, and Bart, armed with his mop and bucket, was fighting a losing battle against entropy. Yet, he persisted, driven by a quiet sense of duty and a strange, almost inexplicable affection for the crumbling old cinema. He was more than just a janitor; he was the Grand Aurora's last, lonely caretaker.

**Notes on this opening:**

*   **Character Introduction:** Immediately establishes Bart's role, age, and hints at his personality (slightly grumpy, dutiful).
*   **Setting Detail:** Focuses on the Grand Aurora's decaying grandeur, creating a sense of atmosphere and history.
*   **Conflict/Intrigue:** Hints at a larger struggle (Bart against the cinema's decline) and a possible mystery (the ghosts, the sense of regret).
*   **Voice:** The language is descriptive and slightly melancholic, establishing the tone of the story.
