Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of a dress maker main character:

**Setting:**

The year is 1938. Cobblestone streets still existed in some sections of London, and they lined the quaint neighbourhood of Bloomsbury. Number 12, Fitzroy Street, was a narrow, four-story building with a faded brick fa√ßade and a wisteria vine climbing precariously up its side. On the ground floor, tucked between a bookshop overflowing with dusty tomes and a tea room perpetually fragrant with Earl Grey, sat "Atelier Moreau," its window displaying exquisite, albeit slightly out of fashion, gowns.

**Opening:**

Elara Seraphina Moreau bit the thread, the sharp snap echoing in the quiet Atelier. The late afternoon light, filtered through the wisteria leaves, cast dancing shadows on the cream silk she was meticulously stitching. Mrs. Henderson's daughter was getting married, and Elara was crafting her the most perfect, modern dress she could manage. But Elara was frustrated, the client's expectations were too high, and her budget was too low. Elara had no doubt she would find a way to make this work, but she was running out of time.

"Too much frill, not enough pizzazz," she murmured to the mannequin, a headless beauty she affectionately called 'Penelope.' "How does one infuse exuberance into a gown when one's own spirit feels decidedly...darned?"

A small bell above the door jingled, and Elara looked up, a hopeful smile gracing her lips. Perhaps it was another bride, flush with excitement and dreams of satin and lace. Or perhaps it was her apprentice, Lily, finally returning from her disastrous attempt to acquire matching velvet ribbon from the East End. Instead, a figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, their shadow falling across the atelier floor. Elara knew it wasn't a bride, or Lily, but she knew this day was about to get a lot more complicated.
