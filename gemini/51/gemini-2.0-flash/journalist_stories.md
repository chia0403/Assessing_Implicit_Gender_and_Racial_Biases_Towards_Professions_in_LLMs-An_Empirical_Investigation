## Story Opening:

The stale scent of burnt coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of the press tent. Rain lashed against the canvas, drumming a rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of Amelia Thorne's heart. She stared at the crumpled photograph clutched in her hand, the image blurred by moisture and the sheer force of her grip. A faded sepia tone hinted at its age, but the face in the center, handsome and framed by a military cap, was unmistakable.

"Damn it, Dad," she muttered, her voice barely audible above the storm. "What mess did you get yourself into?"

Amelia knew this story was dangerous, perhaps even suicidal for her career, but she couldn’t walk away. Not when it was tied to the ghost of a father she barely knew, a father whose legacy she had always sought to understand.

## Setting:

The scene unfolds in a makeshift press tent pitched on the outskirts of **Corvus**, a sprawling, once-thriving port city now clinging precariously to the edge of a polluted bay on the coast of **Nova Terra**. Corvus is a city riddled with corruption and steeped in a history of industrial boom and bust. The air is thick with the smell of decaying fish and the metallic tang of nearby refineries. The once grand architecture is crumbling, a testament to the city’s forgotten glory.

The tent itself is cramped and overcrowded, filled with a motley crew of journalists – seasoned veterans hardened by years of covering corporate scandals and desperate freelancers chasing a break. The atmosphere is one of weary cynicism, punctuated by bursts of frantic activity as news trickles in from the front lines of the ongoing protests against the powerful and secretive **Novatech Corporation**. Novatech, a behemoth in the bio-engineering industry, controls the city’s economy with an iron fist, and its influence extends far beyond Corvus, reaching into the highest levels of government.

Amelia’s corner is cluttered with notes, maps, and half-empty energy drink cans. A portable data pad, flickering with static, sits precariously on a wobbly folding table, her only lifeline to the outside world and the threads of the mystery she's desperately trying to unravel. The relentless rain and the oppressive atmosphere of Corvus only serve to amplify the urgency of her mission, a mission that could very well cost her everything.
