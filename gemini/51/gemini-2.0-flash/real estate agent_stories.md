**Story Opening:**

The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, pressing down on Eleanor Mae Whitlock like a damp wool blanket. She adjusted her linen blazer, already feeling the beginnings of sweat prickling her forehead, and forced a smile. This was it. 701 Ocean Breeze Lane. The listing that could make or break her quarter. And if she didn't make this quarter, well, Eleanor didn't even want to think about that. Foreclosure notices weren't just for her clients, apparently.

She surveyed the house, perched precariously close to the eroding coastline. Three stories of faded turquoise siding, a widow’s walk that looked more like a hazard than a feature, and a yard choked with palmettos that seemed to actively resent her presence. It was… charming, in a dilapidated, “one good hurricane away from being beachfront property” kind of way.

"Alright, Eleanor," she muttered to herself, smoothing down her perfectly coiffed blonde hair. "You've sold worse. Remember that condemned meth lab? Just put on your 'coastal cottage charm' face and you got this."

She grabbed her oversized, monogrammed tote bag (containing, among other essentials, a lint roller, emergency chocolate, and a miniature foghorn – long story), took a deep breath, and started towards the peeling front door.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in a small, rapidly decaying coastal town called Seabreeze, Florida. Seabreeze was once a thriving tourist destination, known for its pristine beaches and quaint shops. Now, however, it's struggling. Coastal erosion, rising insurance rates, and a general shift in tourist preferences have left many businesses shuttered and homes abandoned. The remaining residents are a mix of stubborn retirees who refuse to leave their slice of paradise, young families struggling to make ends meet, and opportunistic developers looking to snatch up cheap property. The atmosphere is a blend of nostalgic melancholy and simmering desperation. 701 Ocean Breeze Lane, in particular, is located in the "Old Seabreeze" section, closest to the ocean and most vulnerable to the elements, a visual representation of the town's decline. The weather is consistently hot and humid, punctuated by frequent thunderstorms and the ever-present threat of hurricanes.
