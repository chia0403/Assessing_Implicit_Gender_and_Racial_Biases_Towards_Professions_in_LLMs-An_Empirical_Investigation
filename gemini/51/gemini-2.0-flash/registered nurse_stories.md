The sterile scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, a familiar, almost comforting, smell for Genevieve Marie Moreau. It was a smell of order, of controlled chaos, a smell that usually managed to calm the swirling anxieties that always seemed to cling to her in the wee hours of the morning. But tonight, the antiseptic couldnâ€™t quite cut through the pervasive feeling of unease that had settled deep in her stomach.

Genevieve leaned against the cool, stainless steel countertop of the nurses' station in the Intensive Care Unit of St. Jude's General Hospital in New Orleans. Outside, the city pulsed with a humid, subtropical rhythm, a symphony of distant jazz horns and rumbling streetcars. But here, inside the ICU, time moved differently. It stretched and contracted, dictated by the rise and fall of respirators, the beep of cardiac monitors, and the soft shuffling steps of nurses moving from bed to bed.

It was 2:17 AM. The fluorescent lights buzzed with a relentless energy, casting long, ghostly shadows across the linoleum floor. Genevieve rubbed her tired eyes, the harsh light exacerbating the beginnings of a headache. A particularly persistent drip from a leaky IV bag nearby echoed in the otherwise quiet space, a monotonous metronome counting down to the end of her shift. She was acutely aware that even with only a few hours left, anything could happen. Anything usually did.
