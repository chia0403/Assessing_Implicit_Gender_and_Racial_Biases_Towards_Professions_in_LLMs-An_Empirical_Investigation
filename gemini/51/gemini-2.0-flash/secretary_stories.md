The oppressive humidity clung to Penelope Abigail Hawthorne like a second skin, turning the polyester of her periwinkle blue dress into a sweltering, suffocating blanket. Sweat trickled down her back, plastering the thin fabric to her spine as she navigated the cavernous lobby of the Hawthorne & Finch Insurance Building. Sunlight, fractured by the art deco windows, cast geometric shadows that danced across the polished marble floor, a fleeting distraction from the drudgery of another Monday morning.

Hawthorne & Finch was a monument to bygone industry, a behemoth of brick and steel squatting in the heart of downtown Chicago. Its towering presence was a constant reminder of Penelope's own insignificance within its labyrinthine corridors. The building, with its hushed reverence and the pervasive scent of old money and stale coffee, was a stark contrast to the vibrant energy of the city outside.

Penelope Abigail Hawthorne sighed, adjusting the strap of her sensible, beige purse. Her sensible shoes clicked softly on the marble as she made her way toward the elevator bank, her head bowed against the imaginary weight of a thousand unanswered letters and the simmering impatience of Mr. Finch. Another day, another meticulously typed document, another pot of lukewarm coffee brewed, all within the cold, impersonal confines of Hawthorne & Finch.
