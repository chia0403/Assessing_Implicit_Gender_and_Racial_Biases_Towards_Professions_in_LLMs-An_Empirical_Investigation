Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and our main character:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "The Healing Hand Pharmacy" tinkled a cheerful greeting, a sound utterly incongruous with the grim expression etched on Rosalind Maeve Abernathy’s face. She barely registered it, too absorbed in the complex calculation sprawled across the countertop: a near impossible cocktail of medications for Mrs. Grimshaw’s stubborn fungal infection, complicated by her borderline renal failure. Rosalind chewed on the end of her pen, the scent of rubbing alcohol and stale coffee clinging to the air. This wasn't just about alleviating an itch; it was about keeping Mrs. Grimshaw, a woman who single-handedly funded the local cat shelter, out of the hospital.

**Setting:**

The Healing Hand Pharmacy occupied a small, slightly dilapidated storefront on Elm Street in the quiet, almost suffocatingly charming town of Havenwood, Maine. The town hadn't seen significant change since the 1950s, and the pharmacy reflected that.  Inside, the linoleum floor was a faded checkerboard of beige and olive green, worn smooth by decades of foot traffic.  Mahogany shelves, stained a deep, rich brown, lined the walls, overflowing with neatly arranged bottles of everything from antacids and cough syrups to homemade herbal remedies and obscure homeopathic tinctures.  A vintage Coca-Cola sign hung askew above the cash register, its once vibrant colors muted by time and dust.  A single, overflowing fern sat precariously on the windowsill, casting dappled shadows across the prescription counter. The air always held a mix of medicinal smells – the sharp tang of antiseptic, the sweet scent of cough drops, and the underlying aroma of old wood and dried herbs.

**Main Character:**
