## Story Opening:

The low thrum of the Himalayan salt lamp was the only sound besides the rhythmic inhale and exhale of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own breath. The aromatherapy diffuser, dispensing a calming blend of lavender and chamomile, cast a soft, ethereal glow across the dimly lit room. Outside, the relentless Seattle rain was a constant, percussive backdrop, but within the sanctuary of "The Healing Touch," Amelia had created a pocket of tranquility, a haven from the city's ceaseless hum. 

Normally, she thrived in this space. The quietude allowed her to center herself, to prepare for the next client walking through her door, each carrying their own burdens of tension and stress. But today, the stillness felt suffocating. Amelia kept glancing at her phone, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Ten minutes past her scheduled appointment and still no word.

Mrs. Elara Finch, a notoriously punctual woman known for her demanding schedule and even more demanding lower back, was a no-show. And Amelia Grace Hawthorne, licensed massage therapist and purveyor of zen, was starting to feel a distinct tremor of unease.

## Setting:

The setting is Amelia's massage therapy studio, "The Healing Touch," located in a converted Victorian house in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle.
