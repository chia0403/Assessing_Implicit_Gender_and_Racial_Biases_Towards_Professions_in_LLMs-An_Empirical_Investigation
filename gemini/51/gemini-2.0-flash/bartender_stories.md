## Story Opening:

The clatter of ice against glass was a familiar symphony, a comforting counterpoint to the howling wind that threatened to rattle the stained-glass windows of The Albatross. Jasper Bartholomew O’Malley, wiping down the already gleaming mahogany bar for what felt like the hundredth time that night, barely registered it. He was focused on the swirling, smoky tendrils rising from the single cube of peat-smoked ice he’d just dropped into a glass of Lagavulin. Tonight, the scent of the sea and the burn of the whiskey were the only things keeping him tethered to reality.

Outside, the storm hammered the sleepy coastal town of Havenwood. Inside, The Albatross was half-empty, a testament to the ferocity of the weather and the sanity of the townsfolk. He preferred it this way. Fewer faces to feign interest in, fewer ears to lend to the same old gossip. Jasper wasn't built for small talk. He was built for creating experiences, for crafting cocktails that told stories, for offering a silent, understanding ear to those who needed it.

He picked up the glass, squinting at the amber liquid. A perfect measure. Just enough to fortify Mr. Abernathy, who was currently huddled in the corner booth, nursing his usual and staring forlornly out at the tempest. Jasper sighed, the sound lost in the wind’s mournful cry. Tonight was shaping up to be one of those nights, thick with unspoken sorrows and the ghosts of forgotten dreams.

## Setting:

**Location:** Havenwood, a small, isolated coastal town in Maine.

**Time:** Late evening, during a ferocious nor'easter in late October.

**Specific Setting:** The Albatross, a dimly lit, old-fashioned bar. The interior is warm and inviting, contrasting sharply with the harsh weather outside. Think dark wood paneling, brass accents, comfortable leather booths worn with age, and a long, well-stocked mahogany bar. The air smells of old wood, sea salt, and the various spirits Jasper expertly mixes. The stained-glass windows depicting seabirds are rattling in their frames, letting in slivers of icy wind despite Jasper's best efforts. The only light comes from the dim gas lamps flickering on the walls and the warm glow emanating from behind the bar, where an array of bottles gleam like jewels in the half-light. The overall atmosphere is one of comfortable melancholy, a safe haven against the storm, but also a place where secrets and sorrows are often shared.
