The sickly sweet smell of fluoride hung heavy in the air, a scent Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had grown both accustomed to and secretly loathed. It coated the sterile white walls of the "Smiles for Miles" dental practice like a sugary glaze, a constant reminder of her profession. This particular Tuesday morning, however, the usual antiseptic aroma was battling a fiercer competitor: the lingering scent of burnt popcorn. Someone, likely Dr. Peterson, had over-microwaved their afternoon snack, adding a slightly charred, almost mournful note to the atmosphere.

Beatrice straightened the neatly arranged instruments on her tray – probe, explorer, mirror, scaler – each gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights. Outside, the early spring sunshine glinted off the snow-dusted peaks of the Cascade Mountains, a view visible through the large picture window in her operatory. It was a beautiful vista, one that usually calmed her, but today, even the majestic mountains couldn't quite quell the knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. Her first patient of the day was Ms. Agatha Periwinkle, notorious for her sensitive gums, her lengthy lectures on the evils of processed sugar, and, Beatrice suspected, a secret stash of Werther's Originals hidden somewhere within the folds of her voluminous floral dresses. Today, the stakes were even higher: Beatrice was shadowing Ms. Periwinkle's chart for any indications of possible gingivitis, and Dr. Peterson, a stickler for detail and prone to dramatic pronouncements, would be reviewing her findings. A burnt popcorn smell and a Werther's Originals-loving, potentially gingivitis-ridden patient? It promised to be one long, fluoride-tinged day.
