## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent light above Bernadette Riley's head hummed a discordant tune, mirroring the unsettling melody churning in her stomach. It was 7:12 PM, and the Friday night silence of the Nationwide Insurance Agency was thick enough to choke on. Outside, the neon glow of "Pete's Pies" cast an orange hue against the rain-streaked window, offering a stark contrast to the stark, beige cubicle Bernadette was trapped in.

Bernadette, a woman whose smile usually held the warmth of a summer afternoon, now felt like a November squall. She stared at the open file on her desk, the typewritten words blurred, no matter how many times she blinked. Mrs. Higgins' claim - "Wind damage to garden gnome collection" - suddenly seemed ludicrous, almost insulting.

She wasnâ€™t thinking about garden gnomes. She was thinking about the burning smell that had permeated her apartment building just hours ago, the frantic barking of Mr. Henderson's chihuahua, and the terrifying, all-consuming fear that had gripped her heart as she'd waited for the all-clear signal.

**Setting:**

The Nationwide Insurance Agency branch in the unassuming town of Willow Creek, Ohio. It's a small, one-story building squeezed between a bakery and a nail salon on Main Street. The interior is predictably bland: gray carpeting, beige walls adorned with generic landscape prints, and rows of identical cubicles. The air is perpetually stale, a mixture of recycled air conditioning and the faint scent of old coffee. The building is generally quiet, save for the ringing of phones and the occasional burst of laughter from coworkers, sounds that felt alien to Bernadette in her current state. The rain outside, a persistent drizzle, emphasizes the feeling of being confined and isolated within these sterile walls.
