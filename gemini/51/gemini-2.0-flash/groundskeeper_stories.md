The crisp autumn air bit at Edgar Alistair Finch's nose, turning the tip a cheerful, if slightly irritated, crimson. He tucked his chin deeper into his worn, green woolen scarf, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clinging to its fibers like loyal subjects to a king. Around him, the grounds of Blackwood Manor surrendered to the inevitable decay of the season. Towering oaks, their leaves now a riot of crimson, gold, and russet, shed their finery onto the meticulously manicured lawns, transforming them into a swirling, rustling tapestry.

Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and menacing gargoyles, loomed over Edgar like a brooding parent disapproving of their child's muddy boots. Its windows, dark and impenetrable, seemed to watch his every move with silent judgment. The place had an atmosphere, a weight that settled on Edgar's shoulders each morning he arrived, a feeling he could never quite shake off. Heâ€™d been tending to these grounds for twenty years, seen countless seasons come and go, yet the Manor remained as indifferent and imposing as the day he first arrived, a fresh-faced lad eager to prove himself. Now, a bit grizzled around the edges and prone to muttering to the squirrels, Edgar Alistair Finch was as much a part of the Blackwood landscape as the ancient yews he pruned each spring.
