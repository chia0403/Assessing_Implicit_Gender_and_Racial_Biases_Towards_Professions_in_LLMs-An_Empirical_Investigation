The fluorescent lights of the Piggly Wiggly hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the endless parade of canned goods, discounted bread, and harried shoppers. It was a Tuesday afternoon, that sweet spot between the lunch rush and the after-work scramble, yet the line at Till 4, manned by Mildred Agatha Buttersworth, was steadily growing.

Mildred, a woman whose face could launch a thousand ships, or, more accurately, launch a thousand coupons, scanned a jar of pickled beets with a practiced flick of the wrist. Her floral-print smock, affectionately nicknamed "The Garden of Earthly Delights" by her coworkers, concealed a figure that had long ago given up the fight against gravity. Her grey hair, styled in a practical yet unflattering bob, was secured with two bobby pins and a prayer. Mildred's movements were efficient, almost robotic, honed by decades of ringing up groceries for the residents of Harmony Creek, a town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia.

Harmony Creek was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, their grandmothers, and the embarrassing things they did in high school. It was a place where the biggest news was usually the winner of the annual pumpkin carving contest or the latest gossip from the Senior Center. Mildred knew most of her customers by name, knew their usual purchases, their ailments, and even their preferred brand of coffee creamer. She was a fixture in the community, as reliable as the morning dew and as comforting as a warm apple pie. And right now, she needed a vacation.
