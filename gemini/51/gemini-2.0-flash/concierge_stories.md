Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Bellweather, perched precariously on the bluffs overlooking the churning, grey Atlantic in the small coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. It's a grand old dame, built in the Victorian era, all turrets and gables and whisper-thin windows that rattle in the constant sea breeze. Inside, however, it's a carefully curated haven of faded elegance. Think floral wallpaper peeling artfully at the seams, velvet armchairs swallowing guests whole, and the constant, comforting scent of beeswax and simmering chowder drifting from the kitchen. It's a place that promises rest, relaxation, and a glimpse into a bygone era, attracting a mix of wealthy retirees, stressed-out city dwellers seeking respite, and the occasional eccentric artist looking for inspiration.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth adjusted the silk scarf at her throat and surveyed the lobby with a practiced eye. The afternoon light, filtered through the stained-glass windows depicting various sea creatures, cast an ethereal glow on the worn Persian rug. Mrs. Higgins, the Hotel Bellweather's resident cat, a fluffy Persian of indeterminate age and regal demeanor, was currently holding court on the bellhop's stand, accepting pets with a condescending flick of her tail. Business was, as usual for a Tuesday in late September, quiet.

Quiet, that is, until the vintage Bentley screeched to a halt outside, shattering the tranquility like a dropped teacup. Beatrice straightened her posture, smoothed the lapel of her perfectly tailored navy blazer, and braced herself. Experience had taught her that unexpected arrivals at the Bellweather were rarely uneventful, and a Bentley was a sure sign of trouble brewing, even in a place as seemingly placid as Port Blossom.
