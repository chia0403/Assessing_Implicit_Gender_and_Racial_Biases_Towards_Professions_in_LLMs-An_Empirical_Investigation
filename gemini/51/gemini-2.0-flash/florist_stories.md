The oppressive July humidity clung to Amelia Beatrice Thorne like a shroud, sticking her unruly auburn curls to her forehead and making the delicate silk dress she wore feel like a wool blanket. Steam rose in lazy tendrils from the cobblestones of Charity Row in Charleston, South Carolina, a street known for its antique shops, art galleries, and, in Amelia's case, its meticulously curated floral boutique, "Thorne's Blooms."

Inside, the air was a blessed cool, a sanctuary provided by a temperamental but necessary window unit. The scent of a thousand blossoms, from the sweet, heady perfume of gardenias to the crisp, green aroma of ferns, hung thick in the air, a fragrant symphony only slightly marred by the metallic tang of the floral preservative Amelia used religiously. Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting St. Francis surrounded by animals, painted the polished wooden floor in vibrant hues.

Amelia was perched on a stool behind the counter, her slender fingers deftly manipulating a length of ivory satin ribbon. She was trying, and failing, to tie the perfect bow for the extravagant bouquet she was crafting for a Mr. Archibald Montgomery. He was, as sheâ€™d learned from his previous orders (always lilies, always white, always exorbitant), a man of considerable wealth and even more considerable grief.
