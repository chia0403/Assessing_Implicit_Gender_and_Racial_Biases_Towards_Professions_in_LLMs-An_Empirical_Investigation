The oppressive humidity hung heavy, even inside the antiseptic chill of Expedia Dreams Travel Agency. It clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a wet shroud, making her already wilting floral-print blouse stick uncomfortably to her back. Amelia hated August in Coral Gables, Florida. It was a brutal reminder that paradise, when marinated in sweat and the threat of impending hurricanes, could feel remarkably like purgatory. Outside, the palm trees drooped languidly, mirroring her mood, and the rhythmic hum of the air conditioning was a lonely soundtrack to the slow creep of the afternoon. Another hour until closing, another hour until she could escape this little box, this tiny island of brochures and dreams that seemed so impossibly far away from her own. The phone hadn't rung in over two hours, the only excitement a fly that had been buzzing persistently around the framed picture of the Swiss Alps on the wall. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne sighed, pushing aside the stack of brochures for "All-Inclusive Resorts in Cancun" that no one ever seemed interested in, and stared out the window, wishing, not for the first time, that she was the one boarding a plane, destination: Anywhere But Here.
