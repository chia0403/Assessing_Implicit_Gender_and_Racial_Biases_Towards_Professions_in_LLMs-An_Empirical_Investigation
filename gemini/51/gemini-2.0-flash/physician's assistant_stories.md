The aroma of stale coffee and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Amelia Grace Harrison like a second skin. Flu season was hitting Green Valley hard, and the tiny, two-room office of Dr. Eleanor Davies, nestled between the Green Valley Mercantile and Benny's Barber Shop, felt more like a triage unit than a general practice. Amelia, Dr. Daviesâ€™ physician assistant, leaned against the worn, floral-patterned wallpaper in the waiting room, her shoulders aching from hunching over charts all morning. Through the glass window, she watched the late afternoon sun bleed into the crisp, autumnal air, painting the leaves of the ancient oak tree outside a fiery orange. The sleepy, rural town, usually so picturesque, felt weary, overwhelmed by the relentless coughs and sniffles that echoed from within the clinic. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another hour, maybe two, and then she could finally escape the germs and the paperwork and the endless parade of hacking children. Just enough time to see Mrs. Gable, little Timmy Miller, and hopefully convince Mr. Henderson to finally schedule his colonoscopy.
