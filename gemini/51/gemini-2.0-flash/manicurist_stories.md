The clatter of tiny glass bottles and the whir of the sanding wheel were practically an extension of Clementine Amelia Bellweather's own heartbeat. In fact, today, they were a frantic, amplified version, buzzing a discordant tune against the simmering anxiety bubbling in her chest. "Powder Blue Paradise" was proving to be anything but, as she painstakingly layered the shimmering acrylic over Mrs. Henderson's gnarled nails.

The setting was "Clementine's Cuticles," a small, fiercely independent salon nestled on a side street just off Main Street in the sleepy town of Meadow Creek, Oregon. The salon itself was a riot of colour â€“ flamingo pink walls, sunflower yellow pedicure chairs, and shelves overflowing with every shade of polish imaginable. Clementine had poured her heart, soul, and a substantial chunk of her inheritance into making it a haven. A haven that, if the whispers she'd overheard at the local diner were to be believed, was about to be swallowed whole by a soulless franchise moving in down the street.

Sunlight streamed through the lace-curtained window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the gentle rustle of leaves on the ancient oak tree in front of the salon did little to soothe Clementine's growing panic. She needed a plan, and she needed it fast. Losing Clementine's Cuticles wouldn't just be losing her livelihood, it would be losing a piece of herself, a vibrant, shimmering piece that simply couldn't be replaced.
