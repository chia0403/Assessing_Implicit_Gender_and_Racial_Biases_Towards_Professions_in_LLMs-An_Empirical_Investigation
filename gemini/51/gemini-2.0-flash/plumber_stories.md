The chill of a November morning seeped through the cracked windowpanes of the rowhouse in South Philadelphia, painting condensation on the glass like weeping ghosts. Inside, a lone bulb flickered weakly, casting long, dancing shadows across the peeling wallpaper. From beneath a mountain of mismatched blankets, a groan echoed, followed by the unmistakable thump of a heavy body rolling out of bed.

"Another goddamn Monday," grumbled **Dominic Joseph Esposito**, the first word punctuated by a gravelly cough. Dominic, a plumber with hands calloused thick as leather and a heart buried deep beneath layers of cynicism, wasn't a morning person. Not even a little bit. He preferred the quiet solitude of a busted pipe at 3 AM to the chirping birds and smiling faces of a new day. The birds, he suspected, were secretly mocking him.

The setting was his own dilapidated apartment above O'Malley's Pub on Moyamensing Avenue. The building, a testament to a bygone era of bustling Irish immigrants and hard-working laborers, was now a creaky, whispering shell of its former glory. Dominic had lived there since he was a boy, inheriting the rent-controlled lease from his nonna, and he couldn't imagine living anywhere else, despite the leaky roof, the perpetually clogged toilet, and the nightly karaoke that threatened to drive him insane. It was home, in all its gritty, imperfect glory. And today, that home was the launching pad for another day of battling busted pipes, angry landlords, and the ever-present existential dread that seemed to cling to him like sewer gas.
