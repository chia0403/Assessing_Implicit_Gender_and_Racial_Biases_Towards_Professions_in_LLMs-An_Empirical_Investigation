## Story Opening:

The bell above the door jingled a weary little tune as a gust of November wind bullied its way into the shop, bringing with it a swirl of dying leaves and the scent of damp asphalt. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins sighed, running a slightly trembling hand over his thinning comb-over. He hated November. Hated the relentless gray sky, the bone-chilling wind, and the persistent ache in his knees that seemed to predict every drop of rain hours before it even drizzled. He hated, most of all, the way it seemed to bleed the life right out of his little shop.

The shop, normally buzzing with the low rumble of conversation and the rhythmic snip of scissors, had been eerily silent all morning. Bart glanced at the clock above the vintage cash register. 11:17 AM. Not even a single head of hair had darkened his doorway.

He leaned against the worn leather of his favorite barber chair, the chrome arms cool against his skin, and stared out at the street. People hurried past, heads bowed against the wind, clutching their collars tight. No one looked even remotely interested in a fresh shave or a trim. Maybe today was just a write-off.

## Setting:

Bart's Barber Shop, nestled on a slightly rundown but still charming street in the heart of Havenwood, a small, sleepy town in upstate New York. The shop itself was a testament to time, having remained largely unchanged since Bart's grandfather, Harold Higgins, first opened its doors back in 1937.

The interior was a cozy, if a little cluttered, space. Two vintage barber chairs, upholstered in worn but meticulously maintained brown leather, faced large, fogged-over mirrors framed with ornate, gold-painted wood. Between the chairs, a scarred wooden countertop held an array of well-worn barbering tools: gleaming silver straight razors, a variety of combs and brushes, and bottles of fragrant aftershave, their labels faded but still legible.

The walls were adorned with faded black and white photographs of Havenwood through the years, interspersed with humorous barbering-themed calendars from decades past. A worn Persian rug covered the linoleum floor, its intricate patterns mostly hidden beneath a layer of swept-up hair. A stack of well-thumbed magazines, mostly sports and outdoor publications, sat on a small, round table near the entrance, offering a distraction for waiting customers.

The overall atmosphere was one of comfortable familiarity, a place where locals could come for a shave and a chat, and where Bart, much like his father and grandfather before him, felt a profound sense of belonging. Even on days like today, when the wind howled and business was slow, Bart Higgins felt a certain peace within the familiar walls of his barber shop. A peace, he feared, might not last.
