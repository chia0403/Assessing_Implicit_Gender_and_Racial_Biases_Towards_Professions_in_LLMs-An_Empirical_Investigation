The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the endless procession of delivery guys, disgruntled clients, and nervous job applicants that frequented the lobby of TechCorp Solutions. For Gwendolyn Penelope Abernathy, Receptionist Extraordinaire (as she jokingly referred to herself in her head), the hum was as familiar and comforting as her worn, floral-print cardigan. The lobby itself was a minimalist's nightmare: stark white walls punctuated by abstract art that looked suspiciously like random splatters of expensive paint, and sleek, black leather chairs that were beautiful to look at but notoriously uncomfortable to sit in for longer than five minutes. A large, chrome TechCorp Solutions logo dominated the wall behind Gwendolyn's desk, reflecting the harsh light and making her squint even on cloudy days. On her desk, meticulously arranged, sat a pen holder shaped like a miniature office building, a stack of neatly alphabetized sign-in sheets, and a half-eaten package of lemon-flavored cough drops, essential for combating the dry air conditioning that seemed perpetually cranked to "Arctic."

Today was Tuesday, and like most Tuesdays, it promised to be a long one. Gwendolyn had already navigated a near-meltdown from a visiting client who couldn't find parking ("It's not my fault, sir, the city's grid is a labyrinthine chaos!"), placated a very persistent salesman trying to hawk "revolutionary" ergonomic keyboards, and directed three lost interns to the HR department. It was only 9:15 AM.
