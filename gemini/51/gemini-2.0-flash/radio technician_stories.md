## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The crackle and hiss was more comforting than any human voice at this hour. Amelia Corvus leaned back in her worn, vinyl chair, the faint scent of ozone clinging to her like a second skin. Outside, the November rain lashed against the corrugated iron walls of Station KHRZ, blurring the already distorted streetlights of Port Lament into nebulous blobs of orange. She traced the intricate circuitry of the aging transmitter console with a calloused finger, the faint hum of its inner workings vibrating through the metal and into her bones. Tonight, the usual symphony of static was punctuated by an unsettling undercurrent â€“ a low, almost subsonic thrum that resonated in her chest and made the hairs on the back of her neck prickle. Something was wrong. Something profoundly, unsettlingly wrong.

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. Port Lament, Washington is a small, isolated coastal town clinging precariously to the edge of the Pacific Northwest. Steep, forested hills plunge directly into the churning gray sea. The town's economy is based primarily on fishing and logging, industries that are both declining and plagued by accidents. Fog hangs heavy in the air most of the year, lending the town a perpetually melancholic atmosphere.

Station KHRZ, the town's only radio station, is housed in a dilapidated, Quonset hut on the outskirts of town, perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the ocean. The interior is cluttered with dusty equipment, tangled wires, and overflowing ashtrays. The walls are lined with faded posters of jazz singers and local businesses. The overall impression is one of comfortable decay, a testament to years of neglect and the unwavering dedication of a handful of eccentric individuals who keep the station running. It's a place where the familiar routines of news broadcasts and local programming are a constant hum against the backdrop of the unforgiving wilderness.
