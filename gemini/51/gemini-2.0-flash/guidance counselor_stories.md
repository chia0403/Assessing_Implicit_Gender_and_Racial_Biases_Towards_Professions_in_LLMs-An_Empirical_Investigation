## The Setting:

The humid August air hung thick and heavy around River Valley High, clinging to the ancient oaks that lined the parking lot like damp moss. Inside, the school was a temporary oasis of slightly stale, air-conditioned bliss. The linoleum floors, usually teeming with teenagers, were eerily silent, buffed to a blinding sheen. This was the week before back-to-school, a time for frantic teachers, misplaced textbooks, and the lingering scent of industrial cleaner. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight piercing through the blinds in room 210, the Guidance Counseling Office. The walls were adorned with faded college pennants and motivational posters featuring impossibly perfect students reaching for the stars. A half-eaten bag of microwave popcorn sat precariously on the edge of a cluttered desk, next to a stack of transcripts threatening to topple over.

## The Opening:

The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of acrylic nails against a ceramic coffee mug echoed in the otherwise silent office. Eleonora Francesca Bellini, Ed.D., sighed and took another sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to alleviate the dull throb behind her eyes. She stared blankly at the computer screen, at the cursor blinking insistently on a partially written email to the superintendent, begging for more funding for mental health resources. Funding, she knew, they wouldn't get. River Valley was notorious for its underfunded arts programs and perpetually broken football stadium, let alone its invisible-to-the-budget guidance department. Eleonora rubbed the bridge of her nose, the scent of lavender hand lotion faintly lingering. Another year, another fight. Another year of trying to piece together the fractured hopes and anxieties of hundreds of teenagers with far too little to offer them. The quiet before the storm, she thought, with a grim little smile. And God, she hated storms.
