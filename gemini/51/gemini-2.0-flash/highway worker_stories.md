The wind, a ravenous beast, clawed at Earl "Earl" Johnson's orange reflective vest, snapping it like a frustrated sail. Gravel sprayed against his thick work boots as a semi-truck roared past, shaking the very ground beneath him. Earl tightened his grip on the heavy-duty traffic cone he was repositioning. He hated this part of the job - the constant proximity to speeding metal behemoths that paid him no mind.

The setting was a desolate stretch of Highway 395, fifty miles north of Bishop, California. The landscape was stark, a symphony of browns and grays: parched earth, scrubby sagebrush clinging stubbornly to life, and the jagged, imposing Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains looming in the distance, their snow-capped peaks mocking the scorching heat that radiated off the asphalt. This particular section of highway was notorious for its crumbling shoulders and the relentless sun that baked the blacktop into a shimmering, mirage-inducing blur. Earl, and his crew, were there to patch it, a Sisyphean task he'd been repeating for the last twenty-three years. He knew this highway like the lines on his own weathered hands, every crack, every pothole, every dusty pull-off where truckers stretched their legs and tossed empty cans. It was a lonely, unforgiving place, but it was home, in a way, and it provided. Earl just hoped, one day, it wouldn't take his life.
