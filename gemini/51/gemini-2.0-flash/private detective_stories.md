Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a private detective named: **Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Vance.**

**Setting:** The year is 1948. The setting is a dimly lit, smoky bar called "The Velvet Curtain" in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The air hangs thick with the scent of cheap perfume, stale beer, and the faint, lingering spice of jambalaya from the lunch rush. The jazz band, a trio consisting of a mournful trumpet, a plodding bass, and a world-weary drummer, were just wrapping up a particularly somber rendition of "St. James Infirmary Blues."

**Opening:**

The trumpet wailed its final note, echoing through the smoky haze of The Velvet Curtain, and Eleanor Beatrice Vance took another long drag from her cigarette. The ember glowed a defiant orange in the dim light, mirroring the simmering irritation in her gut. Ellie hated waiting. Especially when the waiting involved nursing a watery gin rickey and listening to music that sounded like someone was slowly strangling a cat.

She glanced at her reflection in the cracked mirror behind the bar. Dark curls, carelessly pinned back, framed a face that was too sharp, too knowing, to be considered beautiful. A small scar, a souvenir from a particularly nasty case involving a crooked politician and a stolen racehorse, tugged at the corner of her left eye. It gave her a perpetually skeptical expression, which, Ellie figured, was probably accurate anyway.

He was late. Again. This was the third time this week she'd been summoned to this dive by some anonymous tipster, promising information that would “crack the case wide open.” So far, all it had cracked was her patience, and she was starting to suspect she was being played.

Just as she was about to signal the bartender for another drink, a shadow fell across her table. A man, built like a brick shithouse and smelling of cheap cologne and fear, stood before her.

"Miss Vance?" he rasped, his voice barely a whisper. "I... I got something you gotta see."
