The wrench slipped in greasy fingers, the satisfying *clunk* replaced with a sharp *ping* as it bounced off the engine block and landed with a clatter on the concrete floor. Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge of grime in its wake. Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof of Rodriguez Auto Repair, turning the already sweltering shop into a bona fide oven. Even the ancient, asthmatic swamp cooler coughing in the corner offered little reprieve.

The setting was a sprawling junkyard masquerading as an auto shop, situated just outside of Searchlight, Nevada. It was a chaotic symphony of rusted car carcasses, mismatched tires stacked precariously high, and tools scattered like fallen leaves after an autumn storm. Amelia's grandfather, who had started the business fifty years prior, had instilled in her a deep respect for anything with an engine, even if it was held together with duct tape and sheer grit. The air hung thick with the aroma of motor oil, gasoline, and the faint, underlying scent of desert dust. Today, Amelia was wrestling with a stubborn starter motor on a dilapidated 1967 Ford Mustang, a project she’d affectionately nicknamed “Rust Bucket.”
