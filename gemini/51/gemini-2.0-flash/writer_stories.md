## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic clatter of the carriage wheels against the cobblestone streets was a lullaby, a percussive counterpoint to the swirling chaos in Alistair Finch’s mind. He stared out the fogged-over window, the gaslights of London blurring into smudges of amber and gold. He was escaping, in a manner of speaking. Not from the law, thankfully, but from the suffocating weight of expectation, the suffocating silence of his Kensington townhouse, and, most of all, the suffocating blank page. Three months. Three months he’d sat staring at that infernal page, willing words to materialize like specters summoned from the ether. Three months of nothing. And now, driven by a potent cocktail of desperation and the lukewarm recommendation of his physician, Dr. Ashworth, he was headed to the Yorkshire moors, to a windswept, isolated cottage in the hopes that the bleak landscape might somehow unclog his creative arteries. He just hoped the cure wouldn't be worse than the disease.

**Setting:**

The story opens in **Victorian London, 1888.** Alistair Finch is travelling by hired carriage from his comfortable (but now feeling claustrophobic) townhouse in the affluent Kensington district to King's Cross Station. He is embarking on a train journey that will eventually deposit him near a remote village nestled on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors. The immediate setting is the interior of the dimly lit carriage, smelling faintly of damp wool and leather, as it navigates the crowded, gaslit streets of London. The overarching setting is the stark contrast between the bustling, industrialized city and the promise of the wild, desolate moors awaiting him. The weather is typically London - damp, foggy, and perpetually on the verge of rain.
