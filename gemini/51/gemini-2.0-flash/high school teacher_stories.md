The flickering fluorescent lights of Northwood High's faculty room hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation simmering in the pre-bell lull. Outside, the October wind rattled the aging windows, mimicking the nervous energy buzzing within. Miss Deborah Elizabeth Ainsworth, a woman whose perfectly coiffed auburn hair belied the chaotic battlefield of her daily life, stared intently into her lukewarm cup of coffee. The bitter brew did little to soothe the knot forming in her stomach. Today was Curriculum Review Day, and that meant Mr. Henderson, the district superintendent with a penchant for pontificating and a smile that could curdle milk, would be observing her AP Literature class. 

Northwood High, a sprawling, red-brick institution nestled in the heart of sleepy Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, was a place of comfortable routines and predictable challenges. The sprawling lawns were meticulously maintained, the homecoming dances were always well-attended, and the collective IQ of the student body could be generously described as "average." Deborah, however, saw the potential that lay dormant within the halls, the sparks of brilliance waiting to be ignited. She just hoped Mr. Henderson wouldn't extinguish them before they had a chance to flicker. He had a way of doing that, a way of prioritizing standardized tests and buzzwords over genuine connection and critical thinking. Deborah sighed, the steam from her coffee misting her glasses. Today was going to be a long day.
