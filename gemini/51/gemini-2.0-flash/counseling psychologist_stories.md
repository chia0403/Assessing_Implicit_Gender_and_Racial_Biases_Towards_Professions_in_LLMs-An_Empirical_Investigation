## Opening & Setting:

The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's face as she gripped the railing of the MV Serenity, its engine chugging like a contented whale. The ferry, a rickety collection of rust and weathered teak, was the only lifeline to Oakhaven Island, her new home and professional refuge. The island rose from the slate-grey Atlantic like a slumbering beast, draped in emerald forests and shrouded in a perpetual mist that clung to the rugged cliffs.

Eleanor had traded the sterile predictability of her Boston practice for this wild, untamed landscape, hoping to find solace and perhaps, a new perspective on her own fractured past. She breathed deeply, the briny air a stark contrast to the recycled air conditioning she'd grown accustomed to. The air hummed with the cries of gulls and the distant, rhythmic crash of waves against the shore.

Oakhaven Island, population six hundred and shrinking, was a place where secrets clung tighter than barnacles to a hull. A place where the past was etched into the weathered faces of the islanders and whispered in the creaking timbers of their centuries-old homes. Eleanor, with her advanced degrees and urban sensibilities, was a foreign element, a pebble dropped into the calm, deep waters of a well. She just hoped she wouldn't cause too many ripples.
