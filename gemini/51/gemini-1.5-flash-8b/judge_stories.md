The biting wind whipped rain-slicked strands of hair across Judge Eleanor Vance's face, stinging her cheeks.  The grand Victorian courthouse, usually a bastion of calm amidst the tumultuous town of Oakhaven, felt exposed, vulnerable under the onslaught of the storm.  Thunder cracked like a gunshot, echoing through the empty corridors, each reverberation seeming to heighten the sense of isolation that clung to her.  The clock on the grand staircase ticked with relentless precision, each tick a hammer blow against the oppressive silence.  It was nearly midnight, and Eleanor, Judge Eleanor Vance of the Oakhaven Superior Court, was the only soul left within the imposing structure.  

The setting: Oakhaven, a small, picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, was renowned for its apple orchards and its unsettlingly quiet demeanor.  Despite the beauty of its surroundings, a palpable unease settled over Oakhaven like a shroud. The courthouse, with its ornate carvings and stained-glass windows, stood as a monument to justice, yet tonight, it felt more like a mausoleum.
