The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, dilapidated office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic drumming in Amelia Hawthorne's chest.  Empty coffee cups, stained with the remnants of lukewarm espresso, littered the chipped Formica desk.  Amelia, Insurance Agent Extraordinaire, or so she'd once described herself in a particularly enthusiastic sales pitch, stared blankly at the flickering fluorescent light above.  Her meticulously organized binder, usually a beacon of calm amidst the chaos of her life, lay open to a page detailing the peculiar case of the sinking schooner, the *Sea Serpent*.  

The office, tucked away on a side street of Port Blossom, a town clinging precariously to the craggy coast of the Isle of Mist, was less a modern workplace and more a relic of a bygone era.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminating layers of faded posters advertising antique sea charts and weathered fishing nets.  The humid air hung thick with the scent of salt and decaying seaweed, a constant reminder of the ocean's power just beyond the town's precarious borders.  Amelia's worn leather briefcase, heavy with the weight of unanswered calls and unresolved claims, sat beside her, its familiar cool a small comfort against the mounting tension.  Sheâ€™d been tasked with assessing the damage and, more importantly, the liability, stemming from the bizarre and increasingly suspicious disappearance of the *Sea Serpent*.
