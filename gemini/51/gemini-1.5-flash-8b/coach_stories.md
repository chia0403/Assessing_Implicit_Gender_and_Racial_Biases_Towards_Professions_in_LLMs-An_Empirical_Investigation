The biting wind whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  The bleachers of the Frostbite Falls High School stadium, normally a sea of scarlet and gold, were eerily empty.  Just the skeletal remains of a football field, the crisp November air, and the echoing crunch of frost beneath her worn boots.  It was a Tuesday, usually the busiest day of the week at the school, but today the entire student body had vanished, spirited away by some inexplicable and terrifying force. The only sound was the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia's own heart, a relentless drumbeat against the silence.  Frost, a fine, almost imperceptible powder, coated everything in the desolate, skeletal landscape.  This wasn't just a missed practice; this was an apocalypse.
