The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Spa" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alleyway.  Amelia Seraphina Hayes, her name a whisper of grace on the damp air, adjusted the straps of her canvas tote bag.  The scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic clung to the humid night.  Inside the cramped, dimly lit spa, the rhythmic thump-thump of a nearby construction site punctuated the soft, almost imperceptible hum of the massage table beneath her bare feet.  She sighed, the chill of the night seeping into the thin cotton of her tunic.  Tonight was going to be rough.  

**Setting:** A small, struggling massage spa tucked away in a quiet alley in a rapidly developing, gritty urban area.  The contrasting smells of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, perhaps exhaust fumes or construction materials, filled the air.  The juxtaposition of the spa's purported tranquility with the harsh realities of the urban environment set the stage for Amelia's struggles.
