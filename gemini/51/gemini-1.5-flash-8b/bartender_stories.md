The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Mela" Blackwood's face as she wiped down the sticky mahogany bar.  The air, thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, hung heavy in the small, dimly lit tavern.

Outside, the storm raged, but inside, the bar was a microcosm of quiet storm of its own.
