The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed, a relentless, white drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  She adjusted the worn, floral print scarf around her neck, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seeped into the reception area.  The pristine, almost sterile, office building felt like an oversized mausoleum, echoing with the hushed whispers of the suits inside. Amelia, a receptionist with a penchant for mismatched socks and an even greater love for a good cup of Earl Grey, sighed, wishing for a sliver of the colourful chaos she’d experienced in the bustling market stalls of her native Kathmandu.


The Zenith Corporation, nestled in the heart of the gleaming financial district, was a monument to efficiency. Skyscrapers, glass-fronted and reflecting the harsh winter light, surrounded it.  A symphony of rhythmic elevator doors opening and closing, punctuated by the occasional hurried footsteps and the clinking of high heels on polished floors, was the soundtrack to Amelia's daily existence.  The air hung heavy with the scent of expensive cologne and the subtle, almost imperceptible, whiff of fear – a fear Amelia had come to associate with the long, hushed conversations and tense, narrowed eyes that often occurred behind the mahogany doors of the boardroom.  A stark contrast to the colourful, vibrant life outside.
