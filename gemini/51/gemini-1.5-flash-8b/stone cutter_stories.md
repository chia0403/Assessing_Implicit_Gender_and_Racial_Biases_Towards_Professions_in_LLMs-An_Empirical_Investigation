The biting wind, a relentless sculptor of its own, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Cinder Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  Dust, fine as powdered charcoal, swirled around her, obscuring the already muted colours of the landscape.  Below, nestled in a shadowed valley, lay the village of Oakhaven, a collection of weathered timber houses clinging precariously to the slopes.  Elara, her name a testament to the trade she practised, knelt beside a massive granite boulder, the afternoon sun casting long, skeletal shadows across the quarry.  She was, in this desolate place, a sculptor of stone, a weaver of silent forms from the very heart of the mountain.  Her tools – a chipped hammer, a worn chisel – were her only companions in this vast, unforgiving world.
