The greasy air hung thick and cloying around Arthur "Art" Cavendish, clinging to the worn, leather-bound mechanics' manual he held.  He swore he could smell burnt coffee and desperation clinging to the old, sputtering Ford pickup truck in the bay, a testament to a weekend of failed repairs.  The rhythmic whir of the air compressor seemed to mock his frustration, a relentless metronome counting down to the inevitable call from the customer: "It's still not working."  Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on the dusty, cracked asphalt of the "Rusty Wrench" auto repair shop, a dilapidated building that had seen countless vehicles rise and fall, and a few mechanics come and go.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed, their harsh glow reflecting off the oily puddles and strewn tools scattered across the concrete floor.  This was Art's world, a battlefield of busted engines and stubborn transmissions, a crucible where he forged his solutions, one wrench turn at a time.
