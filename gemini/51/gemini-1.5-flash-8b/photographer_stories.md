The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's camera bag around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  Grey clouds, thick and suffocating, pressed down on the cobbled streets of Prague, mirroring the heavy weight in her chest.  She huddled deeper into her worn leather coat, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The iconic Charles Bridge, usually a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours, was swallowed by the gloom, its ancient stone arches appearing like skeletal fingers reaching for a perpetually overcast sky.  Amelia, a freelance photographer known for her evocative portraits and atmospheric cityscapes, felt a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. This was supposed to be the perfect backdrop for a series of photographs capturing the melancholy beauty of the season, but all she felt was a gnawing sense of foreboding, a premonition that something was amiss.  She adjusted her camera strap, the leather familiar and comforting against her skin, a small anchor in a sea of uncertainty.
