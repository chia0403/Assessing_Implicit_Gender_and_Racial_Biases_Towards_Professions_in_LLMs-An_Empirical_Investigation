The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling city streets of Oakhaven, a metropolis that seemed to sleep through the early hours only to wake with a cacophony of horns and sirens.  Eleanor, a woman whose face, despite the relentless strain of the profession, held a subtle elegance, felt a peculiar pressure building in her chest.  It wasn't the usual ache of a long day.  This was something heavier, somethingâ€¦ unnerving.  The tiny, almost imperceptible tremor in her hand as she adjusted the drill bit was a clue.  It had started subtly, almost imperceptibly, but the anxiety had intensified over the past week, mirrored in the increasingly nervous glances she stole at the chipped porcelain figurine of a grinning hippopotamus perched on her desk.  The hippopotamus, a gift from her grandmother, always seemed to offer a quiet reassurance, a tiny, comforting weight in the relentless storm of dental appointments. Today, however, it offered little solace.  The city outside her window, normally a symphony of motion, felt strangely still, the vibrant colours muted. This quiet was more unsettling than the usual clamour.
