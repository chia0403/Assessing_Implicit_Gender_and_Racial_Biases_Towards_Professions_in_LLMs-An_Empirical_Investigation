The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone accounting firm hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s meticulously organized life.  Documents, neatly filed in acid-free folders, whispered secrets of budgets and balance sheets.  Amelia, a petite woman with a precise bob and perpetually poised posture, was the heart, or rather, the organized circulatory system of the firm. Her title, Secretary, felt a little inadequate, a mere descriptor for a woman who held the entire financial future of a small but rapidly expanding company in her meticulously maintained hands.  The office, situated in a nondescript beige building on a bustling corner of Oakhaven, felt both sterile and suffocatingly controlled.  Rows of identical desks, each filled with an identical array of paperwork, stretched to the far end of the cavernous space. Sunlight, filtered through grimy windows, cast a pale glow over everything, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air. Amelia traced the edge of a thick manila envelope, the scent of old paper and printer ink filling her nostrils, a familiar, almost comforting aroma.  The envelope bore the logo of "Global Growth Industries," a company she only vaguely understood, despite spending the better part of the last six months organizing their paperwork. Something about this latest stack, however, felt different, a subtle shift in the rhythm of the office's usual routine.
