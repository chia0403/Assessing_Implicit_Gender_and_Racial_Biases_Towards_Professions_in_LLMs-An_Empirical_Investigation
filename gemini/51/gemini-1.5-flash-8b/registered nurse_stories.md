The fluorescent hum of the emergency room was a constant, low thrumming, a soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale’s life.  The sterile white walls, the metallic glint of equipment, the hushed whispers – it was a symphony of urgency, a cacophony of human frailty, and she knew it intimately.  Tonight, the symphony was particularly discordant.  Outside the large, plate-glass windows of the city hospital, the neon glow of the skyscrapers painted the night sky in hues of bruised purple and angry orange.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tumultuous emotions swirling within the cramped space.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital, felt the pressure mounting, a physical weight pressing down on her chest.  Her name tag, imprinted with a delicate floral design, was a small comfort against the overwhelming chaos.
