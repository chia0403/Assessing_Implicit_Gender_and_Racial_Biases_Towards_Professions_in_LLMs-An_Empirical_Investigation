Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Centre, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar aroma of the season, clung to the air, mingling with the antiseptic smell of the facility's antiseptic cleaner.  Sunlight, fractured and muted, struggled to pierce the gloom of the overcast sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the sprawling grounds.  Amelia, a meticulous occupational therapist with a penchant for order and a heart overflowing with compassion, stood at the edge of the overgrown garden, a worn leather-bound journal clutched in her hand.  Her nameplate, discreetly affixed to her polo shirt, read "Amelia Blackwood, O.T."  The approaching winter felt heavier than usual, not just in the air, but in the palpable stillness that settled over the residents as they retreated into their rooms.  Today, though, felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, a premonition of something... unsettling.
