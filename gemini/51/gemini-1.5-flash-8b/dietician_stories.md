The fluorescent lights of the "Nourish & Thrive" clinic hummed, a soundtrack to Amelia Kensington’s meticulously calculated day.  Amelia Kensington, RD, meticulously arranged bowls of colourful quinoa salads, ensuring each container held precisely 25 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber.  The aroma of roasted vegetables, subtly spiced with turmeric and ginger, wafted through the air, a comforting counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of her laptop as she tracked client progress, scrutinising every calorie and carbohydrate intake.

Her clinic, nestled in the heart of bustling, yet surprisingly green, Brooklyn, was a haven of controlled chaos. Sunlight filtered through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Exposed brick walls, softened by lush green plants in strategically placed terracotta pots, formed a pleasing contrast to the stark, clinical white of the countertops.  The scent of coffee, brewed just moments before, mingled with the herbal notes of the essential oils diffusing subtly throughout the room.  Today, the clinic buzzed with the familiar murmur of conversations, the quiet clinking of cutlery, and the rhythmic clicking of keyboards – a symphony of healthy living. Yet a subtle unease hung in the air, a quiet tension that Amelia, with her practiced eye, sensed.  She knew something was amiss.
