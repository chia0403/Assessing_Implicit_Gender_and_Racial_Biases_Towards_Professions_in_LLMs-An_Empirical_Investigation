The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes's growing unease.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, clinical psychologist, stared out the frosted glass, at the blurred movement of the rain slicking the city streets below.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless percussion mirroring the tumultuous thoughts churning within her.  Today's patient, Mr. Arthur Finch, was scheduled for a crucial session, and the anticipation gnawed at her.  Not just the usual anxiety of a potentially challenging session, but something deeper, a knot of foreboding that had been tightening throughout the week.

The waiting room itself was a study in muted greys and beiges.  A lone, overstuffed armchair, upholstered in a faded floral print, sat forlornly in the center of the room.  A small, chipped coffee table, dusted with what looked suspiciously like a year's worth of accumulated dust bunnies, stood beside it.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  This particular waiting room, nestled in a modest building on the edge of a struggling downtown district, seemed to absorb the anxieties of its visitors, leaving them trapped in a suffocating hush. The worn, faded posters on the walls, promoting self-help books and wellness workshops, served as a stark contrast to the palpable sadness that hung in the air.  Amelia knew this was a neighbourhood where stories, both joyous and sorrowful, unfolded in quiet, unassuming corners.
