The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty lace curtains of her tiny attic room, painted the worn wooden floor in shifting patterns of gold and amber.  Dust motes danced in the beams, swirling like miniature, ethereal dancers.  Amelia, a writer of gothic romances and historical novels of questionable accuracy, hunched over her battered laptop, the rhythmic click-clack of the keys a counterpoint to the gentle chirping of sparrows outside her window.  The year was 1938, and the city of London, shrouded in a grey drizzle, felt a world away from the vibrant, imagined worlds she wove within the confines of her attic sanctuary.  Outside the window, the muted rumble of the city's life, a constant hum of activity, echoed within the quiet attic, a subtle reminder of the real world that often encroached upon the worlds she crafted with such fervent dedication.
