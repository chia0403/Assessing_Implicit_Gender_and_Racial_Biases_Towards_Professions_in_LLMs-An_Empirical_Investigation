Water stained the peeling paint of the walls, and the air hung thick with the smell of mildew and cheap coffee.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, mirroring the uncertainty swirling inside Amelia. Blackwood, a city born from the forgotten dreams of industrial giants and now shrouded in the grime of neglect, held a peculiar allure, a tapestry woven from shadows and secrets.  It was a city where the whispers carried more weight than any spoken word, a place where the past clung to the present like a shroud.  Amelia, hardened by years of navigating its labyrinthine alleys and hidden corners, knew the city's secrets as well as its inhabitants.  But this new case, whispered in the humid air, felt different.  This one smelled of something ancient and malevolent.
