The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's pale, rain-soaked coat around her as she trudged through the overgrown path leading to the Whispering Glade.  Grey clouds, thick as poultices, clung to the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees, shrouding the valley in a perpetual twilight.  The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, vibrated with the eerie silence that always preceded the arrival of the storm.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker at the Blackwood Sanctuary, knew this feeling intimately;  it was a symphony of hushed anticipation, a prelude to the unpredictable dramas of the creatures she tended.  The Blackwood Sanctuary, a sprawling haven nestled deep within the whispering woods, was a patchwork of crumbling stone buildings, overgrown gardens, and enclosures large enough to rival small kingdoms.  Each animal held a story, each enclosure a secret passage into a world beyond human comprehension. Today, however, one story in particular clawed at the edges of Amelia's mind.  The story of the Silver-Whispering Lynx, a creature of legend, who had been found injured on the very precipice of the glades just three days before.
