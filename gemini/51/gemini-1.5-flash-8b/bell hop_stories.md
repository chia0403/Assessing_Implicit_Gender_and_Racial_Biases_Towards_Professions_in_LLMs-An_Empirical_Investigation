The brass of the Grand Imperial Hotel shimmered under the pale London dawn, reflecting the grey-tinged sky like a thousand tiny mirrors.  A biting wind, carrying the scent of coal smoke and damp earth, whipped through the ornate courtyard.  Inside, in the cavernous, echoing lobby,  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bellhop with a perpetually rumpled uniform and eyes that held a surprisingly sharp glint, surveyed the scene.  A haze of cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, sweet perfume of lilies from the nearby conservatory.  He watched a trio of elegantly dressed women, their laughter echoing through the high ceilings, clutching overflowing steamer trunks as they were ushered towards the carriages waiting outside.  The Grand Imperial, a monument to opulence and grandeur, hummed with the restless energy of a city waking. Barty, with his practiced gait and ever-present smile, was its silent pulse.
