The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Mongolian steppes, stinging Dr. Elara Nightingale's cheeks as she stared at the flickering bonfire.  The acrid smell of burning yak dung mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a constant companion on this expedition.  It had been three days since the nomadic tribe, the Khans of the Azure Sky, had summoned her, their ancient healer having succumbed to a fever of unknown origin.  The sprawling yurts, normally a vibrant tapestry of colors, now lay shrouded in an oppressive silence, broken only by the mournful cries of unseen birds and the rhythmic crackle of the fire.  Her battered jeep, a rusted testament to the harsh terrain, was parked a stone's throw from the main encampment, a silent sentinel against the vast, indifferent landscape.  The air hung heavy with the unspoken fear that permeated the camp, a palpable dread that settled over Elara like a shroud.  Tonight, the fate of the Khans rested on her slender shoulders, and the desolate steppes seemed to hold its breath.
