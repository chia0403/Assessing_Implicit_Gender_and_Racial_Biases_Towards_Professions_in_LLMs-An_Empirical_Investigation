The chill of the early November morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, even through the thick layers of his butcher's smock.  He pushed open the heavy oak door of "Grimshaw's Glorious Groceries and Grimly Good Grub," the rhythmic groan echoing through the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the rows of gleaming meat hooks that curved like skeletal fingers against the brick walls.  The air, thick with the scent of aged oak and freshly cut beef, was punctuated by the sharp tang of thyme and rosemary, clinging to the damp shelves stocked with roots and vegetables.  Barty, with his weathered hands and a face etched with years of dealing with the raw materials of life, surveyed his domain.  He was the heart of this small, forgotten corner of the Cotswolds, the man who coaxed beauty from the beasts, a master of the blade, and the quiet custodian of this hallowed space.
