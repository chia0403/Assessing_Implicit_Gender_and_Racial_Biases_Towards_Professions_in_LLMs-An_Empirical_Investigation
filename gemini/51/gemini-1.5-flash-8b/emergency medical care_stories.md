The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's lab coat around her legs as she hurried down the slick, cobblestone street.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, plastered the already-dark alleyways to a shimmering sheen.  London, usually a city of muted, grey beauty, tonight felt raw and unforgiving.  The rhythmic thump-thump of her boots against the wet stone punctuated the muted cries of gulls battling the wind above and the distant wail of a siren.  This was her routine, this was her city.  As an Emergency Medical Technician for the London Metropolitan Ambulance Service,  Amelia found solace, not in the quiet moments, but in the frenetic energy of a storm-wracked city, in the constant, urgent rhythm of life and death.  Tonight, the rhythm had quickened.


Setting: A rain-soaked, windswept section of the East End of London. The city, normally a symphony of activity, is turned into a hostile landscape of shadows and relentless weather. Specific locations within this area, like a network of narrow, cobbled streets and a particularly treacherous stretch of the river Thames, would be key later on.
