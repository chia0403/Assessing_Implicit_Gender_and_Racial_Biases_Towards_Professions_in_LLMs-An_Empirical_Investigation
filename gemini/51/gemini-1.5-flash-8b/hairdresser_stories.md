The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten remnants of yesterday's hair dye, reflected the harsh fluorescent glow of the salon.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight that pierced the grimy window, illuminating a single, stray strand of crimson hair clinging to the chipped paint.  This was "The Whispering Scissors," a salon tucked away on a side street of Willow Creek, a town where the past clung to the cobblestones like ivy.  Elizabeth Anne "Liz"  Ashworth, a woman whose sharp cheekbones and perpetually surprised expression seemed to mirror the intricate, layered bobs she crafted with such precision, adjusted the worn apron around her waist.  The scent of stale coffee and something indefinably floral hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that accompanied the rhythmic *clip-clip-clip* of scissors against hair.  Today, a new client awaited.  A client with a secret.
