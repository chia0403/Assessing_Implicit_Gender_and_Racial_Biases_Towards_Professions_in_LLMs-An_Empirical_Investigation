The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Grocer" hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythm of Amelia Butterfield's life.  She was a cashier, a cog in the meticulously oiled machine of everyday transactions.  Rows of brightly colored produce, their vibrant hues seeming to mock the pale grey of the small, suburban shop, lined the aisles.  Behind the counter, Amelia, a woman of twenty-seven with eyes that held the weariness of countless late nights, meticulously scanned barcodes and tallied totals.  The chipped ceramic mug warmed her hands; it contained lukewarm coffee, a meager comfort against the chill that seeped into the store from the perpetually drafty windows.  Outside, a persistent drizzle hammered against the corrugated metal awning, mimicking the relentless patter of the customers who shuffled in and out of the shop. Each interaction, a fleeting exchange of polite pleasantries or rushed grumbles, was an identical ripple in the still water of her routine. Today, however, a single item, tucked within a brightly wrapped bouquet of daffodils, held the promise of a different kind of ripple.
