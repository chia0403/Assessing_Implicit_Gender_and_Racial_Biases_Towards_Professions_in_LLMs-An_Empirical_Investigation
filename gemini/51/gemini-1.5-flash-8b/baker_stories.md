The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Rue de la Lune, illuminating the chipped paint of the bakery, "Le Petit Pain."  Rain slicked the narrow street, turning the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something sweeter, something yeasty and warm â€“ the aroma of freshly baked bread.  Inside, amidst the gentle hiss of steam and the rhythmic thud of kneading dough,  Amelia Dubois,  a baker with eyes the colour of roasted chestnuts and hands calloused from years of handling flour, meticulously shaped a croissant, the delicate layers whispering secrets only she could understand.  It was the first croissant of the day, a ritual, a promise to herself and the city that awaited, each fold a testament to the quiet magic she wove into every loaf.  The scent of cinnamon and nutmeg hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill of the Parisian autumn.
