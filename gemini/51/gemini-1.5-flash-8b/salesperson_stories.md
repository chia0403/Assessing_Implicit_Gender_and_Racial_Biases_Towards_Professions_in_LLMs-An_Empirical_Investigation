Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Glittering Gem" jewellery store, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Blackwood.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow over rows of glittering necklaces, diamond earrings, and rings that seemed to mock her frustration.  Outside, the city roared – a symphony of sirens and the muffled cries of pedestrians – but inside, Amelia felt utterly alone.  She was the sole salesperson, hunched over a dusty display case of antique brooches, her breath fogging the cold glass.  The store, usually a bustling haven of precious metal and polished stone, was eerily quiet this Tuesday evening.  Only the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky gutter outside punctuated the silence.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas, desperately needed a sale.  Her commission was dwindling, and the looming rent payment loomed larger with every passing hour.
