The fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia  Seraphina  Ashworth's existential dread.  Every Tuesday, this particular corridor, lined with lockers bearing the chipped paint of forgotten identities, felt like a purgatory.  Students, a swirling vortex of anxious whispers and hasty footsteps, seemed to move through it without noticing the faded posters promoting college fairs and the dusty, almost-forgotten brochures for career exploration.  Amelia, her gaze fixed on a particularly stubborn smudge on the linoleum floor, felt more like a museum curator than a guidance counselor.  This Tuesday, however, the usually predictable chaos was punctuated by an unusual silence, a hush that amplified the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart against her ribs.  The silence hung heavy, pregnant with unspoken anxieties, waiting for someone—or something—to break it.
