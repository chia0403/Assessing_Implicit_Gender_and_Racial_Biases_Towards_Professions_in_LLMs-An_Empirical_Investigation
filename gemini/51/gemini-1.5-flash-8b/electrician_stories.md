The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electric Solutions" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alleyway.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind where the city breathed a sigh of relief after a relentless Monday, but the air hung thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth.  This was Elias Thorne's domain, a cramped workshop crammed with wires, tools, and the ghosts of countless circuits brought back to life.  Elias, a wiry man with calloused hands and eyes that held the tired wisdom of a thousand frayed wires, hunched over a tangle of copper, muttering to himself in a low baritone.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of his hand-crank drill.  The flickering neon cast long, distorted shadows on his face, making him seem almost spectral, as if he were a part of the electrical hum that pulsed through the entire city.
