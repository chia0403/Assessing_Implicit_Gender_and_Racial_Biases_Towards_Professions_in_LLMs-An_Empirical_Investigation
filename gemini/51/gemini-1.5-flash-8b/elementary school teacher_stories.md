The chipped paint on the walls of Miss Amelia Hawthorne's second-grade classroom smelled faintly of old paper and something vaguely floral, a scent that clung to the room like a forgotten ghost.  Sunlight, fractured by the dusty blinds, painted elongated shadows across the worn, linoleum floor.  Empty juice boxes and crumpled construction paper littered the tables, a testament to the chaotic but ultimately hopeful energy of a Tuesday morning.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair, usually meticulously braided, was today escaping its confines in loose curls around her face, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  She loved the chaos, the quiet hum of activity, the endless possibilities contained within the four walls of her classroom at Oakhaven Elementary.  She loved these children, their burgeoning imaginations, and the way they clung to every word she said, every gesture she made.  This morning, however, the air held a different kind of tension, a hush that hung heavier than the usual Tuesday morning murmur.
