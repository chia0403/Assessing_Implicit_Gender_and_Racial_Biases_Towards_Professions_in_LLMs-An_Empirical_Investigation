The biting November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the windows of the firehouse like agitated spirits.  Snow, already dusting the ground, threatened to fall heavier, burying the already treacherous back roads of the town of Oakhaven under a suffocating white blanket.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of pine and ozone, a familiar, comforting scent to Captain Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, but one tinged with a preternatural stillness tonight.  The station's usually boisterous chatter was muted, the rhythmic click-clack of boots on the worn concrete floors fading into the background hum of the emergency call box.  Amy, a seasoned fire captain with weathered skin and eyes that held the quiet intensity of a forest fire, felt a shiver run down her spine, a feeling that had nothing to do with the approaching storm.  Tonight, something felt different, wrong.  The silence was pregnant.
