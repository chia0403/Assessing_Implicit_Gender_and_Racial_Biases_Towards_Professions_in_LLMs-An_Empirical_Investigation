The chipped porcelain mug warmed Elias Thorne's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air.  Dew clung to the meticulously manicured hedges of Blackwood Manor, a testament to Elias's dedication, a dedication born not of obligation, but of a quiet, almost spectral, love.  The manor itself, perched atop a craggy hill overlooking the sprawling valley, seemed to breathe a history thick with whispered secrets and forgotten grandeur.  Stone walls, stained a deep, moss-green by time, clawed at the grey sky, their weathered faces etched with stories that Elias, with his trained eye, could almost decipher.  It was a landscape of muted tones, of ancient oaks and whispering pines, a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost chaotic, colours of the wildflowers he carefully nurtured in the hidden gardens below.  Elias, a groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for the past twenty years, felt profoundly connected to this place, a connection as deep and intricate as the roots of the oldest trees. This morning, however, a peculiar silence, thicker than the usual morning mist, hung heavy over the estate.
