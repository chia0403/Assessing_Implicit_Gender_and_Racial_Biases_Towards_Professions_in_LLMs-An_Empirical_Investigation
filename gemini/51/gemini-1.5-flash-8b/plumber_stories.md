The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Leaky Pipes" plumbing shop hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's latest headache.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of the phone ringing.  Barty, a wiry man with grease smudged on his perpetually rumpled overalls and a perpetually furrowed brow, snatched the receiver.

**Setting:**

The "Leaky Pipes" plumbing shop wasn't glamorous.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun that struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows.  Rusty pipes snaked haphazardly through the cramped space, their ends disappearing into a labyrinth of tangled copper tubing and overflowing buckets.  The air, thick with the smell of copper, mildew, and something vaguely floral (Barty suspected a particularly stubborn drain cleaner), hung heavy and stagnant.  A half-eaten sandwich, abandoned mid-bite, lay on a workbench next to a pile of used wrench sets.  The shop, situated on a narrow, cobbled street in the heart of the bustling yet somewhat dilapidated, old-world town of Oakhaven, felt like a microcosm of the city's own complicated plumbing system.  Leaking pipes weren't just a problem in buildings; they were a problem of a different sort here, woven into the fabric of Oakhaven's very existence.
