The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, clawed at Silas Blackwood's face as he chopped.  Each swing of the axe echoed through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, a mournful counterpoint to the screech of unseen hawks circling high above the desolate peaks of the Northern Cascades.  Snow, the consistency of coarse sugar, coated everything in a pristine, unforgiving white.  Silas, weathered and lean, was a figure sculpted from granite and winter, his hands calloused and scarred like the bark of the trees he felled.  He was Elias Blackwood's son, inheritor of the Blackwood logging legacy, and today, the legacy felt heavier than the towering firs he'd been tasked with felling. The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending winter, held a palpable tension.  This wasn't just another logging job; this was a test, a confrontation with the unforgiving heart of the mountain, and with his own fragile sense of purpose.  He was Silas Blackwood, and the mountain, his silent, watchful adversary, was about to reveal its secrets.
