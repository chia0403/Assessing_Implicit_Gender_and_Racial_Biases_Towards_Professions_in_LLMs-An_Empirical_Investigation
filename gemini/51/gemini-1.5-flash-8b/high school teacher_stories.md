The fluorescent lights of Ms. Elara Nightingale's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet rustling of papers and the occasional, barely audible sigh.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the chipped paint on the chalkboard and the faded posters plastered to the walls â€“ a motley collection of historical figures, mathematical formulas, and vaguely threatening-looking diagrams of the human circulatory system.  Elara, a history teacher at Hawthorne High, leaned against her desk, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee in her hand.  Hawthorne High, a sprawling, brick behemoth nestled in the shadow of the towering, industrial smokestacks of the River City skyline, was a place where dreams were as easily choked by smog as by apathy.  Elara herself had a dream, a whisper of something more than the predictable rhythm of lesson plans and standardized tests, but it felt as elusive as the morning mist that clung to the river each day.
