The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, ripped at Amelia "Milly"  Fitzwilliam's worn parka.  She squinted against the swirling snow, the fluorescent orange of her reflective vest swallowed by the white landscape.  The highway, usually a ribbon of asphalt slicing through the frosted plains, was now a frozen, featureless expanse, barely discernible beneath the blinding blizzard.  This wasnâ€™t the idyllic winter wonderland brochures painted; this was the brutal, unforgiving face of the Montana winter.  Milly, a highway maintenance worker for the Montana Department of Transportation, knew it intimately.

The biting wind whipped across the exposed terrain, the snow piled high against the weathered, frost-covered guardrails.  The only sounds were the shriek of the wind, the rhythmic grinding of the snowplow in the distance, and the occasional, lonely howl of a wolf echoing from the surrounding wilderness.  The nearest town, a faded ghost of a settlement called Harlow, lay huddled miles away, its lights barely visible through the swirling snow.
