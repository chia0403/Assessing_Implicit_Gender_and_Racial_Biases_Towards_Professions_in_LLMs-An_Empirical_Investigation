The scent of freshly-cut hair, a heady mix of lavender and something vaguely metallic, clung to the air in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Snip-Snap Scissors."  Sunlight, fractured by the ornate, stained-glass window depicting a flock of scissor-tailed hummingbirds, painted the sawdust-strewn floor in shifting patterns of amber and emerald.  Barty, a man whose neatly trimmed beard mirrored the precision of his craft, adjusted the angle of his gleaming silver clippers.  He'd been at The Snip-Snap Scissors for twenty-seven years, shaping heads and whispering secrets – or at least, the occasional muttered complaint about unruly clients – into the bustling, if somewhat predictable, rhythm of small-town life. Today, however, the usual hum of conversation was muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet.  The town of Oakhaven, nestled between the whispering pines of the Whispering Woods and the shimmering expanse of the Silver Lake, usually buzzed with activity.  But today, an unnerving stillness lay draped over the entire community.
