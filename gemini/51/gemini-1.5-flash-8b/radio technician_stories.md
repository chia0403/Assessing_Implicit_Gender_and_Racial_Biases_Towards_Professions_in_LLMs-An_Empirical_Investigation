The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Microphone" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones, reflecting in the puddles that mirrored the fractured city lights above.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of solder and stale coffee, punctuated by the insistent hum of a dozen different radios.  Elias Thorne, Radio Technician Extraordinaire, hunched over a workbench groaning under the weight of vintage electronics.  Worn leather gloves covered his hands, calloused from years of wrestling with broken circuits and untamed static.  Around him, a symphony of static and crackling signals battled with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias's tools.  He was a man of the ether, a whisperer of signals in a city built on whispers and broken promises.  The city, itself, seemed to hold its breath as Elias worked.
