The biting wind whipped Amelia Genevieve Hayes's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she trudged up the icy incline towards the remote cabin nestled amongst the skeletal branches of the ancient pines.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and frost, felt almost solid against her lungs.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the swirling snow, casting long, skeletal shadows across the frosted landscape.  This was her third winter in the remote village of Alderbrook, and each one felt colder, harsher, more isolating than the last.  Her work as a physical therapist, a profession sheâ€™d always cherished, now felt more like a penance.

Each window, like a vacant eye, peered out at the unforgiving wilderness, seemingly reflecting the exhaustion within her.  She clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the familiar weight a comforting counterpoint to the icy grip of the wind.  The villagers whispered stories about the cabin, of a troubled past, of a lingering curse.  She hadn't believed them at first, but the isolation, the palpable sense of something amiss in the air, was starting to seep into her very bones.  She needed to get to Elias, a young boy she was slated to visit, his body struggling to respond to the brutal winter, more than ever.  But reaching the cabin felt like battling something more substantial than just the snow.
