The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Khyber Pass clawed at the bruised, cerulean sky.  Dust devils danced across the barren, sun-baked landscape, swirling into the miniature canyons carved into the earth.  Amy, her knuckles white around the controls of the battered but loyal "Sky Serpent," felt the relentless vibration of the ancient aircraft â€“ a relic of a forgotten war, a testament to her own stubborn refusal to leave the skies.

The year was 1938.
