The rhythmic hum of the air conditioner, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Alistair Finch's fingers on the keyboard, filled the small, sun-drenched office.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon light filtering through the large window overlooking the bustling city street below.  A faint aroma of lavender and antiseptic hung in the air, a familiar comfort in the otherwise clinical space.  Alistair, a chiropractor with a neatly trimmed grey beard and piercing blue eyes, meticulously documented a patient's progress, each keystroke echoing the quiet precision of his craft.  He focused on the details, the subtle shifts in posture, the almost imperceptible improvement in range of motion, the quantified evidence of his work.  But today, something was different.  The usual hum of the city, usually a welcome backdrop to his focus, felt unnervingly quiet, a hushed anticipation pressing in on the otherwise predictable routine.  A premonition, he thought, almost a whisper in the back of his mind.  He'd felt it before, an inkling of something more than just the usual aches and pains. He hoped, with a sigh, that this time it would be nothing more than a fleeting sense of unease.  The city outside, though, seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for something – or someone – to disrupt the usual rhythm.
