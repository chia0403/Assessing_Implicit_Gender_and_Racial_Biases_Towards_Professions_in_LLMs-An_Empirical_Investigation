The chipped porcelain sink in the ladies' restroom of the Grimsby Public Library gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a single, perfectly formed tear rolling down Amelia Penelope Thistlewick's cheek.  Amelia, a librarian with a heart full of forgotten stories and a soul stained by the whispers of overdue books,  had just witnessed a truly catastrophic event. Not a fire, not a flood, but something far more devastating.  A book, a *very* special book, had gone missing.  The Dewey Decimal System, the very bedrock of her orderly universe, had crumbled under the weight of its absence.  The air in the room, usually thick with the scent of aged paper and beeswax polish, felt thick with an oppressive silence, a silence only broken by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the main reading room, a clock that seemed to mock her despair with its unwavering, steady progress.  The Grimsby Public Library, a haven for lost souls and forgotten dreams, had a gaping hole in its heart.
