The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Institute hummed a monotonous dirge, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's nightly ritual.  Elias Thorne, janitor, custodian of knowledge and forgotten papers, surveyed the sprawling, cavernous library.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight filtering through the high arched windows, illuminating the endless rows of towering bookshelves, each spine a silent testament to countless forgotten dreams and groundbreaking discoveries.  Dust bunnies, like miniature tumbleweeds, rolled across the polished floors, a constant, whispering reminder of the quiet decay that lurked beneath the surface of the gleaming facade. The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and something subtly metallic, clung to him like a second skin.  This was his kingdom, his sanctuary, the place where the whispers of history lingered longest. Tonight, however, the whispers held a different tone.  A low, insistent hum resonated beneath the library floor, a sound that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the building, something heâ€™d never heard before.
