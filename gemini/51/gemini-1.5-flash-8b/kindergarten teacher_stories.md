The chipped paint on the mural depicting a sun-drenched meadow, a testament to countless crayon marks and sticky fingers, reflected the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the large, stained-glass windows of Miss Elara Nightingale's kindergarten classroom at the Whispering Pines Elementary School.  Crayon shavings, like fallen confetti, littered the worn wooden tables.  A faint, sweet aroma of cinnamon and gingerbread hung in the air, a lingering reminder of the holiday crafts they'd completed just days before.  Miss Elara Nightingale, a woman with eyes the colour of warm honey and hair the shade of spun gold, surveyed her charges.  The room, usually a vibrant hub of noise and activity, was unusually quiet.  A single, tear-streaked face, belonging to a small boy named Leo, caught her eye. He sat slumped in his chair, clutching a small, broken wooden soldier.
