The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Hayes's instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a name that somehow felt too poetic for the sterile environment, meticulously polished the patient's molars.  Her hands, surprisingly delicate given the task, moved with a practiced grace that belied the years of meticulous training. Outside, the city thrummed with a life she rarely felt part of.  The rhythmic thud of a distant subway car, the distant wail of a siren, the distant murmur of conversations â€“ all were muted by the sterile, hushed confines of the office.

Amelia worked in a small, but comfortably appointed, dental practice nestled in the heart of a bustling downtown district.  Tall windows overlooking a busy intersection offered glimpses of the city's relentless energy. The smell of antiseptic and lingering mint mingled with the faint scent of burnt coffee from the nearby diner.  A small vase of artificial lilies sat on the reception desk, their plastic perfection a stark contrast to the reality of the human mouths she cared for.  Her workspace, a meticulously organized haven within the clinic, was her sanctuary. A small, framed print of a stylized, intricate, floral design, a gift from a long-forgotten grandfather, was the only personal touch in her otherwise professional space.  The clock ticked, relentless in its measured pace, as Amelia waited for the next patient.
