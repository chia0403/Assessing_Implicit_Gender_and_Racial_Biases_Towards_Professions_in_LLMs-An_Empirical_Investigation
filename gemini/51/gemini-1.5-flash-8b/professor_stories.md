Professor Eleanor Vance, renowned astrophysicist and head of the theoretical cosmology department at the University of Kepler, stared out the panoramic window of her office.  The city of Aethelgard, sprawling beneath a bruised twilight sky, was a tapestry woven from shimmering lights and the faint, smoky haze of industrial exhaust.  Aethelgard, a metropolis perched precariously on the edge of a massive, dormant caldera, held an unsettling beauty.  The once-powerful volcano, now a silent guardian, loomed like a slumbering behemoth against the horizon.  Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, traced the jagged peaks with her fingertip.  Tonight's readings were off.  Critically off.  And that, she knew, pointed towards something far more significant than a simple instrument malfunction.  The readings from the observatory on Mount Somnus, nestled deep within the caldera's shadowed slopes, were inconsistent, and not in a predictable way.  Tonight, they pulsed with a strange, rhythmic tremor, an almostâ€¦ heartbeat.
