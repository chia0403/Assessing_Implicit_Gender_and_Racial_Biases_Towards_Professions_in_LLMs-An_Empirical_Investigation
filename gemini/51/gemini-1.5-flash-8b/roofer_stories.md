The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes and tugging at the frayed edges of his wool cap.  He gripped the rusty iron railing, his calloused hands clinging to the skeletal structure of the old Victorian mansion like barnacles to a ship's hull.  Below, the cobblestones of the ancient town square, slick with a thin sheen of ice, shimmered like fractured glass in the fading afternoon light.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a swirling vortex of debris â€“ fallen leaves, splintered wood, and the forlorn remnants of a forgotten autumn.  Elias Thorne, roofer extraordinaire (though the "extraordinaire" was a whisper more than a shout in this sleepy, rain-drenched town), surveyed the damage.  This wasn't just another roof; it was the roof of Blackwood Manor, a place whispered about in hushed tones and shrouded in a history as thick and impenetrable as the layers of grey slate clinging to its decaying timbers.
