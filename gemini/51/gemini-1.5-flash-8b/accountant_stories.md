The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers and Needles" accounting firm cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Peabody’s meticulously organized desk.  Stacks of invoices, meticulously alphabetized and color-coded, towered around her, each a miniature testament to the meticulous nature that had defined her life since childhood.  Amelia, a junior accountant at the firm, was, by all accounts, efficient.  She was the embodiment of order in a chaotic world.  But tonight, even the perfectly calibrated balance of her world felt askew.

The setting:  A nondescript office building on the outskirts of a rapidly expanding suburb, the kind where the scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the acrid tang of exhaust fumes.  The windows, smudged with grime, offered a glimpse of a burgeoning metropolis, its lights a dizzying array of promise and peril.  Within the quiet confines of "Numbers and Needles", though, the only promise visible was the promise of more work, and the only peril, the looming deadlines of the end-of-quarter reports.  Amelia, however, had a sense of something more unsettling than a mere deadline creeping up.  It was a feeling, subtle but insistent, that the numbers she meticulously tallied were hiding something more significant, something more… *wrong*.
