The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez’s own pulse.  It was a sound she’d grown accustomed to, a constant companion during the long, often stressful shifts she endured.  Tonight, however, the usual hum felt sharper, more insistent, reflecting the nervous energy coiled tight in her stomach.  The air, usually thick with the scent of antiseptic and faintly metallic blood, was heavy with something else tonight – a palpable sense of dread that clung to the sterile white walls like a stubborn stain.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with five years of experience under her belt and calloused fingertips to prove it, found herself bracing against an unease she couldn't quite explain.  The usual pre-midnight lull in the lab was absent, replaced by an unsettling quiet broken only by the occasional distant cough and the whisper of hurried footsteps in the hallway.
