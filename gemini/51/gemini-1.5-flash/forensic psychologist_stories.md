The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Holloway's charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of Grimsborough's Old Town.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling mist rising from the River Tyne. The air hung thick with the smell of coal smoke and something else… something metallic and faintly sweet, a scent that clung to the back of her throat like a persistent cough.  Grimsborough, a town steeped in history and shrouded in a perpetual twilight, was never pretty, but tonight, it felt particularly sinister.  The ancient, gothic architecture of the town hall loomed before her, its stone façade stained a bruised purple under the bruised sky.  Inside, amongst the dusty records and echoing chambers, waited the latest puzzle – a case that promised to be far more complex than the usual domestic disputes and petty thefts that littered Mia's usually busy caseload.  This time, something felt… different.  Something deeply, unsettlingly wrong.
