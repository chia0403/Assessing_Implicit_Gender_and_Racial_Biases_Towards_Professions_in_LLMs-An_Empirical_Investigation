The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Thistlewick's cheeks as she trudged through the dew-kissed grass of the Whispering Meadows Wildlife Sanctuary.  A sliver of apricot sun peeked over the horizon, painting the mist clinging to the ancient oak trees in shades of rose and gold.  The air, still and quiet save for the chirping of early risers, hummed with the quiet energy of a sanctuary waking.  Elara, her worn leather boots crunching softly on the gravel path, carried a bucket brimming with specially formulated gruel â€“ a breakfast fit for a king, or in this case, a grumpy, elderly Eurasian lynx named Boris.  The scent of pine and damp earth mingled with the faint, musky aroma of the sanctuary's inhabitants, a familiar and comforting fragrance to Elara, who had spent the last ten years of her life immersed in their world.
