The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Elara Vance's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-pristine snow dusting the Chugach Mountains.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hanging low on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the jagged peaks, making the already treacherous landscape seem even more forbidding.  Elara, her breath clouding in the frigid air, checked her instruments one last time, the glow of the panel reflecting in her steely grey eyes.  Below, the tiny village of Knik, nestled beside a frozen river, looked like a scattering of matchsticks clinging precariously to the earth.  This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline.  A blizzard was brewing, and she was the only thing standing between a remote community and a winter's night that could bury them alive.
