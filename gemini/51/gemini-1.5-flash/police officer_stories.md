The salt spray stung Officer Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the battered patrol car onto the narrow, winding road that clung precariously to the cliff edge.  Below, the churning Pacific roared, a relentless grey beast gnawing at the base of the towering, wind-whipped cypress trees.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and impending rain, carried the mournful cry of gulls – a sound that, tonight, felt more like a mournful dirge than a natural occurrence.  The tiny coastal town of Seabrook, usually a sleepy haven for retirees and artists, was cloaked in an unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic crash of waves and the frantic beat of Amy’s heart.  This wasn’t a routine call.  This felt… different.  The dispatcher's clipped voice, barely audible over the static, still echoed in her ears: "Possible homicide.  Lone survivor.  Address: 17 Mariner's Lane."  Amy gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  Mariner's Lane.  That was practically on the edge of nowhere.
