The fluorescent lights of Millbrook & Sons hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's otherwise silent existence.  Penelope, or Penny as everyone – except the terrifyingly formal Mr. Millbrook himself – insisted on calling her, sat perched on her ergonomic chair, its supportive curves doing little to alleviate the ache in her lower back.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of her reception area, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and the chipped paint on the ancient mahogany desk. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a perfume uniquely Millbrook & Sons, a prestigious – yet undeniably dusty – law firm nestled in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying, yet still undeniably gritty, corner of Southwark.
