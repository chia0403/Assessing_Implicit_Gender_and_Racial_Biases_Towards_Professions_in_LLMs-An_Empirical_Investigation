The chill wind, a serrated knife slicing through the already thin air, whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's apron as he hauled a side of beef onto the butcher's block.  Snow, fine as powdered sugar, clung to the rough-hewn timbers of his shop, "Butterfield's Meats," a name painted in faded, crimson lettering above the door.  The tiny hamlet of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Blackwood Forest, lay draped in a pristine, unsettling silence – a silence broken only by the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* of Barty's cleaver, a sound as familiar and comforting to him as his own heartbeat. The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and freshly cut meat, held a sharper, almost metallic tang – the scent of impending winter and… something else. Something unsettling.
