The fluorescent hum of the server room was Amelia Hernandez's lullaby.  Amelia, a woman whose neatly-braided dark hair perpetually escaped its confines, tapped a restless finger against the cool metal of a rack, the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* a counterpoint to the whirring fans and the low thrum of power.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and stale coffee, hung heavy in the cavernous space, lit only by the blinking LEDs of countless servers – a constellation of digital stars in their own silent, humming galaxy. Tonight, however, the galaxy felt a little… off.  The usual predictable rhythm of the servers, a comforting symphony of processing power, was punctuated by an unsettling stutter, a hiccup in the smooth flow of data that sent a chill down Amelia's spine.  This wasn't a routine network glitch; this felt… personal.
