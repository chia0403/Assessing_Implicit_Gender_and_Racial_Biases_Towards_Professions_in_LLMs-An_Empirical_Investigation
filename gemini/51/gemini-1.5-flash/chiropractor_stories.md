The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her seaside clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless Atlantic gale, howled a mournful tune around the clapboard building, tossing strands of her dark auburn hair across her cheeks.  Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks just below the cliff edge.  Her clinic, "Coastal Chiropractic," perched precariously on the edge of the dramatic Cornish coastline, was more than just a place of business; it was a refuge, a sanctuary carved from the wild beauty of the land â€“ and a constant reminder of the precarious balance between strength and fragility, a balance she understood intimately, both in the human body and in the face of nature's raw power.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised purple and orange, cast long shadows across the swirling grey sea, painting the scene in hues of impending storm.  Inside, the comforting scent of lavender and warming essential oils offered a stark contrast to the untamed ferocity outside.
