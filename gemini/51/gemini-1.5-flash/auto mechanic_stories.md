The wrench slipped, a metallic shriek echoing in the cavernous gloom of Gus’s Garage.  Grease, thick and black as midnight, clung to everything – the worn workbench, the overflowing parts bins, even to the stubble dusting Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s chin.  The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt oil, gasoline, and something vaguely floral – Amy’s attempt at masking the pervasive aroma with a plug-in air freshener shaped like a vintage Ford Mustang.  Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, turning the small town of Dust Devil, Arizona into a shimmering mirage.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a half-disassembled engine block, its innards a baffling puzzle of pistons, rods, and camshafts.  This was Amy’s domain, her kingdom of grease and grit, a place where the roar of engines drowned out the whispers of a past she’d rather forget.
