The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Elara Vance, whipping her parka tighter against her frame.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her exposed cheeks.  The research station, a squat, metallic behemoth clinging precariously to the ice shelf, groaned under the strain of the gale, a sound that vibrated through Elara’s very bones.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of ozone and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that did little to combat the pervasive chill that seemed to seep from the very fabric of the Antarctic landscape.  Elara, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the laser rangefinder strapped to her chest.  Tonight, the aurora borealis painted the sky in a breathtaking, terrifying display of emerald and sapphire, a fitting backdrop for the work that awaited her – work that could rewrite the understanding of the universe, or shatter it completely.
