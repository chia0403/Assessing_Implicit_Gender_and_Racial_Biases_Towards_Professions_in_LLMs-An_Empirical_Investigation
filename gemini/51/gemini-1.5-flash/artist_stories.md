The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's face as she wrestled the easel into position against the howling Breton wind.  The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, carved furious shapes into the churning grey sea before her, a canvas far grander and more chaotic than anything she could ever hope to reproduce on her own.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and something else, something almost metallic, a tang that hinted at the hidden coves and jagged rocks that ringed the dramatic coastline of Île de Batz.  Her small, rented cottage, barely clinging to the cliffside, seemed to lean precariously into the storm, a miniature defiant against the elemental fury of the Atlantic.  Inside, amidst a delightful chaos of paint tubes, brushes, and half-finished canvases, lay the warmth of a crackling fire and the promise of a bottle of warming cider – a stark contrast to the raw, untamed beauty that awaited her outside.  This was her sanctuary, her inspiration, the very heart of her art.
