The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow, steady erosion of Eleanor's patience.  It was the last day before summer break, a day traditionally celebrated by the cacophony of untamed children, the sweet scent of impending freedom, and the terrifying weight of grading papers that would linger long after the last giggling student had sprinted out the door.  The air in Room 207 of Oakwood Elementary hummed with a frenetic energy, a buzzing hive of barely contained chaos. Crayon shavings littered the carpet like confetti from a particularly rambunctious party, and the scent of glue, desperation, and impending thunderstorms hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the late May sun beat down on the playground, its warmth a stark contrast to the simmering tension within the classroom walls.  Eleanor, however, remained stubbornly calm, a fortress of composure built on years of experience and an alarmingly high caffeine intake.
