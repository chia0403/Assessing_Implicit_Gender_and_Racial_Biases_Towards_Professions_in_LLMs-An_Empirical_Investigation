The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, almost maddening soundtrack to the oppressive afternoon heat.  Amelia Jean Dupre, a woman whose name hinted at both Southern grace and a stubborn streak a mile wide, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand.  The hand, currently clutching a lukewarm bottle of water, was tanned and strong from years spent navigating the swampy backroads and overgrown lots that made up a significant portion of her real estate portfolio in the bayou parish of Terrebonne.  Her crisp white linen pants, a defiant choice against the humidity, were already clinging to her legs.  Ahead, the dilapidated Victorian house – its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, its porch sagging precariously – loomed, a ghostly silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  This was not Amelia Jean’s typical million-dollar listing; this was a fixer-upper, a challenge, a potential goldmine – or a colossal headache.  It all depended on what lurked beneath the surface, both literally and figuratively.
