The midday sun beat down on Amelia Grace Hawthorne's meticulously organized desk, the glare reflecting harshly off the Pantone colour swatches meticulously arranged like tiny, vibrant soldiers.  Amelia, a graphic designer with a reputation for both brilliance and a slightly terrifying attention to detail, squinted at her screen.  The air in her studio apartment, perched precariously on the seventh floor of a crumbling brownstone in Brooklyn's DUMBO neighbourhood, hung thick with the scent of strong coffee and the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of linseed oil from the vintage drafting table nestled in the corner.  Beyond the expansive window, the Manhattan skyline shimmered, a hazy masterpiece of steel and glass, ironically less aesthetically pleasing, in Amelia's opinion, than the perfectly imperfect chaos of her own workspace.  Today, however, even the captivating view couldn't distract her from the looming deadline: the redesign of the city's iconic subway map.  A project both exhilarating and terrifying in its scope.
