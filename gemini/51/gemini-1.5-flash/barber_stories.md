The scent of Bay Rum and old leather hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, who sat perched on his worn barber's chair, the worn leather groaning a soft protest under his weight.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb swinging above, danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of his shop, "Barty's Blades," on the cobbled backstreet of Grimsborough.  Grimsborough itself was a town clinging to the edge of modernity, its Victorian architecture crumbling gracefully beneath a sky perpetually dusted with coal smoke.  Barty, with his own thinning, silver-streaked hair neatly trimmed, looked as much a part of the town's aged fabric as the chipped paint on his shopfront.  He’d been cutting hair in this very chair for fifty years, witnessing the town's slow decline and, occasionally, its fleeting triumphs, all reflected in the faces that sat before him. Today, however, a different kind of tension hung heavier than the Bay Rum.  A tension that wasn't just the usual Grimsborough grit, but something… sharper.
