The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the biting November wind rattling the stained-glass windows of "Petals & Promises."  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, owner and sole proprietor of the most beloved flower shop in the quaint coastal town of Seabrook, hummed a tuneless melody as she pruned the unruly fronds of a particularly stubborn fern.  Rain lashed against the panes, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon, turning the cobbled street outside into a glistening, grey river.  The only other sound, besides the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears, was the gentle crackling of the fire in the hearth, casting a warm, flickering glow across the vibrant colours of the autumnal arrangements that lined the shelves.  Amelia, her hands stained a delicate shade of violet from handling the irises, glanced at the grandfather clock ticking away in the corner.  It was almost closing time, and the only customer she'd had all day was Mrs. Gable, whoâ€™d bought a single, rather pathetic-looking chrysanthemum.
