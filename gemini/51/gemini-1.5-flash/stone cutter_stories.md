The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the valley, a lonely counterpoint to the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks.  Dust, the colour of sun-baked earth and tinged with the grey of the stone itself, motes in the afternoon light, clung to the roughspun tunic of Elias Thorne. Elias, a man carved by the same relentless hand that shaped the mountains around him, hunched over his work, his brow furrowed in concentration.  He was perched precariously on a scaffolding of rough-hewn timbers, high above the floor of the quarry, a dizzying drop to the rocky bottom far below.  The quarry itself, a gaping maw in the side of the mountain, seemed to breathe, its shadowed depths exuding a chill even on this summer's day.  The air tasted of damp earth and the sharp, metallic tang of freshly cut stone.  Elias, his calloused hands moving with practiced ease, was shaping a tombstone, its blank surface a stark testament to the transience of life in the harsh, beautiful landscape of the Cairngorm mountains.
