The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Spa, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of Elara Vance’s own heart.

Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, casting an unsteady, almost desperate glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Seabrook’s quaint, seaside promenade.  Tonight, however, Seabrook felt anything but quaint. It felt…ominous.
