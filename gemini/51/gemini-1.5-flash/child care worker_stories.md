The chipped paint of the "Little Lambs Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overgrown lawn like a sad confetti.  A rusty swing set groaned in the mournful October wind, its chains whispering secrets only the sparrows understood.  Inside, however, a different kind of quiet reigned â€“ the hushed, anticipatory stillness just before the tiny tornadoes of toddlers descended.  Twenty-three-year-old Elara Jean Worthington, her bright red cardigan a defiant splash of color against the muted grey of the building, hummed softly to herself as she arranged miniature pumpkins and gourds on a low table. The scent of cinnamon and apples, a desperate attempt to combat the ever-present aroma of slightly-off-brand baby wipes, hung heavy in the air.  Elara, though perpetually tired and slightly underpaid, felt a familiar warmth bloom in her chest.  It wasn't just the impending arrival of her charges; it was the quiet, potent magic of a daycare on a crisp autumn morning.
