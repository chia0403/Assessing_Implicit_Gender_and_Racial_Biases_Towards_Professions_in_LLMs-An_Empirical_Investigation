The scent of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  It clung to the plush, velvet curtains of her salon, "Shear Indulgence," a haven tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans.  Gas lamps flickered outside, casting a warm, honeyed glow on the wrought-iron balconies that draped over the buildings like skeletal arms reaching for the star-dusted sky.  Inside, however, the air throbbed with a different kind of energy – the low hum of conversation, the rhythmic snip of shears, and the faint, almost imperceptible, click-clack of Sera’s own perfectly manicured nails tapping against the polished mahogany of her workstation.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos was punctuated by an unnerving silence.  A silence heavier than the humid New Orleans air, a silence that spoke of secrets whispered in the shadows and a storm brewing just beyond the gauzy lace of the salon windows.
