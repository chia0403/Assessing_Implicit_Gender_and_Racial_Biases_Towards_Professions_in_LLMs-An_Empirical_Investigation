The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to Lieutenant Elias Thorne's throat, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and burning resin, hung heavy and still over the parched hills surrounding the small, isolated town of Havenwood.

Tonight, it was a stand of ancient redwoods, their towering silhouettes now skeletal against the angry orange glow of the inferno that threatened to consume everything in its path.  The crackling and popping of the flames provided a terrifying counterpoint to the frantic crackle of the emergency radio in Elias's hand.  This wasn't just another brush fire; this felt… different.
