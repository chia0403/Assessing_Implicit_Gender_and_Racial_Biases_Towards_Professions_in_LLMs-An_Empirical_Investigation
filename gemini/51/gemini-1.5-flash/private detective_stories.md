The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, a rhythmic percussion that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something acrid and metallic that clung to the back of her throat.  Izzy, a private investigator with a reputation built on grit and a penchant for trouble, sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle shop across the alley casting long, distorted shadows across her face.  Outside, the neon-drenched streets of Chinatown, San Francisco, throbbed with a nocturnal energy – a cacophony of honking taxis, chattering voices, and the sizzle of woks from countless late-night eateries.  The city, usually a vibrant tapestry of life, felt tonight like a brooding beast, its secrets whispered on the wind.
