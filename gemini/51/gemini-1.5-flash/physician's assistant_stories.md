The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around the clapboard walls of the clinic, rattling the single-paned windows and whistling through gaps in the poorly sealed frame.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and woodsmoke, a peculiar blend that perfectly encapsulated the remote village of Kiana.

Outside, the relentless snow fell, burying the already isolated settlement deeper beneath its icy shroud. The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of a failing heart echoing from the examination room.
