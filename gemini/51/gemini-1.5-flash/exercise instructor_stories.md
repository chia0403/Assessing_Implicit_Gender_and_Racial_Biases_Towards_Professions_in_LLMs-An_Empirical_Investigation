The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's shoulders as she adjusted the mirrored sunglasses perched atop her head. Sweat, already beading on her forehead, reflected the dazzling turquoise of the ocean stretching before her.  Amelia, a woman sculpted from years of tireless devotion to fitness, surveyed her early morning class assembled on the sun-drenched sands of Clearwater Beach.

The rhythmic crash of waves provided a surprisingly calming counterpoint to the chirping of unseen birds and the distant rumble of a passing jet ski.  Today's class, however, felt different. A subtle tension hung in the air, thicker than the humidity clinging to Ameliaâ€™s skin, a premonition of something more than just a challenging workout.  The usual cheerful chatter was muted, replaced by a nervous energy that Amelia, with her keen eye for body language, could feel radiating from every participant.
