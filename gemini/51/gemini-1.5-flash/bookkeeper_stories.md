The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the ledgers stacked on Amelia Featherstonehaugh’s mahogany desk.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her office, a rhythmic drumming that competed with the scratch of her quill pen against parchment.  The year was 1888, and the air in the cramped, book-lined room above Mr. Grimshaw’s apothecary on Bleak Street hung thick with the scent of dried herbs and something else… something faintly metallic, a scent that Amelia, despite her meticulous nature, couldn’t quite place.  Outside, the fog clung to the cobbled streets of Whitechapel like a shroud, swallowing the gas lamps whole and leaving only a muted, ominous glow.  Amelia, a woman of precise habits and even more precise accounting, found herself inexplicably unsettled. This was no ordinary night in Whitechapel.
