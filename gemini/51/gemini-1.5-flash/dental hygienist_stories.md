The sterile scent of antiseptic and the low hum of the suction machine were the soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday morning.  Sunlight, fractured by the blinds of Dr. Albright's office, painted stripes across the polished chrome of her instrument tray.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with hands as steady as a surgeon's and a smile that could disarm the most needle-phobic patient, meticulously organized her tools. Outside, the bustling city of San Francisco thrummed with life – the distant wail of a siren, the chatter of commuters, the insistent honk of a taxi – a world completely muted within the soundproof walls of the pristine dental practice nestled on the edge of Nob Hill.  Today's schedule was packed: Mrs. Gable's annual cleaning, young Timmy O'Malley's first visit, and then… Mr. Silas Blackwood, a notoriously difficult patient whose appointments usually ended in a flurry of frustrated sighs and a chipped bicuspid for Amelia to repair.
