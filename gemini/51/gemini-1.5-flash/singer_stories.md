The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's elbows as she stared at her reflection.  The harsh fluorescent light of the cramped bathroom in the back of O'Malley's Irish Pub mercilessly revealed the faint smudges of mascara under her tired eyes and the slight tremor in her lower lip.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the lingering scent of sweat from the night's boisterous crowd – a scent that, strangely, felt more familiar and comforting than the lavender and rose of her own sparsely furnished apartment.  Outside, the rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the pub, a relentless percussion mimicking the relentless rhythm pounding in Sera's chest.  Tonight's gig had been… a disaster.  Not a complete catastrophe, mind you, but certainly far from the triumphant return she'd envisioned after a year-long hiatus.
