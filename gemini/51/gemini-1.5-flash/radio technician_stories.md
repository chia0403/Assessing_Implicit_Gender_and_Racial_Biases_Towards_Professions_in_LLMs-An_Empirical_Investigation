The salt-laced wind howled a mournful tune around the skeletal remains of the old lighthouse, rattling the corrugated iron shack where Elias Thorne, radio technician extraordinaire (or at least, that’s what his business card claimed), hunched over his workbench.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks below punctuated the crackle and hiss emanating from the ancient shortwave radio perched precariously on a stack of rusty spanners.  Elias, his face illuminated by the flickering green glow of the oscilloscope, was battling a particularly stubborn signal, a ghostly whisper from a research vessel somewhere lost in the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic.  The air hung thick with the smell of ozone, damp wood, and the lingering tang of fish – a familiar perfume to Elias, who had spent the last five years alone on this windswept islet, a forgotten outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the world.
