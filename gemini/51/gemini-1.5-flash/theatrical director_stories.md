The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Seraphina “Sera” Blackwood’s hand, mirroring the tremor in her own stomach.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of Blackwood Manor, each gust a frantic percussion accompanying the tempest brewing within her.  The manor, a crumbling testament to a once-grand theatrical dynasty, stood silhouetted against the bruised purple sky, its shadowy turrets clawing at the storm clouds like skeletal fingers.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of damp velvet, aging wood, and the faint, lingering perfume of a forgotten actress – a perfume that, to Sera, smelled suspiciously like impending disaster.  This wasn't the quiet, contemplative space she'd envisioned for crafting her latest production, a daring adaptation of "Macbeth" set in the roaring twenties, but the reality of inheriting the family estate – and its accompanying legacy of theatrical triumphs and tragic failures – was proving far more dramatic than any play she could ever write.
