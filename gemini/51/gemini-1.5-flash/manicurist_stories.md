The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails chipped a little more with every frustrated sigh escaping Esmelise “Esme” Vanderlyn’s lips.  Rain lashed against the window of her tiny salon, blurring the already fading neon sign that promised “Mani-Pedis & More!” – a “more” that, lately, felt more like “mounting debt and existential dread.” Esme, her usually vibrant fuchsia polish smudged and dull, stared at the half-finished, glittery ombré manicure on her client’s hand, a masterpiece that felt as tragically unappreciated as a sunset in a coal mine. The air hung thick with the scent of acetone, regret, and the faint, lingering aroma of last night’s burnt popcorn – a testament to her disastrous attempt at a relaxing evening.  The only other sound besides the relentless rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient, slightly erratic clock above the reception desk, each second a mocking reminder of time slipping away.
