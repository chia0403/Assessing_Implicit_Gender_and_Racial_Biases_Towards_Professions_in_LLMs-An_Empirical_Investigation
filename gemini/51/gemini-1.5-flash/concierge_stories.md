The rain hammered against the gothic windows of the Blackwood Hotel, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the otherwise hushed opulence of the lobby.  Water cascaded down the leaded panes, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow illuminating the polished mahogany reception desk.

Gus, the concierge, was the quiet heart of the Blackwood, a repository of secrets whispered in hushed tones and requests uttered with desperate hope. Tonight, however, even the usually chaotic symphony of the hotel – the clinking of ice, the murmur of conversations, the rhythmic thump of a distant elevator – felt muted, subdued by the relentless downpour and the unspoken weight of anticipation clinging to the air like the scent of old leather and damp stone.
