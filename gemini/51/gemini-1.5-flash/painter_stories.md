The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He stood perched on the jagged rocks of Penzance Head, the wind whipping his charcoal-grey hair across his eyes as he wrestled with his easel.  Below him, the Cornish coastline unfolded in a breathtaking panorama of turquoise bays and emerald cliffs, a chaotic symphony of colour that both inspired and intimidated him.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks.  Elias, his fingers stiff with cold despite the thick wool of his gloves, squeezed a fresh dollop of cerulean onto his palette, the vibrant blue a stark contrast to the greys and muted greens dominating the landscape before him.  He was attempting, once again, to capture the untamed spirit of the Cornish coast, a spirit that felt as wild and unpredictable as the sea itself.
