The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  Elias, a master tailor with hands as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and eyes that missed nothing, stood hunched over his workbench in the dimly lit back room of "Thorne & Thread," a shop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, a steady rhythm accompanying the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears.  Outside, the city thrummed with a chaotic energy – the clatter of horse-drawn carts, the shouts of vendors, the distant chime of a church bell – but within the four walls of his workshop, Elias found solace, a quiet sanctuary dedicated to the precise art of transforming cloth into wearable stories.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across bolts of richly coloured silks, velvets, and brocades, a silent testament to the countless garments he had crafted over the years, each one a testament to his skill and unwavering dedication.
