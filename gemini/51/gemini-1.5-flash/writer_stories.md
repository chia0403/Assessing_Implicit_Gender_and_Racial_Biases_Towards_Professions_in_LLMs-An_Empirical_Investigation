The chipped paint of Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s writing desk flaked onto the manuscript spread before her, mirroring the slow, agonizing disintegration of her latest novel.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of her rented cottage, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall.  Below, the Atlantic churned, a restless, grey beast mirroring the turmoil in her own heart.  The cottage, smelling perpetually of damp earth and woodsmoke, offered little comfort; its only true inhabitant, aside from Amelia, was a grumpy ginger cat named Marmalade, currently asleep on a pile of rejected drafts, a furry, orange monument to creative failure.  The relentless wind howled a mournful dirge, a fitting soundtrack to Amelia’s current state of writer’s block, a condition that felt less like a temporary impasse and more like a life sentence.
