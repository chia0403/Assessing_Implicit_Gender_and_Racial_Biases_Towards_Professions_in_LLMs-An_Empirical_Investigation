The aroma of almond extract and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to the starched white apron of Seraphina "Sera"  Bellweather.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of "Sweet Surrender," danced in the shafts of light that sliced through the otherwise dimly lit shop.  Sweet Surrender wasn't exactly *surrendering* to anything except perhaps the relentless march of time – its faded floral wallpaper and chipped Formica counters spoke of a bygone era, a time when buttercream roses were considered the height of sophistication, not the quaintly old-fashioned.  But Sera, with her nimble fingers and a talent for transforming ordinary sponge into extraordinary works of art, kept the tiny bakery afloat, one meticulously piped petal at a time.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the blare of horns, the rumble of buses – faded to a muted hum, swallowed by the quiet concentration Sera poured into her current project: a three-tiered wedding cake, its ivory frosting awaiting the delicate brushstrokes of her design.
