The salt spray kissed Amelia Katherine Finch's face as she hauled the last crate of day-old sourdough onto the rickety dock.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and diesel, was punctuated by the insistent cries of gulls overhead.  Amelia, her flour-dusted apron flapping in the stiff sea breeze, surveyed the chaotic scene of Salty Cove Harbour.  Fishing boats bobbed like restless seals, their hulls scarred with the tales of countless battles against the unforgiving Atlantic.  The aroma of frying fish and escaping steam from the nearby fish and chips shop mingled with the pervasive smell of the sea, creating a pungent, uniquely coastal perfume that Amelia, chef and owner of "The Galley," found utterly intoxicating.  Her tiny, ramshackle restaurant, perched precariously on the edge of the harbour, awaited her culinary magic.  Today's special:  lobster bisque, made with the freshest catch of the morning, a secret family recipe, and a whole lot of hope.
