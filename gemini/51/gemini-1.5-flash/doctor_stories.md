The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Reed as she wrestled the recalcitrant door of the dilapidated clinic open.  Ice crystals, sharp as needles, clung to her eyelashes, obscuring the already limited visibility.

The howling wind seemed to mock her as she stepped inside, the warmth of the wood-burning stove a welcome but insufficient shield against the brutal chill that permeated everything.
