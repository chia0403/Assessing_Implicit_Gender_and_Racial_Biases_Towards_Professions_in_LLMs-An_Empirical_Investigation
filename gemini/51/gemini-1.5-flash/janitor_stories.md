The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Elias Thorne's worn-out sneakers on the polished linoleum.  Elias, a man whose life had the same predictable, slightly grimy sheen as the floors he scrubbed, pushed his mop bucket across the vast, echoing expanse of the Grand Galleria.  Midnight had long since passed, leaving the opulent shopping mall a ghostly cathedral of marble and glass, its designer boutiques slumbering behind locked doors, their mannequins frozen in silent, expectant poses.  The only other sounds besides Eliasâ€™s work were the distant whirring of the ventilation system and the occasional, unsettling creak of the building settling under its own immense weight.  The air, thick with the lingering scent of expensive perfume and forgotten coffee, held a chill that seeped into Elias's bones, despite his thick, threadbare sweater. This was his kingdom, a glittering kingdom of silence and discarded receipts, a kingdom he ruled alone under the cold, indifferent gaze of the security cameras.
