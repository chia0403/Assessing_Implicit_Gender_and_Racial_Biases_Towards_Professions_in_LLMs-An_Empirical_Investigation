The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal grey Honda Civic, baking the vinyl seats until they radiated a low hum of trapped heat.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, despite the aggressively blasting air conditioning.  Amelia, a woman whose meticulously-applied lipstick never budged, even under the most stressful circumstances, dabbed at her brow with a tissue, the faint scent of vanilla and sunscreen clinging to it.  She adjusted the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of her own determined gaze, framed by her dark, neatly pulled-back braid.  Ahead, the shimmering expanse of the Gulf of Mexico stretched towards the horizon, a postcard-perfect backdrop to the decidedly less picturesque scene unfolding before her: a ramshackle beachfront shack, practically swallowed by overgrown bougainvillea, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. This was her latest client's property – or what was left of it, judging by the ominous splintered wood sticking out at precarious angles.  Amelia sighed.  Another hurricane claim.  Another long day in paradise.
