The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind rattling the windowpanes of Madame Evangeline Moreau’s atelier.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the beams like tiny, golden fairies.  Evangeline herself, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the secrets embroidered onto her exquisite gowns, hummed a low, lilting tune as she meticulously stitched a delicate pearl onto a bodice of the palest blush silk.  Her nimble fingers, gnarled with years of painstaking work, moved with a practiced grace that belied the weariness etched around her kind, hazel eyes. Outside, the Parisian streets churned with the usual chaos – the rumble of carriages, the cries of street vendors, the hurried footsteps of city dwellers – but within the walls of her small, cluttered shop on Rue de Seine, a serene calm reigned, a sanctuary dedicated to the art of creating breathtaking beauty.
