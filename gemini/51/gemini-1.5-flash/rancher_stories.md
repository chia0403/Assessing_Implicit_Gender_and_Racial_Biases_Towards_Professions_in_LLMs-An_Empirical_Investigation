The wind, a rasping, gravelly voice, whispered secrets across the parched earth of the Devil's Backbone ranch.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red dirt, danced a frantic jig across the cracked plains, mimicking the turmoil churning inside Silas “Si” Blackwood.  Si, a man carved from the same stubborn granite that formed the mesa behind his ranch house, squinted at the setting sun, its fiery hues mirroring the anger that simmered beneath his calm exterior.  The air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and the metallic tang of impending rain – a rain that was desperately needed, but a rain that felt as distant and elusive as hope itself.  His weathered hands, calloused and strong, tightened around the brim of his Stetson, the worn leather creaking a soft counterpoint to the wind’s harsh song.  The year was 1937, and the Dust Bowl had claimed a significant portion of Devil's Backbone, leaving behind only the ghosts of what once thrived.
