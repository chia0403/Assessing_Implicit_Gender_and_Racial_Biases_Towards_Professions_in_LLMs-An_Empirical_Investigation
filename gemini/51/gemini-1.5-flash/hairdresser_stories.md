The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a strangely comforting perfume unique to "Shear Perfection," Aurelia "Reli" Davenport's salon.  Rain lashed against the oversized bay window overlooking Bleecker Street, blurring the already chaotic tapestry of yellow cabs, hurried pedestrians, and overflowing trash cans into a hazy Impressionist painting.  Inside, however, the chaos was contained, a controlled explosion of vibrant colours – the fuchsia of Reli’s own meticulously-styled bob, the turquoise of the vintage barber chair, and the kaleidoscope of hair dye tubes lining the shelves.  Reli herself, a whirlwind of controlled energy in a denim apron stained with an indeterminate mix of hair products and espresso, was currently wrestling with a particularly stubborn tangle in Ms. Eleanor Vance's platinum blonde extensions.
