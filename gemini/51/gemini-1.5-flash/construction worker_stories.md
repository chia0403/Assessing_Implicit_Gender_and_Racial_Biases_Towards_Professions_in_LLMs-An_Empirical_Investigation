The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's calloused hands as he wrestled a recalcitrant steel beam into place.  Above, the skeletal frame of the new Zenith Tower clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, a monument to ambition against the backdrop of a city groaning under its own weight.  Dust, the fine grey grit of demolition and construction, clung to everything â€“ his worn work boots, the threadbare collar of his denim shirt, the stubble shadowing his jaw.  The air hung thick with the smells of diesel fumes, wet concrete, and the faint, metallic tang of blood, a familiar scent on any construction site, a constant reminder of the inherent risk.  Below, the city of Veridia sprawled, a tapestry woven from glittering skyscrapers and shadowy alleys, a testament to both breathtaking progress and crushing inequality.  Elias, a man hardened by years of back-breaking labor and the unforgiving realities of the trade, was a thread in that tapestry, a small, but vital, part of its ongoing, ever-shifting narrative.
