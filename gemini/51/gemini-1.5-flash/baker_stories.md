The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like a damp shroud as she unlocked the bakery doors.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and something faintly floral – probably Mrs. Gable’s lilac bushes across the street –  was pierced by the sharp tang of yeast and the sweeter perfume of simmering apricot jam.  Amy’s “The Golden Crust,” nestled on the edge of the quaint, perpetually drowsy town of Oakhaven, was still cloaked in the velvet darkness of early morning, its windows reflecting the pale, watery light of the rising sun. Inside, the warmth of the ovens battled the morning's bite, creating a hazy, comforting glow that painted the flour-dusted counters in a golden hue.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ancient bread mixer, a constant companion in Amy's life, provided a steady heartbeat to the quiet awakening of the bakery and, by extension, the town itself.
