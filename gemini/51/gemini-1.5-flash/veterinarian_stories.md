The biting wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate open.  Frozen spray from the churning grey sea lashed against her already damp coat, the salty air stinging her cheeks.  Behind her, the battered Land Rover Defender, affectionately nicknamed "Bruiser," groaned in protest, its engine sputtering a final sigh before succumbing to the chill.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The isolated veterinary clinic, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic, felt more like a prison than a sanctuary tonight. The only sound louder than the wind was the mournful cry of gulls, their cries echoing the desolate beauty of the rugged Cornish coastline.  The faint, almost imperceptible glow of a single lamp in the distance, marking the tiny village of Porthcurno nestled in the valley below, offered little comfort. Tonight, Amelia was truly alone.
