The fluorescent hum of the emergency room was a constant, throbbing soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's life.  The sterile white walls, reflecting the flickering shadows of the hurried staff, seemed to press in on her, a suffocating blanket of antiseptic and fear.

The rhythmic beep-beep-beep of the heart monitors was a metronome counting down the seconds until another life hung in the balance.  Tonight, the pressure felt particularly heavy.  Outside the emergency room, the city pulsed with a relentless energy, oblivious to the drama unfolding within the sterile, antiseptic sanctuary.
