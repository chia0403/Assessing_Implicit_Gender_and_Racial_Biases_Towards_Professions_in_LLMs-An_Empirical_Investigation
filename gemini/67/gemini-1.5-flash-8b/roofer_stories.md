The biting wind, a relentless claw, tore at the faded crimson shirt of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam.  He clung to the precarious scaffolding, the rhythmic clang of his hammer a lonely counterpoint to the shriek of the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the overgrown lot next door.  Dust devils, swirling miniature tornadoes, danced across the cracked pavement, carrying with them the scent of pine needles and something acrid, almost chemical, that clung to the air like a phantom.  Barty, a roofer by trade, but a wanderer by nature, squinted at the towering edifice before him:  a Victorian mansion, its once-proud facade now crumbling under the relentless onslaught of time and neglect.  Ivy, thick as pythons, draped themselves across the crumbling stone, vying for space with the skeletal remains of overgrown shrubs and withered flowers.  This particular job, the replacement of the missing slate tiles on the north wing, felt especially fraught with danger, a battle not just against the elements but against the shadowed secrets whispered by the house's weathered facade.
