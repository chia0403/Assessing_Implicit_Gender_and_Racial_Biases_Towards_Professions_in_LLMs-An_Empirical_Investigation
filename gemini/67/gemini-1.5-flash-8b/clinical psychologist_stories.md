Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with a practiced calm that masked the perpetual storm brewing within her, stared out the rain-streaked window of her small, cluttered office.  The grey London sky mirrored the leaden weight in her chest.  Autumn had arrived in a flurry of biting wind and relentless drizzle, and with it, a new case that felt heavier than any she'd encountered in her five years at the Priory clinic.

The setting was a stark contrast to the comforting, if slightly sterile, environment of the Priory's modern therapy rooms.  Eleanor's office, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Bloomsbury, was a testament to her own chaotic life. Bookshelves overflowed with texts on trauma, resilience, and the human condition, their spines a chaotic jumble of colours and titles.  A worn leather armchair, stained with the residue of countless coffees and teacups, sat beside a chipped, but lovingly maintained, antique desk.  A single, almost wilted, sunflower in a chipped ceramic vase sat on the desk, a defiant splash of colour amidst the gloom. The air, thick with the scent of old paper and damp earth, seemed to hold its breath. Outside, the relentless drumming of rain was a constant, insistent soundtrack to the quiet desperation within.
