Tonight, the air was thick with a palpable sense of urgency.  Anya knew that whatever was waiting for them at the landing strip, it was of vital importance.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine was the only constant in the howling chaos, the only pulse of sanity in the swirling white madness.
