The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia "Amy"  Ashworth's dental practice hummed, a low, insistent drone that seemed to vibrate through the very porcelain of her drill-sharpening tools.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, mimicking the anxious jitters in Amy's own chest.  It was a Tuesday, not exactly a bustling day, but the air thrummed with a quiet unease.  A single, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the building, a subterranean sigh that seemed to resonate with the anxious thump-thump of her own heart.

The practice, "Ashworth Smiles," was tucked away on a quiet side street in the older, more established section of Oakhaven.  Sunlight barely kissed the grime-streaked, brick facade, its faded paint a testament to years of neglect, of quiet, unassuming business.  The interior, however, boasted a sterile, almost clinical perfection.  Rows of gleaming dental chairs lined the walls, their stainless steel gleaming under the fluorescent lights.  But the pristine surfaces, the meticulously organized drawers, the spotless instruments, did little to soothe Amy's growing sense of dread.  A faint, metallic tang lingered in the air, a scent that usually signaled the end of a long and fruitful day, but today it feltâ€¦wrong.  The silence was heavier than usual.  The silence was the problem.
