Professor Amelia Hawthorne, renowned astrophysicist and curator of the eccentric "Celestial Curiosities" collection at the University of Alderwood, stared out the rain-streaked window of her cluttered office.  The muted grey light of a late autumn afternoon filtered through the grime-coated panes, mirroring the disarray that seemed to have settled in the room around her.

A half-eaten bowl of lukewarm oatmeal sat on a chipped ceramic mug, a testament to a morning spent poring over ancient star charts.  The air, thick with the smell of old paper and damp wool, hung heavy with a sense of impending unease.  Outside, the relentless drizzle hammered against the gothic architecture of the university's oldest building, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic drumming in her own chest.  Today was the day. The day the lost artifact arrived.
