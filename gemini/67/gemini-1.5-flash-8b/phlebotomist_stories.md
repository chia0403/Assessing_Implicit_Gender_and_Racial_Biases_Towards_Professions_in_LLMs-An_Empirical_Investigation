The fluorescent hum of the clinic was a constant, low thrumming, a soundtrack to Amelia Genevieve Blackwood's life.  Sunlight, fractured and weak through the grimy windowpanes, cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile white walls of the blood-drawing room.  Empty coffee cups, their chipped porcelain glistening with condensation, sat forlornly on the stainless steel counter, silent witnesses to countless hurried mornings. Amelia, a phlebotomist with a perpetually weary smile, adjusted the antiseptic wipe, her fingers surprisingly steady despite the tremor that sometimes played in her hands.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of antiseptic, a scent that, despite its pervasiveness, seemed to possess a peculiar kind of familiarity. Today, the familiarity was tinged with dread.  Another day in the quiet hum of the clinic, another day drawing blood, another day closer to the deadline.
