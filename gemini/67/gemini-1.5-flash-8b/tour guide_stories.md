The midday sun beat down on the cobblestones of Piazza Navona, turning the vibrant frescoes on the surrounding buildings into shimmering heat haze.  Dust motes danced in the air, swirling around Amelia Rossi, a tour guide whose name, whispered by the tourists she led, was practically synonymous with the beauty and intrigue of Rome.  Her tailored beige suit, usually a comforting anchor amidst the chaos, felt like a heavy cloak today.  Today, the usual murmur of excited voices – "Oh, look!  St. Agnes in the background!" –  was muted, replaced by a low, almost palpable anxiety. Amelia, with her perfectly coiffed hair and a practiced smile, felt a tremor in her normally steady hand as she adjusted her worn leather satchel.  She was supposed to be leading the group past the Pantheon, but something…off…hung in the air.  The silence was heavy, pregnant with a foreboding that didn't quite match the usual festive Roman afternoon.
