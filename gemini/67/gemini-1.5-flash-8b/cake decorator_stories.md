The air in "The Sugarplum Confectionery" hung thick with the sweet scent of vanilla and almond, a symphony of sugary notes punctuated by the rhythmic whir of a rotary whisk.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace-curtained windows, painted the tiny shop in warm, golden hues, highlighting the vibrant array of frosting colours displayed on shelves.  This was Amelia "Amy"  Buttercup's domain, a place where buttercream dreams took shape and edible art flourished.  Amy, with her meticulously manicured fingernails stained a delicate shade of lavender, expertly sculpted a delicate rose from a cloud of white frosting, the perfect touch to a miniature wedding cake. The soft jingle of the bell above the door signaled a new arrival.
