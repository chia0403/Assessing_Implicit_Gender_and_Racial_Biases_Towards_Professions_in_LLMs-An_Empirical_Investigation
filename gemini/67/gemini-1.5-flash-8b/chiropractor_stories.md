The fluorescent hum of Dr. Amelia Hayes's office buzzed, a low-level thrumming counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of her heels on the linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, slicing through the pale yellow of the waiting room.  A single, wilting fern drooped forlornly in the corner, its once vibrant green now a faded shade of jade.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, lingering aroma of burnt coffee, a testament to the long hours Dr. Hayes often spent hunched over her paperwork.  Outside, the city's relentless roar—a symphony of honking taxis, screeching brakes, and distant sirens—seemed to seep into the quiet sanctuary, a constant reminder of the world she had chosen to leave behind.  Amelia, or "Amy" as she preferred, traced the chipped paint on her desk with a weary fingertip.  Today was shaping up to be another typical Wednesday.
