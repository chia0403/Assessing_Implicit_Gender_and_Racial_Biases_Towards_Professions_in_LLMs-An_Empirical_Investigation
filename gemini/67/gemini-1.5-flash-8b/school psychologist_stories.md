The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic rustling of papers and the muffled shouts emanating from the hallways.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the anxieties building within Amelia “Amy”  Everett.  Amy, a school psychologist at Riverbend High, was known for her calm demeanor, her ability to navigate the turbulent waters of teenage angst.  But today, even her carefully constructed composure felt inadequate.

The setting was the dimly lit, beige-walled office of Riverbend High School.  Empty coffee cups and crumpled papers littered the cluttered desk, a testament to the sleepless nights and rushed days spent in the relentless pursuit of helping students.  Outside, the sprawling campus, normally vibrant with the rush of teenage life, was enveloped in a melancholic mist.  The scent of damp earth and something indefinably metallic hung heavy in the air. A single, bare bulb in the office ceiling cast harsh shadows over Amy, highlighting the fine lines etched around her tired eyes.  The chipped paint on the walls, a faded shade of what was probably once a cheerful yellow, matched the muted tone of the day.
