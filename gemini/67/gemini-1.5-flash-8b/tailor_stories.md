The clatter of shears slicing through cloth, the soft whisper of needles against fabric, and the faint scent of lavender and beeswax filled the tiny workshop.  Elias Thorne, a tailor of impeccable reputation in the bustling port city of Aethelgard, meticulously measured a length of emerald silk.  The silk, shimmering with an unnatural luminescence, felt strangely warm against his fingertips.  It was a commission unlike any he'd received before, a tapestry of constellations woven into the fabric itself, demanding the utmost care and precision.

Aethelgard, a city perched on the edge of the whispering seas, was a crucible of cultures and trades.  Tall ships, their sails like painted wings, dotted the harbor, their hulls groaning with the weight of exotic goods from distant lands.  The city's narrow cobblestone streets, lined with shops overflowing with silks, spices, and gleaming weaponry, pulsed with a vibrant energy that both attracted and repelled Elias.  He preferred the quiet hum of his workshop, the rhythmic dance of his needle and thread, to the clamor of the marketplace.  But this commission, this extraordinary silk, demanded his full attention. The client, a reclusive mage known only as the Star-Weaver, had insisted on the utmost secrecy, and Elias felt a prickle of unease, a sense of something profound lurking beneath the surface of this seemingly simple task.  He had a feeling this wasn't just a piece of clothing.
