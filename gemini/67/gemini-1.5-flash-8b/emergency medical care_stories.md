The biting wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes's coat around her legs as she scrambled up the steep, gravel path leading to the remote cabin nestled amongst the towering pines.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, tasted of impending snow.  The radio crackled in her pocket, static swallowing the dispatcher's frantic voice.  Another avalanche.  This time, in the Whispering Glades, a notoriously treacherous area where rescue teams rarely ventured.  Her boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step echoing eerily in the silent woods.  The only other sound was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her heart, a frantic drumbeat against her ribs.  She was a paramedic, yes, but more than that – she was a daughter of the mountains, raised on stories of their unforgiving beauty and brutal power.  This one was different.  This one felt personal.  She’d been sent here many times before, to salvage bits of life from the unforgiving grip of the mountains, but something about this incident—a rumor of a missing teenager, a girl rumored to have been a star student at the local school - resonated deeper.  This one held a whisper of a familiar fear.
