Rain lashed against the plate glass windows of the "Apex Electronics" showroom, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and stale coffee, hung heavy with the unspoken tension of a slow-moving, potentially disastrous sales meeting.  Amy, a seasoned salesperson with a reputation for closing deals faster than a caffeinated cheetah, was staring at the sleek, obsidian-black "Chronos" watch on the display counter.  It was a prototype, whisper-thin, and impossibly expensive.  And it was the key, perhaps, to either a triumphant close or a devastating crash and burn.

The showroom itself was a cathedral of polished chrome and glass, showcasing the latest advancements in timekeeping technology, from intricate pocket watches to futuristic wristbands.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the rain, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, casting an ethereal glow on the futuristic displays.  A hushed murmur of whispers and the low hum of air conditioners filled the space.  Today, however, the usual buzz of excited customers was absent, replaced by the heavy silence of anticipation.  Across from Amy, seated behind a sleek, minimalist desk, sat Mr. Alistair Finch, the notoriously demanding CEO of Chronos Industries.  His expression was unreadable, his eyes glinting with an intensity that both intimidated and intrigued Amy.
