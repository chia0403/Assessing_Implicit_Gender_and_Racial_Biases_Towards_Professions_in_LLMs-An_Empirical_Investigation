Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Grey Gables" law office, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Peabody, Senior Partner.

Outside, the city’s rhythmic pulse of honking horns and distant sirens was swallowed by the torrential downpour.  This was Amelia’s battleground, the place where legal eagles clashed with wounded hopes, and where the whispers of injustice often found a sympathetic, if sometimes weary, ear. Today, however, the air thrummed with a particular, unsettling tension.
