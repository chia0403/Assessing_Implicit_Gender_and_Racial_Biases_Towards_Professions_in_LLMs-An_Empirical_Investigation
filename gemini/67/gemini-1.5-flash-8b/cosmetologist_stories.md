Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Scissors & Smiles," a salon tucked away on a side street of the perpetually overcast city of Ashwood.  The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the icy wind howling outside.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, a cosmetologist with a cascade of raven-black hair that fell past her waist, meticulously sculpted a delicate wave into a client's auburn tresses.  The rhythmic click-click of her shears echoed in the otherwise quiet space, a symphony of artistry in the midst of the storm.  Amelia, despite the salon's shabby charm, possessed a quiet intensity, her eyes, the color of stormy seas, reflecting a world beyond the confines of the salon's chipped enamel walls.  The rhythmic thump of a bass drum from a distant club, usually a welcome soundtrack to the hustle of the evening, tonight felt ominous, a prelude to something moreâ€¦ turbulent.
