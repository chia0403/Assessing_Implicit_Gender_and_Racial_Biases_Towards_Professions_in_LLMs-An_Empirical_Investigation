The fluorescent hum of the abandoned library, a symphony of ghostly whispers in the echoing silence, was the only soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's Tuesday morning.  Dust motes, illuminated by the stark white light, danced in erratic patterns across the polished oak floor, mirroring the chaotic thoughts swirling in Barty's head.  He pushed a worn, metal cart laden with cleaning supplies – a veritable arsenal of disinfectant, sponges, and buckets – through the cavernous stacks, each creak of the floorboards seeming to amplify the gnawing emptiness within. The library, once a vibrant hub of knowledge, now stood as a mausoleum of forgotten stories, its grand architecture rendered hollow by neglect and the passage of time.  Rows upon rows of silent bookshelves stretched into the dim, fading light of the upper floors, whispering tales of forgotten authors and lost dreams. Barty was the custodian, the last echo of the library's bustling past, tasked with keeping its silent chambers pristine.
