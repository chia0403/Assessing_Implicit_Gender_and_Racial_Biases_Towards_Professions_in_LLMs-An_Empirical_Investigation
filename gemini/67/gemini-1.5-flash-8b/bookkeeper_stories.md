The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood’s hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind that whistled through the gaps in the drafty windows of "Numbers & Narratives," her small accounting firm.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the gloom, illuminating a swirling vortex of receipts, invoices, and meticulously organized ledger books that cluttered the mahogany desk.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-five with eyes the colour of faded amethyst, stared at a particularly messy spreadsheet detailing the quarterly expenses of the local artisanal cheese-making cooperative.  Another late night loomed, another mountain of numbers to conquer.

The firm, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Oakhaven, was a testament to both Amelia's dedication and her small, barely-sustainable business.  The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, its ornate façade hinting at a time when grand fortunes were made, not meticulously balanced ledgers.  Ornate ironwork framed the faded, mustard-yellow windows, and the scent of aged paper and slightly damp earth clung to the air.  Amelia loved the quiet, the history whispered in the crumbling stone walls, but the relentless pressure of keeping the doors open was a constant ache.
