The biting wind whipped at Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s coat, tugging at the brim of her worn fedora as she surveyed the neglected garden.  Twisted branches clawed at the grey sky, gnarled roots, like skeletal fingers, clawing at the cracked pavement.  This wasn't the meticulously manicured masterpiece Amelia envisioned, but the grim reality of her latest commission: the derelict estate of Lord Ashworth, rumored to be haunted by a disgruntled gardener from the Victorian era.  

Amelia, a landscaper with a surprisingly sharp wit and an even sharper eye for detail, adjusted her gloves.  The property sprawled across acres of overgrown wilderness, a stark contrast to the manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds she usually tended.  Ivy choked the ancient stone walls, clinging like a living shroud to the faded grandeur of the manor house.  A crumbling archway, draped with spiderwebs, formed a skeletal gateway into the heart of the overgrown maze.  The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, seemed to hum with an unseen energy.  This was not just a garden; it was a story whispered on the wind, etched in the very stones of the earth.
