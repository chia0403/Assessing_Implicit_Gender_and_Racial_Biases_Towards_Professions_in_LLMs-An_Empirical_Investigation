The chipped paint of the nail salon, a faded, sickly mint green, seemed to absorb the afternoon sun, turning it into a muted, almost ghostly light.  Dust motes danced in the solitary shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of "The Polished Petal," a tiny salon tucked away on a side street in the heart of the crumbling Victorian district.  This was the realm of  Anya Petrova, manicurist extraordinaire.  Anya, a woman of perpetual motion and vivid, almost chaotic, energy, was currently wrestling with a particularly stubborn gel overlay, her brow furrowed in concentration, a tiny diamond earring catching the light.  The air hummed with the quiet thrum of a half-dozen different conversations, the low hum of the air conditioner, and the faint, metallic tang of polish.  Outside, the city murmured, a constant, underlying symphony of car horns and distant sirens.  Anya, lost in her current task, was oblivious to it all, except for the faint scent of lilac and the insistent squeak of her tiny, almost robotic, nail clippers.
