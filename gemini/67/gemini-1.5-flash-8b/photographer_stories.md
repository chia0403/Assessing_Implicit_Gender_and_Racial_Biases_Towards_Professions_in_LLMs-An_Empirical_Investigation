The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Blackwood's camera bag across the cobblestones of the ancient city.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow light of a setting sun, danced in the air like phantom figures.  Above, the jagged silhouette of the  spire of the Cathedral of the Azure Flame pierced the bruised sky, a stark monument to a faith long faded. Em, a photographer with eyes the colour of storm clouds, squinted, focusing her lens on the crumbling façade of the Grand Bazaar.  She was in Aeridor, a city steeped in history, rumour, and a chilling, almost tangible, sense of decay.

Aeridor, a sprawling metropolis built upon the ruins of a forgotten empire, lay in a valley hemmed in by towering, snow-capped mountains.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and something indefinably acrid, a lingering echo of the city’s tumultuous past.  Streets, once grand avenues, were now choked with overgrown vines and skeletal remnants of carriages.  Dusty, faded murals depicted fantastical creatures and long-forgotten gods, now partially obscured by years of neglect.  This wasn't the vibrant city of legend. This was Aeridor, a whisper of its former glory.
