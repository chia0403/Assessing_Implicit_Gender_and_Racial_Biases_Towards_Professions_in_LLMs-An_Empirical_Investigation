Amelia, a flight attendant with the quiet intensity of a seasoned warrior, felt a prickle of unease crawl beneath her uniform. This wasn't just any flight. This was the last leg of a meticulously planned route, a journey that had already pushed the boundaries of the ordinary.  The destination: a remote island shrouded in mystery, an island whisperingly rumored to hold secrets older than time itself.
