The biting wind whipped Amelia Stone, Animal Caretaker Extraordinaire, across the desolate, windswept plains of the Auroran Highlands.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the skeletal remains of ancient, petrified trees.  The air, thin and crisp, tasted of salt and something indefinablyâ€¦ alien.  Amelia, her parka pulled tight against the chill, squinted at the jagged peaks of the distant Frostfang Mountains, a perpetual shroud of snow clinging to their granite faces.  This wasn't the lush, tropical preserve she was used to managing; this was the Auroran Experimental Zone, a place where the very definition of "wildlife" was constantly being rewritten.  Her job? To oversee the strange and often unsettling creatures housed within its forbidding enclosures.  She adjusted her worn leather satchel, a small, intricate carving of a Chimera nestled inside. A constant reminder of the cryptic origins of these creatures.
