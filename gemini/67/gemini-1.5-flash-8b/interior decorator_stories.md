The flickering neon sign of "The Painted Palette" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Hawthorne's meticulously organized apartment.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the blinds, illuminating the half-finished sketches strewn across her small, cluttered desk.  Amelia Hawthorne, interior decorator extraordinaire, found herself staring at a particularly frustrating watercolour – a depiction of a grand, dilapidated manor house shrouded in mist, a project that felt more like a curse than a commission.

The manor, the sprawling, gothic-revivial  "Oakhaven," sat perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the misty valley of Blackwood.  A symphony of mournful wind chimes and the distant caw of crows echoed through the empty rooms, making the house seem more like a mausoleum than a potential masterpiece.  Amelia, a self-proclaimed romantic at heart, was struggling to reconcile the house's chilling grandeur with the client's demands for a "modern, yet sophisticated" aesthetic.  The client, a reclusive art collector known only as Mr. Blackwood, had a reputation as enigmatic as the house itself.  Amelia had been given only one instruction: "Restore its soul."  But how could she restore something so profoundly lost in the shadows of its own history?  The chilling whispers of the wind seemed to carry with them the ghosts of Oakhaven's past, and Amelia felt a growing sense of unease.  She knew, deep down, that this commission was more than just a job; it was a journey into the heart of something… dark.
