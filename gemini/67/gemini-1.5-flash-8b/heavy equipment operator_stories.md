The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's greasy hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she surveyed the desolate landscape.  The ochre-colored plains of the Dustbowl stretched out to the horizon, a vast expanse of cracked earth and skeletal brush.  Dust devils danced like malevolent spirits, swirling the fine particles into suffocating clouds.  This wasn't the California she'd dreamed of.  This was the California she'd been cursed with – a fractured, sun-baked wasteland where hope was as rare as a raindrop.  Her Caterpillar 990, a behemoth of steel and diesel, stood sentinel beside her, its massive treads sinking slightly into the hardpan.  Ash, her calloused hands wrapped tight around the oversized joystick, felt the familiar hum of the engine, a reassuring thrum in the oppressive silence.  Her job – the only job she could find in this forsaken corner of the state – was to clear debris.  Debris left behind by the storms, the floods, the ever-hungry sun.  Debris that whispered tales of a world lost to the elements.
