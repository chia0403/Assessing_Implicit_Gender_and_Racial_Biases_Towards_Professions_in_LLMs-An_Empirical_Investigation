Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the law firm, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  The fluorescent lights of the cramped paralegal office hummed, a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amy's fingers on the keyboard.  She was deep in the trenches of a complex contract dispute, the intricate legal jargon blurring into a meaningless soup of legalese.  Outside, the city, usually a vibrant tapestry of lights and motion, was muted, swallowed by the relentless downpour.  Amy, hunched over her desk, felt utterly and profoundly alone.

The high ceilings, once graced by portraits of illustrious lawyers, now echoed with the low sighs of overworked staff and the hushed whispers of mounting frustration.  Musty leather furniture whispered tales of bygone triumphs, stories Amy only glimpsed in the dusty files she navigated daily.  Each file, a microcosm of someone else's struggle, added to the ever-present weight pressing down on Amy.  Today, a particularly complex shareholder lawsuit seemed destined to keep her chained to her desk until sunrise.
