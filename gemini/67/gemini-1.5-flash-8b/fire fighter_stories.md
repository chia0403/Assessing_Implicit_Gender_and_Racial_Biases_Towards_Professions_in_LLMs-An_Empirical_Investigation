The biting wind, a relentless claw, whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks as she stared out at the encroaching dusk.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling the already scarce vegetation into a hazy, orange-tinged oblivion.  The rhythmic groaning of the rusted water tower, a skeletal sentinel against the bruised sky, was the only sound besides the howl of the wind.  Amelia, a Firefighter for the Dust Bowl District, felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't a typical call.  It wasn't a house fire or a vehicle blaze.  This was something else entirely, somethingâ€¦ ominous.

The setting was the Dust Bowl District, a patchwork of abandoned homesteads and cracked, dust-choked roads that stretched into the horizon.  The once-fertile land was now a graveyard of dry, skeletal trees.  A perpetual haze of fine sand and dust hung low in the air, clinging to everything.  The district's only source of water was the dilapidated, aging water tower that dominated the desolate landscape.  The air was thick with the smell of burnt earth and the metallic tang of something unseen. Buildings stood hollow-eyed, their once-proud facades eroded by the relentless sun and wind.  The only signs of life were the battered fire truck, its metal body reflecting the dying light, and the figure of Amelia, standing resolute amidst the approaching darkness.
