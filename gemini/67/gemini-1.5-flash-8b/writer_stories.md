Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated writer's cottage, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's frantic typing.  The tiny, cluttered study, smelling faintly of old paper and damp earth, was lit by the flickering glow of a single bulb hanging precariously from a frayed wire.  Dust motes danced in the beam, swirling around overflowing inkwells and stacks of manuscripts, their spines cracked and dog-eared.  Amelia, a woman in her late twenties with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair the shade of raven's wings, hunched over the worn wooden desk, her knuckles white as she pressed keys, fingers flying across the keyboard.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks that clawed at the sky, their shadows stretching long and menacing across the overgrown garden. This was Blackwood's Retreat, perched precariously on the edge of the whispering woods, a place of both inspiration and torment, and tonight, the torment was winning.
