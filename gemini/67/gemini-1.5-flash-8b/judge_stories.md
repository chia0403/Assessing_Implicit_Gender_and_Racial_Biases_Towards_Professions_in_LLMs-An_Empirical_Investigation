Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the leaded panes of the Old Bailey courthouse, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Judge Alistair Finch-Hartley.  The year was 1888, and the city, though vibrant in its shadowed corners, pulsed with a palpable unease.

The prosecution painted a picture of brazen villainy, while the defense, a nimble pair of solicitors with eyes that darted around the room as if searching for a scapegoat, sought to weave a web of plausible deniability.

The fate of reputations, fortunes, and perhaps even lives, rested on his decision.
