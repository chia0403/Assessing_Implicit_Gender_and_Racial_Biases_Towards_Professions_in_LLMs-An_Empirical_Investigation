The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestone streets of Victorian-era London, illuminating the ornate façade of the Grand Savoy Hotel.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the towering windows, mirroring the storm brewing within the soul of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bellhop at the establishment.  Barty, a lanky young man with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hands perpetually calloused from carrying weighty luggage, sighed.  Another dreary night.  Another endless procession of weary travellers seeking solace in the grand halls of the Savoy.  The rhythmic clang of the hotel bell, a constant reminder of the hustle and bustle, echoed in his ears, a discordant soundtrack to his present discontent.  Tonight, though, a particular package felt different.  Small, wrapped in faded crimson velvet, it pulsed with an almost unseen warmth.  It held a silent promise, one that resonated with the very marrow of Barty’s bones.
