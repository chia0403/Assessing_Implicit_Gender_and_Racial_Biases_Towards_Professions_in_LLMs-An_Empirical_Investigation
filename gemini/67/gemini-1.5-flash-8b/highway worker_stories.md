The biting wind whipped at Amelia Petrova's worn safety vest, stinging her cheeks and rattling the chipped enamel mug in her gloved hand.  Sunrise, a bruised purple smudge on the horizon, offered little warmth to the desolate expanse of the I-95 median.  Twisted, skeletal trees clawed at the grey sky, their branches clawing like skeletal fingers at the overcast.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and diesel exhaust, a pungent mix that clung to Amelia like a second skin.  She was already three hours into her shift, the rhythmic thrum of the distant highway a constant, insistent pulse against the hushed emptiness around her. This stretch of road, known locally as "The Ghost Mile," was notorious for its unpredictable weather and even more unpredictable accidents.  Amelia was no stranger to the eerie stillness that settled over the landscape once the sun fully surrendered to the grey of the day.
