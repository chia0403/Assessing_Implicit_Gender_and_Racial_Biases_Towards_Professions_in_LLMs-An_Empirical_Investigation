The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faint smudges of coffee she'd been trying to wipe from her apron.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and something faintly floral, likely the wilting bouquet someone had left on a table near the back.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia's heart. Tonight was a disaster waiting to happen.  Tonight, the regulars were in a particularly boisterous mood, the kitchen was running behind, and the entire back room smelled faintly of desperation.  This was her third night in a row working double shifts, and the exhaustion was starting to seep into every inch of her being.

The Rusty Mug, nestled in the heart of the forgotten industrial district of Blackwood, wasn't exactly a glamorous establishment.  The exposed brick walls, once vibrant red, were now a dull, peeling orange, punctuated by faded posters of obscure rock bands and hand-drawn graffiti.  A worn wooden bar, scarred and stained with countless stories, stretched along one wall, its surface a mirror reflecting the anxious energy of the room.  The whole place had a sort of faded grandeur, a relic of a bygone era clinging to the edge of oblivion.  The rain-slicked streets outside reflected the same melancholy aura, mirroring the perpetual drizzle of Amelia's own mood.
