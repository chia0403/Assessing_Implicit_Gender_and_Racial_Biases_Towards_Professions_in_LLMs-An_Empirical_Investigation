Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned factory, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s chest.  The air hung thick and damp, smelling of mildew and something indefinably metallic.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a tangle of rusted machinery and skeletal frameworks.  This was no ordinary property viewing.  This was the derelict husk of "The Zenith Forge," a local legend whispered about in hushed tones, a place rumored to hold secrets older than the town itself.

Amelia Hawthorne, a real estate agent with a reputation for her meticulously crafted presentations and unwavering optimism, found herself profoundly out of her element.  Her carefully tailored suits and perfectly coiffed hair felt ludicrous amidst the crumbling grandeur.  Her client, a reclusive eccentric named Mr. Silas Blackwood, had insisted on this viewing, this particular relic of the past.  And Amelia, despite her misgivings, felt compelled to comply.  The commission was substantial, and the Blackwood family legacy, intertwined with this decaying behemoth, was a tempting carrot.


The setting:  Ashwood, a small, forgotten town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians.  Known for its faded glory and even more faded industrial past, it now clung to a fragile existence, a forgotten corner of time.  The Zenith Forge, once a titan of industry, now stood as a monument to its decline, a concrete testament to the fleeting nature of human endeavour, a macabre spectacle waiting to be unearthed.
