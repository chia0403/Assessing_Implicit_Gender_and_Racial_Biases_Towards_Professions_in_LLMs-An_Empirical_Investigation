The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded shade of periwinkle, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Sunlight, fractured through the grimy window panes, cast long, distorted shadows across the colourful toys strewn haphazardly on the floor.  Amelia "Em"  Fitzwilliam, a child care worker at the Sunnyside Daycare Centre, sighed too, though hers was a sound more akin to a weary rumble than a genuine breath.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, a constant, irritating hum that mirrored the relentless demands of the afternoon.  Today, the toddlers had decided that "constructive play" involved using Play-Doh to decorate the teddy bears, and then promptly smearing said teddy bears with peanut butter.  A particularly sticky situation, Em thought, her gaze flitting from a sobbing child to a table laden with the remnants of a sugar-cookie catastrophe.  It was a Tuesday, and the day was only halfway over.
