The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Acquisitions" lobby hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Kensington's keyboard.  Amelia, a receptionist with a perpetually tired smile and slightly too-red lipstick, stared at the swirling vortex of emails in her inbox.  Each one a potential pit of paperwork, each one a potential headache for the shadowy figures who inhabited the upper floors of this imposing glass and steel skyscraper.  Apex Acquisitions, they called it.  A company shrouded in secrecy, whispered about in hushed tones on the financial news.  And Amelia, the silent guardian of their front desk, was their first line of defense against the outside world.

The lobby, polished granite and minimalist modern design, felt sterile and impersonal.  A low, buzzing conversation emanated from the reception area's corner, where a man in a sharp, charcoal suit was clearly attempting to charm the perpetually harried Ms. Eleanor Vance, the company's CEO (as far as Amelia knew).  Sunlight, fractured into a thousand tiny shards by the towering windows, painted the floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow. Outside, the bustling city of Neo-Veridian thrummed with a cacophony of car horns and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the hushed, calculated environment within.  Ameliaâ€™s job? To deflect the outside world, to keep the inner workings of Apex Acquisitions locked away, just like a carefully guarded secret.
