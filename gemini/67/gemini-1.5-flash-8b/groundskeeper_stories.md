The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's threadbare jacket around her, rattling the worn brass bell on her key chain.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, stung her lungs, but Amelia, groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past twenty years, barely registered it.  Her task, as always, was to prepare the sprawling estate for the encroaching winter.

Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece perched atop a craggy hill overlooking the misty valley, was a monument to grandeur.  Towering turrets, draped in ivy that whispered secrets to the wind, seemed to watch her every move.  Jagged stone walls, perpetually speckled with moss, snaked through meticulously manicured gardens, now choked with autumnal colours â€“ fiery reds, burnt oranges, and bruised purples.  A network of ancient, gnarled oaks and beeches, their branches skeletal against the fading light, formed an impenetrable canopy, casting long, eerie shadows across the deserted pathways.  The air itself hummed with a quiet, almost palpable sense of history, a hushed testament to the generations who had lived and loved within these walls. Amelia, though, felt only the cold, and the weight of the responsibility resting on her shoulders.  Today, however, something felt different.  A faint, unsettling tremor ran through the very foundations of the manor.
