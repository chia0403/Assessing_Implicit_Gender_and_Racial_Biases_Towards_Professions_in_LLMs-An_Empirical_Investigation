The chipped paint of the "Imagination Station" kindergarten classroom seemed to hum with a low, almost imperceptible thrum.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a vibrant jungle, cast dappled patterns across the meticulously arranged blocks and colorful drawings.  A faint scent of cinnamon and crayons hung in the air, mingling with the hushed whispers and the rhythmic tapping of tiny fingers on wooden tables.  This was the world of Ms. Eleanor "Ellie"  Ashworth, a kindergarten teacher with eyes that held a surprising depth of patience and a heart brimming with stories.  Ellie, perched on a wobbly stool at the edge of the circle, watched her charges with a gentle smile.  Their vibrant energy was a constant source of inspiration, but today, an unusual quiet hung over the room.  Something was different.  Not bad, exactly, but undeniablyâ€¦ off.
