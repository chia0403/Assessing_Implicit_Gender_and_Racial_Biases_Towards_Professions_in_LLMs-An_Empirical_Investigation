The fluorescent hum of the server room, a constant, low thrumming, was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  Heâ€™d been in the bowels of the Global Data Exchange, a sprawling behemoth of interconnected servers and cooling units, since before dawn.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and burnt electronics, clung to him like a second skin.

The setting was the heart of Silicon Valley, in a nondescript, windowless building tucked away between gleaming glass towers.  This specific location, the GDX data center, was a subterranean complex, a technological cathedral, dedicated to processing and maintaining the vast digital tapestry that connected the world. Elias's task, tonight, was routine: troubleshooting a recent spike in data transfer errors, a subtle ripple in the vast ocean of information.  But this particular ripple seemed different, a discordant note amidst the symphony of digital communication.
