The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestone street.  A chill, sharp and biting, sliced through Amelia Nightingale's threadbare coat, despite the thick wool.  The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and frying onions, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, her voice a raw, untamed thing even in the quiet of her own thoughts, clutched the worn leather strap of her guitar case tighter.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was her stage.  Tonight, she was Amelia Nightingale, singer of forgotten songs and broken dreams.

The Rusty Mug itself was a relic, a crumbling Victorian building swallowed by the sprawling, grey industrial district of Ashhaven.  Years ago, it had been a bustling tavern, its tables overflowing with boisterous locals and the clinking of tankards. Now, the tables were few, the bar barely lit, and the patrons were mostly figures lost in the shadows, their faces masked by weariness or despair.  The air hung thick with the hushed whispers of shared anxieties, and the only music that dared to intrude was the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water leaking somewhere in the building's decaying heart.  This was Ashhaven, a city built on the ashes of ambition and choked by the smog of resignation.  Amelia, a stranger in this place, hoped her song might offer a flicker of warmth, even if only for a moment.
