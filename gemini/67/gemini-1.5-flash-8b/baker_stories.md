The chipped enamel sign, "Monsieur Antoine's Pains et Délices," hung precariously above the bakery, swaying slightly in the perpetual Parisian breeze.  Rain, a relentless, grey curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, echoing the frantic rhythm of Antoine Dubois's own heart.  He, Antoine Dubois, renowned baker of the Marais district, stood at the back of his small, cluttered shop, a whirlwind of flour dusting his apron and his brow.  The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, usually a comforting balm, felt acrid against the encroaching damp.  Tonight, something was amiss.  Not just a usual pre-storm tension, but something…heavy.  His stomach churned with a foreboding he couldn't quite place, a feeling as unsettling as the relentless downpour.  Outside, the cobblestones, usually a symphony of footsteps and chatter, were eerily quiet.  The only sounds were the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Antoine's own hammering heart.
