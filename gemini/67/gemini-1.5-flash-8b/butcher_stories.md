The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glinting steel of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's cleaver.  Sweat beaded on his brow, a mixture of the shop's oppressive heat and the adrenaline coursing through him.  Tonight, the air hung thick with the cloying scent of blood, a familiar, almost comforting aroma in the heart of the bustling, yet grimy,  East End of London, 1888.  He worked with a practiced efficiency, his movements as precise and ruthless as the blade in his hand.  Every chop, every slice, seemed to echo through the narrow space, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of his heavy boots on the worn wooden floor.  Outside, the city roared with the night's symphony of drunken shouts, horse-drawn carriages clattering over cobblestones, and the distant wail of a siren, a mournful sound that always seemed to seep into the shop's interior, a constant reminder of the cityâ€™s darkness.  Barty Grimshaw, the renowned butcher of the Five Bells district, was a man of steel and shadow, as familiar with the intricate cuts of a prime ox as with the hidden corners of his own city.
