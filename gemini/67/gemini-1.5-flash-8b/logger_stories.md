The biting wind, a razor-edged whisper, sliced through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines that clawed at the bruised sky.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, kicking up whispers of the long, dry summer.  Elias Thorne, muscles knotted and calloused hands stained a perpetual mahogany, hacked at a stubborn knot in the trunk of a towering fir.  He’d been at it for hours, the rhythmic clang of his axe a lonely counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and the metallic tang of sweat and wood, clung to him like a second skin.  This patch of the Cascadian wilderness, a forgotten corner of the Olympic National Park, was Elias’s sanctuary, his kingdom of silent, brutal beauty.  His only companions were the whispering trees, the skittering grouse, and the elusive, watchful gaze of the mountains.
