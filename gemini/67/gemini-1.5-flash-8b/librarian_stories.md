The chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes perpetually staring, sat on the top shelf of the forgotten children's section at the Gilded Lily Library.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes.  Amelia Blackwood, a librarian with a penchant for the melancholic and a surprising affinity for dusty relics, surveyed the room with a sigh.  The Gilded Lily, a magnificent building once renowned for its opulent interiors, was now a testament to the slow, inexorable march of neglect.  Its grand arches, once echoing with the chatter of patrons, now whispered secrets only the decaying plaster could understand.

Amelia, her name a counterpoint to the library's faded grandeur, was hunched over a worn wooden desk, the faint scent of old paper and mildew clinging to her.  Around her, bookshelves groaned under the weight of forgotten stories, their spines cracked and brittle, their pages yellowed and brittle like aged parchment.  A single flickering fluorescent light buzzed above, casting long, distorted shadows across the room.  The library, once a sanctuary of knowledge, now felt like a mausoleum of lost words.
