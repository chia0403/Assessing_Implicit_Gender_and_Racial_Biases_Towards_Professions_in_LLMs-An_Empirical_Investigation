The chipped Formica countertop of Mrs. Amelia Hayes's kitchen reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of the high school hallway, casting an unnerving yellow glow on the half-eaten bowl of cereal.  Amelia, a history teacher at Hawthorne High, stared at the lukewarm milk, the scent of burnt sugar still clinging to the air from the failed attempt at apple crisp earlier that afternoon.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her heart echoed the frantic drumming of the approaching clock hand.  It was 3:17 PM, five minutes before the official end of her workday.  But for Amelia, the clock always ticked louder in the suffocating silence of the empty hallways, a silent countdown to the inevitable.

The setting was the small, somewhat dilapidated kitchen of her modest, one-bedroom apartment, located above the dusty, forgotten bookstore on the edge of Hawthorne's forgotten downtown.  A single, almost-dead philodendron drooped from a corner window, mirroring the wilted feeling in Amelia's gut. The faint scent of old paper and leather, a constant companion of the bookstore below, permeated the air, mixing strangely with the lingering aroma of burnt sugar.  The silence was heavy, punctuated only by the distant sounds of a street sweeper and the occasional, echoing shriek of a lonely crow.  Hawthorne, a town steeped in a quiet melancholy, seemed to hold its breath, awaiting the inevitable.
