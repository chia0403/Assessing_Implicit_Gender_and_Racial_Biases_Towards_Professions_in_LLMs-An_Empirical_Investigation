The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Springs Massage Parlour" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked street.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes, hung heavy in the late-night air, a stark contrast to the calming lavender oil that usually permeated the tiny space.

Tonight's appointments had been sparse, the usual murmur of quiet conversations and soft sighs replaced by an unsettling silence.  The rhythmic drip of the leaky faucet in the back room seemed to mock the quietude, a persistent counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety gnawing at Anya. Her name was not a simple flourish, but a statement; it bore the weight of heritage and dreams whispered on the wind.
