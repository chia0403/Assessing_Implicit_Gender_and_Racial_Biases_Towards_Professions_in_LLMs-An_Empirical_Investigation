Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an occupational therapist as the main character:

**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling but slightly dilapidated therapy gym of "Havenwood Rehabilitation Center," a sprawling, ivy-covered building just outside of Boston, Massachusetts. The gym itself is a chaotic mix of state-of-the-art equipment and well-worn, slightly squeaky contraptions. Sunlight streams through the large, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a constant reminder of the building's age. The air smells faintly of antiseptic, sweat, and the lingering scent of someone's microwaved fish lunch.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic whir of the overhead hoist filled the room, a familiar sound that usually soothed Elara Maeve O'Connell. But today, even the mechanical lullaby couldn't calm the knot twisting in her stomach. Elara, a certified occupational therapist with five years under her belt and a cascade of auburn hair pulled back into a practical braid, adjusted the sling supporting Mr. Henderson, a wiry eighty-year-old recovering from a stroke. "Alright, Mr. Henderson," she said, forcing a cheerful tone she didn't quite feel, "let's see if we can get you to grip that bar a little tighter. Think about squeezing a lemon. Go on, give it a try!"

Mr. Henderson's brow furrowed with concentration, his hand trembling as he weakly attempted to grasp the smooth metal. Sweat beaded on his forehead. Elara held her breath, willing his muscles to cooperate. This wasn't just about strength; it was about independence, about dignity. It was about giving him back a piece of the life the stroke had stolen.

But today, Mr. Henderson’s grip failed. His hand slipped, and a frustrated groan escaped his lips. "Just can't do it, Elara," he rasped, his voice thick with defeat.

Elara gently lowered him back into his wheelchair, her own disappointment mirroring his. “It’s alright, Mr. Henderson,” she said, carefully detaching the sling. “We’ll try again tomorrow. Small steps, remember? Small steps.”

As she wheeled him back towards his room, Elara couldn’t shake the feeling that the “small steps” weren’t enough. Something was off, not just with Mr. Henderson's progress, but with Havenwood itself. A shadow seemed to be creeping over the place she had once considered a haven, and Elara Maeve O'Connell was beginning to suspect she was the only one who could see it.
