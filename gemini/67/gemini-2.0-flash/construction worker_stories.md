The biting November wind clawed at the edges of Daniel O'Connell's thick Carhartt jacket as he stood precariously on the I-beam, two hundred feet above the churning grey chaos of downtown Chicago. He adjusted his hardhat, the faded sticker of the Ironworkers Local 63 glinting dully in the weak sunlight, and tightened his grip on the safety harness tethered to the steel skeleton that was slowly becoming the 'Constellation Tower.' The air vibrated with the rhythmic clang of hammers, the screech of welding torches, and the guttural roar of a distant jackhammer; a symphony of construction that had been the soundtrack to Daniel's life since he was a kid lugging rebar for his old man.

The setting was the sprawling construction site of the Constellation Tower, a ambitious skyscraper project designed to be the city's tallest, situated on the western edge of the Loop, bordering the West Loop neighborhood. This meant a breathtaking panorama of the city unfolding beneath him - the iconic silhouettes of the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center piercing the sky to the east, the vast expanse of Lake Michigan shimmering in the distance, and the vibrant tapestry of warehouses and loft buildings that characterized the West Loop stretching out to the west. Below him, a swarm of yellow hardhats scurried around like ants, directing cranes, maneuvering forklifts, and pouring concrete into the insatiable maw of the building.

Daniel wasn't just building a skyscraper; he was building a legacy. He was following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, both ironworkers who had helped shape the Chicago skyline. But today, the weight of that legacy felt heavier than usual, a dull ache in his gut that had nothing to do with the wind or the altitude. Today, something felt...off.
