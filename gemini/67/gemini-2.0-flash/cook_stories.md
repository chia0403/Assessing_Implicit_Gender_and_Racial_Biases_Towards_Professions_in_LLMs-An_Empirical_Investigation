## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the gray Atlantic, stinging Amelia "Mel" Beaumont's cheeks as she lugged a crate of freshly caught mussels up the steep, cobbled path towards The Salty Siren. The iconic lighthouse, painted in cheerful stripes of red and white, dominated the tiny island of Oakhaven, Nova Scotia. It was early November, and the off-season had truly settled in. Most of the tourists had retreated to the mainland, leaving Oakhaven to its hardy inhabitants – the fishermen, the lighthouse keeper, and Amelia, the island’s only cook.

**Opening:**

Amelia Beaumont wiped a stray strand of auburn hair from her eyes with the back of a flour-dusted hand. Inside The Salty Siren, the ancient wood-fired stove roared, battling the encroaching chill. She glanced at the chipped, ceramic clock hanging above the pantry door: 6:30 PM. Almost time.

"Almost time for what?" she muttered to herself, her breath puffing out in a small white cloud. For the same solitary meal she'd had every night for the past three weeks? For the dull ache of loneliness that settled in her bones the moment the last ferry chugged away from the dock?

The bell above the front door jingled, a sharp, insistent sound that made Amelia jump. She smoothed down her worn apron, a splash of color against her faded overalls, and plastered on a welcoming smile. Perhaps tonight wouldn’t be so bleak after all.
