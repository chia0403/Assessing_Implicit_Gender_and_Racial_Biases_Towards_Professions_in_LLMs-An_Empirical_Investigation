## Opening:

The stench of burnt ozone hit Eleanor "Ellie" Vance like a physical blow as she shoved her way through the throngs of panicked performers. Feathers, sequins, and the sweat of desperate ambition clung to her like static cling. The entire stage was dark, the elaborate backdrop – a glittering, faux-art deco cityscape – silhouetted against the emergency exit signs.

"Ellie! Ellie, thank God!" a shrill voice pierced the chaos. It was Mr. Petrov, the theatre manager, his normally impeccably tailored suit rumpled and his meticulously coiffed hair now plastered to his forehead with sweat. "The opening number… the lights… they just… *poof*!"

Ellie ignored his frantic gestures and focused on the task at hand. Smoke, acrid and clinging, still curled from the lighting rig high above the stage. A sinking feeling clenched her stomach. This wasn't just a blown bulb. This was something far more serious, and the premiere of "Broadway Bound," the biggest, most extravagant show to hit this theatre in years, was about to be a catastrophic failure.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the grand, yet slightly dilapidated, **Grand Majestic Theatre** located in the heart of the Theater District in **Manhattan, New York City**. The theatre, a monument to the gilded age of Broadway, boasts ornate plasterwork, velvet curtains heavy with history, and a lingering scent of old perfume and sawdust.

While the front of house retains its former glory, the backstage is a maze of cramped dressing rooms, dusty props, and tangled wires. The lighting rig, a complex network of cables and lights, is a testament to the theatre's long history, with layers of upgrades and patchwork repairs piled on over the decades. The air is thick with the unspoken pressure of mounting expectations and the ever-present threat of something going wrong. The contrast between the glamorous facade and the gritty reality behind the scenes is palpable, creating a sense of both wonder and impending doom.
