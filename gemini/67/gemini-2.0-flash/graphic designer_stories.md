The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled with the unwieldy cardboard tube. Chicago in November was a special kind of brutal, a slap in the face to anyone foolish enough to believe autumn lingered past Halloween. Elias, a freelance graphic designer with a penchant for vintage fonts and a chronic inability to predict the weather, cursed under his breath, his gloved fingers fumbling with the stubborn cap.

His studio, a cramped but charming space on the second floor of a converted warehouse in Pilsen, was his sanctuary. High ceilings, exposed brick, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the vibrant street art below provided an endless source of inspiration. Inside, a carefully curated chaos reigned. Stacks of design books teetered precariously on shelves crafted from reclaimed wood, rolls of brightly coloured paper littered the floor, and half-finished projects sat scattered across his expansive drafting table. The air hung thick with the aroma of strong coffee and the faintest hint of solvent from his printing inks. It was a mess, but it was *his* mess, and within it, Elias Thorne crafted visual magic.
