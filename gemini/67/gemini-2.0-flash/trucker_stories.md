Dwayne “Diesel” Davidson couldn't quite place *exactly* where he was, but the smell of burnt coffee and frying bacon assured him he was in the right place to start his day. The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, painting the chrome of his Kenworth T680, affectionately nicknamed "Bertha," with a soft, pink glow. The air, however, smelled less romantic – a potent cocktail of diesel exhaust, stale cigarette smoke, and the faint, underlying odor of a cattle truck that had clearly passed through recently.
