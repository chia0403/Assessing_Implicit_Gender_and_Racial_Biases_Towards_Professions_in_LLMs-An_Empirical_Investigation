The rain, a greasy, insistent drizzle, clung to the cobblestones of Place du Tertre, reflecting the gaslights in shimmering, distorted halos. The air, thick with the smell of wet canvas, cheap wine, and the lingering ghost of Gauloises smoke, did little to dispel the biting chill that seeped into Elara Beatrice Hawthorne's bones. She tugged her worn, tweed coat tighter around her, the collar scratching uncomfortably against her neck. She was far too early.

Elara Beatrice Hawthorne, foreign correspondent for the *London Chronicle*, loathed being early, particularly on assignments like this. An interview with Jean-Luc Dubois, the reclusive artist whispered to be the modern master of surrealist expressionism, was a coup for any journalist, especially one still cutting her teeth on the Paris beat. But the man’s notoriety was matched only by his rumored eccentricity, and Elara suspected the ungodly hour – six in the morning – was a deliberate test.

She stood beneath the awning of a dilapidated crêperie, watching the square slowly awaken. The artists, the heart of Montmartre, were still hidden away, presumably nursing hangovers or feverishly chasing inspiration. Only the street sweepers and a few haggard-looking stragglers, the remnants of the previous night’s revelry, occupied the space, their shadows long and distorted under the flickering gaslight. The promise of dawn was a faint, pale smudge on the eastern horizon, but here in the heart of Paris' artistic soul, night clung stubbornly, refusing to relinquish its hold. Elara took a deep breath, the damp air stinging her nostrils, and mentally reviewed her list of questions. It was going to be a long morning.
