## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive humidity of late August hung heavy over Meadowbrook Elementary, a low-slung brick building baking under the relentless Georgia sun. Cicadas buzzed their deafening summer song, mocking the fact that school was back in session. Inside, the linoleum floors gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting a frantic energy as teachers prepped their classrooms, last-minute supply orders arrived in cardboard boxes, and the faint scent of floor wax battled with the stronger aroma of burnt coffee.

**Story Opening:** Dr. Amelia Grace Davies sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Her new office, a converted storage closet tucked between the nurse's station and the fifth-grade hallway, was cramped and smelled faintly of dust and old volleyballs. A single window offered a view of the playground, currently deserted but soon to be a battleground of youthful angst and skinned knees. It was her first official day as the school psychologist at Meadowbrook, and the mountain of paperwork already threatening to avalanche off her desk felt symbolic of the challenges ahead. She adjusted her glasses, took another sip of lukewarm coffee, and told herself, for the tenth time that morning, that she was ready. This was her purpose, after all: to navigate the labyrinthine minds of children, to offer a safe space for their fears and frustrations, and to help them find their way, one crayon drawing and whispered secret at a time. Then, a sharp, insistent knock startled her, and a harried-looking woman with frizzy red hair and a nametag that read "Ms. O'Malley - 3rd Grade" burst in, her eyes wide with a mixture of panic and exasperation. "Dr. Davies," she gasped, "you *have* to help me. It's Timmy Johnson. He's bitingâ€¦again."
