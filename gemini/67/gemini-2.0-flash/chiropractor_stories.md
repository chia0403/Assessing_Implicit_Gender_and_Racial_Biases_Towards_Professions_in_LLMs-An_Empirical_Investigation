## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Alistair Finch hated Mondays. Not in the performative, “ugh-Mondays” way that permeated social media and office chatter. Alistair’s loathing was deeper, more primal, rooted in the tangible slump of shoulders, the tight knots of anxiety, and the dull, radiating ache that seemed to collectively descend upon the populace after a weekend of poor decisions and prolonged inactivity. Today, however, his Monday malaise was compounded by the flickering fluorescent lights of the clinic, which were conspiring to induce a headache even before his first patient had hobbled through the door. He sighed, pressing the heel of his hand into his temple and contemplating the merits of switching to candlelight, when a notification pinged on his phone. A text from his mother. Wonderful. This was shaping up to be a *special* kind of Monday.

**Setting:**

Dr. Alistair Theodore Finch’s chiropractic clinic, "Finch Family Chiropractic," was nestled in the heart of a quaint, slightly-too-perfect Victorian-era neighborhood in the fictional town of Havenwood, Maine. The building itself was a converted single-family home, painted a calming, albeit somewhat predictable, shade of sage green. Inside, the waiting room was an exercise in deliberately curated comfort: overstuffed armchairs upholstered in floral prints, a well-stocked magazine rack featuring everything from *National Geographic* to outdated issues of *Golf Digest*, and the soothing sounds of a babbling brook piped through hidden speakers. Alistair, however, preferred his office, located just beyond the reception area. It was less intentionally charming, more utilitarian, with an adjustable chiropractic table dominating the space. Posters depicting the human skeletal system and detailed charts of pressure points adorned the walls, vying for attention with Alistair’s collection of antique anatomical models, which he’d inherited from his grandfather, also a chiropractor. A small window offered a view of the meticulously manicured rose garden in the backyard, a splash of vibrant color in an otherwise functional, almost sterile environment.
