Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a stockbroker named Alistair Finch:

**Story Opening:**

The screech of Alistair Finch's mahogany desk chair against the polished marble floor of Finch & Thorne Partners was almost imperceptible amidst the cacophony of the trading floor. He barely noticed it anyway. His eyes, bloodshot and strained, were glued to the cascading red numbers on his six monitors. A trickle of sweat, cold as a bad omen, snaked down his temple and disappeared into the perfectly coiffed salt-and-pepper hair he paid a ludicrous amount to maintain. The morning had started normally, a predictable ballet of buy orders and sell signals. But then the news broke - the CEO of OmniCorp, a biotech giant Alistair had heavily invested in for his most important client, had been found dead in his Aspen chalet. Suicide, the headlines screamed. Alistair felt a cold dread blossom in his chest. This wasn't just a bad day. This was a disaster.

**Setting:**

The setting is primarily the bustling trading floor of Finch & Thorne Partners, a high-end investment firm located in the heart of the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Think gleaming glass skyscrapers, the constant hum of computer servers, and the frenetic energy of hundreds of brokers vying for attention. Alistair's personal workspace is a carefully curated haven of wealth and success:

*   **The Office:** Situated on the 47th floor, offering panoramic views of the city's skyline.
*   **The Desk:** A large, antique mahogany desk cluttered with multiple monitors, phones, and scattered reports, with a few framed pictures of his family strategically placed to project an image of stability.
*   **The Atmosphere:** A mix of intense concentration and nervous energy hangs in the air. The constant phone calls, shouted orders, and the rhythmic tapping of keyboards create a relentless, high-pressure environment. While impressive, the office holds an underlying feeling of greed and constant one-upmanship.

**Character Introduction:**
