The sodium vapor lamps hummed their monotonous tune, painting the alley in a sickly orange glow. Rain, a persistent drizzle that had been falling for hours, plastered discarded newspapers to the grimy brick walls and turned the cracked asphalt into a treacherous slip-and-slide. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi huddled deeper into her worn leather jacket, the collar pulled up against the chill.

The setting was the underbelly of New Haven, Connecticut: the alley behind Frankie's, a notorious late-night dive bar known more for its shady deals and after-hours brawls than its cheap beer. The air hung thick with the stench of stale beer, cigarette butts, and something else, something metallic and acrid that clawed at the back of Izzy’s throat. It was the smell of blood. She knew it all too well. Another night, another body, another piece of New Haven’s soul slowly eroding in the darkness.
