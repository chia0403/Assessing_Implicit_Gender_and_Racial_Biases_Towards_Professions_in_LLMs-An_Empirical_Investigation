## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the "Quick Stop & Go" hummed a familiar, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Eleanor May Bartlett's Tuesday afternoon. She scanned a bag of gummy worms with practiced ease, the red laser etching a fleeting barcode into the sickly-sweet confection. Mrs. Higgins, her usual collection of discount coupons clutched in a trembling hand, shuffled forward.

"Now, Eleanor, dear, make sure you use the senior discount on this oatmeal," she rasped, her voice a low, gravelly whisper that seemed to vibrate the very air around her.

Eleanor suppressed a sigh. She knew the routine. Mrs. Higgins was a regular, and while Eleanor appreciated the business, she also knew that this transaction would likely take five minutes longer than it needed to.

"Of course, Mrs. Higgins," Eleanor said, forcing a smile. "Always happy to help."

But today, even the familiar routine felt different. A strange, almost tangible, tension crackled in the air. It wasn’t just the usual pre-thunderstorm humidity; it was something…else. Eleanor felt it in the prickle of her skin, in the sudden, almost overwhelming urge to look out the large, plate-glass window and see what was happening beyond the confines of the Quick Stop & Go.

The tension thickened as a figure walked in.

## Setting:

The **"Quick Stop & Go"** is a brightly lit convenience store located on the corner of Maple Street and Elm Avenue in the small, unassuming town of Havenwood, Ohio. Its paint is a faded shade of blue, chipped around the edges, and the sign above the door flickers intermittently, its second "O" perpetually threatening to go dark.

Inside, the store is a labyrinth of narrow aisles crammed with everything from chips and soda to motor oil and lottery tickets. The shelves are lined with dusty cans and brightly colored packages, all vying for attention. The air is thick with the combined scents of stale coffee, day-old donuts, and the ever-present aroma of artificial cherry flavoring.

The cashier's station, where Eleanor spends the majority of her day, is a relatively cramped space, dominated by a noisy cash register and a small counter cluttered with promotional pamphlets and forgotten receipts. A large window behind the counter offers a view of the street, showcasing a constant stream of traffic and the occasional town resident hurrying by. Outside, a rusty soda machine gurgles intermittently, promising a refreshing escape from the Ohio heat, though Eleanor knows it's more likely to dispense a lukewarm, fizzy disappointment. The atmosphere is generally unremarkable, a microcosm of small-town life, until today, when it feels palpably…wrong.
