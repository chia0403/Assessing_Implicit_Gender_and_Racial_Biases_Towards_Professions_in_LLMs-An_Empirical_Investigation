**Opening:**

The clatter of the ancient Smith Corona echoed in the cramped room, a frantic percussion accompanying the storm raging outside. Rain lashed against the single, grimy window, blurring the already dim light filtering through. Isabella Beatrice Finch, hunched over the typewriter, ignored the insistent chill seeping into her bones. She was lost in a world of her own creation, a world far more vibrant and compelling than the dreary reality that surrounded her. The words flowed, albeit messily, across the page, fuelled by black coffee and a burning desire to escape. She needed to finish this chapter, to unravel the mystery that gripped her characters, before the weight of her own life crushed her entirely. Another key stuck, forcing her to hammer it with a force that threatened to send the whole machine tumbling to the floor. "Blast it all," she muttered, tugging at the stubborn letter "E."

**Setting:**

Isabella's apartment occupied the top floor of a dilapidated brownstone in the West Village of New York City. The building had seen better days, its faded grandeur a testament to a bygone era. The walls of her single room were painted a peeling, sickly yellow, and the scent of dust and stale cigarettes clung to the air. Books overflowed from rickety shelves, piled high on the floor, threatening to topple at any moment. A threadbare rug, patterned with faded roses, covered a portion of the wooden floor, offering minimal warmth against the draft. The only other furniture consisted of a chipped desk, the aforementioned Smith Corona perched precariously on its surface, a wobbly chair, and a narrow cot pushed against the wall. A small, rusted sink occupied one corner, serving as both a makeshift kitchen and bathroom sink. Despite its squalor, the room possessed a certain charm, a chaotic haven filled with the promise of untold stories, whispered secrets, and the unwavering determination of Isabella Beatrice Finch to capture them on paper. The view from the window, when the rain permitted, offered a sliver of the bustling city below, a constant reminder of the world she yearned to conquer with her words.
