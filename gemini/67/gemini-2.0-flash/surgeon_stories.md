Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a surgeon:

**Setting:**

The pre-dawn light was a bruised purple against the high, snow-capped peaks surrounding the Kathmandu Valley. Dr. Aris Thorne stood on the balcony of his modest apartment, the air crisp and thin enough to bite. Prayer flags, strung haphazardly between buildings, snapped in the wind like whispered secrets. Below him, the city was just beginning to stir; the muted rumble of an ancient bus struggling to life, the distant clang of a temple bell, the high-pitched calls of vendors preparing their stalls. From his vantage point, he could see the sprawling Tribhuvan International Airport, where his day - and perhaps another life - would begin.

**Opening:**

Dr. Aris Thorne, his back aching from a restless night, took a slow sip of his lukewarm chai. The familiar scent of cardamom and ginger was usually a comfort, but this morning, it did little to soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in his gut. He was good, damn good even, at what he did. A leading cardiothoracic surgeon, sought after for his steady hand and innovative techniques. But today was different. Today, he wasn't just wielding a scalpel; he was stepping into a political minefield. His patient, a young Sherpa guide named Tenzing, had become a symbol â€“ a symbol of hope for a remote village ravaged by a recent earthquake and political neglect. If Aris failed, the repercussions would extend far beyond the operating room. He glanced at his watch. 5:30 AM. Time to face the music. He just hoped it wasn't a dirge.
