## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Amelia Finch’s face as she wrestled the stubborn gate open, the rusty hinges screaming in protest like a chorus of arthritic knees. The wind, a persistent bully, whipped strands of her graying auburn hair across her cheeks, tasting of seaweed and a promise of impending storm. She tugged her fisherman’s sweater tighter, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seeped bone-deep, and squinted at the path ahead. 

The path itself was treacherous, a winding ribbon of uneven cobblestones swallowed periodically by encroaching dunes of coarse, blonde grass. It led, predictably, towards the only landmark visible on this desolate stretch of the Outer Banks: The Cliffside Sanatorium, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the very edge of the bluff, its silhouette stark against the bruised twilight sky.

## Setting:

**The Outer Banks, North Carolina, late November.** The story takes place primarily on a remote, wind-swept stretch of coastline, specifically centered around **The Cliffside Sanatorium**. Built in the late 1890s, the sanatorium has a reputation for being gloomy and isolated, with peeling paint, perpetually fogged windows, and a general air of decay both physical and metaphorical. The grounds surrounding the building are untamed and wild, with dunes, scrub brush, and the constant presence of the Atlantic Ocean shaping the landscape. The closest town is a small, tight-knit fishing village several miles inland, characterized by its insularity and wariness of outsiders. The time of year is late November, meaning the weather is harsh and unpredictable, adding to the overall sense of isolation and foreboding.
