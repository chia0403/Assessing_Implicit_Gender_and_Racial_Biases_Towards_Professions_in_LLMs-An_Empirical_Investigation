## Opening and Setting

The persistent drizzle of the Cornish coast clung to everything, a fine mist that beaded on the waxy leaves of the camellias and slicked the ancient stones of the wall surrounding Rosewick Manor. For Mr. Silas Penhaligon, head groundskeeper, it was just another Tuesday, another opportunity to wage war against the relentless tide of nature threatening to reclaim what was once meticulously ordered. He adjusted his worn tweed cap, pulling it lower over his brow as he surveyed the scene before him. The sprawling gardens, normally a symphony of color even in early spring, were muted and somber under the grey sky.

Rosewick Manor itself, a magnificent gothic pile perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, was equally imposing and melancholic. Generations of the Ashworth family had lived and died within its grey stone walls, leaving behind a palpable sense of history â€“ and more than a few lingering rumors of hauntings. Silas, a man of simple pleasures and grounded practicality, generally dismissed such tales as the product of too much sherry and too little sun. Still, there were times, like now, when the wind howled through the crenellations and the seabirds shrieked overhead, that even he felt a shiver crawl down his spine.

Today's task was to prune the rose bushes in the East Garden, a task he usually relished. The fragrance of the Damask roses, even in their dormant state, was intoxicating, a reminder of the beauty that lay just beneath the surface of the harsh winter. But as Silas approached the iron gate, he noticed something out of place, a splash of vibrant color against the monochrome landscape. He squinted, his breath misting in the cold air. Nestled amongst the thorny branches, gleaming like a stolen gem, was a single, impossibly bright, scarlet poppy. And lying beneath it, nestled in the damp earth, was a small, tarnished silver locket.
