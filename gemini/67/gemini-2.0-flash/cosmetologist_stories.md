## Story Opening:

The jasmine-scented heat hit Eleanor Beatrice Albright the moment she stepped outside "The Glamorous Glimmer," her small but perfectly formed salon on the edge of Savannah's historic district. It was late afternoon, the kind where the humidity clung to your skin like a second, unwelcome, dress. Usually, the end-of-day exhaustion was enough to dull the oppressive climate, but today, a different kind of weariness gnawed at Eleanor â€“ a hollow ache that had nothing to do with sore feet or aching fingers.

She paused on the porch, the chipped, robin's egg blue paint flaking gently beneath her worn Mary Janes. Across the street, Spanish moss dripped from ancient oaks, casting long, languid shadows. The rhythmic click-clack of a horse-drawn carriage echoed in the humid air, a sound so intrinsically Savannah it usually soothed her. Today, it only amplified the feeling of being stuck, like a fly caught in a glistening web.

Eleanor reached into her purse, her fingers fumbling for a cigarette. She hadn't smoked in years, not since her Aunt Mildred had passed from lung cancer, a cruel irony considering Mildred had been a staunch advocate for organic skincare and toxin-free living. But the urge was strong, primal. She needed something, anything, to cut through the cotton wool that had settled in her brain.

She found the pack, its crinkled edges betraying its age. As she pulled out a single cigarette, a gust of wind rustled through the oak trees, scattering leaves like golden confetti. A fleeting moment of beauty, quickly swallowed by the looming shadow of the approaching evening.

Eleanor Beatrice Albright, celebrated cosmetologist, expert eyebrow shaper, and confidante to Savannah's elite, took a deep breath and lit the cigarette, the cherry glowing like a tiny, defiant ember against the gathering gloom. She knew this wasn't a solution. But for now, it was enough.

## Setting:

**Savannah, Georgia:** The story is set in the historic district of Savannah, a city known for its Southern charm, Spanish moss-draped trees, wrought-iron balconies, and a palpable sense of history. The humidity is a constant presence, adding to the atmosphere of languid beauty and hidden secrets.

**"The Glamorous Glimmer" Salon:** This is Eleanor's salon, a small, brightly colored space on the edge of the historic district. It's not a flashy, modern establishment, but rather a cozy and welcoming haven filled with vintage furniture, antique mirrors, and the aroma of essential oils and hairspray. The exterior is painted a faded robin's egg blue, with chipped paint and a small porch where Eleanor often takes a break. The interior reflects Eleanor's personality - a blend of classic elegance and quirky charm. It's a place where women come to be pampered, to share secrets, and to leave feeling a little more glamorous.
