## Story Opening:

The scent of dust, old velvet, and desperate ambition hung heavy in the air, clinging to the ornate plasterwork of the Grand Majestic Theatre like a stubborn stage ghost. Evelyn Bellweather, a woman whose silver hair was always slightly disarrayed, framing a face etched with both weariness and a fierce, captivating spark, stared up at the vast, empty stage. She ran a gloved hand along the threadbare curtain, a melancholic sigh escaping her lips.

The theatre, once the beating heart of New York's theatrical scene, now felt like a mausoleum, echoing only with the ghosts of forgotten applause. The shimmering chandeliers, dimmed and dusty, cast long, skeletal shadows across the rows of velvet seats, each one a silent witness to a hundred forgotten dramas. Evelyn could almost hear the whispers, the soaring melodies, the thunderous ovations that had once filled this space. She could almost *feel* the life that had pulsed through its veins.

But the Majestic was dying. Cracks spiderwebbed across the ceiling, the once-opulent paint peeled in mournful strips, and the whispers were now mostly from the rats that had claimed the rafters as their own. Tonight was dress rehearsal for *The Tempest*, Evelyn's last-ditch attempt to breathe life back into the old building, to conjure a miracle, a box-office explosion that would save the Majestic from the wrecker's ball.

She glanced at her watch, a battered antique passed down from her own theatrical mother. It was almost time. Evelyn straightened her shoulders, pushed back the encroaching despair, and summoned a voice that, while raspy from years of shouting direction and too many late-night cigarettes, still held a commanding resonance.

"Places, everyone! Let's try to remember that this might be the only chance we have to show them all what this theatre, what *we*, are still capable of!"

## Setting:

The Grand Majestic Theatre, located in the heart of Manhattan's dwindling Theatre District. Constructed in 1928 during the golden age of American theatre, it's a sprawling, Beaux-Arts masterpiece, now tragically faded. The interior boasts elaborate plasterwork, towering marble columns, and plush velvet seating, all showing signs of neglect. The stage is enormous, capable of hosting the most ambitious productions, but the rigging is temperamental and the backstage area is cramped and poorly lit. The entire theatre has a palpable sense of history, tinged with the sadness of decline and a lingering glimmer of past glory. The surrounding neighborhood is also showing signs of decay, with boarded-up storefronts and a general air of neglect that mirrors the theatre's own plight.
