**Story Opening:**

The salt air whipped Amelia Stone's auburn hair across her face as she stood on the weathered deck of the "Salty Siren," a charter fishing boat whose best days were decades behind it. The boat groaned beneath her feet, a symphony of aged wood and rusty metal protesting the choppy waters of the Gulf of Mexico. She gripped the railing, her knuckles white, and squinted into the blinding glare reflecting off the waves. Below, a pod of dolphins broke the surface, their sleek bodies arching in a playful ballet. Amelia should have been enjoying the spectacle, should have felt the restorative power of the ocean. Instead, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest, heavy and insistent as a lead weight. She was a lawyer, damn it, not a marine biologist. What in God's name was she doing out here?

**Setting:**

Amelia is standing on the deck of the "Salty Siren," a small, aging charter fishing boat operating out of the small, sleepy coastal town of Perdition Key, Florida. The sun is high and hot, typical of a late July morning. Perdition Key itself is a haven for retirees, fishermen, and tourists seeking a quiet escape from the hustle of city life. Its beaches are pristine, its seafood is fresh, and its secrets are buried deeper than the anchor chain of the "Salty Siren." The town's charm is undeniable, but beneath the surface lies a simmering tension, a quiet desperation born from a stagnant economy and a history steeped in folklore and whispered legends. The "Salty Siren," owned and operated by a gruff but ultimately good-hearted old salt named Captain Silas, represents a fading way of life, struggling to compete with the larger, more modern tourist attractions.
