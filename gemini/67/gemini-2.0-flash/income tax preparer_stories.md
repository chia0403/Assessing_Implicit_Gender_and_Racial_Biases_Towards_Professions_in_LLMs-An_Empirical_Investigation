**Opening:**

The scent of day-old coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Stanley's Small Business Solutions. It was April 14th, and the clock ticked with the malevolent glee of a schoolyard bully tormenting a smaller kid. Arthur Percival Finch, meticulously organized, perpetually perspiring, and generally unflappable, felt a bead of sweat trickle down his temple despite the arctic blast emanating from the aging air conditioner. He adjusted his spectacles, the familiar weight somehow comforting in the swirling chaos around him. Tonight, he knew, would be a marathon of receipts, deductions, and the quiet sobs of self-employed artists facing down the barrel of Schedule C.

**Setting:**

Stanley's Small Business Solutions occupied a cramped, second-floor office above a struggling pet grooming business on Elm Street in the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Ohio. The building itself was a testament to faded glory, its once-bright yellow paint peeling like sunburnt skin. Inside, the d√©cor was strictly functional: mismatched desks salvaged from various garage sales, plastic filing cabinets overflowing with manila folders, and a perpetually jammed printer that Arthur affectionately referred to as "The Devil's Chariot." A motivational poster featuring a kitten clinging to a branch, captioned "Hang In There!", hung crookedly above Arthur's desk, its message more ironic than inspiring. The only personal touch in the whole place was a small, framed photograph of Arthur's prize-winning zucchini from the Willow Creek County Fair, a silent testament to his ability to coax order and growth from even the most unlikely of subjects. The walls were thin, and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of poodle fur being trimmed downstairs provided a constant, strangely soothing backdrop to the impending tax-day pandemonium.
