The late afternoon sun, a hazy apricot orb sinking behind the skeletal branches of the bare oaks, cast long, dancing shadows across the freshly raked gravel. Ebenezer Silas Hawthorne, a man whose hands knew the texture of soil better than the feel of polished mahogany, squinted at the manicured expanse. He’d spent the entire day coaxing life back into the neglected garden of Mrs. Abernathy’s stately Victorian, and the ache in his lower back was a testament to his efforts.

The setting was the affluent, almost suffocatingly picturesque town of Oakhaven, Connecticut. Houses, each more grandiose than the last, lined streets paved with cobblestone and shaded by centuries-old trees. It was a town steeped in tradition and secrets, a place where manicured lawns and carefully curated appearances were valued above all else. And Ebenezer, despite being the best landscaper within a fifty-mile radius, always felt like a slightly unkempt weed in its perfectly sculpted flowerbed. He knew the difference between a hybrid tea rose and a floribunda, but he still felt more comfortable in his worn denim overalls than a tailored suit. He belonged in the dirt, not in the drawing rooms he occasionally glimpsed through sparkling clean windows. He was the man who made the perfect facade possible, but he was never invited to admire it from within.
