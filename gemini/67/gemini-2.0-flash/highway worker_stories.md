Okay, here's a story opening, complete with setting and main character introduction:

**Story Opening:**

The screech of metal on asphalt was a sound Arthur "Art" McKinley had come to both hate and rely on. It meant work, which meant a paycheck. But on a Monday morning, with the desert sun already hammering down on his sweat-stained hard hat, it also meant a fresh kind of misery. The drill bit chewed into the sun-baked surface, spitting out grit and sending vibrations through the handle that rattled Art's teeth. He adjusted his grip, the orange gloves chafing against his skin, and tried to focus on the task at hand: installing another reflective marker along a particularly treacherous curve of Highway 395.

He glanced up, squinting against the glare. Another eighteen-wheeler, a behemoth hauling God-knew-what, roared past, its wind buffeting him and coating his face in a fine layer of dust. Art coughed, spitting out the gritty taste. This stretch of the 395 was a killer, known for its blind spots and the sheer, unadulterated boredom it inflicted on long-haul drivers. Which, he figured, was probably why they needed so many damn reflective markers to keep them from careening off into the scrub.

Art sighed and went back to his task. It was going to be a long, hot day. A day like any other. Or at least, that's what he thought until he unearthed something from the hardpan that definitely wasn't a rock.

**Setting:**

The story is set along a remote stretch of Highway 395 in the high desert of California. Think scrub brush, Joshua trees, endless horizons, and a relentless sun. The highway itself is a long, straight ribbon of asphalt, occasionally punctuated by winding curves and treacherous drop-offs. The air is dry and the wind is constant, often carrying dust and grit across the landscape. The nearest town, Lone Pine, is a good 45 minutes away, a small oasis of gas stations, motels, and a few struggling diners clinging to life along the highway.

**Main Character:**

**Full Name:** Arthur "Art" McKinley
**Occupation:** Highway Worker
**Brief Description:** Art is a man in his late 40s, weathered by years of working outdoors. He's a quiet, practical type, not prone to flights of fancy. He takes pride in his work, even if it's monotonous, and is generally content with a simple life. He's seen a lot of strange things along the highway over the years, but nothing quite like what he's about to discover.

I hope that gets you off to a good start! Let me know if you'd like any more details or ideas.
