The late afternoon sun, filtered through grime-streaked windows, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cavernous studio. Dust motes danced in the golden rays, swirling around discarded canvases and half-empty turpentine jars. The air, thick with the scent of linseed oil and forgotten dreams, clung to the back of your throat.

Eleanor wasn't looking at the canvas currently mounted, a half-finished portrait of a wilting sunflower. No, her gaze was fixed on the cobblestone street visible through the aforementioned grimy window, a street that had been her muse, her tormentor, and her home for the last forty years: Rue de la Pompe, in the heart of Montmartre, Paris.
