Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the main character's full name:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of "Shear Bliss" hummed, casting a sterile glow on the chipped Formica countertops. Elara Beatrice Finch, master hair cutter and owner of this particular establishment, stared at the reflection of her perpetually tired face in the dusty mirror. Rain lashed against the storefront window, turning the sleepy town of Harmony Creek into a blurry watercolor painting. Another Tuesday, another day battling bad perms and existential dread. Elara sighed, pushing a stray strand of her own unruly, auburn hair behind her ear. At least the rain would keep Mrs. Higgins and her weekly blue rinse appointment away. Today, Elara thought, today might be the day she finally perfected the art of perfectly symmetrical bangs, or at least, managed to avoid a single customer crying before noon.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Harmony Creek, a small, somewhat isolated town in rural Oregon. It's a place where gossip travels faster than the local bus, and the highlight of the week is the Friday night bingo game at the community center. "Shear Bliss" is located on the town's main street, a collection of aging storefronts that have seen better days. The salon itself is a testament to the late 80s, with pink-and-grey color scheme, outdated magazines scattered on the waiting area table, and the lingering scent of hairspray and cheap perm solution.
