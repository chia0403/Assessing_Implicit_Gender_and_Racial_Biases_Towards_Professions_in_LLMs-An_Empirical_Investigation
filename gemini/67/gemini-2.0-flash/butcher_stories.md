## Story Opening:

The first rays of dawn, pale and hesitant, painted the cobblestones of Shepherd's Row a watery grey.  The air, thick with the scent of coal smoke and damp earth, clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He pushed open the heavy oak door of Thorne & Sons, his father's butcher shop, the hinges groaning a familiar protest that echoed in the narrow street.  The cool, cavernous interior offered a welcome respite from the chill, though its own distinct aroma of blood, sawdust, and spice was, perhaps, not for everyone. Elias, however, breathed it in deeply, a habit ingrained since he was a boy barely tall enough to see over the chopping block. Today, like every other day, Elias Thorne had meat to prepare.

## Setting:

The story unfolds in the fictional town of Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling hills of the Yorkshire Dales, England, circa 1888. Oakhaven is a bustling market town, centered around its vibrant marketplace.  Shepherd's Row, where Thorne & Sons is located, is one of the oldest streets in the town, characterized by its narrow, winding lanes, tightly packed buildings, and the constant flow of farmers, merchants, and townsfolk going about their business.

**Thorne & Sons itself is a place of contrasts:**

*   **The Front:** A pristine display of carefully arranged cuts of meat – joints of beef glistening with rendered fat, rows of plump sausages threaded together, and plump chickens hanging from hooks. White-tiled walls are scrubbed clean daily, and the large window is meticulously polished, showcasing Elias’s artistry to passersby.

*   **The Back:** A more utilitarian space, dimly lit and smelling strongly of blood. Here, amidst the clatter of cleavers and the whir of the sausage-making machine, the real work happens.  Large hooks hang from the ceiling, bearing the carcasses of sheep, pigs, and cattle. Wooden chopping blocks, stained with years of use, stand as silent witnesses to countless slaughters and preparations.

The shop is more than just a place of business; it's a cornerstone of Oakhaven's community, a place where locals gather to gossip, share news, and of course, purchase their daily meat.  It's a place steeped in tradition, a place where Elias Thorne is both revered and relied upon.
