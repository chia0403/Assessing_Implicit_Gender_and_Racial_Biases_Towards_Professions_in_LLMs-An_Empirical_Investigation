**Story Opening:**

The turbulence hit without warning, a violent shudder that sent the breakfast cart skidding across the galley floor. Steam hissed from the coffee pot, scalding the linoleum in a brown, bitter stain. Eleanor Anya Petrova grabbed the nearest overhead bin, her knuckles bone-white against the polished aluminum. Years of flying hadn't dulled the primal fear that coiled in her stomach whenever the plane bucked like a wild bronco. She took a deep, steadying breath, reciting the emergency procedures in her head â€“ brace positions, oxygen mask deployment, evacuation slides. Routine, routine, routine. That's what kept her sane.

**Setting:**

The story begins aboard a Boeing 777, flight AZ124, somewhere over the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. The flight is en route from Rome, Italy, to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. The cabin is a mix of hushed slumber and quiet conversation, the soft glow of individual reading lights illuminating a landscape of weary faces and travel pillows. Outside, the inky blackness is punctuated only by the distant flicker of stars and the occasional wingtip light, a lonely beacon in the vast, empty sky. The air, recycled and filtered, has that particular sterile scent unique to airplanes: a blend of antiseptic cleaner, jet fuel, and the faintest hint of stale coffee.
