The scent of hyacinth, sharp and sweet, stung Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's nostrils as she wrestled a particularly thorny branch of rambling rose.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, gothic-arched windows of her workshop, painted dusty stripes across the concrete floor, illuminating swirling motes of pollen.  "Bloody roses," she muttered, the words lost in the humid, flower-heavy air. "More trouble than they're worth."

Eleanor's Haven, nestled in the shadow of St. Bartholomew's cathedral in the heart of the old market district, was a haven only in name. The building, a former blacksmith's forge, was cavernous and perpetually damp.  Iron rings, remnants of its past life, still clung to the brick walls, now adorned with rusty climbing frames for honeysuckle and clematis.  Outside, the cacophony of the marketplace rose and fell like a tide, the hawkersâ€™ shouts and the rumble of delivery vans a constant counterpoint to the quiet beauty she cultivated within.

This morning, however, even the market noise seemed muted, dulled by the oppressive humidity that hung thick in the air, promising a storm. Eleanor knew the weather was bad for business.  Weddings avoided the risk of downpours, funerals felt heavier under the looming clouds.  She sighed, snipping off a rogue thorn with unnecessary force. Today, it seemed, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth would be spending more time talking to her roses than selling them.
