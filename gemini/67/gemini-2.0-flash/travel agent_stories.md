The fluorescent lights of "Escape Now!" hummed with a nervous energy, mirroring the flutter in Eleanor Isobel Hawthorne's stomach. Outside, a relentless London drizzle painted the window in streaks of grey, a stark contrast to the vibrant, sun-drenched posters advertising the turquoise waters of the Maldives or the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps that adorned the walls of her small, somewhat dusty office. Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, adjusted her slightly lopsided glasses, the faint scent of jasmine tea clinging to her cardigan. It was Monday morning, the start of what she hoped would be a less chaotic week than the last. Last week involved a cancelled honeymoon in Santorini, a lost passport in Bangkok, and a near fist-fight over a misbooked cruise to Alaska (apparently, not everyone considered icebergs "romantic"). Today, she desperately needed a win, a happy customer, a destination that sparked joy rather than panic. She just hoped someone, anyone, would walk through the door willing to trade the drab reality of a London autumn for a slice of paradise.
