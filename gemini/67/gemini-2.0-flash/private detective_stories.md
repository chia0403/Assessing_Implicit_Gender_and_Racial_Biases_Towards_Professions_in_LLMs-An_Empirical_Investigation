## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The stale smell of stale cigarettes and cheap whiskey hung heavy in the air, clinging to the threadbare velvet curtains like a persistent ghost. Outside, the neon sign for "Rosie's Diner" flickered erratically, casting a lurid red glow across the chipped linoleum of my office floor. Rain, a constant companion in this godforsaken city, hammered against the windowpane, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the drumming in my own skull. I took another swig of the lukewarm coffee, grimacing at the bitter taste. Just another Tuesday night in the life of Jack Stratton...or, as my mother would insist, Johnathan Stratton, Private Investigator.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Rain City, a fictional metropolis heavily inspired by 1940s noir films and real-life Seattle**. It's perpetually shrouded in mist and rain, giving the city a gloomy and melancholic atmosphere. Towering art deco buildings jostle for space with dilapidated warehouses and dimly lit alleys, creating a labyrinthine urban landscape. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked asphalt, exhaust fumes, and the faint aroma of saltwater from the nearby docks. The city is a melting pot of cultures, teeming with both hardworking immigrants and shadowy figures lurking in the underbelly of society. Rosie's Diner, just across the street from Jack Stratton's office, serves as a greasy spoon haven for late-night patrons and weary souls, offering cheap eats and strong coffee. Jack's office, located in the run-down "Anchor Building" on the less savory side of town, is a testament to his struggling career: a cramped space cluttered with overflowing ashtrays, dusty files, and a perpetually ringing landline that rarely brings good news.
