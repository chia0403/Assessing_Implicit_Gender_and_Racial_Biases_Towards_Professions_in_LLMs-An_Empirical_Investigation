**Opening:**

The rhythmic click of the adding machine was Beatrice Ainsworth's morning mantra. Click-click-click, the sound punctuated the otherwise suffocating silence of the Sterling & Stone accounting department. At exactly 8:53 AM, it would be punctuated further by Mr. Archibald Stone's arrival, signaled by the creak of the floorboards outside his corner office and the subsequent grumbling about the lukewarm coffee Beatrice had dared to make the day before. Today, however, the rhythm was slightly off. Beatrice had been staring at the same column of numbers for the past ten minutes, her mind a thousand miles away, not on the impending doom of balancing the books, but on the chipped nail polish on her left thumb and the dizzying possibility of...escape.

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. Sterling & Stone, Chartered Accountants, occupied the entire third floor of a drab, brick building on Wall Street. The interior was a testament to the stifling conformity of the era: rows of grey metal desks, each meticulously aligned and topped with a green blotter, stretched out under the harsh glare of fluorescent lights. Walls, painted a soul-crushing beige, were adorned with framed diplomas and the occasional motivational poster featuring a cartoon bee buzzing about the importance of hard work. The air was thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke, cheap coffee, and the ever-present anxiety that clung to the very fabric of the place. Beatrice's small desk, tucked between the filing cabinets and the water cooler, felt less like a workspace and more like a holding cell. The only splashes of color were the vase of slightly wilted carnations Beatrice brought in every Monday and the vibrant, hand-painted map of Italy she kept hidden beneath a stack of invoices â€“ a secret reminder of a life she longed to lead.
