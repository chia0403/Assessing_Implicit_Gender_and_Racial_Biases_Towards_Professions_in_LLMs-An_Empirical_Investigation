The rising sun, a molten orange smear across the vast prairie sky, painted the dust motes dancing in the air of Jedediah Silas Blackwood’s barn a fiery gold. The smell of hay, manure, and the faint, sweet perfume of ripening wheat clung to the rough-hewn timbers like stubborn memories. Jedediah, his weathered face etched with the map of a hard life under the Kansas sun, paused in his milking, the rhythmic squelch of his hands on Bessie’s udder momentarily still.

He wasn't looking at the cow, though Bessie deserved his attention. She was a good milker, sturdy and reliable, unlike the weather these past few years. Jedediah's gaze was fixed on the horizon, a blurry line where the amber fields met the turquoise sky. He was watching for clouds, the kind that brought relief, the kind that could mean the difference between a meager harvest and a decent one.

He knew the signs - the way the wind shifted, the unsettling silence of the birds, the aching throb in his old knee. Today felt different. Today felt like a promise, or maybe a threat, depending on which way the wind blew. This farm, Blackwood Acres, had been in his family for generations, wrested from the unforgiving land with blood, sweat, and a stubborn refusal to give up. But lately, the land was fighting back.
