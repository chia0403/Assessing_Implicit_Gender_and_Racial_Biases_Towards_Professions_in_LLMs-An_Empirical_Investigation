The fluorescent lights of the open house buzzed overhead, a relentless symphony of monotony that mirrored Beatrice Penelope Hawthorne’s day. Beatrice, a real estate agent with a name that belonged in a Victorian novel and a temperament that leaned more towards pragmatic exhaustion, adjusted the already-perfectly-centered "Welcome!" sign on the polished mahogany table. Outside, a relentless drizzle painted the manicured lawns of Hawthorne Glen, an affluent but stubbornly stagnant housing development on the outskirts of Asheville, North Carolina.

Hawthorne Glen was Beatrice's territory, for better or for worse. Nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the development promised luxury living with panoramic views and a close-knit community. In reality, it offered exorbitant HOA fees, slightly-off-center cobblestone driveways, and a population mostly comprised of retired CEOs who communicated solely through passive-aggressive Nextdoor posts about misplaced garbage cans and the inappropriate shade of lavender used by Mrs. Abernathy on Lot 42.

Today, Beatrice was hosting the open house for number 17 Honeysuckle Lane, a four-bedroom, three-bath colonial with a gourmet kitchen that even she, a woman who subsisted mainly on instant coffee and lukewarm leftovers, had to admit was impressive. The house was beautiful, the price was right, and the weather was… Asheville-in-November predictable. Yet, Beatrice had a sinking feeling that, like most of her open houses at Hawthorne Glen, this one would be attended only by Brenda from across the street, who just enjoyed stealing complimentary cookies and complaining about the neighborhood's dwindling deer population.

She sighed, straightened her navy blazer (again), and pasted on the professional, yet approachable, smile she'd perfected over years of dealing with picky buyers and oblivious sellers. Showtime.
