## Story Opening:

The wind, a howling, bitter thing off Lake Michigan, clawed at the edges of Arthur Percival Griffith's worn work gloves. He spit a stream of chewing tobacco juice, aiming for a rusty nail lying forlornly on the slate roof, and missed. "Damn it," he muttered, the sound swallowed by the gusts. He hated days like this, days that turned a simple re-shingling job into a battle against the elements. But bills didn't pay themselves, and Mrs. Henderson's leak, according to her increasingly frantic phone calls, was threatening to turn her attic into an indoor swimming pool.

## Setting:

The late afternoon sun, struggling to pierce the thick November clouds, cast a weak, watery light over the Victorian houses that lined Milwaukee's East Side. These grand, aging dames, built in an era of opulent detail and sturdy craftsmanship, were Arthur's bread and butter. Each possessed a character as distinct as its intricate gingerbread trim and gabled roofs. Today, he was perched precariously on the sloping roof of a two-and-a-half story home on Terrace Avenue, overlooking the icy grey expanse of the lake. The air, thick with the smell of wet leaves and impending snow, carried the distant, mournful wail of a freighter horn. Mrs. Henderson's house, a faded yellow with peeling green trim, was sandwiched between a newly renovated brick mansion and a ramshackle boarding house whose occupants seemed to consist entirely of cats and the faint aroma of stale beer. It was a neighborhood in transition, a mix of the well-to-do and the barely-getting-by, a microcosm of Milwaukee itself. And Arthur, with his calloused hands and practical wisdom, was one of the unsung caretakers, battling the ravages of time and weather, one shingle at a time.
