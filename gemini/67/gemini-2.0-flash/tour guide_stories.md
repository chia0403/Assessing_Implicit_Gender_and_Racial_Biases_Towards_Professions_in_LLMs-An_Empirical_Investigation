## Story Opening:

The damp, salty air hung heavy, clinging to Amelia "Mia" Bellweather's hair as she waited on the cobbled dock. Another day, another gaggle of eager (and often clueless) tourists ready to be initiated into the secrets of Port Blossom. The first rays of dawn, painting the sky in shades of apricot and rose, did little to pierce the persistent gloom that seemed to perpetually shroud the old fishing town. Mia pulled her worn, navy pea coat tighter, the brass buttons cold against her skin. She hated these early morning tours, but they paid the best, catering to the "serious history buffs" who were apparently unfazed by potential hypothermia and the distinct aroma of rotting seaweed. Today's group, according to the manifest, was a mix of birdwatchers and genealogy enthusiasts. Just the thought made her inwardly groan. Birds and bloodlines â€“ two topics guaranteed to test even her well-honed patience.

## Setting:

**Port Blossom, Maine.** A small, isolated town clinging precariously to the rugged coastline. The harbor is its heart, bustling with fishing boats (more weathered than seaworthy, in most cases) and the occasional lobster trap. Buildings are a mix of sturdy, salt-box style homes painted in muted shades of grey, blue, and seafoam green, interspersed with newer, pastel-colored tourist shops selling everything from taffy to miniature lighthouses. A dense forest, rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of forgotten sailors, encroaches upon the town from the west, adding to its sense of isolation. The air is thick with the scent of the sea, mixed with the pungent aroma of fish and the faint, metallic tang of something ancient and buried. The town is steeped in local lore and whispered legends, a place where history feels less like a story and more like a living, breathing presence.
