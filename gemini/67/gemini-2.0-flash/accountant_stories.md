## Opening:

The fluorescent hum of the office lights was a persistent, maddening lullaby to Reginald Arthur Fitzwilliam, a lullaby that tonight, sounded less like sleep and more like a ticking clock. He leaned back in his ergonomic chair, its mesh digging into his damp shirt. Outside, the rain hammered against the towering glass of the Zenith Investments building, each drop a percussive reminder of the storm brewing inside him. The spreadsheets swam before his eyes, a sea of numbers threatening to drown him in red ink.

Reginald scrubbed at his tired face, pushing his spectacles further up his nose. He’d been at this for twelve hours straight, chasing a ghost in the ledger, a phantom discrepancy that was threatening to unravel a multi-million dollar deal. He was close, he could feel it in the dull ache behind his temples, but close wasn't good enough. Close didn’t appease Mr. Harding, the notoriously ruthless CEO of Zenith Investments. Close just meant another night spent staring at the cold, unforgiving glow of his monitor, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the crushing weight of expectation.

## Setting:

The story primarily takes place in the high-rise office of **Zenith Investments**, located on the 47th floor of a newly constructed glass tower in downtown **Chicago**. The office is modern and sleek, a testament to Zenith's success. Polished concrete floors are offset by strategically placed plants and abstract art pieces. Cubicles are arranged in neat rows, separated by frosted glass partitions, fostering an atmosphere of professional efficiency, but also a subtle sense of isolation.

Reginald’s own cubicle, nestled in the corner of the accounting department, is a microcosm of his personality: meticulously organized, yet slightly cluttered. Files are stacked with military precision, each label perfectly aligned. But scattered amongst them are personal touches: a framed photo of his ginger cat, Clementine, staring disdainfully at the camera; a miniature Eiffel Tower he picked up during a brief, ill-fated vacation to Paris; and a half-eaten box of artisanal chocolates – a desperate attempt to combat the late-night sugar cravings that had become his constant companions.

The overall atmosphere is one of high pressure and relentless ambition. The air hums with the quiet, constant click-clack of keyboards and the hushed whispers of deals being brokered. Even after hours, a select few remain, hunched over their desks, driven by the promise of success and the fear of failure. The city lights twinkling below offer a stark contrast to the stark, artificial light within, a constant reminder of the vibrant life outside that Reginald is currently missing.
