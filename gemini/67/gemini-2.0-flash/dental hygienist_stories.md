The scent of spearmint mouthwash clung to the air, a deceptive sweetness that rarely masked the underlying anxieties of the patients waiting their turn in Dr. Henderson's brightly-lit, but undeniably sterile, office. This Monday morning was no different. A fidgety teenager picked at a loose thread on his jeans, while a matronly woman flipped through a tattered copy of "Good Housekeeping," a grimace flitting across her face every time she turned a page. For **Eleanor Marie Dubois**, this was just another day at the office, albeit one with a particularly pungent odor wafting from examination room three.

Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, straightened the already immaculate tray holding a scaler, mirror, and explorer. She was a creature of routine, finding solace in the precise order and clean lines of her profession. Her pale blonde hair, always pulled back into a neat bun, gleamed under the fluorescent lights, and her crisp, white uniform was devoid of any stains or wrinkles. But beneath the composed exterior, a tiny seed of restlessness had begun to sprout, a feeling that polishing teeth and flossing gums wasn't quite the grand adventure she'd envisioned for herself.

The setting was Bayview, a sleepy coastal town nestled on the Oregon coast. The town was known for its breathtaking sunsets, charming antique shops, and an unnaturally high number of dentists, leading to cutthroat competition and a perpetually anxious Ellie wondering if Dr. Henderson was contemplating replacing her with a newer, younger, and possibly less thorough hygienist. Outside, the promise of a crisp, salty breeze danced on the air, but inside, Eleanor felt trapped in a minty-fresh purgatory, destined to forever battle plaque and tartar in the charming, yet undeniably predictable, confines of Bayview Dental.
