The dust devils danced like miniature dervishes across the parched earth of the Circle K Ranch, mimicking the frantic rhythm in Eleanor Mae Kendrick's chest. The late afternoon sun, a molten coin in the vast Montana sky, cast long, skeletal shadows from the wind-battered windmills that dotted the horizon. Eleanor, wiping the sweat from her brow with a calloused hand, squinted at the approaching pickup truck. It was old man Henderson, and she could tell from the grim set of his jaw, visible even from this distance, that whatever news he brought wouldn't be good.

For over a century, Kendricks had wrestled a living from the unforgiving land, braving droughts, blizzards, and fluctuating cattle prices. But this felt different. The bank was breathing down her neck, the cattle were thinner than she liked, and the relentless sun had already baked the promise out of this year's grazing. Now, Henderson, a fellow rancher and her closest neighbor, was driving up with a look that could curdle milk. Eleanor braced herself, the dry, crackling earth beneath her boots the only constant in a world that felt like it was rapidly slipping away.
