The stale scent of beer, regret, and desperation hung heavier than usual in The Rusty Mug tonight. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside the skeletal remains of Franklin Delano Roosevelt "Frankie" O'Malley. He squeezed another lime, the sour juice splashing onto his calloused hand, and barely registered it. Frankie had seen worse things than lime juice splash onto him in his six years tending bar at this den of iniquity on the wrong side of New Orleans' French Quarter.

The Rusty Mug was a dive, plain and simple. Not the hip, ironically-decorated kind of dive, but the kind where you feared catching something off the chipped Formica bar top. The low hum of the neon "Open" sign fought a losing battle against the mournful wail of a blues harmonica sputtering from the ancient jukebox in the corner. Sticky spills adhered to the floor, catching the cheap, red paper napkins that patrons carelessly tossed aside. The only artwork consisted of faded pictures of local Saints victories from decades past and a hand-drawn sign above the restroom that simply read, "Consider Yourself Warned."

Tonight, the usual motley crew were present. "Fingers" Malone, the wizened card sharp, was nursing a whiskey at the corner booth, his knuckles like gnarled tree roots. Madame Evangeline, the fortune teller with eyes that seemed to see right through you, was whispering intently to a nervous-looking tourist, her clinking bangles a counterpoint to the harmonica's lament. And lurking near the back, shrouded in shadow, was "Silas," a man Frankie knew better than to know too much about.

Frankie wiped down the bar, the damp cloth doing little to alleviate the stickiness. He knew, deep down, that something was about to happen. The air crackled with a nervous energy, a pre-storm stillness more potent than the hurricane brewing outside. He just hoped whatever it was wouldn't involve him. After all, Frankie just wanted to get through another night, pour a few drinks, and maybe, just maybe, forget about the ghosts that haunted him just as surely as the Rusty Mug was haunted by the ghosts of good times long gone.
