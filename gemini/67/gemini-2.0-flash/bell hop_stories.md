Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and a main character named Archibald Finch, a bellhop:

**Setting:** The grand lobby of the Hotel Magnifique in New Orleans, Louisiana. It's a sweltering late afternoon in August, the air thick with humidity that seeps even through the heavy, velvet drapes. Sunlight filters dimly through the stained-glass windows depicting scenes of Louisiana history – steamboats on the Mississippi, bustling cotton fields, and the solemn signing of treaties. The scent of jasmine and decay hangs heavy in the air, a signature perfume of the city. Polished marble floors reflect the ornate chandeliers, and the murmur of hushed conversations blends with the distant sounds of a jazz band tuning up somewhere deeper inside the hotel.

**Opening:**

Archibald Finch adjusted the brim of his ridiculously oversized bellhop hat, the stiff fabric itching at his forehead. Sweat beaded on his upper lip despite the valiant efforts of the lobby's antiquated air conditioning. He watched, with practiced disinterest, as a woman draped in enough diamonds to buy a small country fussed with her oversized poodle. The Hotel Magnifique was full of them – the wealthy, the eccentric, the utterly oblivious. He was invisible to them, a mere prop in their gilded lives.

Archibald had been invisible for the past five years, ever since he had started working at the Hotel Magnifique. Now, he was 22, an invisible fixture of the hotel. He had started working here after his father died, and he needed a job to help support his mother and little sister. "Archibald Finch, at your service, ma'am," he murmured mechanically, already calculating the size of the potential tip based on the quality of the poodle's fur. He didn't dare let his mind wander, not during a shift. Not when a single misplaced thought could conjure the ghosts he so desperately tried to keep at bay.
