The humid Atlanta air hung thick and heavy, even in the early morning. Eleanor Vance navigated the maze of overflowing azalea bushes bordering Mrs. Abernathy's driveway, a weary sigh escaping her lips. She could practically taste the sugar-sweet magnolia blossoms clinging to the breeze, a scent she usually adored, but today it only amplified the mounting anxiety churning in her stomach. Today was presentation day. Today, Eleanor would either cement her reputation as the next big thing in Atlanta interior design, or crash and burn in a spectacular display of floral chintz and questionable color palettes.

Mrs. Abernathy's Italianate villa loomed before her, a palatial monument to old money and even older, stuffier sensibilities. Eleanor adjusted the strap of her oversized leather tote, the weight of fabric swatches and design boards digging into her shoulder. This project, this house, represented everything Eleanor Vance Interior Design was working towards: a foothold in the upper echelon, a chance to break free from the endless parade of beige condos and hastily flipped craftsman bungalows. Now, all she had to do was convince Mrs. Abernathy that her vision of "modernized classic" wasn't simply "sacrilege" in expensive wallpaper.
