## The Story Opening:

The chipped ceramic of Mrs. Higgins’ prize-winning rose teacup trembled in Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's hand. It wasn't the tremors of old age, but the low, guttural rumble emanating from the bowels of the house itself that made the porcelain dance. Eleanor paused, her feather duster suspended mid-air above the mahogany dining table. It had started subtly – a barely perceptible vibration that she’d initially dismissed as the distant thunder of summer storms rolling in off the moor. But this felt different. This felt...angry.

Eleanor, a woman who prided herself on the meticulous order and quiet calm she brought to even the most chaotic of households, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. She took a small, fortifying sip of the lukewarm Earl Grey, the floral scent doing little to soothe the growing tension in the air. The rumble intensified, accompanied by a low moan that seemed to echo from the very stones of Blackwood Manor.

“Right then,” she muttered to herself, placing the teacup down with a resolute click. “No good standing about like a ninny. Best get to the bottom of this.”

## The Setting:

**Blackwood Manor** stands perched precariously on the edge of a windswept moor in the remote reaches of North Yorkshire, England. A sprawling, gothic edifice built from dark, imposing stone, it is a testament to generations of the Blackwood family and their somewhat eccentric history.

The interior is a labyrinth of echoing hallways, shadowed rooms, and winding staircases. Grand, though faded, tapestries depict scenes of hunts and battles, their colors muted with age. Dust motes dance in the shafts of light that pierce through the towering, leaded glass windows.

Antique furniture, shrouded in dust sheets for most of the year, fills the rooms – ornate chairs with clawed feet, towering bookcases filled with leather-bound tomes, and imposing portraits of stern-faced Blackwood ancestors that seem to follow Eleanor with their eyes. The air is thick with the scent of beeswax, damp stone, and the faintest, lingering aroma of lavender – a scent Eleanor painstakingly maintains in her efforts to combat the pervasive mustiness.

The Manor is largely deserted, inhabited only by the current, reclusive Lord Blackwood, a man rumored to be as eccentric and enigmatic as the house itself. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, a woman of fifty-seven with a sharp wit, even sharper eye for detail, and an unwavering dedication to her duties, is its sole housekeeper and the only consistent human presence in the aging, echoing halls of Blackwood Manor. And she, tonight, had the distinct feeling that she was not alone.
