It smelled of pine resin, wet earth, and something else, something metallic and ancient that always seemed to permeate the air deep in the Olympic National Forest. Mist swirled between the towering cedars and hemlocks, their canopies lost in the grey. It was a world of emerald and slate, a place where the sun rarely dared to peek through the dense foliage.

Silas, his beard still slick from the morning drizzle despite the brim of his weathered Stetson, adjusted the chokers on the massive log he was preparing to yard. His muscles, honed from years of wrestling timber, strained against the worn canvas of his plaid shirt. The roar of the skidder engine, a guttural growl in the otherwise silent forest, was a familiar comfort. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the undergrowth, the sound swallowed by the damp earth. Today was just another day, another tree to fell, another log to haul. But Silas had a feeling, a prickling unease at the back of his neck, that this particular day held something different, something unsettling hidden beneath the ancient boughs. He just couldnâ€™t shake the feeling he was being watched.
