The biting wind whipped across the tarmac, stinging Amelia Iris Holloway's cheeks as she tightened the strap of her leather flight helmet. The Alaskan sun, a weak and watery presence even at noon in late October, barely pierced the thick, grey clouds that clung to the peaks surrounding Bethel. Her breath plumed out in ragged bursts, momentarily obscuring the tail number of the venerable de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter she was pre-flighting: N347AS.

Bethel Municipal Airport, a collection of weathered hangars and a single, overworked diner, was buzzing with a nervous energy. The weekly mail run to the remote village of Aniak was crucial, carrying not just letters and packages, but also essential supplies: medicine, parts for snowmobiles, and the latest issue of "Alaska Magazine" that everyone seemed to devour within hours. Amelia knew the villagers relied on her, and on the Otter, with a quiet intensity that both humbled and terrified her.

The radio crackled to life in her headset. "Eagle Air One, this is Bethel Tower. Winds gusting to twenty-five knots, visibility limited. Recommend postponing, Holloway."

Amelia paused, her gloved hand hovering over the fuel tank gauge. She glanced towards the horizon, a jagged line of black against the swirling grey. Postponing meant the villagers wouldn't get their supplies, not today anyway. It meant potential delays, compounding frustrations in a place where patience was already stretched thin.

She keyed the microphone. "Bethel Tower, this is Eagle Air One. Understood. Request weather update in fifteen. I'm going to take a look at the sky myself."
