## Opening:

The shriek of the hyrax was piercing enough to cut through the morning fog clinging to the African enclosure. Eleanor Rose Albright, bundled in her worn, olive green Carhartt jacket, winced and quickened her pace towards the sound. Her breath plumed white in the frigid pre-dawn air. "Alright, alright, hold your horses, little guys," she muttered, already picturing the possible scenarios: a territorial squabble, a rogue mongoose slinking in from the savanna exhibit, or, the ever-dreaded, a particularly feisty sunbird invading their carefully curated rock piles. Eleanor had dealt with them all before, and, hopefully, would again this morning. She trusted her hyraxes; they were usually only this vocal when something was genuinely amiss.

## Setting:

The story takes place at the **Wildhaven Wildlife Sanctuary**, a sprawling, privately owned sanctuary nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. Wildhaven boasts over 200 acres of meticulously designed habitats, mimicking ecosystems from around the globe. They pride themselves on their dedication to conservation and education, taking in rescued and rehabilitated animals from all over the world. 

Eleanor's primary area of responsibility is the **African Savanna Exhibit**, a vast, undulating landscape that includes enclosures for meerkats, hyraxes, several species of gazelle, and a pride of majestic (and notoriously grumpy) lions. The exhibit is a mix of meticulously planned landscaping and untouched natural terrain, creating a somewhat realistic – if slightly miniaturized – vision of the African plains. The air is always thick with the earthy smell of red clay and the faint, persistent odor of animal musk. The Blue Ridge mountains loom in the distance, their peaks often shrouded in mist, providing a stark and beautiful contrast to the vibrant life teeming within the Savanna's boundaries. The sanctuary, though meant to be a safe haven, is not without its dangers, both from the animals themselves and the unpredictable forces of nature.
