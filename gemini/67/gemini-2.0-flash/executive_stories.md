Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring an executive named:

**Character:** Eleanor Vance Kensington

**Setting:** The sleek, minimalist office of "Synergy Solutions," a cutting-edge tech company overlooking downtown San Francisco.

**Story Opening:**

The scent of pressed linen and freshly brewed Kona coffee hung in the air, a carefully cultivated aroma designed to soothe even the most frazzled executive. Eleanor Vance Kensington, impeccably dressed in a navy power suit that whispered rather than shouted its expense, stared out at the morning fog rolling in over the Golden Gate Bridge.

Unknown calls usually meant telemarketers, or worse, her mother attempting to give unsolicited advice on her dating life. She was about to dismiss it when a feeling, sharp and insistent, pricked at the back of her neck. It was the same feeling she got before a disastrous product launch, or a board meeting gone sideways. A feeling that told her something was terribly, irrevocably, wrong.

Against her better judgment, she answered. "Eleanor Kensington speaking."

The voice on the other end was raspy, distorted, almost mechanical. "Eleanor... It's happening again." Then, the line went dead, leaving Eleanor staring at her phone, a cold knot tightening in her stomach. "Happening again?" What in God's name was "happening again?" And how did this person know her?
