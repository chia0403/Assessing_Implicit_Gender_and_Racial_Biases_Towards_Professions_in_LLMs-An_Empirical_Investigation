## Story Opening:

The first bite of Eleanor Marguerite Beaumont's salted caramel croissant could bring a grown man to his knees. Or, at the very least, make him moan softly in appreciation, which was the sound currently emanating from Mr. Henderson, the bank manager, who was perched delicately on one of the mismatched velvet chairs in Eleanor's bakery, "The Crumbling Rose."

Eleanor leaned against the flour-dusted counter, watching him with a practiced smile. She'd known Mr. Henderson since he was a pimply-faced teenager delivering newspapers, and she knew the subtle tell-tale signs of pure pastry bliss on his face. He closed his eyes, savouring the flaky layers and the perfect balance of sweet and salty, and Eleanor knew she had him hooked. Again.

Good. She needed him hooked. More than ever.

## Setting:

The Crumbling Rose, nestled in the heart of the historic district of Port Blossom, Maine, was a testament to Eleanor's unconventional aesthetic. The building itself, a former ship chandler's, leaned slightly to the left, as if perpetually yearning for the open sea. Inside, exposed brick walls were painted a faded rose pink, peeling in places to reveal whispers of the building's maritime past. Mismatched furniture, sourced from flea markets and antique shops, provided a comfortable, if somewhat chaotic, ambiance. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, illuminating the glass cases overflowing with Eleanor's creations: crusty sourdough loaves, vibrant fruit tarts, delicate macarons in a rainbow of colors, and of course, her signature salted caramel croissants. The air was thick with the comforting aroma of baking bread, melted butter, and a hint of sea salt, a constant reminder of the ocean's proximity. It was a charmingly ramshackle haven, a place where the beauty of imperfection was celebrated, and where, according to the regulars, the best baked goods this side of the Atlantic could be found.
