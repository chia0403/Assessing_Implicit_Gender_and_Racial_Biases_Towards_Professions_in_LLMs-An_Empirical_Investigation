## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The grand, echoing halls of the Atherton Conservatory, a renowned institution dedicated to the study and preservation of rare and exotic plants, located in the misty hills just outside of Portland, Oregon. The Conservatory boasted a series of interconnected glasshouses, each meticulously climate-controlled to mimic environments from around the globe. Lush foliage cascaded from every surface, vibrant orchids dripped with condensation, and the air hung thick with the perfume of blooming night-bloomers. At night, under the soft glow of meticulously placed lighting, the place felt less like a scientific institution and more like a forgotten temple swallowed by the jungle.

**Story Opening:**

The insistent buzz of the automatic floor scrubber was the only sound breaking the pre-dawn silence in the Temperate House. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a man whose face held the map of a thousand sleepless nights and a million forgotten messes, guided the machine with practiced ease between rows of towering tree ferns. He hummed a tuneless melody under his breath, a habit born of loneliness and the soothing drone of the scrubber. At 5:00 AM, Bart was the king of the Atherton Conservatory, the sole inhabitant of its humid kingdom, responsible for keeping its floors pristine and its secrets buried.

Tonight, however, the usual symphony of the rainforest was off-key. There was a frantic rustling coming from the section housing the Corpse Flower, a behemoth of a plant currently exhibiting a particularly pungent bloom. Bart sighed, his shoulders slumping. Heâ€™d hoped for a quiet shift, a chance to catch up on the audiobooks he listened to through his noise-cancelling headphones. Now, it sounded like something was tearing through the delicate ecosystem of the Temperate House, and Bart knew, with a sinking feeling in his gut, that he was about to find out what.
