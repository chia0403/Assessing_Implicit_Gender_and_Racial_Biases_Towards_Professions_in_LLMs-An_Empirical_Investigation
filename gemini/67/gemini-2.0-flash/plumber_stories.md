**Story Opening:**

The stench hit Edgar Philip Blackwood before the knock even finished echoing. It was a familiar smell, a pungent blend of decay, stagnant water, and despair â€“ the official aroma of a plumbing emergency in the heart of the sweltering Louisiana summer. Edgar sighed, pushing his reading glasses higher on his nose and reluctantly placing his dog-eared copy of "Moby Dick" back on the cluttered workbench.

He opened the door to a frantic woman with eyes as wide and wild as the overgrown hydrangeas choking the porch of her antebellum home. "Mr. Blackwood, thank goodness! It's... it's coming from everywhere! Please, you have to do something!"

**Setting:**

Edgar Philip Blackwood, a man whose love for literature was only slightly surpassed by his proficiency with a pipe wrench, operated his modest plumbing business, "Blackwood's Best Bends," out of a converted garage in the quaint, historic town of Cypress Bayou, Louisiana. The town itself was a sleepy tapestry of moss-draped oaks, weathered Creole cottages, and the sluggish, ever-present bayou that snaked through its heart. Edgar's garage, crammed with pipes of every size, wrenches of every description, and half-finished projects, was a testament to his organized chaos. The humid air, perpetually thick with the scent of mildew and damp earth, clung to everything, including Edgar himself.
