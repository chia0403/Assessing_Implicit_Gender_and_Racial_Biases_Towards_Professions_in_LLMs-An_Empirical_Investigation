## Opening:

The insistent chirping of a cardinal mocked Dr. Alistair Pembroke’s attempts at meditation. He’d been at it for a solid fifteen minutes, cross-legged on the faded Persian rug of his office, and all he’d managed to achieve was a throbbing lower back and a growing irritation for avian life. He sighed, cracking one eye open to glare at the window. The cardinal, oblivious to his ire, puffed out its chest and unleashed another volley of tweets.

Alistair rubbed his temples. He knew he needed to be calmer, more grounded. His next patient was Mrs. Eleanor Finch, whose anxiety was as pervasive and clinging as the humidity that clung to Charleston air. He needed to be a haven of tranquility, a steady ship in her tempestuous sea of worries. Instead, he felt like a lifeboat spring a leak.

He closed his eyes again, trying to summon the image of a serene lake, shimmering under the midday sun. But the only thing he could conjure was the face of his last patient, a troubled teenager named Liam, and the haunting despair in his eyes. He opened his eyes again, defeated. Meditation was clearly going to have to wait until after five o'clock and a very strong gin and tonic.

He stood, stretching with a groan, and glanced at the small, brass clock on his antique rolltop desk. Five minutes to go. He straightened his tweed jacket, brushed a stray dog hair (courtesy of Barnaby, his perpetually shedding Golden Retriever) off his trousers, and plastered on what he hoped was a professional, yet empathetic, smile. Ready, as he always was, to face the next story, the next fractured mind, the next piece of the human puzzle.

## Setting:

Dr. Alistair Pembroke's practice occupied the second floor of a beautifully restored Victorian building in the historic French Quarter of Charleston, South Carolina. The building, painted a soft, almost ghostly, shade of grey, was adorned with intricate wrought-iron balconies overflowing with vibrant geraniums. The street below, cobblestone and narrow, bustled with tourists and locals alike, the sounds of horse-drawn carriages and street musicians weaving through the humid air.

Inside, Alistair had cultivated an atmosphere of quiet, understated elegance. The waiting room was small but comfortable, furnished with plush armchairs upholstered in muted floral patterns, a mahogany side table stacked with meticulously arranged magazines (mostly nature photography and psychology journals), and a gentle, bubbling fountain that masked the street noise. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, casting a warm glow on the aged wooden floors.

His office, while larger, maintained the same sense of calm. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, overflowing with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and literature, lined one wall. The aforementioned rolltop desk, a family heirloom, held a carefully curated collection of vintage curiosities: a tarnished silver magnifying glass, a collection of smooth, sea-worn stones, and a small, framed photograph of Alistair as a boy, grinning mischievously beside his father on a windswept beach. The Persian rug, faded but still vibrant in its colors, added a touch of warmth and history to the room. A comfortable chaise lounge occupied one corner, offering a space for patients to relax and unwind.

The entire space felt like a sanctuary, a refuge from the bustling world outside, a place where Alistair hoped his patients could feel safe enough to confront their inner demons. It was, after all, a reflection of the man himself: thoughtful, compassionate, and deeply rooted in the past.
