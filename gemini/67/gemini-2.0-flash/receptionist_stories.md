## Story Opening:

The insistent beep of the front desk phone sliced through the relative tranquility of the eleventh floor. Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth sighed, barely suppressing a grimace. It was always something. Just as she’d managed to untangle the Christmas lights (admittedly, two weeks overdue) and was finally about to tackle the overflowing basket of unopened mail, the infernal device demanded her attention.

“Ainsworth, how can I help you?” she chirped, injecting an unnatural amount of sunshine into her voice. Years of dealing with disgruntled clients and impatient executives had honed her phone persona into a weapon of disarming pleasantry.

A gruff voice on the other end barked, "Is Mr. Sterling in?"

Eleanor consulted the meticulously color-coded calendar on her computer screen. "I'm afraid Mr. Sterling is in a meeting until 3 PM, sir. May I take a message?"

"No message. He'll know why I called." The line went dead.

Eleanor frowned. She knew a lot about her coworkers, the higher-ups at least. It was practically a job requirement. Mr. Sterling rarely took calls like that. Ones that felt... ominous. Shaking off the feeling, she returned to the Christmas lights, determined to conquer at least one small corner of the office chaos.

## Setting:

The offices of Sterling & Thorne Investment Group occupied the entire eleventh floor of the gleaming, mirrored skyscraper at 140 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. A monument to power and money, the building was all polished chrome and hushed reverence. Sterling & Thorne, however, was a slightly less polished version of that image.

Eleanor's reception area, strategically positioned to command a view of the entrance and the city beyond, was designed to impress. A sleek, minimalist desk of imported Italian marble sat on a plush, neutral-toned carpet. Expensive, abstract art adorned the walls, none of which Eleanor particularly liked. The overall effect was one of sophisticated blandness, punctuated only by the vibrant splashes of color from Eleanor's slightly disheveled desk.

The rest of the office followed a similar, albeit less rigidly maintained, aesthetic. Glass-walled offices lined the perimeter, offering panoramic views of the city to those who had earned them. The inner offices, for the less successful, were cramped and overlooked cubicles buzzing with activity. The air, perpetually climate-controlled, carried the faint scent of expensive cologne and underlying anxiety. It was a place where fortunes were made and lost, and Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, armed with her wit, her calendar, and a healthy dose of cynicism, was the gatekeeper to it all.
