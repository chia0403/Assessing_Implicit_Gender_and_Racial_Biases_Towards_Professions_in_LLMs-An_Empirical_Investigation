## Story Opening:

The stale, recycled air of Engine 27 tasted like ash and cheap coffee, a familiar blend that clung to the lining of Elias Thorne's throat. He knew that taste. It was the taste of waiting, of readiness humming just beneath the surface of forced calm. He sat perched on the edge of his regulation-issue chair, the worn leather creaking softly under his weight. He wasn't supposed to be nervous. Not after fifteen years on the job. Not after pulling families out of burning apartment blocks, battling infernos in warehouses, and even once, coaxing a stray cat out of a tree after it had mistakenly scaled a fire escape. But tonight, the tension was a tangible thing, radiating from the worn linoleum floor and up the metal legs of the bunk beds.

## Setting:

The setting is the engine room of Fire Station 27, located in the heart of the industrial district of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The station is a brick behemoth, built in the early 1900s, with high ceilings and the echoing acoustics of a cathedral. The walls are painted a utilitarian cream, chipped and stained in places by years of grease, soot, and the occasional splatter of tomato sauce from late-night dinners. A large, metal roll-up door dominates one wall, revealing the gleaming red engine inside, a powerful beast waiting to be unleashed. The room is sparsely furnished with mismatched furniture, a testament to its many inhabitants over the years. A pinboard crammed with notices, family photos, and tattered newspaper clippings hangs precariously above a dented metal desk overflowing with paperwork. The overall atmosphere is one of practical functionality, hinting at the constant state of preparedness that permeates the lives of the firefighters who call this place home. A low, constant hum of the generator provides a dull, rhythmic background to the anticipation in the air.
