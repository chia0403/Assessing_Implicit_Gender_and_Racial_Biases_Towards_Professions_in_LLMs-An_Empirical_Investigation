## Story Opening:

The damp chill of the stone permeated Sergeant Alistair Thorne's bones, a constant reminder that even inside the Citadel's seemingly impenetrable walls, the outside world clawed its way in. He shifted his weight, the worn leather of his breastplate creaking a familiar lament under the weight of his vigil. He had been standing guard at the North Gate for the last eight hours, watching the perpetual drizzle turn the cobbled courtyard into a shimmering, grey mirror. The silence was the worst of it; a suffocating blanket broken only by the rhythmic dripping from the gargoyles leering down from the battlements and the occasional, mournful cry of a seabird circling overhead. He longed for the raucous chatter of the mess hall, the smell of roasting meat, anything to break this monotonous trance. But a guard, especially a sergeant of the Watch, did not complain. A guard, especially Sergeant Alistair Thorne, knew his duty. Even when his eyelids felt heavy and the world began to blur at the edges, he would not waver. Not tonight. Not ever.

## Setting:

The Citadel of Veridian Rise dominated the craggy coastline, a monument of grey stone and unwavering resolve. Perched atop the highest cliffs, it had weathered centuries of storms and sieges, its walls scarred with the battles of ages past. The North Gate, where Alistair stood, was a formidable structure of oak and iron, reinforced with thick layers of steel. Beyond the gate stretched the Whispering Moor, a vast expanse of desolate landscape shrouded in mist and legend. Whispers of ancient magic and forgotten evils clung to the moor like the clinging fog, tales that chilled even the most seasoned veterans. Within the Citadel walls, the air buzzed with the constant activity of soldiers, servants, and dignitaries. A labyrinthine network of corridors and chambers housed armories, barracks, libraries, and the opulent chambers of the ruling council. The scent of salt and iron permeated everything, a constant reminder of the Citadel's purpose: to stand as a bulwark against the encroaching darkness and protect the realm from whatever horrors lurked beyond the walls.
