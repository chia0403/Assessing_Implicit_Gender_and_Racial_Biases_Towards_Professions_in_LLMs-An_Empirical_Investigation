## Story Opening:

The scent of overripe mangoes clung to the humid Miami air as Dr. Eleanor Rose Gutierrez navigated her worn, cherry-red bicycle through Little Havana. She hummed along to Celia Cruz blasting from a nearby bodega, the salsa rhythm a familiar comfort. Today, however, the usual vibrancy felt oppressive, a sticky blanket weighing on her already slumped shoulders. Eleanor adjusted the strap of her overflowing canvas bag, the weight of brochures, measuring spoons, and a half-eaten empanada digging into her collarbone. She needed a cafecito, and she needed it badly.

## Setting:

The story primarily unfolds in Little Havana, Miami. Specifically, the setting encompasses:

*   **Eleanor's small, brightly painted office on Calle Ocho:** A space crammed with colorful cookbooks, anatomical charts, and motivational posters in both English and Spanish. It's a haven for her clients, a place where they can feel comfortable discussing their cultural relationship with food.

*   **Domino Park:** A local gathering spot where older Cuban men passionately debate politics and play dominoes. Eleanor often stops here to observe, gleaning insights into the community's eating habits and social dynamics.

*   **The bustling bodegas and cafes of Little Havana:** These vibrant businesses, overflowing with fresh produce, fragrant spices, and traditional Cuban dishes, are both a source of inspiration and frustration for Eleanor. They represent the rich culinary heritage she wants to preserve, but also the dietary challenges she seeks to address.

*   **The homes of Eleanor's patients:** These range from cramped apartments above busy streets to sprawling suburban houses in the outskirts of Miami. They offer a glimpse into the diverse economic and social realities of her clientele.

The atmosphere is generally warm, humid, and vibrant, reflecting the Cuban culture and energy of Little Havana. However, there's also an undercurrent of struggle, as Eleanor witnesses the challenges of poverty, chronic disease, and cultural displacement affecting her community.
