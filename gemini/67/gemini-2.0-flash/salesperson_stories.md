## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The starkly modern lobby of 'OmniCorp Solutions', a sprawling, glass-and-steel tower piercing the gray Seattle sky. Sleek, uncomfortable chrome chairs dotted the polished concrete floor. A digital waterfall shimmered on one wall, doing little to alleviate the sterile atmosphere. The air hummed with the barely perceptible buzz of unseen machinery.

**Opening:**

"Another rejection, another pointless power lunch of lukewarm salmon and forced smiles," groaned Alistair Finch, slumping against the faux-leather seat in the lobby of OmniCorp Solutions. His tie, a vibrant power-red that screamed 'trust me', felt like a noose slowly tightening. Alistair, Senior Sales Executive for 'Evergreen Innovations', had been trying to land this account for six months. Six months of early mornings, late nights, and increasingly desperate attempts to convince OmniCorp that Evergreen's cloud-based solutions were the key to their exponential growth. He'd even resorted to learning the CEO's bizarre penchant for interpretive dance, a skill Alistair hoped never to utilize again. But all he'd earned was a brusque, dismissive "We'll be in touch," from Ms. Thorne, the CEO, whose ice-cold stare could freeze the Puget Sound. He rubbed his temples, the persistent thrum of a headache building behind his eyes. This wasn't just another lost sale; this was starting to feel like a personal vendetta. Alistair reached for his phone, the cold, smooth surface a small comfort in this monument to corporate indifference. He had a string of increasingly frantic messages from his boss, and the thought of facing his disappointment was almost as painful as the lingering taste of salmon in his mouth. Maybe it was time to consider a career change. Maybe, just maybe, interpretive dance instructor wasn't so far-fetched after all.
