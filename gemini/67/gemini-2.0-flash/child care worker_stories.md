**Opening:**

The rhythmic hum of the dishwasher was Amelia Hayes' favorite sound. Not because she enjoyed cleaning – heaven knew, she’d done enough of that for one lifetime before the age of thirty – but because it signaled the end of the day. The last sticky-fingered masterpiece had been scraped from the table, the last tiny shoe reunited with its mate, and the last heart-wrenching farewells exchanged at the brightly colored cubby wall. Now, blessedly, quiet. Almost.

**Setting:**

Amelia Hayes worked at "Little Sprouts Learning Center," a cheerful, single-story building nestled in the quiet, leafy suburb of Willow Creek. The main room, where she typically spent her days with the "Busy Bees" (the four and five-year-olds), was a kaleidoscope of primary colors and kid-sized furniture. A reading nook, overflowing with well-loved picture books, sat beneath a sunny window. Construction paper cut-outs of bumblebees buzzed from the ceiling, a testament to a particularly enthusiastic art project gone slightly awry. One wall was dedicated to a mural featuring handprints in every conceivable shade, a messy, vibrant chronicle of the children who had passed through its doors. Outside, a small, fenced-in playground boasted a slide, a sandbox perpetually sprinkled with rogue snacks, and a surprisingly robust patch of sunflowers, a gift from a particularly green-thumbed parent last summer. The air inside always smelled faintly of crayons, apple juice, and the slightly cloying aroma of hand sanitizer. It was a chaotic, vibrant, and profoundly exhausting place, but for Amelia, it was home.
