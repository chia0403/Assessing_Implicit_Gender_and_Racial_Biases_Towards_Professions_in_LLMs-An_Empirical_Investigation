Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and introduction to the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent, repetitive thrum of rain against the bay window was starting to get to Dr. Eleanor Vance. It had been falling for three days straight, a relentless, grey curtain drawn across the already somber cityscape of Portland. Sheâ€™d always found a certain melancholic comfort in the rain, but today, it felt like a reflection of the heavy, unspoken emotions hanging in the air of her office. Outside, a seagull screamed, its cry swallowed by the wind. Eleanor sighed, pushing the stray strands of auburn hair behind her ear and glancing at the clock. Five past five. Her last patient of the day, Mark Olsen, was always late. And she already knew what he'd say when he arrived, a rote recitation of his anxieties, delivered with the weary acceptance of a man trapped in a loop.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office is located on the third floor of a renovated brick building in the Pearl District of Portland, Oregon. The building once housed a warehouse and has been converted into a space for small businesses and creative professionals. Her office is comfortably furnished, with a mix of modern and vintage pieces. A deep teal velvet couch sits opposite two armchairs upholstered in a calming, patterned fabric. Bookshelves filled with psychology texts and art books line one wall, while the opposite wall features framed prints of Oregon landscapes. The room is lit by a combination of natural light from the bay window and soft, warm lamps. A small, antique desk sits in the corner, cluttered with files and a half-finished cup of herbal tea. The overall atmosphere is intended to be calming and inviting, a refuge from the city's frenetic energy.

**Main Character:**

**Dr. Eleanor Vance** is a counseling psychologist in her early forties. She's known for her empathetic approach and her ability to connect with her patients on a deep level. She has a quiet confidence about her, stemming from years of experience and a genuine desire to help others. She has a sharp intellect and a compassionate heart, which makes her a trusted therapist in the Portland area.

I hope this is a good start! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any aspect of this.
