The stale smell of chalk dust and simmering teenage angst hung heavy in the air of Room 203. It was 7:58 AM, two minutes before the bell, and the usual pre-calculus cacophony was already underway: whispers of last nightâ€™s homework, rhythmic tapping of pencils against desks, and the sporadic, high-pitched giggle that always threatened to devolve into a full-blown drama. Ms. Evelyn Eleanor Fairchild sighed, smoothing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She loved her job, really she did, but sometimes, especially on Mondays, the sheer volume of adolescent energy was almost physically overwhelming. Today, however, the typical hum was laced with a different kind of electricity. Everyone, it seemed, was on edge, buzzing with anticipation. Today was the day they announced the nominees for Prom Queen.

Evelyn, or Ms. Fairchild as she was known to the students of Northwood High, adjusted the already perfectly aligned stack of worksheets on her desk and straightened her navy blue blazer. She preferred order, both in her classroom and her life. It was a coping mechanism, a way to exert some small measure of control over the swirling chaos that seemed to define the world. Outside, the crisp autumn air was just beginning to hint at winter, and the maples lining the school parking lot blazed with fiery hues of red and orange. Inside, Room 203 felt like a pressure cooker about to explode, and Evelyn Eleanor Fairchild was about to walk right into the blast zone.
