## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The lobby of the Hotel Azure, nestled precariously on the edge of Positano, Italy. Sunlight, a thick, liquid gold, streams through the arched windows, painting the creamy marble floor in shifting patterns. Bougainvillea, riotous with color, spills from overflowing planters, their sweet scent mingling with the faint, salty tang of the Tyrrhenian Sea carried on the breeze. The air hums with a low, almost imperceptible thrum, a symphony of luxury: the soft clink of champagne glasses from the rooftop bar, the distant laughter of sunbathers on the private beach below, and the hushed murmur of Italian conversations.

**Story Opening:**

The scream was thankfully muffled, mostly absorbed by the thick, hand-knotted Persian rug that dominated the Hotel Azure's lobby. Nevertheless, it was enough to make Giovanni Esposito, dressed impeccably in his midnight blue concierge uniform, pause mid-sentence. He'd been assuring Mrs. Van Derlyn that a private helicopter tour of Capri, scheduled for precisely 11:00 AM, would be the highlight of her stay, guaranteed to cure her existential ennui. Now, Giovanni's carefully crafted smile faltered. He subtly scanned the lobby, his years of experience as a concierge instantly kicking in. Nothing appeared overtly amiss. A gaggle of impeccably dressed Russian tourists were posing awkwardly for selfies in front of the antique Murano glass chandelier. A young couple, fresh off the Amalfi Coast ferry, were excitedly discussing their honeymoon plans in hushed tones. But the screamâ€¦ it had been unmistakably real.

Giovanni Esposito, his dark eyes narrowed behind his impeccably clean spectacles, decided to investigate.
