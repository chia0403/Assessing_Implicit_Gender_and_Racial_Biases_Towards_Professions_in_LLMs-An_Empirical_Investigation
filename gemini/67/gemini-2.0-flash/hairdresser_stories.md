The clatter of coffee cups and the hum of hairdryers were practically a symphony to Seraphina Isabella Rossi, a sound track she'd conducted for the last fifteen years at "Curl Up & Dye" in the heart of Willow Creek, Oregon. Sunlight, strained through the gingham curtains that perpetually adorned the salon windows, painted dappled patterns across the linoleum floor. The air, thick with the scent of perm solution and hairspray, hung heavy and comforting.

Willow Creek itself was the kind of town where everyone knew your grandma's maiden name and could probably guess what you ate for breakfast. Nestled in a valley carved out by the lazy, meandering Willow River, it was a postcard of Americana: white picket fences, annual apple festivals, and the kind of neighbourly gossip that could make or break a reputation.

Seraphina, with her perpetually rosy cheeks and a tendency to talk with her hands, was as much a part of Willow Creek as the annual summer drought. Her salon, a small but vibrant haven squeezed between Mrs. Higgins' knitting shop and the dusty antique store owned by Old Man Withers, was more than just a place to get a trim. It was a community hub, a confessional, a source of local news and, occasionally, a place where dreams were carefully teased, coiffed, and sent out into the world, one perfectly styled head at a time.

But today, as Seraphina Isabella Rossi swept a pile of chestnut-colored clippings into the bin, the familiar rhythm of her morning felt off-key. The usual comforting smells seemed to cling to her, suffocating rather than soothing. Outside, the sun blazed a defiant gold, but inside, a chill had settled in her bones, a premonition as sharp and unsettling as a stray bobby pin stuck in her scalp. Something was about to happen in Willow Creek, and Seraphina had a feeling she was about to get caught right in the middle.
