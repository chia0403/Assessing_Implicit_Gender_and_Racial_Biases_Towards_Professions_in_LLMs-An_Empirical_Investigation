The late afternoon sun, a tired orange orb peeking through the smog of 1938 Pittsburgh, cast long, skeletal shadows across the ledger pages in front of Mildred Abigail Featherstone. The aroma of dust and aging paper, a comforting scent she'd grown to cherish, permeated the cramped office of "O’Malley & Sons, Ironworks - Accounts and Ledger Management." It wasn’t much, just a sliver of a room tucked between the noisy machine shop and the perpetually greasy loading dock, but it was Mildred's domain. Every decimal point, every crossed t, every neatly categorized expense was her responsibility.

Mildred, a woman whose life had, until recently, been as meticulously organized as her bookkeeping, chewed the end of her pencil. The O’Malley brothers, brash and booming men who treated her with a mixture of bewildered respect and thinly veiled impatience, were out for the day, “sealin’ a big deal” as Declan O’Malley had bellowed before slamming the door. Mildred, however, was stuck with a different sort of deal - a discrepancy in the iron ingot purchases for the month of July, a discrepancy that, according to her painstakingly cross-referenced calculations, amounted to a missing seventy-three dollars and sixteen cents. A sum that, in these lean times, could feed a family for a week.

Outside, the metallic clang of the factory seemed to mock her quiet struggle. Mildred adjusted her spectacles, their wire rims digging into the bridge of her nose. Seventy-three dollars and sixteen cents. It wasn't just the money, though that was certainly a concern. It was the principle. It was the integrity of her books, the validation of her meticulous work, that was at stake. And Mildred Abigail Featherstone, a woman whose entire life revolved around the unwavering truth of numbers, was not about to let it stand. Something, she suspected, was terribly wrong.
