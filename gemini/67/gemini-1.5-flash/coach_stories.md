The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate practice field.  Bare, skeletal trees clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their branches mimicking the gnarled fingers of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of the dilapidated stadium.  Fallen leaves, the color of dried blood, crunched under her worn cleats.  This wasn't exactly the picturesque setting she’d envisioned when she’d accepted the head coaching position at St. Jude’s Academy – a once-proud institution now clinging precariously to relevance, much like the ivy struggling to climb the crumbling brick walls surrounding the field.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, lingering aroma of woodsmoke from the distant town.  Amy shivered, pulling her threadbare jacket tighter, not entirely from the cold.  The weight of her responsibility felt heavier than any November wind.
