The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the squeak of Elias Thorne's worn sneakers on the polished floor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the beams as Elias, a man whose life seemed to exist solely in the shadows of others' triumphs, pushed a mop across the vast expanse.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, cheap disinfectant, and the faint, almost nostalgic aroma of old leather from the basketballs abandoned in a corner.  Tonight, however, the usual post-game chaos was absent.  An unnerving silence blanketed the enormous space, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Elias's mop and the unsettling drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet near the bleachers.  The silence felt heavier than the usual post-game exhaustion; it feltâ€¦ expectant.
