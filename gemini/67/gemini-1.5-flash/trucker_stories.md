The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel, knuckles bone-white against the worn plastic, his gaze fixed on the endless ribbon of Interstate 40 stretching before him like a black serpent under the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  The air hung heavy and humid, the kind of oppressive stillness that clung to the Louisiana bayous like a shroud.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic chorus, their song a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the eighteen-wheeler's tires on the asphalt.  Bart's rig, a battered but trusty Kenworth he'd affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," groaned under the weight of a cargo of crawfish destined for a seafood market in Memphis – a journey that would test both Betsy’s age and Bart’s patience.  The air conditioning sputtered intermittently, battling the relentless heat seeping in through the cracked window, a constant reminder of the long, arduous haul ahead.
