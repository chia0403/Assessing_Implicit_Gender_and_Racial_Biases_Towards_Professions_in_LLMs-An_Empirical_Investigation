The chipped porcelain of the teacup warmed Amelia "Mia" Featherstonehaugh's fingers, a stark contrast to the icy November wind howling outside the grimy window of the rehearsal room.  Rain lashed against the aged, leaded panes, mimicking the tempest brewing within her. The room itself, a cavernous space above a derelict bakery in the cobbled backstreets of Spitalfields, was a testament to both glorious decay and tenacious creativity.  Half-finished sets – a mangled Victorian chaise lounge, a leaning Eiffel Tower fashioned from scaffolding poles, and a collection of unsettlingly lifelike mannequins – jostled for space amongst discarded costumes and overflowing prop boxes.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale paint, sawdust, and desperation; the familiar aroma of a theatre production teetering on the brink of collapse.  Mia, however,  wasn't one to surrender easily.  Tonight, the fate of her ambitious, if somewhat eccentric, adaptation of "King Lear" hung in the balance.
