The air hung thick and sweet in "Sugar Rush," a bakery so crammed with sugary delights it felt like stepping into a giant, edible gingerbread house.  The scent of vanilla bean clung to everything – the floral wallpaper, the worn wooden countertops, even Amelia Katherine Cartwright's bright pink apron.  Amelia, or Amy as everyone but her grandmother called her, hummed a slightly off-key rendition of "The Sugar Plum Fairy" as she meticulously piped delicate buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the ivory frosting gleaming under the shop's warm, incandescent lights.  Outside, the November rain lashed against the windowpanes, a stark contrast to the sugary paradise she'd created within.  But Amy wasn't worried about the storm; she was far too engrossed in perfecting the delicate curve of a petal.  This cake, commissioned by a notoriously demanding socialite, was her masterpiece, and nothing – not even the impending deluge – would deter her.
