Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminated like tiny, glittering stars in a miniature, smoky galaxy.

Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, his bellhop uniform crisp despite the oppressive humidity of the New Orleans summer night, straightened his already impeccable posture.  He adjusted the brass nameplate gleaming on his cap, a silent promise of impeccable service, even if the clientele sometimes tested that promise to its limits.  The Grand Majestic, a monument to faded grandeur, held its breath, waiting for the next drama to unfold.
