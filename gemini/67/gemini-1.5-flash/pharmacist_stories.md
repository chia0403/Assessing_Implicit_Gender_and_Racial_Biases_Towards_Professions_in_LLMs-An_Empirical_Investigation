The chipped paint of the apothecary's sign, depicting a faded, almost skeletal serpent entwined around a mortar and pestle, creaked faintly in the mournful November wind.  Rain, the colour of bruised plums, lashed against the single, dusty window of Blackwood's Pharmacy, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street beyond. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of dried herbs, cinnamon, and something elseâ€¦ something subtly metallic, almost blood-like.  Elara Genevieve Blackwood, her fingers stained a faint ochre from crushing saffron, meticulously measured powdered ipecac into a tiny glass vial. The silence of the pharmacy, usually a comfort, felt tonight like a suffocating blanket, pressing down on her already burdened spirit.
