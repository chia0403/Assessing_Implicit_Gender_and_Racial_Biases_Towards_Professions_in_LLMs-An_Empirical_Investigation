The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Hernandez’s worn leather notepad, a tiny, rust-colored addition to the already chaotic collage of graffiti and grime clinging to the brick wall.  Rain, a greasy, relentless drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her forehead, the droplets clinging like tiny, unwelcome jewels.
