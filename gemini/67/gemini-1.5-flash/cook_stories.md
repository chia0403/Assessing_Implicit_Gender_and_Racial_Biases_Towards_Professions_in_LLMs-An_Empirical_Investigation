The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frying onions and simmering spices, a familiar perfume that clung to Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne like a second skin.  It was a humid Tuesday evening in the bustling kitchen of "The Gilded Spoon," a renowned Cajun restaurant nestled on the edge of the French Quarter in New Orleans. Steam rose from the glistening pots and pans, blurring the already hazy gaslight illuminating the worn brick walls and chipped Formica countertops.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, expertly wielded a large wooden spoon, stirring a gumbo so rich and dark it seemed to absorb the very light itself. The rhythmic clatter of cutlery and the murmur of conversations from the dining room formed a comforting soundtrack to her evening ritual. Tonight, however, a disquieting silence hung in the air, broken only by the sizzle of the roux and the frantic beat of Amy's own heart. Something felt…off.
