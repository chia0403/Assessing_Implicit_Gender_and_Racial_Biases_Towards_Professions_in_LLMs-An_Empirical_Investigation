The chipped mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy knot in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of her tiny, book-lined office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that promised nothing but endless spreadsheets and the soul-crushing weight of a thousand unread manuscripts.  Amelia, a senior editor at Blackwood & Quill, a publishing house steeped in history and currently drowning in debt, stared out at the rain-slicked cobblestones of Fleet Street, the iconic church spire of St. Bride’s barely visible through the deluge.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp brick and the faint, lingering aroma of old paper and printer’s ink – a scent that, usually comforting, tonight only amplified her anxiety.  This wasn't just another Tuesday; it was the Tuesday that could sink Blackwood & Quill, and possibly, Amelia's career along with it.
