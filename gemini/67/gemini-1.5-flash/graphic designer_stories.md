The chipped mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hands, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the icy dread clenching her stomach.  Rain lashed against the panoramic window of her Soho loft, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolour smear of greys and inky blues.

The apartment, normally a haven of carefully curated mid-century modern furniture and overflowing sketchbooks, felt oppressive tonight, each carefully placed object a silent accusation of her procrastination.
