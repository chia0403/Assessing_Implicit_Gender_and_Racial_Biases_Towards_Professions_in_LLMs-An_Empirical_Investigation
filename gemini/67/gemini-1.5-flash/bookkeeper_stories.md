The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the November chill that seeped into the bones of Blackwood & Sons Accounting.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering overhead bulb, danced in the stagnant air, a silent ballet mirroring the slow, methodical rhythm of Amelia’s pen scratching across the ledger.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge against the gothic gables of the Blackwood building, a sound that seemed to perfectly complement the melancholic click-clack of her abacus.  The only other sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the dimly lit hallway, its pendulum a metronome counting down to… what, Amelia wasn’t quite sure. But something was definitely brewing in the shadowed corners of Blackwood & Sons, something far more unsettling than a simple overdue invoice.
