The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the easel into position.  The canvas, a pristine expanse of Belgian linen, remained stubbornly blank, mocking her from its perch overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air, thick with the salty tang of brine and the mournful cry of gulls, mirrored the turmoil brewing within her.  She stood on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, the dramatic, jagged coastline a chaotic masterpiece that mirrored the tempest in her heart – a tempest far more difficult to capture than the raging sea before her.  The crumbling stone walls of an ancient, abandoned lighthouse stood sentinel behind her, their weathered grey a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost violent colours of the approaching storm.  Amelia, a painter known for her breathtaking seascapes, felt utterly and completely blocked.
