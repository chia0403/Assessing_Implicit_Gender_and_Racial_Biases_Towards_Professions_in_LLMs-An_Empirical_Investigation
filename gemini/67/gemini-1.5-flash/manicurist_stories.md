Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the Art Deco buildings into shimmering, pastel mirages. But inside Serenity Nails, it was a different kind of heat that simmered, a low hum of unspoken tension that hung thicker than the humidity.  Tonight, it felt particularly volatile.
