The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, a tune she’d grown intimately familiar with over the past fifteen years.  Ice crystals clung to the wings like tiny, malevolent teeth, threatening to further burden the already struggling aircraft. Below, the Chugach Mountains loomed, a jagged, snow-covered labyrinth stretching to the horizon under a bruised, twilight sky.  The last rays of sun, a desperate, blood-orange smear on the western sky, were rapidly fading, painting the already precarious landing strip at McCarthy – a mere gravel scar hacked into the unforgiving landscape – in an increasingly sinister light.  Evie gripped the yoke, knuckles white against the worn leather, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit air. This wasn't just another flight; this was a fight for survival.
