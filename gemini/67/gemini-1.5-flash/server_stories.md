The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Elara Jean Blackwood's fingertips, a familiar discomfort in the otherwise sterile glow of "The Gilded Lily" diner.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the neon signs of the highway into streaks of electric colour – a chaotic watercolor reflecting the turmoil brewing inside Elara herself.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying bacon, a scent so ingrained in her it almost felt like a second skin. Tonight, however, the greasy aroma was overshadowed by a sharper, metallic tang – the faintest whisper of blood.  Elara straightened her already-crisp, black-and-white uniform, the starched fabric a stark contrast to the tremor in her hand as she reached for a fresh stack of menus.  Another night, another shift at the Gilded Lily, another opportunity for something – or someone – to go spectacularly wrong.
