The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Steele hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Penelope Ann Featherstonehaugh's day.  Penelope, or Penny as most people – though irritatingly few – called her, perched on her ergonomically designed but decidedly uncomfortable chair, the faint scent of yesterday's microwaved tuna lingering in the air. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the office's sterile ambience, rattling the already slightly askew windowpanes.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a hazy grey smear.  It was, in short, a Tuesday.  And a particularly dreary one at that.
