The stale scent of sweat and chlorine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Mia" Hernandez.  It clung to the faded turquoise walls of "Body & Soul Fitness," a small, family-owned gym nestled incongruously between a laundromat and a pawn shop on the grittier side of Oakhaven.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, almost theatrical glow on the chipped linoleum floor.  Outside, the relentless summer heat of Arizona shimmered, warping the already distorted view of the distant mountains.  Mia, sweat beading on her forehead despite the air conditioning struggling valiantly against the desert's embrace, surveyed her class – a motley crew of retirees, harried mothers, and the occasional surprisingly ripped accountant – with a practiced smile.  Today's class was Zumba, and judging by the hesitant shuffles and the general air of apprehension, it was going to be a challenge.
