The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Elias Thorne’s cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn parka, the collar pulled high, offering little respite against the relentless assault of ice crystals.  The cab of his Caterpillar D11T was a sanctuary, a metal cocoon humming with the low growl of its powerful engine.  Outside, the landscape was a monochrome canvas of white and grey, stretching to the hazy horizon where the sky bled into the snow-covered mountains.  Elias, his breath fogging the interior glass, squinted at the digital readout on the dash: -35°F.  Another brutal day in the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, another day wrestling with the unforgiving land. The air smelled faintly of diesel and the bitter chill of the Arctic.  This was home, or as close to it as Elias Thorne had ever come.
