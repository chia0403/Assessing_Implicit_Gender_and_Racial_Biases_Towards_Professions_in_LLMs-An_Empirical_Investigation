The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy steel door of the abandoned textile mill open.  Rust groaned in protest, a symphony of decay accompanying the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through broken panes of glass.  Inside, the air hung thick and heavy, a miasma of damp earth and something else… something acrid, metallic, like old blood.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak beam of her flashlight, danced in the cavernous space, highlighting the skeletal remains of looms and the graffiti-scarred walls.  This wasn’t the picturesque industrial heritage site the tourist brochures promised; this was a tomb, and Mia, Detective Sergeant Amelia Hernandez of the Bradford City Police, was about to become its unwelcome guest.
