The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grand Blackwood Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the stained-glass windows depicting mythical creatures, danced in the stillness.  Elara Thistlewick, her name as meticulously ordered as the Dewey Decimal System she so diligently upheld, adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose.  The silence, usually her sanctuary, felt different today, charged with an almost palpable tension that prickled at the edges of her usually calm disposition.  Outside, the relentless drumming of rain against the gothic arched windows only served to amplify the unsettling quiet within the library's hallowed halls, a quiet that hinted at secrets waiting to be unearthed, perhaps even secrets better left undisturbed.
