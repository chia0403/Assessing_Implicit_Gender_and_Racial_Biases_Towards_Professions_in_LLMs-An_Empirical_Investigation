The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room was peeling like sunburnt skin, a slow, reluctant surrender to the relentless march of time.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the stagnant air, a silent ballet reflecting the uneasy stillness that had settled over the small, cluttered office.  The worn floral armchair, its cushions flattened by years of anxious sighs and whispered confessions, sagged invitingly, yet offered little comfort.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a reputation for both fierce empathy and unwavering pragmatism, sat at her desk, the scent of old books and slightly stale coffee clinging to the air like a persistent memory.  The rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, a constant, unwavering presence, punctuated the silence, each tick a tiny hammer blow against the fragile walls of her patients' unspoken anxieties.  Outside, the relentless New England winter howled a mournful tune, mirroring the inner turmoil she suspected awaited her next appointment.
