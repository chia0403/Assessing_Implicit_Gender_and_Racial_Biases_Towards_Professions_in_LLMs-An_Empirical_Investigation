The salt spray kissed Elias Thorne's weathered face as he wrestled a stubborn oak beam into place.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and pine, clung to his calloused hands, leaving a film of grit that even the relentless Atlantic wind couldn't quite scour away.  He stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, a hundred feet above the churning grey sea that gnawed at the craggy cliffs of the Isle of Skye.  Below, the half-finished lighthouse – a defiant sentinel against the unforgiving elements – clawed its way towards the heavens, a testament to Elias’s skill and the island's enduring spirit.  The wind howled a mournful song, a constant reminder of the isolation and the inherent danger of his trade in this remote corner of Scotland.
