The siren’s wail was a familiar lullaby to Dr. Elias Thorne, a sound that had woven itself into the very fabric of his being over the past fifteen years. Tonight, however, it felt different.  Sharper, more urgent. The flashing red and blue paint streaks across the rain-slicked asphalt of Chicago's South Side, blurring the already indistinct outlines of decaying brick buildings and flickering neon signs advertising late-night liquor and even later-night regrets.  Elias gripped the wheel of his ambulance, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the vehicle a counterpoint to the frantic hammering of his own heart.  The dispatcher's voice, tight with stress, echoed in his ears: "Multiple victims, possible mass casualty incident at the abandoned meatpacking plant on Halsted.  Code 3, Thorne, get there now."  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet concrete and something else… something metallic and sickeningly sweet.  Tonight, the city's underbelly felt particularly close, a lurking predator in the shadows of the storm.
