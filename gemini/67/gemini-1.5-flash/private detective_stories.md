The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Hartiganâ€™s office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and cheap coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to the worn leather armchair where he sat, nursing a tumbler of amber liquid that was significantly more potent than coffee.

The city, usually a vibrant tapestry of noise and activity, was muted tonight, muffled by the deluge, leaving only the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the low hum of the refrigerator in the corner as a soundtrack to his melancholic contemplation.  Tonight, the silence felt heavy, pregnant with the unspoken secrets that usually found their way to his door.
