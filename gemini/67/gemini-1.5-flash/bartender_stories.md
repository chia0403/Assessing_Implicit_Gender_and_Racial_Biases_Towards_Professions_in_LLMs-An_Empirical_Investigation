The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's calloused fingers as he meticulously polished a already gleaming pint glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the alley into a hazy, orange smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, metallic tang of desperation â€“ the usual aroma of a Tuesday night at Elias's establishment.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting soundtrack to the melancholic symphony of clinking ice and whispered conversations playing out within the dimly lit bar.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of weary routine felt punctuated by an unsettling stillness, a pregnant pause before the storm truly broke.
