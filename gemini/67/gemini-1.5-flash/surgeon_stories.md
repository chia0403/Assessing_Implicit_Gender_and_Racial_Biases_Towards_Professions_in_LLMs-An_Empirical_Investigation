The biting November wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Grace Reed's charcoal coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted hospital courtyard.  Rain, the kind that hammered against the ancient stonework of St. Jude's General, plastered her dark hair to her forehead.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic â€“ a scent that, even after fifteen years as a trauma surgeon, still clung to her like a second skin.  The towering gothic architecture of St. Jude's, a relic of a bygone era, loomed over her, its stained-glass windows reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Inside, the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors and the hushed urgency of whispered conversations provided a stark counterpoint to the howling wind, a symphony of life and death playing out within its aged walls.  Tonight, Evelyn felt the rhythm pulse a little faster, a premonition of the night ahead heavy in the damp air.
