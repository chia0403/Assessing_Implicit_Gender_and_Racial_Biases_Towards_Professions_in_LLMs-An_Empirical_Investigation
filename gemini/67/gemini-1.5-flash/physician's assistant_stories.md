The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn wool coat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts battled with the pervasive damp chill that clung to the ancient stones of the Scottish Highlands village of Glencoe.  Overhead, the sky was a bruised purple, threatening further snow to the already ankle-deep drifts lining the narrow lanes.  Amelia, a physician's assistant at the small, understaffed Glencoe Medical Centre, tugged her scarf tighter, the rhythm of her boots on the uneven pavement a counterpoint to the mournful wail of the wind whistling through the gaps in the centuries-old stone buildings.  Tonight, however, the usual bleak beauty of Glencoe felt particularly ominous, the silence between the wind’s howls heavy with an unspoken tension.  She was late, dread tightening its icy grip around her heart – and she had a very bad feeling about this house call.
