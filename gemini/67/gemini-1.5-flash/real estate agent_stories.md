The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s shoulders, baking the already stifling air inside her cherry-red convertible.  Sweat clung to her crisp white linen shirt, a stark contrast to the pristine, manicured lawns that blurred past her as she navigated the winding streets of Palm Cay Estates.  Palm Cay wasn't just another luxury development; it was a meticulously crafted illusion of paradise, a place where million-dollar mansions hid behind towering hedges and the only sounds were the gentle lapping of the ocean and the occasional shriek of a brilliantly coloured tropical bird.  Amelia, however, was acutely aware of the simmering tensions beneath the surface – tensions that could boil over and spoil the carefully cultivated image of this exclusive community, and, perhaps, even cost her a lucrative commission.  Today's showing was for Villa del Mar, the crown jewel of Palm Cay, and Amelia knew this sale could make or break her quarter.
