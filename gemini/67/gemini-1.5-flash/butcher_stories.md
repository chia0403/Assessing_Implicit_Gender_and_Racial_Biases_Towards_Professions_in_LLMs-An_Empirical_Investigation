The rasp of the steel cleaver on bone, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as his own heartbeat, echoed through the chill morning air of the Smithfield Market.  Barty, his breath misting in the pre-dawn gloom, surveyed his domain: a chaotic symphony of blood-red slabs, glistening flanks, and the pungent aroma of freshly-slaughtered livestock.  The air hung thick with the smell of iron and offal, a scent most found repulsive, but to Barty, it was the perfume of honest toil, a comforting fragrance that spoke of hard work and a life lived close to the earth.  Rows of hanging carcasses, their pale eyes staring blankly ahead, swayed gently in the breeze filtering through the market's open sides.  Outside, the grey London sky threatened rain, a fitting backdrop to the grim but essential business of the day.
