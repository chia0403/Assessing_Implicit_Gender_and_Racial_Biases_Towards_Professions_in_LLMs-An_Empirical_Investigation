The fluorescent lights of Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s tiny office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  Rain lashed against the grimy window of her storefront on Bleecker Street, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety thrumming in Mia’s chest.  Stacks of tax forms, each a miniature mountain of someone else’s financial hopes and fears, towered precariously on every available surface.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of stress – a familiar aroma in Mia Hernandez Income Tax Services, especially during the final frenzied weeks before the April 15th deadline. Outside, the vibrant chaos of Greenwich Village, usually a welcome distraction, was muted by the storm, leaving Mia isolated with her mountain of paperwork and the weight of her clients' financial futures.
