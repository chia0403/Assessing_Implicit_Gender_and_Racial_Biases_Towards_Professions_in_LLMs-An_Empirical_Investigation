The scent of woodsmoke and lavender hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume clinging to the cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for three days, slicked the uneven paving stones, reflecting the dim glow of gas lamps sputtering against the encroaching twilight.  Inside his tiny shop, tucked away on a side street barely wide enough for a cart, Elias Thorne, master tailor and purveyor of fine garments, meticulously stitched a button onto a cuff of midnight-blue velvet.  The needle, a slender silver dart, moved with practiced ease in his nimble fingers, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the single, dusty windowpane.  His shop, "Thorne's Threads," was a haven of quiet industry, a world away from the bustling market square just beyond the alleyway.  The only sounds besides the rain were the gentle hiss of his shears and the soft sigh of Elias himself, a sigh that spoke volumes of weary patience and the unspoken weight of secrets held close within the folds of his carefully crafted clothes.
