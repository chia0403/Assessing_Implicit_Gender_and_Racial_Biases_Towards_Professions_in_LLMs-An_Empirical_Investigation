The scent of eucalyptus and old wood hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually calmed Dr. Eleanor Vance.  But today, the familiar scent did little to soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the frosted-glass windows of her clinic, "Vance Chiropractic," a small, independent practice nestled in the quiet, snow-dusted town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Colorado Rockies.  The rhythmic drumming of the storm was almost hypnotic, but Eleanor found herself unable to relax, her gaze repeatedly drawn to the empty waiting room, a stark contrast to the usually bustling afternoon.  Havenwood was a town where everyone knew everyone elseâ€™s business, and the unnerving silence felt like a premonition.
