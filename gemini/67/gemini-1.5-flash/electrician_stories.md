The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled with a recalcitrant cable, the wind howling a mournful dirge around the skeletal remains of the old lighthouse.  Below, the Atlantic churned, a restless beast gnawing at the granite cliffs.  Elias, a man whose hands were more accustomed to the smooth curves of copper wiring than the jagged edges of weathered stone, cursed under his breath.  The lighthouse, perched precariously on the windswept promontory of Widow's Point, was a monument to stubbornness â€“ both in its defiance of the elements and in its refusal to cooperate with its current, rather impatient, inhabitant.  The smell of ozone, mingled with the sharp tang of brine and the faint, earthy scent of decay from the crumbling stonework, hung heavy in the air.  This was no ordinary electrical fault; Elias suspected something far more sinister was at play.
