The smell of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, proprietor of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane of his shop, illuminating the swirling chaos of his cluttered workspace.  Shears, combs, and straight razors – some gleaming, some dull with the patina of years of faithful service – lay scattered across his mahogany barber's chair, a testament to the hurried nature of his last client's departure. Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of trolley brakes, the distant wail of a siren, and the incessant rumble of horse-drawn carts – provided a constant, low hum to the otherwise quiet afternoon.  Elias, a man etched with the lines of a life lived under the merciless glare of a Brooklyn sun, ran a hand through his own thinning, dark hair, the faintest trace of a grimace tugging at his lips.  Another slow day, he thought, though something about the stillness felt…different.  A prickling unease settled on his skin, as subtle and persistent as the lingering scent of Old Spice clinging to the worn leather of his chair.
