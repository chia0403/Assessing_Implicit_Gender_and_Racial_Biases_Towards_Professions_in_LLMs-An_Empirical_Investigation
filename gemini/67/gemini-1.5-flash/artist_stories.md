The scent of turpentine and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, clinging to him like the dust motes dancing in the slanted afternoon sunbeams that pierced the grime-coated windows of his studio. Elias, a man whose beard rivaled a badger's in both density and unruly charm, wrestled with a particularly recalcitrant canvas.  It depicted a stormy sea, a churning maelstrom of blues and greens that seemed to mirror the turmoil in his own heart.  The studio itself, perched precariously on the uppermost floor of a crumbling Victorian building in the cobbled alleyways of  Hastings Old Town, was a chaotic reflection of his artistic spirit.  Paint tubes lay scattered like fallen soldiers, brushes stiff with dried pigment leaned against a chipped easel, and half-finished sketches, their charcoal lines bold and expressive, adorned every available surface.  Outside, the cries of gulls mingled with the distant rumble of the English Channel, a constant soundtrack to Eliasâ€™s solitary existence.
