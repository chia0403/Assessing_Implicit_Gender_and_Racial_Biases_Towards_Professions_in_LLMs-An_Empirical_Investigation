The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia Katherine Stone’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery door, the key scraping a familiar, comforting sound against the worn brass.  The air inside “Stone’s Sweet Surrender,” was thick with the comforting aroma of yeasty sourdough and the faint, sweeter scent of caramelizing sugar.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating shelves laden with rows of empty, awaiting cake tins and the glint of copper mixing bowls hanging from the ceiling like tarnished constellations.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven were still cloaked in the inky blackness of a November morning, the only sounds the distant rumble of a delivery truck and the rhythmic chirping of a lone, persistent robin.  Amelia, a woman whose flour-dusted apron mirrored the perpetually dusted surfaces of her beloved bakery, felt the familiar hum of anticipation settle in her chest.  Another day, another batch of perfectly risen loaves and exquisitely iced cakes to bring a little sweetness to the lives of Oakhaven's residents.
