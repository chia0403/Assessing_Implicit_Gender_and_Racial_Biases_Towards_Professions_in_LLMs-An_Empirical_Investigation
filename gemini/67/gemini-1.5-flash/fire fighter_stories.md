The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Hayes's throat, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and burning ash, hung heavy and still over the charred remains of what had once been a proud, if somewhat dilapidated, cabin nestled deep within the Redwood National Park.  Flickering flames, stubbornly clinging to the heart of the structure, cast an eerie, dancing light on the faces of the exhausted firefighters around her, their helmets gleaming like polished obsidian under the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  The roar of the inferno, which had raged for hours, had finally subsided to a low, crackling hiss, but the danger, Evie knew, was far from over. The ground beneath her feet was unstable, littered with smoldering debris and the skeletal remains of fallen trees, a testament to the wildfire's relentless power.
