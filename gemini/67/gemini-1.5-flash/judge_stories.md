The air hung thick and humid, a stifling blanket draped over the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom.  The scent of salt and decaying seaweed battled with the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle clinging to the weathered clapboard houses that lined Elm Street.  Judge Abigail Hawthorne, her silk robe clinging uncomfortably to her skin, adjusted the heavy oak fan resting on her desk.  Sweat beaded on her upper lip, a stark contrast to the perfectly controlled composure she maintained as she surveyed the courtroom.  The single, bare bulb hanging above cast harsh shadows, exaggerating the cracks in the plaster walls and the chipped paint on the mahogany furniture.  This wasn't the grand, marble-laden hall of a city courthouse; this was the Port Blossom County Courthouse â€“ a relic of a bygone era, as quaint and crumbling as the town itself.  And today, it was about to become the stage for a drama far more complex than any Abigail had ever encountered.
