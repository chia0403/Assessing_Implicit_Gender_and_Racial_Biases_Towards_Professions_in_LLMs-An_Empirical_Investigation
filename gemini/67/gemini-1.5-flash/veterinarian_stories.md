The biting wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  Snow, thick and unrelenting, piled high against the weathered clapboard siding, transforming the quaint New England village into a frosted fairytale, albeit one with a distinctly chilly undercurrent.  The air inside, thankfully, was a welcome contrast – warm and infused with the comforting scent of disinfectant and something vaguely animalistic; a comforting blend of fur, hay, and the faint metallic tang of blood.  Evelyn shivered, not entirely from the cold, as she surveyed the small, cluttered waiting room.  A chipped porcelain cat sat perched on a wobbly shelf, its glazed eyes staring blankly at nothing, mirroring the unsettling quiet that hung in the air, a silence broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock in the corner.  This quiet, Evelyn knew, was rarely a good sign.
