The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Rel" Davenport seemed capable of producing.  Rel, a cosmetologist whose salon, "Shear Genius," occupied a charming, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian storefront on Bleecker Street in New York City, sighed, a plume of perfumed breath escaping her lips.  Outside, a late October drizzle painted the cobblestones a slick, obsidian sheen, reflecting the flickering gaslights in a shimmering, distorted dance.  Inside, the salon was a controlled chaos of half-finished blow-dries, overflowing product shelves, and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears, a counterpoint to the melancholic jazz drifting from the ancient gramophone in the corner.  Rel, perched precariously on a stool, her fingers expertly weaving through a client's thick auburn hair, felt a familiar prickle of unease.  It wasn't the usual pre-holiday rush; this feltâ€¦ different.  Something was brewing in the air, something thicker than the lavender and burnt sugar, something darker than the gathering storm outside.
