The wind, a rasping sculptor itself, tore at Elias Thorne's thick woolen coat as he surveyed his work.  Granite dust, the fine grey powder of a thousand patient strokes, clung to his beard like a second, stony skin.  He stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, the biting November air stinging his cheeks, overlooking the half-finished gargoyle perched high on the north face of St. Jude's Cathedral.  Below, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a town carved from the very rock that formed his livelihood, snaked towards the churning grey sea. The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and woodsmoke, a familiar perfume that had been part of Elias's life since he first hefted a chisel at the age of ten. The cathedral, a behemoth of grey and weathered stone, loomed over the town, a silent witness to centuries of Oakhaven's history, and now, Elias Thorne was adding his own small, meticulously crafted piece to its enduring narrative.
