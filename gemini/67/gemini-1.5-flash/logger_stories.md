The chainsaw’s shriek was a familiar lullaby to Silas Blackwood, a sound that had punctuated the dawn of his life for as long as he could remember.  This morning, however, the usual symphony of the forest – the chirping of unseen birds, the rustle of unseen creatures – was muted, swallowed by a thick, unnatural silence.  A silence heavier than the damp, moss-laden air that clung to the ancient redwood trees of the Whispering Pines, a silence that pressed down on Silas like a physical weight.  He stood on the edge of the clearing, the biting chill of the pre-dawn air stinging his cheeks, his breath puffing out in white clouds, his axe leaning against a gnarled root, its head dull from a thousand felled giants.  The Whispering Pines, once a sanctuary teeming with life, now held its breath, a suffocating stillness that promised trouble.
