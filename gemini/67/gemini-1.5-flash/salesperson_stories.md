The stale air of the showroom hung heavy with the scent of new car upholstery and simmering resentment.  Agnes Periwinkle, a woman whose smile could curdle milk and whose determination could fell a redwood, adjusted the tiny, perfectly-placed pearl earring dangling from her left lobe.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the deserted highway, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  It was Tuesday, 3:17 PM, and Agnes hadnâ€™t made a single sale all day.  Not a single one.  This wasn't just a bad day; it was a testament to the crippling apathy that seemed to have settled over the town of Harmony Creek like a shroud.  Even the usually cheerful, chirpy sales manager, Mr. Fitzwilliam, had retreated to his office, the muffled sounds of his weeping barely audible above the relentless drumming of the rain.  Agnes, however, was not a woman given to tears. She was a closer.  And she had a quota to meet.
