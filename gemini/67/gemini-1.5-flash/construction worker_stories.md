The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles, a frigid counterpoint to the dull ache in his lower back.  He hunched deeper into his threadbare jacket, the collar scratching against his chapped cheeks.  Above, the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper clawed at the bruised, grey sky, a monument to ambition against the backdrop of a city choked by smog and the ghosts of forgotten industries. Elias, a third-generation construction worker for Thorne & Sons, the family business that had built half of this very city, squinted at the half-finished structure.  Below, the street pulsed with the chaotic symphony of a metropolis waking; car horns blared a discordant tune against the rhythmic clang of a distant jackhammer, a familiar lullaby to Elias's ears.  The air tasted of diesel fumes and damp concrete, the scent of his life, his heritage, and perhaps, his impending doom.
