The November wind howled a mournful tune around the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, rattling the leaded panes of Dr. Alistair Finch’s surgery.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of clove and something faintly metallic – a familiar perfume for Alistair, though tonight, the usual comforting familiarity felt tinged with unease. Rain lashed against the stone walls of his small, isolated practice, nestled in the village of Glencoe, a place where the dramatic landscape mirrored the often dramatic lives of its inhabitants.  A flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany desk, where Alistair, his tired eyes magnified by the spectacles perched on his nose, stared out at the tempestuous night.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, felt heavier than the storm raging outside.  He’d been expecting a call, a call that hadn’t come.  And that silence, Alistair knew, was far more unsettling than any howling wind.
