The flickering neon sign of the Stardust Diner cast a lurid, cherry-red glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleaker Street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Rain lashed against the large plate-glass windows, blurring the view of the near-empty street outside. It was a Tuesday night, always slow, but tonight felt particularly desolate.  Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, her name tag slightly askew on her faded pink uniform, leaned against the counter, idly polishing a coffee cup with a stained dishrag.  Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a tight bun, had begun to fray around the edges, mirroring the unraveling of her patience. The only other person in the diner was Mr. Henderson, the night cook, who hummed tunelessly to himself as he flipped burgers with the practiced ease of a man who’d seen too many late nights.  The silence, punctuated only by the sizzle of the grill and the drumming of the rain, was thick enough to cut with a knife.  Amy glanced at the clock. 11:47 pm. Three more tables to wipe down and then she could finally go home.
