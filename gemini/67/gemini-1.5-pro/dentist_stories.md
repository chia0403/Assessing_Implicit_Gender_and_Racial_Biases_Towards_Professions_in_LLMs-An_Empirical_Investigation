The November wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s Victorian dental practice, rattling the stained-glass window depicting a surprisingly cheerful molar.  Inside, the waiting room was quiet, warmed by a crackling fire in the hearth and the faint scent of clove oil.  Snow began to fall in thick, lazy flakes, obscuring the view of the small, isolated town of Port Blossom, Maine. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, tapped a manicured nail against her worn leather appointment book. 4:00 pm. No-show.  She sighed, the sound swallowed by the plush velvet armchair she sank into. It was the third no-show that week.  Port Blossom wasn't exactly bustling, even for November, but this was unusual.  Something felt…off.  The unsettling quiet was punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a tiny hammer blow against the fragile peace.
