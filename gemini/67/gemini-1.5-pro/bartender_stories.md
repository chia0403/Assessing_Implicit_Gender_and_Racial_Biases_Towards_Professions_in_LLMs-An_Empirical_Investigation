Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon sign reflecting off the slick cobblestones of Zenith Alley.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation.  Amelia "Mia" Corvus, her name tattooed in elegant script on her left wrist, polished a tumbler with a practiced hand, her dark eyes reflecting the flickering gaslights above the mahogany bar.  Zenith City was a place built on secrets and shadows, and Mia, with her sharp wit and even sharper intuition, was the keeper of many of them. The Gilded Lily, tucked away in the city's oldest district, was her domain, a sanctuary for the lost and the forgotten, a haven where truths were whispered and lies were swallowed whole with every shot of rye.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A stillness hung in the air, heavier than the cigarette smoke clinging to the velvet curtains, a premonition of something brewing in the heart of the city, something dark and dangerous.
