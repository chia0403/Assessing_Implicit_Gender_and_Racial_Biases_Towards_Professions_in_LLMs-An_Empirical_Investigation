The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, exhaling a gust of frigid Chicago air that ruffled Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's meticulously styled hair.  Snow dusted the shoulders of the fur-clad dowager sweeping past him, leaving a faint scent of expensive perfume in its wake.  The year was 1923, and the lobby of the Grand Majestic, with its towering marble columns, glittering chandeliers, and the low hum of hushed conversation, was a world away from the biting wind and grey slush of the streets outside. Barty, resplendent in his burgundy uniform with gold braiding, straightened his pillbox hat and offered the woman a practiced, if slightly strained, smile. The lobby clock chimed the half-hour, a melodic reminder of the relentless pace of his duties. Tonight, like every night, held the promise of tips, tales, and the tantalizing glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous who graced the Grand Majesticâ€™s hallowed halls.
