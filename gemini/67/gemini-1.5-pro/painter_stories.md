The salt spray stung Eliza Jane Hawthorne's face, a familiar and unwelcome kiss. Her easel, precariously perched on the uneven cobblestones of the pier, vibrated with the rhythmic crash of waves against the pilings.  A thick, grey fog, the kind that clung to everything like damp wool, had swallowed Port Blossom whole.  The normally bustling fishing town, nestled between the craggy cliffs of the Cornish coast and the restless Atlantic, was hushed, its vibrant colours muted to shades of grey and silver.  Eliza, wrapped in a thick, paint-splattered oilskin, squinted at the scene before her â€“ a lone fishing trawler, its lights a hazy glow in the fog, battling its way back to harbor. This was it, the moment, the elusive light she had been chasing for weeks.  Her fingers, stiff with cold, fumbled for a brush.  Time to capture the melancholic beauty of a Port Blossom morning.
