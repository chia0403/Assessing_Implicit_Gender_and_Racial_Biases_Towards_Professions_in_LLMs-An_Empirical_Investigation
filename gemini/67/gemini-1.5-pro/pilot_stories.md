The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Milly" Cartwright's flight jacket as she prepped her Cessna 208 Caravan for takeoff. The small Denali airstrip, a mere gouge carved out of the frozen earth and dusted with a precarious layer of gravel, offered little protection from the elements.  Towering pines, their branches laden with snow, framed the runway like brooding sentinels. The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened more snow. Milly, her breath clouding in the frigid air, ran a gloved hand over the Caravanâ€™s nose, a familiar ritual offering a silent prayer to the machine that was her livelihood and, often, her lifeline in this unforgiving wilderness. This particular morning, with the temperature hovering around ten below zero, her cargo was unusually precious: a pair of premature twin girls needing transport to the neonatal intensive care unit in Anchorage, hundreds of miles south.
