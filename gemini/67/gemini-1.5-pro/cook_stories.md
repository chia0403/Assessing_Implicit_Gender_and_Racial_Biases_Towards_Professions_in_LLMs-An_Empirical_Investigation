The clatter of pots and pans, the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil, the rhythmic thud of a cleaver against a worn wooden cutting board – these were the sounds that composed the morning symphony of  Beatrice Amelia Dubois.  Her kitchen, nestled at the back of "The Salty Spoon," a small, brightly painted diner clinging to the edge of the Salton Sea in Desert Shores, California, was her kingdom.  Outside, the early November sun cast a hazy, almost mirage-like shimmer across the still, saline water. Inside, the air crackled with the promise of Beatrice's famous chilaquiles, their aroma already weaving its way through the dusty screen door and onto the deserted main street, a siren's call for the town's sleepy inhabitants.  This morning, however, the usual pre-dawn peace was punctuated by a different sound – a persistent, low growl emanating from somewhere beyond the kitchen's swinging doors.
