The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s ankles as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the Northwood High School parking lot.  Her sensible brown loafers, already scuffed from a long day, offered little protection from the creeping cold.  Above her, the school’s brick facade, once a proud testament to the town’s prosperity, now wore a patina of neglect – chipped paint, boarded-up windows, and a faded banner proclaiming them the 1987 State Football Champions. Northwood, Pennsylvania, a town whose fortunes had waned with the closure of the local steel mill a decade prior, clung to past glories like a life raft in a storm-tossed sea. The air held the scent of woodsmoke and decay, a familiar aroma Amelia had grown accustomed to in the five years since she’d returned to her hometown to teach English literature.  Tonight, though, the usual melancholy was laced with a distinct edge of unease. The sodium vapor lamps sputtered intermittently, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the emptying lot, and the silence was broken only by the mournful whistle of the distant freight train – a sound that always seemed to echo the town’s collective sigh of resignation.
