The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous B-flat above Amelia Reyes, casting a sterile glow on the pristine white expanse of her drafting table.  The faint scent of blueprint ink hung in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to her clothes and hair like a second skin.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the windows of Peterson & Sons Architectural Firm, a low, brick building nestled amongst the steel and glass giants of the city's financial district.  It was late November, and the skeletal branches of the sycamore tree outside Amelia's window clawed at the overcast sky, mirroring the nervous energy that tightened in her chest.  Tonight was the unveiling of her design for the new city library, a project she'd poured her heart and soul into for the past six months.  It was her chance, her *big* chance, to finally step out from the shadows of her more experienced colleagues and prove she was more than just a competent drafting worker.  Tonight, Amelia Reyes was determined to make a name for herself.
