The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the oversized window of Gentle Dental, blurring the already muted greens and greys of Portland's West Hills.  Inside, the air hummed with the low whine of the autoclave and the faint scent of antiseptic. Eliza Jane Bellweather, a dental hygienist with a preternatural ability to anticipate a patient's gag reflex, tapped a meticulously polished fingernail against her clipboard.  It was a slow Tuesday morning, the kind that stretched out like a piece of chewed gum, punctuated only by the rhythmic swish of the fish tank in the waiting room and the occasional, tinny chime of the front door.  Eliza Jane, however, felt a prickle of unease beneath her starched, mint-green scrubs. It wasn't the weather, nor the unsettling quiet. It was the small, antique silver locket clutched in the hand of Mrs. Abernathy, her 10:00 a.m. appointment, who was currently staring intensely at a framed poster of dental floss techniques with an expression that could only be described as haunted.
