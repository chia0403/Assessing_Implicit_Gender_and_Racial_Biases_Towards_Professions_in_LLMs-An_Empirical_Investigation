The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across Dr. Elias Thorne's rain-streaked window.  November in Oakhaven, Oregon, was a symphony of grey: grey skies, grey rain, and the grey, perpetually damp streets reflecting the city's perpetually subdued mood.  Inside Thorne Chiropractic, however, the atmosphere was even more oppressive. Elias rubbed a hand over his tired face, the fluorescent lights highlighting the deepening lines around his kind, brown eyes.  The only sounds were the rhythmic tick of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner and the persistent drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet in the examination room. He’d fixed it twice already this month.  Just another thing adding to the weight settling on his shoulders, a weight heavier than the patient files stacked precariously on his desk.  He’d inherited the practice from his father, a man whose large, jovial presence still seemed to linger in the worn leather of the adjusting table and the faint scent of liniment clinging to the air.  Elias loved his work, loved helping people, but lately, Oakhaven felt less like a haven and more like a cage slowly constricting around him.  And something told him the relentless rain wasn't the only storm brewing.
