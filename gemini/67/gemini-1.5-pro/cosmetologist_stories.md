The fluorescent lights of "Shear Perfection," a salon tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down Italian restaurant, hummed a monotonous tune that Genevieve "Gen" Dubois had grown accustomed to.  The scent of hairspray, perm solution, and something vaguely reminiscent of burnt sugar hung in the air – a comforting, if slightly chemical, aroma that signified the start of another day.  Pine Creek, Oregon, a town nestled deep in the Cascade foothills, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, but Gen had carved out a niche for herself, transforming the town's residents one haircut, color, and updo at a time.  The rain hammered against the large front window, mirroring the nervous flutter in Gen's stomach. Today wasn't just any other Tuesday. Today, a Hollywood location scout was coming to Pine Creek, and rumour had it, they were looking for local talent. Gen wasn't an actress, but she had a secret dream… a dream that involved more than just scissor-sharp skills and perfectly blended highlights.
