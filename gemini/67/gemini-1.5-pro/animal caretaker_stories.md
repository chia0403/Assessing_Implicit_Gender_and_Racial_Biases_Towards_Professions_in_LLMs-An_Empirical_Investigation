The biting wind whipped at Elara Thistlewood's thick wool coat as she trudged across the frozen expanse of the wolf enclosure.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the Sanctuary of Whispering Pines, leaving the towering pines shrouded in pre-dawn gloom.  Their snow-laden branches, heavy and still, created a cathedral-like hush over the sanctuary, broken only by the crunch of Elara's boots and the distant, mournful howl of a lone timber wolf.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the Canadian Rockies, was a sprawling haven for orphaned and injured wildlife, from majestic elk and elusive lynx to playful river otters and stoic owls.  Elara, the head animal caretaker, considered it both her workplace and her sanctuary, a place where the heartbeat of the wild resonated within her own soul. This morning, however, a palpable unease gnawed at her.  The alpha female of the wolf pack, Tala, hadn't greeted Elara at the fence as she usually did, and that worried her deeply.
