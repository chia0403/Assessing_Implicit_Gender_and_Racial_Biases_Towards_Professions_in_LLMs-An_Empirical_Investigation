The scent of aged paper and leather clung to Elsie Aurelia Fairweather like a beloved shawl.  It was a scent she'd grown up with, nestled amongst the towering shelves of her grandfather's library, and now, it permeated her own domain: the Whispering Pines Public Library. Nestled in the heart of the sleepy, fog-kissed town of Port Blossom, Maine, the library was a two-story Victorian edifice with gingerbread trim and leaded glass windows that depicted scenes from classic fairy tales. Rain lashed against these windows, mirroring the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reading room, its steady beat the only sound besides the occasional rustle of turning pages. October had arrived, draping Port Blossom in a tapestry of crimson and gold, but inside, the library offered a warm sanctuary against the encroaching chill.  Elsie, perched on a rolling ladder, straightened a slightly askew volume of Tennyson, her brow furrowed in concentration. Something felt off. Something beyond the usual Monday morning quiet.
