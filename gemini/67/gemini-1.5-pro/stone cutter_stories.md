The wind, sharp and cold as a freshly knapped flint, whipped through the Cwm Idwal valley, tugging at Elias Bryn Davies's thick wool coat.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, clung to the craggy peaks of Glynnog Fawr, casting long shadows across the valley floor. Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, stood before a freshly quarried block of slate, the blue-grey stone gleaming like a frozen wave beneath the overcast sky.  His workshop, little more than a canvas lean-to lashed to the side of the quarry face, offered minimal protection from the elements, but it housed the tools of his trade: hammers, chisels, wedges, and the sharpening stone that had been passed down through generations of Davies stone cutters.  The air vibrated with the faint, rhythmic clang of metal on stone echoing from the other side of the valley, where the larger quarry operations of Bethesda were already in full swing.  But Elias preferred the solitude of his own small claim, the quiet companionship of the mountains, and the satisfying work of shaping the ancient rock to his will.
