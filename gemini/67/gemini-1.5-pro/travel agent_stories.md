The chipped flamingo pink paint of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's office door seemed to mock her.  Another Tuesday morning in Harmony Creek, Ohio, a town where the most exotic travel was the bi-annual trip to the state fair.  Amy, full name Amelia Isabella Reyes, tapped a chipped nail against the peeling flamingo, wishing she could melt into the travel posters plastered across her tiny office walls.  Bali’s emerald rice paddies, the vibrant souks of Marrakech, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas – they whispered promises of adventure she’d only ever sold to others.  Outside, the rhythmic drone of cicadas underscored the stillness of a humid July day, a stark contrast to the roaring waterfalls of Iguazu she’d been describing to a client just moments ago. The scent of freshly cut grass drifted in through the open window, a far cry from the heady aroma of Moroccan spices she longed to inhale.  This morning, even the normally comforting clanging of the bell above the door of the Harmony Creek General Store across the street sounded like a prison sentence.
