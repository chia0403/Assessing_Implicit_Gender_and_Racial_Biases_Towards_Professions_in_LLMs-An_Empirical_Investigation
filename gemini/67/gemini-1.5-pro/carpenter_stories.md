The rasping shriek of Elias Thatcher's hand saw sliced through the crisp morning air, a sound as familiar to the inhabitants of Port Swallow as the cry of the gulls wheeling overhead.  The October sun, a pale disc struggling through the clinging sea mist, cast long shadows across the splintered planks of the half-built fishing boat resting on the shingle beach.  Port Swallow, a cluster of brightly painted houses huddled around a natural harbour on the rugged Cornish coast, was a town built on fishing and Elias, its most skilled carpenter, was its lifeblood.  The smell of salt, sawdust, and woodsmoke mingled in the air, a comforting aroma that spoke of hard work and simple pleasures. Today, however, the usual tranquility of Elias's work was tinged with a subtle unease.  A dark schooner, its sails furled like the wings of a slumbering bat, had anchored silently in the harbour before dawn, and its crew, a motley collection of scarred and silent men, had been watching him work with an unnerving intensity.
