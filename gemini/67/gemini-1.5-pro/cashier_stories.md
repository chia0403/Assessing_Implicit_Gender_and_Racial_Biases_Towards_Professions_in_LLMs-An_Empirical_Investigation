The fluorescent lights of the Quik Stop buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the aisles of dusty chips and lukewarm sodas.  Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, tapped her chipped, cherry-red fingernails on the worn countertop.  It was 2:17 AM, the graveyard shift's deepest trough, and the only sound other than the rain and the buzzing lights was the gentle whir of the slushy machine, a lonely sentinel in the otherwise empty convenience store.  Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of mousy brown hair out of her eyes. Tonight, like most nights, felt like an eternity.
