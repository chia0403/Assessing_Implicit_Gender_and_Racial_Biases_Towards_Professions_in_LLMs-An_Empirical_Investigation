Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau’s 42nd-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of downtown Chicago.  The city, usually a vibrant tapestry of steel and glass glittering beneath a Midwestern sky, was tonight a smeared watercolor of grey and amber.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of Cassie's cooling Earl Grey tea and the faint, metallic tang of impending stress.  Her sleek, minimalist office, usually a sanctuary of order, was strewn with the remnants of a particularly brutal board meeting: scattered reports, overturned coffee cups, and a half-eaten protein bar discarded on a pristine white notepad. Cassie, Chief Operating Officer of Thorne Industries, a global leader in sustainable energy solutions, stared out at the storm, her reflection a ghost in the glass.  The victory she'd fought so hard for – the approval of her groundbreaking renewable energy initiative – felt less like a triumph and more like the calm before another, more devastating storm.  Her phone buzzed, a stark white light pulsing against the darkening sky.  It was a number she didn't recognize.  A shiver, unconnected to the chill autumn air, ran down her spine.
