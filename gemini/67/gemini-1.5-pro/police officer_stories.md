The biting November wind whipped off Lake Erie, tearing at Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's trench coat as she stood on the edge of the Cleveland Cliffs.  Below, the churning grey water mirrored the steel-grey sky.  Spray from the crashing waves misted her face, tasting of iron and something faintly, unsettlingly sweet.  The flashing blue and red lights of the patrol cars painted the scene in stark, pulsating colours, illuminating the small crowd of onlookers huddled together against the cold.  Izzy pulled her collar higher, the wind a physical force pushing her towards the precarious edge.  This wasn't the kind of call she expected on a Tuesday morning, especially not one involving a vintage Rolls Royce perched precariously halfway over the cliff, its front wheels dangling in the icy void.
