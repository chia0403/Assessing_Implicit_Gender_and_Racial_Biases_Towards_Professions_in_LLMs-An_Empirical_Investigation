Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Golden Spoon Diner, blurring the neon sign advertising "World Famous Chili" into a shimmering, indistinct blob. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions, a scent Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez usually found comforting. Today, however, it only amplified the gnawing unease in her stomach. Amy, a pharmaceutical sales representative for Derma-Nova Laboratories, tapped a manicured fingernail against the worn Formica tabletop, her gaze fixed on the rain-slicked highway stretching out beyond the diner's window. Route 66, once a symbol of opportunity and adventure, now felt like a long, lonely road to nowhere.  She was due in Winslow, Arizona by sundown, a four-hour drive in good weather, to close a deal with Dr. Harrison, a notoriously fickle dermatologist.  This deal, the contract for Derma-Nova's new eczema cream, was the biggest of her career, and its success or failure hung precariously in the balance, much like the flickering neon sign outside.
