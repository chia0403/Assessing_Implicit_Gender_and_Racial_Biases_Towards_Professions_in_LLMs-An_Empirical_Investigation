The air in the cabin crackled with a mixture of anticipation and exhaustion â€“ a familiar cocktail on the Athens-Santorini route, especially during the peak summer season. Amelia, however, felt a different kind of electricity humming beneath her skin.  This wasn't just another landing. This was a homecoming, of sorts, and after ten years, she was finally ready to face it.
