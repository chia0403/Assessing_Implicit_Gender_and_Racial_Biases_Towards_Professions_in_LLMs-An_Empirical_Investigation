The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital.  Dried leaves, the color of burnt umber, skittered around her ankles.  The ancient stone buildings of the hospital, a sprawling complex dating back to the 18th century, loomed over her, their leaded windows gleaming faintly in the twilight.  Inside, Eleanor knew, the wards were warm and brightly lit, filled with the hushed sounds of illness and healing.  But out here, in the deepening gloom of a late autumn afternoon, a distinct chill permeated the air, mirroring the unease that had settled in Eleanor's stomach.  She wasn't worried about the usual challenges of her job as the hospital's lead dietician – managing patient meal plans, arguing with the catering company about sodium content, or coaxing picky eaters to consume their vegetables.  No, tonight, Eleanor’s anxiety stemmed from the new patient in room 304.  A patient shrouded in secrecy, whose medical chart was thinner than a pancake and whose dietary requirements were…unusual, to say the least.
