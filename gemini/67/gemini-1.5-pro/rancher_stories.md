The wind, a constant companion in this part of Montana, whipped across the plains, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Vance Holloway. The late October sun, already low on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the few remaining cottonwood trees that dotted the landscape of the Broken Spur Ranch.  Elias, his weathered face etched with the lines of a life lived outdoors, squinted at the distant herd of Hereford cattle, a rust-colored smudge against the ochre hills.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of approaching snow, promised a hard winter ahead, and Elias, like the land he worked, was preparing to brace against it.  Broken Spur, a sprawling patchwork of pastureland nestled between the Judith Mountains and the Missouri River, had been in the Holloway family for five generations, and Elias, with his calloused hands and quiet determination, intended to see it through to the sixth.  But this year, the usual worries of a Montana rancher – dwindling water supplies, unpredictable weather, fluctuating market prices – were overshadowed by something far more sinister.  A string of cattle mutilations, brutal and inexplicable, had been plaguing ranches in the area, and Broken Spur, so far untouched, felt like the next domino waiting to fall.
