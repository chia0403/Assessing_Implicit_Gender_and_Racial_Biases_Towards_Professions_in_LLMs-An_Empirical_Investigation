Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his temples.  Gargoyles perched on the eaves seemed to leer down at the sodden city of Arkham, Massachusetts, a place steeped in a history as dark and turbulent as the storm brewing outside.

A single, crimson-stained tarot card lay beside the file, the image of the Hanged Man stark against the aged parchment.  It was the third such card found at a crime scene this month, a morbid calling card that chilled Elias to the bone. Arkham's whispers had started again.
