The bell above the door to "Petal & Sprig" chimed a whimsical two-note melody, announcing a customer just as Elara Thistlewick pricked her thumb on a particularly stubborn rose thorn.  A tiny bead of blood welled up, crimson against the creamy white of the 'Avalanche' rose.  Elara sucked on her thumb, wincing, the metallic tang momentarily overwhelming the heady perfume of lilies and freesia that usually permeated her little shop.  Petal & Sprig, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, was Elara's sanctuary, a riot of color and fragrance against the grey backdrop of the town. Rain pattered softly against the large front window, blurring the view of the perpetually misty moorland that stretched beyond the town limits.  Inside, amongst the overflowing buckets of hydrangeas and the trailing ivy that climbed the exposed brick walls, a sense of vibrant life persisted, defying the melancholy that seemed to cling to Hollow Creek like the ever-present fog.
