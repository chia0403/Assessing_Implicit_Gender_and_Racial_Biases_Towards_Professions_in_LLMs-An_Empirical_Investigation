The rusty clang of a dropped wrench echoed through the cavernous garage, swallowed by the scent of motor oil, stale coffee, and the faint ghost of burnt rubber. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of "Rosie's Rides," a small auto repair shop nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bowling alley on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Oregon.

It was a Tuesday, which usually meant a slow trickle of oil changes and the occasional tire rotation.  But today, Harmony Creek seemed to have collectively decided their vehicles were in perfect working order, leaving Ellie with nothing but the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the company of a disassembled '67 Mustang, its engine splayed across a workbench like a metallic heart awaiting surgery.
