The velvet curtains of the dilapidated Rialto Theatre in Port Blossom, Oregon, smelled of dust and forgotten dreams.  Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of  Eleanor Vance's worn leather boots as she paced the stage.  October had arrived, dragging with it a chilling dampness that seeped into the very bones of the building, a building Eleanor had sworn she would revitalize, a building that currently held the fragile weight of her future.  Her breath plumed in the frigid air, illuminated by the single work light clamped to a rusty pipe above.  Around her, shadows danced in the cavernous space, whispering tales of past glories and looming failures. The Rialto, once the jewel of the coastal town, had fallen into disrepair, a victim of changing times and dwindling audiences. Eleanor, however, saw not decay, but potential. She saw not ghosts, but a stage waiting to be brought back to life.  This production, a daring reimagining of Shakespeare's "The Tempest," was her last chance.
