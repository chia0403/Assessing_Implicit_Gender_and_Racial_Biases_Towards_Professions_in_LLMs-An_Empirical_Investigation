The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he trudged across the shingle beach. The sky, a bruised purple, mirrored the churning grey water below.  Salt spray clung to his thick wool coat and the battered leather of his medical bag.  It was late November in the small, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged Aberdeenshire coast of Scotland. The village, a cluster of granite cottages huddled against the elements, was normally quiet, but tonight an unnatural stillness hung in the air, broken only by the mournful cry of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the sea wall.  A single, flickering lamp in the window of the 'Fisherman's Rest' was the only beacon of warmth in the encroaching darkness.  Elias had a feeling this was going to be a long night.
