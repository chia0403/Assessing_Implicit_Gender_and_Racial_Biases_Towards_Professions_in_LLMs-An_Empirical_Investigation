The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby buzzed like trapped wasps, a counterpoint to the soothing strains of Vivaldi emanating from hidden speakers.  Dust motes danced in the artificial sunlight filtering through the enormous stained-glass window depicting a improbably bucolic scene of nymphs frolicking with cherubic sheep.  Eleanor Vance, seated behind the imposing mahogany reception desk, tapped a crimson-painted nail against the worn leather blotter, her expression a carefully cultivated mask of polite indifference.  The Grand Majestic, despite its grandiose name, was fading. The carpets were threadbare, the gilt on the ornate furniture chipped, and the air conditioning struggled to combat the sweltering Charleston summer.  Eleanor, however, remained immaculate in her crisp navy uniform, her auburn hair perfectly coiffed, a silent testament to her professionalism amidst the slow decay. This Tuesday morning promised to be as uneventful as any other, until a man with eyes like glacial ice and a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist walked through the revolving doors.
