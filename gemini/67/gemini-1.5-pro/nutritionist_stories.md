The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Hibiscus Health Hut, a melodic counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the smoothie blender. Dr. Eleanor Vance, a registered dietitian with a PhD in Nutritional Biochemistry and a penchant for tropical shirts, surveyed her small but vibrant clinic. Located in the sleepy, sun-drenched (usually) town of Harmony Bay, Florida, the Hut was her sanctuary, a place where she could preach the gospel of good food and vibrant living.  Palm trees swayed wildly outside, their fronds lashing against the windows like frantic dancers. It was the kind of torrential downpour that usually heralded the arrival of something unexpected in Harmony Bay, and Eleanor, wiping down the stainless steel counter, had a feeling today would be no exception.
