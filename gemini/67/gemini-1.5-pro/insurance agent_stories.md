The relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the interior of Amelia Reyes's 2012 Honda Civic to a sweltering oven.  A tumbleweed, skeletal and brittle, skittered across the deserted expanse and snagged on her rear bumper. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair out of her face.  It was already 103 degrees at 9:00 am, and the shimmering heat haze rising from the blacktop made the two-story, adobe-style buildings of the dusty town of Desolation Point seem to wobble and melt in the distance.  Amelia, a seasoned insurance agent for Desert Bloom Insurance, was not used to house calls this early, especially not ones that required driving forty miles out of Phoenix into the literal middle of nowhere.  But Mr. Silas Blackwood, a recent transplant from somewhere “back East,” as he’d vaguely described it, had been insistent. His prize-winning orchids, apparently, were insured for an exorbitant sum, and one of them had inexplicably wilted overnight. He needed Amelia there immediately.  She adjusted her sensible blazer and grabbed her briefcase, the metallic click echoing in the oppressive silence.  Desolation Point might be a godforsaken dustbowl, but a claim was a claim.
