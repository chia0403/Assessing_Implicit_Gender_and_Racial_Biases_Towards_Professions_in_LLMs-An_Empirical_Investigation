The late afternoon sun, filtered through the frosted glass of "Knot Another Day Massage Therapy," cast long shadows across the waiting room.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the calming scent of lavender and chamomile that permeated the air. Rain pattered softly against the large bay window, a soothing counterpoint to the gentle strains of panpipe music drifting from a hidden speaker.  Eleanor Vance, her hands still faintly scented with peppermint oil from her last client, glanced at the clock.  4:57 pm.  Almost time for Mr. Henderson, her most enigmatic regular. He always arrived precisely at 5:00 pm on Tuesdays, booked for a deep tissue massage, and never spoke more than a few words. Eleanor, despite her naturally inquisitive nature, had learned to respect his silence, finding a strange solace in the quiet rhythm of kneading away the tension in his perpetually tight shoulders.  Outside, the rain intensified, mirroring the knot of unease that was beginning to tighten in Eleanor's own chest. Mr. Henderson was always punctual.  Five oâ€™clock came and went, the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner suddenly loud in the stillness.  Five minutes past. Then ten.  He'd never been late before.
