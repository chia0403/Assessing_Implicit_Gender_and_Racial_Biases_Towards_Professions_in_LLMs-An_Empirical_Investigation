The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Medical Center hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's early morning routine. The clock above the nurses' station blinked 6:02 AM, a cruel reminder that Amelia's internal clock was far superior to any man-made device.  Outside, the Los Angeles sky was just beginning to blush a soft pink, but inside the Phlebotomy Lab, it was perpetually a sterile, shadowless white.  Amelia, in her crisp lavender scrubs, snapped on a pair of latex gloves, the familiar snap echoing in the otherwise silent lab.  A neatly arranged tray of needles, tourniquets, and labelled vials awaited her, gleaming under the harsh lights.  Today, like every day, Amelia would be the first point of contact for dozens of patients, a silent collector of the vital fluids that whispered their stories of health and illness.  The quiet hum of the refrigerator storing blood samples and the faint antiseptic smell were the only companions she needed before the hospital truly came alive.
