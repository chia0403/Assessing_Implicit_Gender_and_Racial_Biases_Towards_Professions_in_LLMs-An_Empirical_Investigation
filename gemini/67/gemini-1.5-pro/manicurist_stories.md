The bell above the door of "Nailed It," jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the large front window.  Amelie Dubois, her name tag pinned neatly to her blush-pink apron, sighed.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late November, the sky the colour of a bruised plum, and business in the tiny salon tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down fish and chip shop, was predictably slow.  Amelie glanced at the clock – 2:47 pm.  Only Mrs. Henderson, a regular with a penchant for alarmingly long acrylics and gossip, had braved the weather so far.  The salon itself, painted a soothing lavender, smelled of acetone and something vaguely floral, a scent Amelie couldn’t quite place but suspected came from the perpetually wilting bouquet of lilies by the cash register.  Outside, the neon glow of the laundromat next door cast a strange, ethereal light on the rain-slicked pavement, illuminating the empty bus stop across the street.  Amelie tapped a perfectly manicured, scarlet nail against the counter, the silence broken only by the rhythmic whir of the nail dryer and the distant rumble of thunder.  She hoped for another customer, someone interesting, someone with stories hidden beneath their cuticles and a willingness to share them.
