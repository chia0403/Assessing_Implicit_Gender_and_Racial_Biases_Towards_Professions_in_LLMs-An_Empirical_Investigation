Rain lashed against the gothic arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a frantic percussionist against the aged glass.  The room, typically a sanctuary of calm, felt oppressive tonight. Shadows danced across the Persian rug, mimicking the flickering gaslight streetlamp visible through the rain-streaked panes.  Elias, his full name Elias Vance Thorne, adjusted his spectacles, the faint metallic click a sharp counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the downpour. He watched the reflection of his tired face in the darkened window, a face lined with the weight of other people's secrets. His office, perched high above the fog-wreathed streets of Victorian London, in a converted attic space on Harley Street, usually offered a panoramic view of the bustling city. Tonight, however, it offered only a blurry, impressionistic painting of rain and shadow. The air, thick with the scent of old books and damp wool, crackled with an unsettling energy. Elias had a feeling this night was going to be unlike any other.
