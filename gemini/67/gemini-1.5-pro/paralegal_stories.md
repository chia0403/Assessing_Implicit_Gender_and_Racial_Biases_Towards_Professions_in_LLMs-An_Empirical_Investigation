The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Sons law offices buzzed in Amelia Hayes' ears, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her acrylic nails on the worn mahogany desk. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune around the gothic spires of the Tribune Tower, hinting at the November chill seeping through the ill-fitting windows. Amelia, bundled in a thick cardigan despite the stuffy office air, squinted at the dense paragraph of legalese on her monitor.  The clock on the wall ticked towards 7 pm, the crimson numbers a stark reminder that she was the only one left on the twenty-second floor, save for the slumbering security guard in the lobby far below. The case, a particularly thorny intellectual property dispute involving a stolen bagel recipe (yes, a bagel recipe), had kept her chained to her desk for the past twelve hours.  Just as she finally felt the fog of exhaustion beginning to lift, a sharp *ping* from her inbox jolted her back to alertness.  An email from Mr. Kressler himself. Subject line: URGENT.
