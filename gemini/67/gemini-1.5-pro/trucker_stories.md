The neon "Open 24 Hours" sign of the Crossroads Diner buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of the parking lot.  Delaney "Del"  McBride, her knuckles raw from gripping the steering wheel for the last twelve hours, pulled her rig, a beat-up Kenworth W900 she affectionately called "The Wanderer," into a vacant spot.  The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel and damp earth, a familiar perfume on this lonely stretch of Highway 17 just outside of Jericho, Nevada. Rain lashed against the cab, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing ache behind Del's eyes. Jericho, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it town nestled between the unforgiving Mojave Desert and the even more unforgiving silence of the Nevada night, was just another pit stop on a long haul to somewhere better, somewhere Del hadn't quite figured out yet.
