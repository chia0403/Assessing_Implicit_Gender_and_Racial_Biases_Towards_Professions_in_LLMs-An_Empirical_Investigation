The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of the small, clapboard veterinary clinic. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Vance Holloway, her auburn hair escaping its braid, peered through the frosted glass at the swirling snow. The "Holloway Animal Clinic" sign, hand-painted by her grandfather and faded by decades of sun and storms, creaked rhythmically above the door.  The clinic, nestled between a dusty feed store and a long-abandoned gas station, was the only splash of vibrant color for miles â€“ its turquoise paint a defiant stand against the monochrome landscape.  This Friday evening, usually quiet, was punctuated by the frantic mewing of a kitten huddled in a cardboard box by the crackling wood stove. The wind howled again, a lonely sound that mirrored the emptiness of the highway stretching endlessly in either direction.  A storm was coming, and Ellie Holloway had a feeling it wasn't just the meteorological kind.
