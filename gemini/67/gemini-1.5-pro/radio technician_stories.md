The biting wind whipped across the desolate, rust-colored plains of Mars, stinging Amelia "Amy" Sharma's exposed cheeks.  Her breath plumed out in frosty puffs, momentarily obscuring the already limited view from the cramped comms shack perched precariously on the rim of Valles Marineris.  Inside, amongst a tangle of wires, blinking lights, and humming servers, Amy hunched over a recalcitrant console. The rhythmic beep that had plagued her for the last three sols echoed through the tiny prefabricated structure, a maddening counterpoint to the howling Martian wind.  The nearest human outpost, Ares VI, was a thousand kilometers away, a distant speck of hope in a vast, unforgiving landscape.  Amy, the sole radio technician for the remote seismic monitoring station designated MSR-7, knew that if she couldn't fix this interference, the vital data stream about Martian tectonic activity would be lost. And with it, potentially, the key to understanding the planet’s future – and humanity’s precarious foothold on it.
