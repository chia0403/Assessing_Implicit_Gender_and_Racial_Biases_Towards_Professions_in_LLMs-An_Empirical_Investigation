Dawn hadn't yet broken over the Yukon Territory, but the floodlights mounted on her Caterpillar D11T dozer painted the snowy landscape in a harsh, artificial glow.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and pine, hung heavy and still, a stark contrast to the vibrating steel beneath her work boots.  Millie adjusted her hard hat, the beam of her headlamp catching the swirling snowflakes as they danced in the artificial light. Around her, the skeletal frames of the new gold processing plant loomed like prehistoric beasts against the inky pre-dawn sky.  This was her domain.
