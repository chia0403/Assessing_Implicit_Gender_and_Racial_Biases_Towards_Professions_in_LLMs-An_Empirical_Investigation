The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" buzzed a tired, lavender glow onto the rain-slicked streets of Aethelburg.  Nestled between a perpetually closed fortune teller's shop and a laundromat that smelled faintly of burnt sugar, Finnian's establishment was a haven of warm light and the comforting aroma of bay rum and sandalwood.  Aethelburg itself was a town clinging to the edge of the whispering Greyfell Woods, a place where the air always seemed a little thicker, the shadows a little deeper, and the stories told in hushed tones around crackling fireplaces a little stranger. It was late October, the wind howling a mournful ballad through the crooked chimney pots, rattling the leaded glass panes of Finnian’s window, and carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and something else… something indefinably *wild*.  Inside, Finnian O'Malley, his silver hair gleaming under the single overhead bulb, meticulously sharpened his straight razor, the rhythmic scraping a counterpoint to the storm brewing outside.  He had a customer due any minute, a new face in town, and in Aethelburg, new faces always brought a fresh breeze of intrigue, or perhaps, something more unsettling.
