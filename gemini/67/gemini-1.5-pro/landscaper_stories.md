The biting October wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson maple leaves she was raking into a neat pile. The air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke and decaying foliage, hinted at the approaching winter that would soon blanket the Hudson Valley in snow. Amy, bundled in a thick flannel shirt, worn jeans, and her grandfather's well-loved work boots, surveyed the sprawling grounds of Oakhaven Manor with a practiced eye.  The Manor itself, a grand Victorian edifice of grey stone and dark wood, loomed over the manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds, its many windows glinting in the afternoon sun.  For generations, the Hawthorne family had tended these grounds, and Amy, the latest in a long line of dedicated landscapers, felt the weight of that legacy in every pruned branch and carefully placed stone. This autumn, however, felt different. A strange stillness hung in the air, a quiet anticipation that went beyond the usual seasonal shift.  Something was about to change at Oakhaven, Amy could feel it in her bones.
