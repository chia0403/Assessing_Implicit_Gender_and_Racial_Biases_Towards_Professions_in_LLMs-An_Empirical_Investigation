The air in the Bumblebrook Children's Center hung thick with the scent of stale apple juice and impending naptime.  Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow window film, splashed across the linoleum floor where Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne knelt, gently coaxing four-year-old Leo to relinquish his death grip on a plastic firetruck. Outside, the relentless Michigan summer hummed with cicadas and the distant drone of lawnmowers. Bumblebrook was a Victorian house, converted and expanded over the years, nestled amongst a row of similar structures now repurposed as doctors' offices and accounting firms. Its faded yellow paint and slightly crooked porch gave it a whimsical, almost storybook quality that belied the often chaotic reality within.  Amy, with her perpetually messy bun and paint-splattered cardigan, was the calm at the eye of the hurricane.  Today, however, a nervous flutter tickled her stomach. It wasn't the impending naptime struggle, nor the looming threat of Leo’s meltdown.  Something felt… different.  A shift in the air, a prickle on the back of her neck, like the moment before a thunderstorm breaks.
