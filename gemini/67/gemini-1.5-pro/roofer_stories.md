The tar hissed and bubbled, a miniature black volcano erupting onto the shingles under Elias Thorne's steady hand.  The late August sun beat down on his back, baking the sweat into his faded grey t-shirt. Below him, the sleepy town of Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling hills of the Virginia Piedmont, shimmered in the heat.  Red brick chimneys poked out from leafy green canopies, and the distant clang of a church bell echoed through the still air.  Elias adjusted his worn leather work gloves, the rough material familiar and comforting against his calloused fingers.  This was his view most days: a patchwork of rooftops, the world spread out beneath him like a map he was slowly piecing together, one shingle at a time.  Today, however, something felt different.  A flicker of movement in the dormer window of the Victorian across the street caught his eye.  Not just the shifting curtains stirred by the breeze, but a definite, purposeful movement.
