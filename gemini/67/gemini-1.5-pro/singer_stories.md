The crimson velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of anticipation, quivered slightly.  A single spotlight, sharp and unforgiving, pierced the darkness, illuminating a microphone stand centre stage at The Blue Note. A hush fell over the packed New York City jazz club, the clinking of glasses and murmured conversations replaced by a palpable buzz of excitement. It was November 17th, 1958, a night already thick with the promise of something extraordinary.  Backstage, Eleanor "Ellie" Josephine Vance traced a nervous finger along the cool metal of her saxophone, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. Tonight wasn't just another gig; tonight was her chance to finally break free from the shadows and claim her rightful place amongst the city's jazz royalty.
