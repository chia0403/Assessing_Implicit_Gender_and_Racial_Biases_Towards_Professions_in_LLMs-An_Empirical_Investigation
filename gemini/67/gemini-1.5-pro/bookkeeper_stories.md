Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Amelia Finch's bookkeeping office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the anxious flutter in her chest.  The office, tucked above Mrs. Peabody's bakery on High Street in the quaint, perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, usually offered Amelia a sense of quiet order.  Ledgers lined the shelves, each entry a testament to her meticulous nature.  The scent of cinnamon and sugar usually wafted up from below, a comforting presence.  But tonight, the sweet aroma was overpowered by the metallic tang of fear.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, and something far more unsettling than the storm was brewing in Hollow Creek.
