The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne’s ankles as he perched precariously on the top rung of his ladder.  Below him, the churning grey waters of the Puget Sound slapped against the barnacle-encrusted pilings of the old cannery pier.  Rusting machinery groaned in protest against the gusts, a metallic chorus echoing the creak of the ladder beneath Elias's weight.  Salmon Bay, usually a picturesque postcard of Seattle’s industrial waterfront, was today a tempestuous beast. Elias, bundled in a thick canvas jacket and woolen cap, squinted against the driving rain as he wrestled with the corroded junction box.  The salty air had gnawed at the wiring, leaving it brittle and treacherous.  He needed to get this last security light working before the storm truly hit, otherwise the entire pier, and the fledgling artist collective it now housed, would be plunged into darkness.
