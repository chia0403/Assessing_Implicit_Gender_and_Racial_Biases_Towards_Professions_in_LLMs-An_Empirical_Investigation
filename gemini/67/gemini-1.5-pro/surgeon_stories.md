The biting wind whipped across the East River, rattling the ancient windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's apartment. Twenty-two stories below, the city lights of Manhattan glittered like a spilled box of jewels.  Inside, the only illumination came from a single desk lamp, casting long shadows across the meticulously organized medical journals and anatomical charts that lined the walls.  It was 3:17 am, a time Elias usually reserved for stolen moments of quiet contemplation before the controlled chaos of the operating room consumed him. Tonight, however, the quiet was fractured.  A persistent tremor vibrated through his left hand, a subtle reminder of the car accident six months prior that had almost cost him his career. He picked up a scalpel from his desk, the cool steel a familiar comfort against his palm, and began meticulously dissecting a perfectly ripe pear.  Outside, the first tentative fingers of dawn began to paint the sky a pale, bruised purple, mirroring the anxieties swirling within him. A single phone call was all it took to shatter the fragile peace, summoning him back to the relentless demands of life and death at Lenox Hill Hospital.
