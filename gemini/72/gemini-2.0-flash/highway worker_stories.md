Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and introducing the main character, a highway worker named Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins.

**Story Opening:**

The whine of the saw cut through the humid Georgia air, a high-pitched scream that momentarily drowned out the rumble of eighteen-wheelers hurtling down I-95. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The midday sun beat down on the asphalt, turning the highway into a shimmering oven. He squinted at the shattered remains of the guardrail, jagged metal teeth pointing accusingly at the sky. Another one. This was the third accident this month on this particular stretch of highway, a cursed bend just south of Savannah.

He switched off the saw, the silence deafening in its wake. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of diesel and freshly cut grass. A lone hawk circled overhead, a black silhouette against the blinding blue. Bart sighed, the weight of the heat, the traffic, and the constant repairs settling heavy on his shoulders. He pulled a crumpled pack of Marlboros from his breast pocket and lit one, the smoke a brief and fleeting comfort.

This wasn't how he pictured his life. Heâ€™d dreamed of being a musician, filling concert halls with his saxophone, not filling potholes on a highway to hell. But dreams, like spilled coffee, rarely go where you intend them to. He took a long drag, the nicotine a small jolt to his weary system, and surveyed the scene. Time to get back to work. People were waiting. The highway demanded it.

**Setting:**

The story is set on a particularly accident-prone section of Interstate 95, a major highway running along the East Coast of the United States, specifically a stretch just south of Savannah, Georgia. The time is present day, during a hot and humid summer. The scene is a highway work zone, with orange cones, flashing lights, and the constant roar of traffic creating a sense of danger and urgency. The landscape is flat, mostly scrub pines and palmetto trees lining the edges of the highway. The air is thick with humidity and the smell of diesel, asphalt, and cut grass. The general atmosphere is one of heat, exhaustion, and a constant, low-level tension due to the proximity of speeding vehicles.
