The fluorescent lights of the "MegaMart Bargain Bonanza" hummed with the aggressive efficiency of a beehive, buzzing a frantic tune that threatened to burrow into Amelia Beatrice Bumble's skull. Amelia, clutching a half-empty cup of lukewarm coffee, surveyed her domain: a sprawling aisle dedicated to “Household Helpers,” crammed with lemon-scented everything. Disinfectant sprays, self-wringing mops, robotic vacuum cleaners that looked vaguely like sentient hockey pucks - the whole nine yards of domestic bliss (or, more often, barely contained chaos).

Amelia’s territory was the “Supreme Scrub-Master 5000,” a monstrosity of a cleaning device boasting five oscillating brush heads, a steam-powered dirt blaster, and a voice that could curdle milk. Usually, the Scrub-Master just sat there, a chrome-plated behemoth silently judging the inadequacy of every mop in its vicinity. But today, Amelia felt a sliver of optimism. It was Saturday, the air was thick with the promise of impulse buys, and Amelia Bumble was determined to sell at least one Supreme Scrub-Master 5000, or face the withering disappointment of her manager, Mr. Henderson, who had a habit of communicating entirely through the dramatic sighs of a man perpetually on the verge of combustion. Today, Amelia was a saleswoman on a mission. And MegaMart Bargain Bonanza, with its linoleum floors and the faint, ever-present aroma of popcorn, was her battlefield.
