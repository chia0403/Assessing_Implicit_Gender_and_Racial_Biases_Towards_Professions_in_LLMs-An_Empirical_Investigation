The fluorescent lights of "Fresh Foods Emporium" buzzed with the same relentless, unwavering intensity as Miriam Eleanor Davenportâ€™s anxiety. It was a Thursday, late afternoon, the kind of hour where harried parents with screeching children vied for position with the equally-stressed office workers grabbing ingredients for quick, guilt-free dinners. Miriam, perched on her ergonomically questionable stool behind register seven, took a deep breath, trying to channel the placid serenity of the desktop screensaver showcasing a misty mountain lake.

The setting was precisely as it always was: a symphony of consumerism orchestrated in the sterile white and lime-green color scheme of the grocery store. The air hung heavy with the perfume of overly-ripe avocados and the lingering, metallic tang of the meat counter. Aisles stretched out before her like organized canyons of processed delights. To her left, a mountain of discounted day-old pastries beckoned with a siren song of empty calories. To her right, the ever-present security guard, Carl, pretended to browse the magazine rack, his eyes darting suspiciously at anyone who lingered near the expensive imported cheeses.

Miriam straightened her nametag, its plastic surface already smudged with stray grocery dust. The rhythmic *beep-beep-beep* of the scanner was about to begin anew, the opening act in another Thursday evening performance of groceries and anxieties. She just hoped she wouldn't accidentally charge Mrs. Henderson twice for her organic kale chips again.
