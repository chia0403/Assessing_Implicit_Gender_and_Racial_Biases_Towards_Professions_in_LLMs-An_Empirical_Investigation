## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The shrill ring of the service bell cut through the otherwise hushed lobby like a broken promise. Leo Maxwell adjusted the peaked cap perched precariously on his head, its gold braid a stark contrast to the perpetually weary look in his eyes. Another guest. Another bag. Another potential sliver of a tip he could squirrel away. He smoothed down the red and gold uniform, the scratchy wool itching against his skin even in the climate-controlled air, and plastered on the practiced, polite smile that felt less like genuine warmth and more like a mask glued to his face.

"Coming!" he called, the word bouncing off the polished marble floor and echoing amongst the towering potted palms that guarded the entrance to the Grand Imperial Hotel. He pulled his luggage cart from its designated corner, its wheels squeaking a mournful tune that only he seemed to notice, and hurried towards the revolving doors.

**Setting:**

The Grand Imperial Hotel stood as a monument to a bygone era of opulence and grandeur in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter. Built in the 1920s, it boasted towering columns, ornate wrought-iron balconies overflowing with vibrant bougainvillea, and a façade of gleaming white stucco that caught the humid Louisiana sunlight. Inside, the lobby was a testament to old-world charm. Crystal chandeliers dripped from the high ceilings, casting a soft glow on the plush velvet seating arrangements. A grand piano stood silently in the corner, waiting for a performer to coax life back into its ivory keys. The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and the faint, lingering aroma of strong coffee and beignets from the hotel's esteemed café. While whispers of modernization had swirled around the Grand Imperial for years, the management stubbornly clung to its traditions, its very essence steeped in a romantic, albeit slightly faded, past. It was a place where time seemed to move slower, where the ghosts of famous guests still lingered in the hallways, and where even the youngest bellhop, Leo Maxwell, felt the weight of its history pressing down upon him.
