## Story Opening:

The clock on the wall of Phillip Harold Blackwoodâ€™s cramped office was a cruel mistress, mocking him with its slow, deliberate ticks. Each one chipped away at the remaining seconds of April 15th, the dreaded Tax Day deadline. Outside, the rain was a relentless drumbeat against the frosted windows of the "Blackwood & Brown - Your Tax Solutions" storefront, mirroring the relentless pressure building in Phillip's chest. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, the familiar scent of cheap coffee and recycled paper doing little to soothe his fraying nerves. Another form sat on his desk, a labyrinth of numbers and deductions that swam before his weary eyes. This one belonged to Mrs. Gladys Periwinkle, a cat enthusiast with a penchant for "creative" accounting. Phillip sighed, a sound like air escaping a punctured tire. He needed a vacation. He needed a new career. He needed, at the very least, a strong drink. But right now, he just needed to decipher if Mrs. Periwinkle actually spent $3,000 on catnip.

## Setting:

The office of "Blackwood & Brown - Your Tax Solutions" was located on the less-than-glamorous side of Elm Street in the small, perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Oregon. The building, a former laundromat, retained a faint smell of dryer sheets mingled with the more potent aroma of tax law. Inside, the walls were painted a shade of beige so bland it was practically invisible, and adorned with framed, slightly-faded certificates from various accounting seminars Phillip and his (now retired) partner, Mr. Brown, had attended. Two desks cluttered with paperwork, a temperamental computer, and a waiting area furnished with uncomfortable plastic chairs completed the picture. A chipped ceramic cat, a leftover from Mr. Brown's eccentric decorating phase, sat precariously on the filing cabinet, watching over the chaos with a glazed-over stare. The overall impression was one of quiet desperation, a place where dreams went to die and deductions went to be scrutinized.
