Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and full name of the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The air in "The Cleaver's Charm" hung thick with the scent of sawdust, brine, and the faint, metallic tang of blood, a scent that Thomas Ashton Blackwood had long ago ceased to notice. Steam billowed from the massive pot on the far burner, the simmering broth a comforting hum in the otherwise quiet pre-dawn hours. He ran a calloused hand over the gleaming edge of his boning knife, the steel whispering against his skin like a lover's secret. Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven market square were still slick with the night's drizzle, the gas lamps casting a weak, amber glow that barely pierced the gloom. Today was market day, a brutal ballet of elbows, haggling, and the constant need to outwit Mrs. Higgins from the bakery who always tried to sneak off with extra bacon rinds. Thomas sighed, a puff of air that briefly fogged the already grimy window. Time to dance.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Oakhaven, a small, somewhat isolated market town nestled in a valley known for its livestock. The time period is roughly late 1800s, early 1900s - a time when butchers held a respected and essential place in the community. "The Cleaver's Charm" is Thomas Blackwood's butcher shop, a somewhat cramped but well-maintained establishment located right on the main market square. The shop itself is a mix of old and new, with inherited antique butcher blocks standing alongside newer, more efficient refrigeration units. The walls are lined with hooks and various cutting tools, each meticulously cleaned and sharpened. The atmosphere is functional, but Thomas takes pride in its cleanliness and the quality of his wares.
