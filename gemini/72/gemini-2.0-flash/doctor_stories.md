**Opening:**

The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's small cottage, mimicking the turmoil in her own heart. A low, guttural growl rumbled from somewhere deep within the overgrown thicket that bordered her property, a sound that sent a shiver down her spine despite the warmth radiating from the peat fire in her hearth. Usually, she found solace in the rhythm of a storm, a sense of cleansing renewal that mirrored her own approach to healing. Tonight, however, the wind seemed to whisper secrets, dark and unsettling, secrets that mirrored the chilling unease she'd been feeling for weeks. Her patient, old Mrs. Albright, had rambled about shadows and whispers on her deathbed, dismissing them as fever dreams. But Eleanor knew Mrs. Albright. She hadn't been a woman prone to flights of fancy, and the fear in her eyes had been stark and real.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the secluded, windswept village of Hollow Creek, nestled in the Scottish Highlands. Hollow Creek is a place where the old ways cling tight, where ancient superstitions linger in the mists that perpetually shroud the rolling hills. The village itself consists of a handful of stone cottages, a weathered church, and a single, dimly lit pub called "The Crooked Cairn." The surrounding landscape is dominated by rugged mountains, dense forests, and the ever-present, brooding presence of Loch Ard, a deep, dark lake rumored to be haunted by creatures of folklore. Eleanor Vance's cottage, built on the outskirts of the village, is a small, stone structure with a slate roof and a garden bursting with medicinal herbs. It is a place of quiet comfort, a sanctuary from the harsh realities of life in Hollow Creek, but even within its sturdy walls, the whispers of the Highlands can penetrate, bringing with them a sense of unease and foreboding.
