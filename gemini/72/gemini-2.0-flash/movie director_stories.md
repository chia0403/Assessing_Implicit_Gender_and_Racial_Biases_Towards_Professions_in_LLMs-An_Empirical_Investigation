The insistent, rhythmic tapping on the glass was the only sound breaking through the organized chaos of the soundstage. Benedict Augustine Sterling, IV, his brow furrowed in a perpetual state of artistic anxiety, didn't even flinch. He was far too engrossed in the microscopic adjustments being made to the placement of a single, perfectly aged Victorian teacup on a mahogany table.

He knew who it was anyway. Agnes, his long-suffering assistant, the human equivalent of a caffeine-fueled Swiss Army knife, would only resort to physical percussion if something truly, cosmically disastrous had occurred. He just hoped it wasnâ€™t the studio head come to deliver yet another lecture on the ever-ballooning budget of "The Clockwork Heart," his passion project - a neo-Victorian steampunk romance that was, in Benedict's humble opinion, destined for cinematic immortality, and, in the studio's slightly less humble opinion, destined to bankrupt them all.

The soundstage, nestled deep within the sprawling Culver Studios complex in Los Angeles, was a meticulously crafted replica of a London drawing-room circa 1888. Gas lamps, painstakingly sourced from antique dealers across Europe, cast a warm, flickering glow on velvet drapes, ornate wallpaper, and an unsettlingly realistic waxwork bust of Queen Victoria staring down from a pedestal. The air, thick with dust motes dancing in the lamplight, smelled of old books, beeswax polish, and simmering dread. This was Benedict's kingdom, a meticulously curated world where time seemed to slow down, where the past could be relived, and where he, Benedict Augustine Sterling, IV, could finally escape the crushing banality of the present.
