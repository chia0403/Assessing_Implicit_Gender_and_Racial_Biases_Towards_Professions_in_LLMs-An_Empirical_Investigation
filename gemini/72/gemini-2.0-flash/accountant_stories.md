The stale air of the office building hung thick with the scent of old coffee and desperation. Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to another Tuesday that felt like a Monday. Around her, colleagues typed with a frenetic energy that bordered on panic, fueled by impending deadlines and the gnawing anxiety of spreadsheet errors. But inside her tiny, meticulously organized cubicle, nestled amongst a forest of filing cabinets in the corner of the tenth floor, Imogen Amelia Blackwood found a semblance of peace.

The office, "Sterling, Finch & Associates, Chartered Accountants," was located in a nondescript glass tower in the financial district of Toronto. It was a place of muted colors, calculated decisions, and the silent hum of data streams flowing from computer to computer. From her vantage point, Imogen could just barely see a sliver of Lake Ontario shimmering beyond the neighboring skyscrapers. It was a reminder that there was a world outside the confines of balance sheets and profit margins.

Imogen, unlike her more stressed-out counterparts, possessed a certain zen-like calm when faced with a mountain of numbers. She was a master of the ledger, a whisperer to spreadsheets, a devotee of the decimal point. And right now, she was about to uncover a discrepancy that would shatter the quiet order of her world.
