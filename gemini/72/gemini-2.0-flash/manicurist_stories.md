The midday sun, filtered through the gauzy curtains of "Nails by Nancy," cast a hazy, rose-tinted glow on the chipped, floral-patterned linoleum. The air, thick with the sweet, chemical tang of acrylic and the low hum of the ventilation system, vibrated with the saccharine strains of a 90s pop playlist, currently blasting out Aqua’s “Barbie Girl” at a slightly-too-enthusiastic volume.

Beatrice “Bea” Evangeline Rossetti hummed along, her own lips painted a daring shade of electric fuchsia, as she meticulously sculpted a perfectly arched nail extension on Mrs. Henderson’s left pinky. Bea was, in her own humble opinion, a goddamn artist, and Mrs. Henderson's hands were her canvas, even if that canvas was perpetually clammy and prone to unsolicited stories about her grandson's unfortunate incident with a rogue squirrel.

Nails by Nancy wasn’t exactly Bea’s dream studio. Tucked away in a strip mall nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually struggling tax preparation service in the sleepy, suburban sprawl of Maplewood, New Jersey, it wasn't exactly a hotbed of high fashion or groundbreaking nail trends. Nancy, the owner, was a sweet, if slightly scatterbrained, woman whose aesthetic peaked sometime in the mid-80s and hadn't budged since. But it was a job, and Bea needed a job. Besides, the clientele, mostly comprised of bored housewives, sweet old ladies, and the occasional teenage girl prepping for prom, were, for the most part, predictable and surprisingly loyal.

Bea glanced at the clock above the reception desk. 12:17 PM. Almost lunchtime. And hopefully, no more Mrs. Hendersons for a while. The image of a perfectly curated Instagram feed, overflowing with avant-garde nail art designs, danced in her head. One day, she thought, her little corner of Maplewood wouldn’t contain her. One day, Beatrice Evangeline Rossetti would be a nail legend, not just a purveyor of pink and white acrylics to the residents of suburban New Jersey.
