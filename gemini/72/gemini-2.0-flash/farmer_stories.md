The persistent drone of cicadas was the soundtrack to Silas Ebenezer Wainwright's life. It seeped into his dreams, a buzzing lullaby as monotonous and unwavering as the summer sun beating down on his acres of corn. He wiped the sweat from his brow, the red dust of the Oklahoma soil clinging to his skin like a second hide. He squinted at the horizon, a shimmering haze blurring the line between the parched earth and the vast, indifferent blue of the sky. Silas had seen this sky darken with promise and then cruelly withhold its rain too many times.

This was Wainwright's Folly, the name his father, a man known more for grit than foresight, had bestowed upon the land. Ninety acres of stubborn, sun-baked earth, a small, weather-beaten farmhouse clinging to the crest of a gentle hill, and a barn that groaned with every gust of wind. It wasn't much, but it was Silas's. And right now, it was thirsty.
