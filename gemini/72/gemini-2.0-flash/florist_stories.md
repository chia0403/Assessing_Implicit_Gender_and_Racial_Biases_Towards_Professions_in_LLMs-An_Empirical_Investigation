The scent of a thousand blooms hung heavy in the air, a dizzying cocktail of sweet alyssum and earthy hellebore. Outside, a November drizzle turned the cobblestones of Pennyfeather Lane slick and treacherous. Inside "Petals & Prose," however, it was a sanctuary of warmth and color. Clementine Aurora Bellweather, her auburn hair escaping its messy bun in tendrils that mirrored the delicate tendrils of a climbing jasmine, sighed and rubbed the ache from her lower back. She was knee-deep in discarded ribbon and stray petals, surrounded by the aftermath of a busy morning.

Clementine, whose heart felt as inextricably intertwined with flowers as the vines around her shop’s ancient brick facade, surveyed the organized chaos. She’d just finished arranging a sympathy bouquet for Mrs. Higgins, a cheerful burst of yellow daffodils meant to offer a whisper of spring in the face of winter’s gloom, and now she needed to prepare for the afternoon rush. The scent of rosemary and sage, simmering in a pot on the back burner, promised a soothing tea and a brief respite before the next customer walked through her fragrant doorway. This little corner of Havenwood, a quaint town nestled at the foot of the Whispering Mountains, was Clementine's world, her haven, her canvas. And right now, that canvas was a riot of floral possibility.
