## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The insistent beeping ripped Dr. Alistair Trevelyan Hayes from the clutches of a restless sleep. He blinked, the pale pre-dawn light struggling to penetrate the thick blackout curtains, and groaned. Another one. Another goddamn emergency consult. He fumbled for his glasses on the bedside table, the cool metal a jarring contrast to the heat rising in his frustration. He checked the time: 3:17 AM. Wonderful. He was going to be running on fumes for a triple coronary bypass he had scheduled for 9.

The message displayed on his phone was terse and to the point: "Trauma one. GSW to abdomen. Possible aortic involvement. Stat. Dr. Singh unavailable."

Alistair swore under his breath. Singh was on call. What the hell had happened? But he didn't have time to dwell. A gunshot wound to the abdomen with potential aortic damage was a ticking time bomb. He threw back the duvet and swung his legs over the side of the bed, the familiar thud of his bare feet hitting the hardwood floor a prelude to the chaos he knew awaited him.

**Setting:**

Alistair Trevelyan Hayes lives in a meticulously renovated Victorian townhouse in the heart of Boston's Back Bay. The house, purchased with the signing bonus from his current hospital, Boston General, is a stark contrast to the chaotic and often heartbreaking world he navigates within the hospital walls. The interior is minimalist and modern, featuring clean lines, exposed brick, and carefully curated artwork that offers a semblance of peace and control. A state-of-the-art kitchen, barely used, dominates the ground floor. The bedroom, on the second floor, is dominated by a king-size bed and a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a quiet, tree-lined street. The overall atmosphere is one of understated luxury and calculated order, a sanctuary designed to shield him from the relentless pressures of his profession. The house is a reflection of Alistair himself: brilliant, composed, and intensely private.
