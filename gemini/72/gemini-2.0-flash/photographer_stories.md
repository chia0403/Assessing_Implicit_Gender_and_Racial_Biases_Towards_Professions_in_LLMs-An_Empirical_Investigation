The biting wind whipped across the weathered shingles of the lighthouse keeper’s cottage, tasting of salt and regret. Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau hunched deeper into her oilskin jacket, the damp seeping through its fabric despite its promises. Outside, the churning Atlantic was a canvas of muted grays, the waves crashing against the jagged cliffs with the rhythmic ferocity of a drumbeat. This wasn't the postcard-perfect coastal Maine scene she’d envisioned. This was brutal, unforgiving, and utterly captivating.

She shivered, pulling the woolen scarf higher around her neck. The interior of the cottage offered meager solace. The single room was sparsely furnished with a rickety table, a threadbare rug, and a cast-iron stove that grudgingly offered a lukewarm warmth. The previous lighthouse keeper, Old Silas, had left it as he'd lived – simple, functional, and devoid of charm. But that suited Izzy just fine. She wasn't here for charm.

Izzy was here for isolation. Here to capture the raw, untamed beauty of Monhegan Island and, perhaps more importantly, to lose herself within the lens of her camera. She'd come to Monhegan to escape the suffocating expectations of her family, the pressure to settle down, and the ghost of a relationship that still haunted her dreams.

She glanced at her camera bag, a worn leather satchel overflowing with lenses, filters, and half-empty film canisters. This was her shield, her confidante, her weapon against the encroaching darkness that threatened to consume her. And as the foghorn blared its mournful call across the desolate landscape, Isabelle Moreau knew she was exactly where she needed to be, even if she wasn't entirely sure why. The island, and her camera, held a secret. And she intended to unlock it.
