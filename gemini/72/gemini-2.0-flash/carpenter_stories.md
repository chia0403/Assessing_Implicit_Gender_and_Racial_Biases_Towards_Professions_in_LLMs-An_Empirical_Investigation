## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind howled through the gaps in the window frames of the old Victorian boarding house in Astoria, Oregon. Salt spray coated the glass, blurring the flickering gas lamps across the street. Inside, the smell of wood shavings and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the dreary dampness seeping in from the coast.

**Opening:**

The first knock came tentative, almost apologetic. Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands calloused and stained the color of mahogany, ignored it. He needed to finish mortising the tenons for the new legs on Mrs. Petrovich's beloved oak writing desk before the day ended. Each swing of the mallet was precise, rhythmic, a small act of defiance against the relentless rhythm of the storm battering the coastline. Another, louder knock reverberated through his cramped workshop on the ground floor. Sighing, Elias laid down his tools. His brow furrowed, the lines etched deep by years of squinting at blueprints and fretting over warped wood. He knew, with a certainty that settled like lead in his gut, that this interruption would be more trouble than it was worth. He wiped his hands on his oil-stained apron and turned toward the door, the smell of pine and the anticipation of a headache swirling around him.
