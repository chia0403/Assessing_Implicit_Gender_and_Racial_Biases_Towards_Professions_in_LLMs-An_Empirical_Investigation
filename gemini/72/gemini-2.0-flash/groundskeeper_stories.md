Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, incorporating a main character who is a groundskeeper:

**Setting:** The crumbling, gothic Blackwood Manor. It sat perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning, grey waters of the Atlantic Ocean, shrouded perpetually in mist. Ivy, thick as pythons, choked the stone walls, and gargoyles leered down from the eaves, their expressions perpetually mournful. The grounds, once meticulously manicured, were now a wild tangle of overgrown roses, skeletal trees, and a network of paths swallowed by moss and creeping vines. The air itself felt thick with the weight of forgotten memories and whispered secrets.

**Opening:**

The early morning mist clung to Jedediah Silas Blackwood’s beard, making it glisten like spun silver. He exhaled a weary breath, the condensation momentarily obscuring the chipped blade of his scythe. Another day, another battle against the relentless advance of nature’s reclaim on Blackwood Manor. For twenty years, Jedediah had been the groundskeeper, a silent guardian of this decaying behemoth. He knew every twisted branch of the ancient oaks, every crumbling stone of the overgrown walls, every mournful screech of the seabirds that circled overhead. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him deeper than the autumn wind, that something was wrong. Terribly wrong. The feeling had been building for weeks, a prickling unease that settled in his bones and made him jump at shadows. Today, though, it was more than unease. It was a palpable sense of dread, as heavy and suffocating as the fog that clung to the grounds. He paused, scythe hanging limply in his hand, and listened. The usual sounds of the estate were there – the rhythmic crashing of waves against the cliffs, the rustle of leaves in the wind, the distant caw of a crow. But beneath it all, he could swear he heard… a whisper. A faint, mournful whisper carried on the wind, a sound that spoke of sorrow and something far more sinister.
