## The Story Opening

Rain lashed against the tall windows of the lighthouse, a furious, insistent drumming that mirrored the frantic tap-tap-tapping of Elias Thorne's fingers on the worn keys of his ancient Underwood. He’d been staring at the same sentence for the last hour, a sentence that seemed to taunt him with its inadequacy.

*“The fog rolled in, thick as a shroud…”*

Elias sighed, the sound a defeated puff of air in the small, cramped room. The fog *always* rolled in, thick as a shroud, thick as pea soup, thick as… well, anything clichéd and predictable. He needed something more. He needed to *feel* it, the bone-chilling dampness that seeped into his bones, the ghostly silence that swallowed even the crashing waves.

He pushed back from the typewriter, the wooden chair groaning in protest, and rubbed his tired eyes. Outside, the beam of the lighthouse sliced through the tempest, a desperate, defiant plea against the encroaching darkness. It was a fitting metaphor, he thought grimly, for his own struggle to wrest meaning from the howling void.

He needed inspiration. He needed escape. He needed… a damn good cup of tea.

## The Setting

The setting is a remote, isolated lighthouse perched on the craggy, windswept coast of **Isle of Shadows**, an island off the coast of Scotland in the present day. The lighthouse itself, **North Point Lighthouse**, is a sturdy, cylindrical stone structure, built in the late 19th century. Inside, it’s a warren of narrow, winding staircases leading to various levels.

Elias Thorne’s living quarters are on the third level, a single room dominated by the large windows that offer a panoramic (and often terrifying) view of the sea. The room is sparsely furnished: a narrow cot, a battered desk overflowing with papers and books, a small bookshelf crammed with well-worn volumes of gothic literature and philosophy, and a vintage Underwood typewriter that Elias considers his most treasured possession. A small, electric kettle sits on a rickety table, perpetually on standby for tea. The walls are bare, save for a single, faded photograph of a smiling woman with kind eyes. The air is thick with the scent of sea salt, damp wool, and old paper. The overall impression is one of isolation, austerity, and a lingering sense of history.
