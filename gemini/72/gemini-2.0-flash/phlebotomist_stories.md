Okay, here's a story opening with a phlebotomist character and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The stale, vaguely floral-scented air of the Evergreen Medical Centerâ€™s outpatient lab hung thick and heavy, especially on Tuesdays. Outside, the morning sunlight was a promise of warmth, but inside, under the harsh fluorescent buzz, it felt like the sun had been filtered through ten layers of bureaucratic beige. Beatrice Eleanor Finch, phlebotomist extraordinaire, sighed, adjusting her name tag for what felt like the hundredth time that morning. Beatrice hated Tuesdays. The hangover from the weekend combined with the fresh dread of the week ahead seemed to coalesce in the veins of her patients, making them notoriously difficult sticks. And difficult sticks made for cranky patients.

Beatrice glanced at the waiting area. A woman with a perpetually surprised expression nursed a Styrofoam cup of coffee, a teenager scrolled through her phone with headphones blasting something Beatrice could feel more than hear, and an elderly man with a tweed hat clutched a well-worn copy of *The Daily News*. Just another Tuesday, she thought grimly.

A gentle ding announced a new patient. Beatrice forced a smile, practiced and slightly strained, and called, "Next! Mr. Henderson, please?"

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the outpatient laboratory of Evergreen Medical Center, a mid-sized hospital located in the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.

**Specific details about the lab:**

*   **Color Palette:** Predominantly beige and pale green, with splashes of color from patient artwork (mostly finger-paintings from local elementary schools) adorning the walls.
*   **Equipment:** Standard phlebotomy chairs and tables, meticulously clean. A centrifuge hums quietly in the corner. A small, locked cabinet houses sharps containers and more sensitive medical supplies.
*   **Atmosphere:** Tense, sterile, and often understaffed. The air always smells faintly of antiseptic wipes, hand sanitizer, and fear. The lighting is harsh, highlighting every imperfection.
*   **Location within the Hospital:** Tucked away on the ground floor, near the Radiology department, making it a convenient (or inconvenient, depending on your perspective) stop for many patients.

Havenwood itself is a small, close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else's business. Evergreen Medical Center is a major employer and a cornerstone of the town. The surrounding landscape is beautiful but economically depressed, leading to a mix of resilience and quiet desperation among the residents who rely on the hospital.
