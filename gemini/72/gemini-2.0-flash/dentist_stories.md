The hum of the ultrasonic scaler was a lullaby to Dr. Eleanor Anne Fairchild. Even after ten years of pulling, scraping, and polishing, the rhythmic vibrations still soothed her. She found a strange, meditative calm in the meticulous work, a solace that the rest of her life sorely lacked.

The setting was Eleanor’s meticulously designed, though perpetually slightly chaotic, dental practice, "Fairchild Family Dentistry," nestled on the leafy corner of Elm Street in the picturesque town of Willow Creek, Connecticut. The building itself was a lovingly renovated Victorian house, painted a cheerful, though not-quite-dentist-office-standard, shade of periwinkle blue. Inside, the waiting room was a deliberate attempt to combat dental anxiety: overflowing with plush armchairs, vibrant paintings by local artists (all, inevitably, depicting serene landscapes – no gnashing teeth here!), and the ever-present aroma of lavender-scented wax melts, a touch courtesy of Eleanor’s slightly eccentric, but undeniably efficient, receptionist, Agnes.

Today, however, even the periwinkle exterior and the lavender calm couldn’t quite dispel the air of anticipation crackling around the place. It was the annual Willow Creek Apple Festival, and the normally quiet town square, visible through the large bay window in the waiting room, was already starting to throb with the sounds of bluegrass music and the tantalizing scent of caramel apples. Eleanor knew her schedule was tight, packed with patients eager to get their pre-festival teeth whitening, and the thought of escaping the fluorescent lights and joining the revelry, even for just a little while, was almost overwhelming.
