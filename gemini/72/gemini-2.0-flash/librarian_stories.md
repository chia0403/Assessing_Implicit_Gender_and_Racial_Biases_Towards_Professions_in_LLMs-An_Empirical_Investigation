The scent of old paper and beeswax polish clung to the air in the Grand Reading Room, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Ainsworth. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and the intricate gold leaf patterns that adorned the ceiling, depicting scenes from ancient mythology. Eleanor, head librarian of the esteemed Blackwood Historical Society, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed her domain. The room was a cathedral to knowledge, filled with towering mahogany bookshelves that stretched towards the heavens, housing volumes centuries old. Today, however, the hallowed halls felt… different. A prickling unease crawled up Eleanor's spine, an intuition honed over twenty years of silently observing the ebb and flow of researchers, tourists, and the occasional eccentric who wandered in mistaking them for the public library. A shadow seemed to linger just beyond the sunlit patches, a feeling of being watched even though the room was officially empty save for her. The feeling had started yesterday, coincidently right after she discovered the faded map tucked inside a first edition of "A Treatise on Ancient Runes." The map, drawn on vellum and bearing strange symbols she couldn't identify, felt strangely… alive. And Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman who prided herself on logic and reason, couldn't shake the feeling that it was calling to her.
