The fluorescent lights in the faculty lounge hummed a discordant lullaby, doing little to soothe the frayed edges of Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's nerves. Tuesday afternoon, Parent-Teacher conferences. The bane of her existence, only slightly less agonizing than grading fifteen stacks of poorly-written five-paragraph essays on the symbolism of Holden Caulfield's red hunting hat. She chewed on the end of her pen, staring out the window at the dreary November sky. A few brave, or foolhardy, students were attempting a game of touch football on the soggy field, their shouts barely audible through the thick glass.

Eleanor sighed. Outside, the world was full of boundless energy and potential, messy and chaotic, just like her students. Inside, she was trapped in a beige-walled prison of passive aggression and awkward small talk, forced to mediate the expectations of overly-ambitious parents with the realities of hormonally-charged teenagers who considered algebra an affront to their personal freedoms.

The setting was Northwood High School, a sprawling brick building nestled in the sleepy suburb of Meadow Creek, Pennsylvania. Built in the 1970s, it boasted a formidable football team and a surprisingly vibrant drama club, but was perpetually plagued by budget cuts and a palpable sense of quiet resignation that hung heavy in the air, like the lingering scent of cafeteria chili. The faculty lounge, in particular, was a monument to mediocrity: faded floral wallpaper, mismatched furniture donated over the years, and a perpetual shortage of decent coffee. It was a place where dreams went to die, or at least took a very long nap. And tonight, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth was about to face the music.
