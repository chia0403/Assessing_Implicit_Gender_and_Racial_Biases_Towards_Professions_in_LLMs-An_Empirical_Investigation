The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying with it the scent of salt and decay, a smell Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Davies knew all too well. She tugged her thick wool scarf tighter around her neck, its rough fibers scratchy against her skin, and squinted at the churning gray water. The ferry to the island of Aethel, her home for the last five years, was late. Again.

Aethel wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis. Nestled off the coast of Northumberland, England, it was a small, windswept island clinging stubbornly to tradition. The population hovered around a few hundred, mostly crofters, fishermen, and their families. There was one pub, one tiny grocery store that also served as the post office, and Ellie’s veterinary practice, "Aethel Animal Care," a converted shed attached to her even smaller cottage.

She leaned against the corrugated metal wall of the ferry terminal, the damp cold seeping into her bones. Her wellington boots were coated in a layer of dried mud, a testament to her last patient – a stubbornly arthritic Shetland pony named Agnes. Aethel might be picturesque, but life here was often messy, muddy, and demanding. And right now, all Ellie wanted was a hot cup of tea and a roaring fire.
