The neon pink of the "Pump It Up!" sign cast a sickly glow across the wet asphalt outside the studio. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already frenetic scene inside. Disco balls, resurrected from a bygone era, spun relentlessly, throwing jagged shards of light across the straining faces of thirty-odd people bouncing in synchronized agony.  Each jump was a desperate attempt to keep up with the relentless rhythm of a remixed 80s power ballad, and the voice booming from the speakers was both encouraging and utterly unforgiving.

That voice belonged to Annelise Marguerite Dubois, a woman who could coax the most reluctant couch potato into a respectable side lunge.  Annelise, standing on a slightly raised platform at the front of the room, possessed the kind of energy that could power a small city. Her vibrant orange leggings and sweat-drenched tank top were a testament to her own dedication, her sleek ponytail bouncing in time with her every move.  She smiled, a dazzling, teeth-baring grin that promised both endorphins and unrelenting muscle burn.

"Alright, people! Let's FEEL the burn!" she shouted, her voice easily cutting through the music. "Remember, we're not here to be delicate little snowflakes! We're here to CONQUER!"

Annelise, despite her outwardly bubbly persona, secretly loathed rainy Tuesdays. They always brought out the worst in people – the whiners, the complainers, the ones who just couldn’t seem to find the motivation to push past their own pathetic limitations. But Annelise Dubois was a professional. Rain or shine, she was here to whip these people into shape, one excruciating rep at a time. And tonight, she was more determined than ever.
