## The Hum in the Void

**Setting:** A dilapidated, two-story clapboard house perched on the edge of a windswept cliff overlooking the unforgiving Atlantic. The paint, once a cheerful seaside blue, was now peeling in brittle curls, revealing the grey wood beneath, weathered and scarred by countless storms. Salt spray perpetually coated the windows, blurring the already gloomy interior. Inside, the house was a labyrinth of cluttered rooms filled with the ghost of a life once vibrant. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight that dared to penetrate the gloom, illuminating stacks of moth-eaten books, forgotten photographs, and the overwhelming presence of electronics. Wires snaked across the floor like metallic serpents, connecting vacuum tubes, oscillators, and a chaotic array of dials, knobs, and meters. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone, soldering flux, and the faint, pervasive scent of something long dead.

**Opening:**

The hum had started subtly, a low thrumming beneath the static that was as much a part of Arthur Reginald Finch as the scar that bisected his left eyebrow. For weeks, he’d dismissed it as atmospheric interference, just another anomaly in the endless symphony of the void he spent his nights listening to. After all, running a shortwave radio repair shop in a forgotten corner of Maine meant contending with all sorts of strange signals, from ghost stations broadcasting gibberish to the mournful wails of distant foghorns. But tonight, the hum had intensified, vibrating through the floorboards and resonating in Arthur’s very bones. He adjusted the dial on his meticulously crafted Collins R-390 receiver, a relic of the Cold War, its green glow reflecting in his tired, brown eyes. The usual cacophony of crackles and whistles persisted, but beneath it, like a discordant note in a beautiful melody, the hum pulsed, a low, guttural groan that seemed to emanate not from the airwaves, but from something far deeper. He reached for his soldering iron, the familiar weight comforting in the growing unease. Something was wrong. Very wrong. And Arthur Reginald Finch, by virtue of his isolation and his intimate knowledge of the unseen currents that flowed through the air, was the only one who could hear it.
