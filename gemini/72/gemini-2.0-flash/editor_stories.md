Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is an editor:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the dimly lit, perpetually cluttered office of *Paradigm Press*, a mid-sized publishing house nestled in a historic brownstone on Charles Street in Boston's Beacon Hill. The building itself seemed to sigh with the weight of unread manuscripts and half-finished novels. Outside, the early November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aged, single-pane windows and threatening to send stacks of paper tumbling from the precarious heights they'd reached on various shelves. Inside, the air smelled faintly of old paper, stale coffee, and the quiet desperation of deadlines.

**Story Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent light above her desk buzzed like an angry wasp, a sound that had become a constant, irritating companion to **Eleanor Vance**, Senior Fiction Editor at Paradigm Press.  She rubbed her temples, the bridge of her nose aching with the familiar pressure of staring too long at too many words. It was nearly 9 PM, and the only other signs of life in the office came from the muffled sound of Mr. Abernathy, the night watchman, humming off-key down the hall.

Eleanor stared at the manuscript before her, "The Serpent's Kiss," a historical romance novel so laden with purple prose it felt like wading through treacle.  She'd spent the last eight hours wrestling with its plot holes and attempting to prune its overflowing metaphors.  She'd circled yet another instance of the heroine's "bosom heaving like a stormy sea" with a red pen, a sigh escaping her lips.  Normally, she could find some redeeming quality in even the most flawed submission, a spark of genuine talent, a kernel of a good idea struggling to break free. But "The Serpent's Kiss"?  It was simply...awful.

Just as she was about to resign herself to another late night of damage control, her phone buzzed.  An email. From an unknown sender. The subject line:  "Regarding Your Dead Author."
