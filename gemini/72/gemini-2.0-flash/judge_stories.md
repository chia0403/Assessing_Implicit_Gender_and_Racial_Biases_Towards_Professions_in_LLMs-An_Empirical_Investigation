Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a judge named Eleanor Vance:

**Opening:**

The smell of decaying crab shells hung thick in the air, clinging to Eleanor Vance’s wool coat despite the brisk autumn wind whipping off the Chesapeake Bay. It was a smell she’d grown accustomed to, almost fond of, having lived her entire life in the weathered town of Port Willow. But tonight, the acrid tang felt like a premonition, a subtle warning that clung to the shadows lengthening across the water. She pulled the collar of her coat higher, squinting against the dying light, the silhouette of her Victorian house – the one her grandfather had built and her father had inherited – a familiar comfort against the unsettling feeling brewing in her gut.

Eleanor had spent the day wrestling with a difficult custody case, a particularly ugly battle that had left her feeling drained and disillusioned. She longed for the quiet solace of her study, a glass of sherry, and the rhythmic ticking of her grandfather's grandfather clock, the only sound louder than the whisper of the tide. But the flickering gaslight in the front window of the crab shack across the street, the one run by old Silas Granger, held her captive. There was something wrong, a discordant note in the usually cheerful bustle of the place. The voices coming from inside were low, hushed, laced with an undercurrent of something... sinister.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Port Willow, Maryland, a small, historically rich town nestled on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. Port Willow prides itself on its maritime history, its quaint, Victorian architecture, and its close-knit community. The town's economy hinges on crabbing, fishing, and a slow but steady influx of tourists drawn to its picturesque charm. The bay dominates the landscape and the culture, its moods influencing everything from the price of crab cakes to the general temperament of the townspeople. Eleanor's house sits on a bluff overlooking the bay, providing stunning views but also exposing it to the harsh winds and unpredictable weather. Across the street from her stands Silas Granger’s crab shack, a local institution known for its fresh seafood and lively atmosphere – an atmosphere that seems ominously absent tonight. The time is late October, the cusp of autumn, with the leaves turning vibrant shades of red and gold before the inevitable chill of winter settles in.
