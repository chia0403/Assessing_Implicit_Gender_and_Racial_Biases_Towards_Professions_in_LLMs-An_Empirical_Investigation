Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is an occupational therapist:

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's sneakers echoed down the linoleum hallway of the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, a sound as familiar and comforting to her as the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee that permeated the air.  It was 6:45 AM, and she was, as usual, the first one in. The early morning quiet was a balm against the cacophony that would soon follow: the beeping of monitors, the clatter of meal trays, the murmur of conversations, and, most importantly, the determined grunts and groans of her patients striving to reclaim pieces of themselves. Today, however, a different sound cut through the silence: a low, rhythmic thumping coming from room 203. Amelia frowned, pushing her wire-rimmed glasses further up her nose. That was Mr. Henderson's room, and he wasn't scheduled for therapy until nine. Usually, he was the most docile of her patients, barely managing more than a grumbled "good morning."

**Setting:**

The Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center is a sprawling, two-story brick building nestled in the heart of the small, somewhat forgotten town of Havenwood, Ohio.  Built in the late 1970s, it has a distinct institutional feel â€“ beige walls, dark brown trim, and functional, if not particularly inspiring, decor. The main lobby is dominated by a large, outdated water feature that rarely works properly and a collection of mismatched, worn armchairs.  Each patient room is equipped with a hospital bed, a small wardrobe, and a shared bathroom.

The therapy wing, where Amelia spends most of her time, is a bit brighter, with large windows overlooking a small, neglected courtyard. It contains a variety of equipment: parallel bars, weighted balls, resistance bands, and adaptive tools designed to help patients regain lost skills and independence. The walls are adorned with motivational posters featuring stock images of smiling, active people, a stark contrast to the often-frustrating reality of recovery. Outside the windows, a few hardy oak trees stand guard, their leaves rustling a melancholic tune in the breeze.
