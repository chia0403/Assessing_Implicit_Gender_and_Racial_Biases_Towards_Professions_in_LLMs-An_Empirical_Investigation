The smell of burnt sugar and stale regret hung heavy in the air of the donut shop, clinging to the vinyl booths like a stubborn stain. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Ramirez shivered despite the thin, scratchy fabric of her LAPD uniform. It was 5:00 AM, the city still cloaked in a hazy pre-dawn gloom, and the only other occupant of "Happy Hole Donuts" was a man nursing a lukewarm coffee, his face hidden behind a copy of the LA Times that looked older than Izzy herself.

Happy Hole Donuts, nestled in a forgotten corner of Van Nuys, wasn’t exactly Izzy’s preferred breakfast spot, but it was strategically located between her cramped, shoebox apartment and the North Hollywood precinct. More importantly, it was anonymous. Izzy needed anonymous this morning. Yesterday’s case – a brutal home invasion gone sideways – had left her feeling like she’d swallowed a handful of sand, gritty and uncomfortable. She needed the bland sweetness of a glazed donut and the numb anonymity of the pre-dawn hours to scrape some of that grit away before facing another day.
