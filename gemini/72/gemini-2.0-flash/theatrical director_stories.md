## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust, stale coffee, and desperate hope hung thick in the air of the Blackwood Repertory's rehearsal space. For Theodore Bartholomew Finch, it was home. He ran a hand, calloused and paint-stained, over the tattered velvet of an antique armchair rescued from a dumpster behind the theater. He'd intended to reupholster it, but the theater, as always, had demanded more pressing concerns.

He swiveled, the armchair creaking a mournful protest, and fixed his gaze on the makeshift stage. Three actors, each radiating varying degrees of anxiety and exhaustion, stood bathed in the harsh glare of the work lights. Their lines, from Shakespeare's *King Lear*, were being delivered with all the passion of a dentist reading a newspaper.

Theodore suppressed a sigh that would have rivaled the groan of his armchair. Tonight was the dress rehearsal. Tomorrow, the curtain rose on the Blackwood's season opener. And right now, he felt less like a director and more like a babysitter trying to avert a theatrical meltdown.

He opened his mouth to speak, to offer yet another note on Cordelia's feigned despair or Kent's simmering loyalty, but then a floorboard let out a loud, defiant squeak. Theodore pinched the bridge of his nose. This was going to be a long night.

## Setting:

**The Blackwood Repertory Theater, Havenwood, Maine:**

The Blackwood was a relic, a grand old dame fallen on hard times. Built in the 1920s during a brief and inexplicable cultural boom in Havenwood, a small, isolated town on the coast of Maine, the theater had once hosted touring companies from New York and London. Now, its ornate facade was peeling, the plush red seats were threadbare, and the gilded cherubs that adorned the ceiling were perpetually covered in dust. The theater was a testament to a bygone era, clinging desperately to relevance in a world of streaming services and multiplex cinemas.

Despite its dilapidated state, the Blackwood possessed a certain charm, a palpable sense of history and passion. The stage, though small and uneven, held the ghosts of countless performances. The dressing rooms, cramped and cluttered, whispered secrets of forgotten triumphs and devastating failures. The smell of the old wood and stale stage makeup was intoxicating to those who loved it.

The town of Havenwood itself was a character in the Blackwood's story. A place steeped in tradition and stubbornly resistant to change, Havenwood was a mix of weathered fishermen, seasonal tourists, and a handful of artists drawn to the town's quiet isolation and the promise of affordable living. The Blackwood was a lifeline for the community, a place where they could escape the monotony of their lives and lose themselves in the magic of theater, at least for a few hours. Theodore knew, however, that its survival was constantly hanging by a thread, a thread he was fiercely determined to keep from snapping.
