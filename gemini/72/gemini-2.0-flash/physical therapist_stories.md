## Opening:

The scent of antiseptic and stale sweat clung to the air in the rehab wing, a smell Amelia Grace Harding had grown accustomed to. But today, it was sharper, laced with a nervousness that mirrored the knot in her own stomach. She adjusted her name tag, the shiny plastic a small shield against the uncertainty ahead. A clipboard, thick with notes and assessment forms, trembled slightly in her hand. Today was her first official day as lead therapist, a position she'd worked relentlessly to earn. But the pressure was immense, and the face waiting behind door 307 - a face etched with pain and barely suppressed hope - felt like a monumental test. Amelia took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and whispered a silent mantra: *empathy, knowledge, patience.* Then, she knocked.

## Setting:

The story primarily takes place within the "Sunrise Rehabilitation Center," a sprawling, modern building situated on the outskirts of Willow Creek, Colorado. The center, a mix of glass and earth-toned brick, overlooks a picturesque valley, a vista supposedly conducive to healing. Inside, the rehab wing is a labyrinth of hallways lined with patient rooms, each meticulously numbered and furnished with a hospital bed, a small side table, and a chair. The communal spaces include a bright and airy gymnasium equipped with state-of-the-art exercise equipment, a hydrotherapy pool shimmering under fluorescent lights, and a quiet therapy room filled with soft mats and resistance bands. The atmosphere is a carefully curated blend of sterile professionalism and comforting warmth, designed to inspire hope and facilitate recovery, but often falling short against the harsh realities of injury and chronic pain.
