The fluorescent lights of "The Corner Drug" hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack Amelia Grace O'Connell had grown to both crave and loathe. It was 7:12 PM on a Tuesday, and the early evening rush had dwindled to a trickle. Outside, the late October wind rattled the aging windows of the store, promising another bone-chilling night in Havenwood, Maine. Havenwood, a town stubbornly clinging to its maritime roots despite the creep of tourism, was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, their prescriptions, and, more often than not, their business. Amelia, however, felt more like a watchful ghost than a member of the community. She hadn’t been born in Havenwood. She'd arrived three years ago, escaping a life in Boston that now felt like a faded photograph, and had taken over the pharmacy after old Mr. Henderson finally retired.

The air was thick with the familiar scents of isopropyl alcohol, cherry cough syrup, and something vaguely floral from Mrs. Higgins' perpetually over-perfumed visits. Behind the counter, Amelia, a woman who had once envisioned a future filled with test tubes and cutting-edge research, now carefully counted out thirty capsules of amoxicillin, her brow furrowed in concentration. It was a far cry from her dreams, but here, in this small-town pharmacy, surrounded by the comforting predictability of pills and potions, Amelia Grace O'Connell had found a semblance of peace. At least, she *thought* she had. Until tonight. Because tonight, a man she’d never seen before had entered the store, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and the deepening shadows of the evening, and asked for something that wasn't on any shelf. He asked for information.
