**Setting:** The relentlessly hot, asphalt-scented rooftop of a three-story brick apartment building in the Little Italy neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. It’s mid-July, thick with humidity that clings to everything like a second skin. The air crackles with the distant sounds of city life – the rumble of delivery trucks, the shouts of children playing in the street below, the tinny melodies drifting from open windows. Discarded pizza boxes and empty beer cans litter the corners of the roof, remnants of past tenant gatherings.

**Story Opening:**

Sweat stung **Salvatore “Sal” Giovanni’s** eyes as he squinted against the blinding glare reflecting off the new TPO membrane he was wrestling into place. He cursed under his breath, a string of rapid-fire Italian syllables lost to the wind. It wasn’t just the sun trying to melt his brains; it was Mrs. Esposito downstairs, perpetually late on the rent, who'd promised him a plate of her famous lasagna *this* morning, and the damn tarpaper, sticky as hell, that was fighting him every inch of the way. He’d been a roofer for twenty years, ever since his father, a bricklayer with hands like granite, had declared “Enough with the books, Salvatore! Time to learn an honest trade!” He still loved the books, secretly reading Dostoevsky in the evenings after a long day on the roof, but he couldn't deny the satisfaction of fixing a leak, of keeping the rain out, of leaving a building better than he found it. Still, some days, like today, the roof just seemed to have it in for him.
