## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A cramped, dimly lit Korean BBQ restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Steam billows from a sizzling grill in the center of a round table, obscuring the faces of the diners huddled around it. The air is thick with the scent of marinated beef, kimchi, and desperation.

**Opening:**

The clatter of metal chopsticks against ceramic bowls was a relentless, percussive accompaniment to the ticker tape scrolling relentlessly through Leo Maxwell’s brain. He barely registered the taste of the galbi, or the worried glances his mother, Esther Maxwell, kept throwing his way across the table. He hadn’t slept properly in a week. The market was a monster, unpredictable and voracious, and Leo, a seasoned stock broker at Sterling & Klein, was desperately trying to keep his clients from becoming its next meal.

He stabbed viciously at a piece of scallion pancake, the plastic-handled chopsticks digging into the cheap melamine. He knew he should be listening to his Aunt Susan, who was currently recounting a particularly gruesome bunion surgery with graphic detail. He should be thanking his mother for the carefully chosen side dishes, each intended to nourish him and soothe his frazzled nerves. He should be *present*.

But all he could see was the plummeting price of GlobalTech, all he could hear was the angry screech of his boss, demanding answers, all he could feel was the cold sweat clinging to his temples.

"Leo, honey, are you even listening?" Esther’s voice, sharp with concern, cut through the cacophony. "Aunt Susan was just saying…"

Leo swallowed hard, forcing a smile that felt as brittle and artificial as the plastic chopsticks he held. "Sorry, Ma. Long day. Just… long." He knew 'long' was an understatement. He was teetering on the edge of financial ruin, and the future he’d meticulously planned, the one where he finally paid off his mother’s mortgage and bought her a condo overlooking the Hudson, was flickering like a faulty neon sign in the oppressive Flushing night.
