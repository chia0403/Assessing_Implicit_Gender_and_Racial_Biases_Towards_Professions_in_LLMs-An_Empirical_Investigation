## Story Opening and Setting:

The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air inside the Middlesex County Probation Office, a smell Beatrice Eleanor Sterling knew as intimately as her own fingerprint. It was a smell that burrowed into your clothes, your hair, even, she sometimes thought, your soul.

Beatrice sighed, adjusting the thermostat – again – in her cramped office. It was perpetually set to arctic levels, courtesy of Barry in accounting, who apparently battled his own internal furnace. Beatrice, however, shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, mimicking the low-level anxiety that thrummed through her whenever she had a full schedule, which, as of today, she certainly did. 

Outside, a November drizzle blurred the grimy windowpane, painting a bleak picture of the courthouse square in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree standing sentinel opposite her office building were slick with rain, mirroring the slick, unpredictable lives she was tasked with navigating.

Beatrice checked the clock. Ten minutes until her first appointment: a repeat offender, fresh out of jail on a breaking and entering charge. Just the kind of invigorating start to a Monday she'd been dreading all weekend.
