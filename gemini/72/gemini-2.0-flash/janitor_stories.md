The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony, a familiar soundtrack to Arthur Reginald Finch's late-night labors. The vast, silent halls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art were his kingdom after hours, his broom his scepter, the Pledge his purifying agent. He surveyed the gallery, a cavernous space dedicated to ancient Egyptian artifacts, the golden sarcophagi gleaming dully in the artificial light. Tonight, though, something was different. A faint, earthy smell, like damp papyrus and turned soil, hung in the air, heavier than usual. Arthur wrinkled his nose, his normally placid face creased with a hint of concern. He'd mopped these floors and emptied these bins for the past fifteen years, and he knew the museum's odors like he knew the lines on his own hands. This wasn't the usual stale-air-and-old-canvas scent. This felt...alive.
