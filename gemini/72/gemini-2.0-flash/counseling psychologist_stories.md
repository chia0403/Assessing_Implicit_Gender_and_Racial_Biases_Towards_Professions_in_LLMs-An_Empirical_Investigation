## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and jasmine tea hung in the air, a familiar comfort in Dr. Eleanor Vivian Davies' office. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her sixth-floor practice, mirroring the tempest often brewing in the souls of the people who sought her help. She glanced at the clock, a vintage Seth Thomas she'd inherited from her grandmother. 9:58 AM. Two minutes until Martin arrived. Martin and his anxieties about leaving his cat, Mr. Whiskers, alone for the weekend. Eleanor sighed, not with irritation, but with the weight of a hundred different burdens she carried, a little bit, each day. She swiveled in her worn leather armchair, the one she'd had reupholstered three times, and smoothed the wrinkles from her corduroy skirt. Time to put on her listening ears.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Davies' counseling practice, "Haven Mind," was located in a pre-war building in the heart of Philadelphia's historic district. The building itself was a study in faded grandeur, with its ornate cornices and slightly chipped marble staircase. Haven Mind occupied a two-room suite on the sixth floor, overlooking a small, leafy park.

Eleanor's office was designed to be a sanctuary, a space of warmth and understanding. The walls were painted a calming shade of sage green, and soft lighting emanated from a Tiffany-style lamp on a side table. A large, comfortable leather armchair sat beside a small, mahogany coffee table, perpetually adorned with a selection of herbal teas and a box of gluten-free cookies (a surprising hit, even with the non-allergy crowd). A bookshelf overflowing with psychology texts, novels, and a few well-loved poetry collections lined one wall. On another, framed artwork, mostly landscape paintings and abstract watercolors, provided a touch of color and serenity. Even on the greyest of days, the room felt like a haven, a place to exhale and begin to heal. The outer office, smaller and more utilitarian, housed her receptionist, Sarah, and a waiting area with a scattering of comfortable chairs and a stack of well-worn magazines.
