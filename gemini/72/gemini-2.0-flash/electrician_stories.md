**Opening:**

The aroma of burnt coffee and the metallic tang of ozone hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a desperate phantom. Michael Anthony Petrocelli, electrician extraordinaire and general fixer-upper, squinted through the dim light of his headlamp, its beam dancing nervously across the skeletal innards of the old fuse box. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smudge of grime in its wake. He knew, deep in his gut, that this wasn't just another blown fuse. This was something… wrong.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the crumbling splendor of the Grand Majestic Hotel, perched precariously on the edge of a forgotten seaside town called Seabreeze. Once a haven for the wealthy and renowned, a beacon of Art Deco glamour, the Grand Majestic had fallen into disrepair decades ago, a victim of shifting fortunes and changing tastes. Now, its faded grandeur was masked by peeling wallpaper, water-stained ceilings, and the ever-present scent of damp sea air. The hotel's owner, a perpetually flustered woman named Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, had hired Michael to address a series of increasingly bizarre electrical malfunctions plaguing the aging building. Michael’s current location is the hotel's dilapidated basement, a labyrinthine space filled with cobwebs, forgotten machinery, and the unsettling echoes of a past that refuses to stay buried. It's a place where shadows cling to corners, and the silence is thick enough to cut with a butter knife. Outside, the relentless crash of waves against the shore provides a constant, mournful soundtrack to Michael’s unsettling task.
