The clatter of copper pipes against porcelain tile woke Leo Maxwell from a fitful sleep. 4:30 AM. He swore, a low grumble lost in the pre-dawn hush. Damn Mrs. Hemlock and her insistence on only having him, Leo Maxwell, the *only* plumber she trusted, fix her leaky faucet. And damn the fact that he actually needed the work.

Leo heaved himself out of bed, the thin mattress offering little in the way of comfort. He glanced around his small, cramped apartment, a single room above Mrs. Petrov's laundromat on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. The walls were painted a drab, institutional green that reminded him of his high school locker room. He’d tried to brighten the place up with a few posters – vintage jazz album covers mostly – but they just seemed to emphasize the room's overall dinginess. A stack of plumbing supply catalogs teetered precariously on a wobbly milk crate next to his threadbare armchair.

His toolbox, overflowing with wrenches, pipe cutters, and various fittings, sat propped against the door, a silent reminder of his daily grind. The aroma of Mrs. Petrov’s industrial-strength detergent, already assaulting the air with its cloying sweetness, made him wrinkle his nose. He desperately needed a cup of coffee and a strong dose of nicotine before facing Mrs. Hemlock's pristine bathroom and her eagle-eyed scrutiny of his every move. This was going to be a long day.
