## The Sweetest Rebellion

**Setting:** The crisp morning air hung thick with the smell of woodsmoke and rising dough. It was the heart of autumn in Havenwood, a village nestled deep within the Whispering Woods. The houses, cobbled together with moss-covered stones and thatched roofs, clung to the hillside like drowsy badgers. The annual Harvest Festival, a time of vibrant colors and communal feasting, was only a week away. But this year, the air felt different. Heavy. Charged with a subtle, unsettling unease. The Duke's new tax policies had cast a long shadow over the usually jovial preparations.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Clementine Butterfield slammed the iron door of her oven shut with a resounding clang that rattled the jars of wildflower honey on her shelves. Damn the Duke, damn his grasping fingers, and damn his insatiable hunger for gold! Her usually rosy cheeks were flushed crimson, not from the heat of the oven, but from the simmering fury in her gut. Her hands, calloused but nimble, trembled as she measured out the precious flour for her sourdough starter. Usually, the rhythm of baking, the satisfying knead and rise, soothed her soul. Today, it felt like a futile act of rebellion, a tiny flick of flour dust against a rising tide of injustice.
