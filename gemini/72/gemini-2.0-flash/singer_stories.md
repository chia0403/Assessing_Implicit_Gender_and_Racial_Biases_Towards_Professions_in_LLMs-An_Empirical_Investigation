## Story Opening:

The air in the Green Room backstage at the Royal Albert Hall tasted of stale ambition and overripe flowers. Amelia Beatrice Thorne, known to the world as simply "Amelia T," took a long, steadying breath, trying to ignore the insistent thrumming of her pulse in her ears. She could hear the hushed murmur of the audience beyond the heavy velvet curtain, a restless ocean of expectancy waiting to be unleashed. She smoothed down the shimmering, emerald gown clinging to her figure, the cool silk a flimsy shield against the tidal wave of pressure crashing down on her. Tonight was different. Tonight wasn't just another sold-out concert. Tonight, it was legacy time. Tonight, she either solidified her place among the greats, or drowned in the wake of her own hype.

## Setting:

The story is set primarily in London, in the present day. Key locations include:

* **The Royal Albert Hall:** A grand, historical concert venue in South Kensington, playing a crucial role as the setting for Amelia's pivotal performance.
