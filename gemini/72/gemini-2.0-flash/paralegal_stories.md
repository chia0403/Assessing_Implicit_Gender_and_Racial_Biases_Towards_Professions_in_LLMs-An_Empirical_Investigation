The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Sarah Michelle Ramirez's Tuesday morning misery. They cast a sterile, almost surgical glow on the overflowing in-tray on her desk, a landscape of deposition transcripts, court filings, and enough legal jargon to choke a small horse. Sarah sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear. It was 7:15 AM and she was already late - or, at least, not early enough. At Prescott, Sterling & Finch, "on time" was five minutes before your actual start time, a tradition rooted somewhere between tradition and outright sadism.

The office itself was a testament to power and wealth, a temple of mahogany and muted greys overlooking the bustling cityscape of Chicago. Located on the 37th floor of the Sterling Tower, the firm's panoramic windows offered a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan, but Sarah rarely had time to appreciate it. Her usual vista consisted of the stack of documents threatening to bury her alive. The scent of old money mingled with the faint aroma of overpriced coffee brewing in the partners' lounge, a constant reminder of the chasm between her role as a paralegal and the opulent lives of the lawyers she served. Today, however, the air held an undercurrent of something else, something prickly and charged, like static electricity before a storm. Something told Sarah Michelle Ramirez that this Tuesday wasn't going to be just another Tuesday.
