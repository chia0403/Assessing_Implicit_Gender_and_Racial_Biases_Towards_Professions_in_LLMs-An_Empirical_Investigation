## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to Amelia Rose Harding like a second skin, a familiar comfort amidst the chaos of the emergency room. She’d scrubbed in three times already this shift, each time trying to wash away the feeling of grit and exhaustion clinging to her bones. A low, guttural moan echoed from triage, pulling her back to the present. Amelia pinched the bridge of her nose, willing herself to focus.

"Another overdose," she sighed under her breath, more to herself than anyone else. Saturday nights were always the same; a tapestry woven with desperation, recklessness, and the inevitable consequences. She glanced at the clock – 2:17 AM. Only a little more than three hours until sunrise, and maybe, just maybe, a moment's peace.

## Setting:

The story opens within the Emergency Room of **St. Jude's Hospital**, a sprawling medical complex nestled in the heart of **downtown Detroit, Michigan**. The ER is a hive of constant motion, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, casting a harsh, almost clinical glow on the scene.

The sounds are a cacophony: the rhythmic beeping of monitors, the shouted orders of doctors, the muffled sobs of patients and their families, and the persistent crackle of the overhead paging system.

The walls are painted a sterile, off-white color, attempting to project an air of calm amidst the inherent pandemonium. Strewn throughout the various patient bays are discarded gloves, crumpled sheets, and scattered medical instruments - remnants of the endless battle against injury and illness waged within these walls.

Outside, the city lights bleed through the grime-covered windows, a constant reminder of the world beyond, oblivious to the dramas unfolding within the ER's chaotic confines.
