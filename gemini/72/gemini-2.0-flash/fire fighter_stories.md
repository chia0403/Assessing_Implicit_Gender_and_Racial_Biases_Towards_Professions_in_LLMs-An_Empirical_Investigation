Okay, here's a story opening, introducing a firefighter named Evelyn Grace Carter, along with its setting:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of acrid smoke clung to Evelyn Grace Carter like a second skin, a constant reminder of the chaos she'd just pulled herself from. She tugged off her helmet, the sweat plastering her dark hair to her forehead. Outside, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the Medivac helicopter grew louder, a mournful counterpoint to the exhausted sighs of her fellow firefighters. Inside, the charred remains of what had been Mrs. Petrov's bakery hissed and popped, a final, angry exhale of the blaze they'd finally conquered.

Evelyn leaned against the cool metal of the fire engine, her lungs still burning with the phantom sting of smoke. She could still see the flickering orange light dancing behind her eyelids, could still feel the intense, suffocating heat that had pushed her to her limits. And she could still hear the frantic cries of Mrs. Petrov, a tiny woman with flour-dusted hands and eyes that held the weight of generations of bakers.

Evelyn knew, with a grim certainty that settled heavy in her stomach, that the smell of burnt sugar would never quite leave her.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the bustling, somewhat gritty, port city of **Portside, Maine**. Portside is a place where the salty tang of the Atlantic mixes with the exhaust fumes of fishing trawlers and the sweet scent of maple syrup from nearby farms. The city is a patchwork of old brick buildings, weathered clapboard houses, and modern glass towers, reflecting its history as a shipbuilding center that's now embracing a tech boom.

The specific fire station, **Station 7 - "The Anchors,"** is located in the heart of the old warehouse district, just a few blocks from the waterfront. The area is a mix of renovated lofts, dive bars, and the lingering remnants of the fishing industry. The station itself is an aging brick building, its fa√ßade stained with years of soot and seawater, but inside, it's a well-maintained hub of activity, a second home for the men and women who risk their lives to protect the city.
