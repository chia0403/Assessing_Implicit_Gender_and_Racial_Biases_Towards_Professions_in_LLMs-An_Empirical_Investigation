## Opening:

Sweat prickled beneath Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's collar. The Carolina sun, a relentless bully even in early October, beat down on her head, reflecting off the pristine white siding of the McMansion that was, according to the listing, "a breathtaking example of Southern Elegance." Bea dabbed at her forehead with a tissue, the faint scent of lavender momentarily masking the earthy, almost fungal, aroma that had permeated the air since she'd pulled into the driveway. This was lot number 13, the last and, Bea suspected, least desirable property in the hastily-constructed Magnolia Creek development.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. It was Mrs. Gable, her most promising lead this week, confirming their appointment. Bea pasted on her practiced, winning smile. Today, Magnolia Creek would shed its shoddiness and become a dream come true. Or, at least, that's what Beatrice Montgomery intended.

## Setting:

Magnolia Creek was a sprawling, identikit development located just outside the historic city of Charleston, South Carolina. Picture-perfect houses, all with sprawling porches, meticulously manicured lawns, and names like "The Magnolia Bloom" and "The Palmetto Paradise," lined identical, winding streets. The illusion of Southern charm was carefully curated; think less "Gone With The Wind" and more "Gone With The Money."

The houses were built on what had once been a thriving rice plantation, a history conspicuously absent from the glossy marketing brochures. The soil, still rich with remnants of the old rice paddies, was perpetually damp, contributing to the aforementioned fungal aroma and, Bea suspected, a host of other unseen problems.

The model home, where Bea waited, boasted vaulted ceilings, granite countertops, and a state-of-the-art kitchen. But the air felt stale, almost suffocating, and the silence was punctuated only by the buzzing of cicadas and the distant hum of construction machinery, a constant reminder that Magnolia Creek was still a work in progress, desperately clinging to the promise of prosperity.
