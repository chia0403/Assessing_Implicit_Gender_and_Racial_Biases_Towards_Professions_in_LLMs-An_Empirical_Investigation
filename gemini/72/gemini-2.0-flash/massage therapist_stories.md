**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic thump of rain against the skylight was a familiar comfort, almost as soothing as the focused breath that guided Amelia Rose Hawthorne's practiced hands. Outside, Seattle was a grey watercolor, the Space Needle swallowed by a low-hanging cloud. Inside "The Wellspring," Amelia's haven of tranquility, the air was thick with the calming scents of lavender and sandalwood.

A low groan escaped the lips of her current client, a man whose shoulders were permanently sculpted into a defensive hunch. Amelia paused, her thumbs digging deeper into the knotted muscles just below his shoulder blades. "Holding a lot of tension there, Mr. Henderson," she murmured, her voice a low, melodic hum designed to encourage relaxation, not conversation.

He grunted again, a sound that could have meant agreement, acknowledgement, or just plain agony. Amelia didn't push. She'd learned long ago that the body often spoke volumes where words failed. And right now, Mr. Henderson's body was screaming. She just needed to listen.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in "The Wellspring," Amelia Rose Hawthorne's private massage therapy practice located in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

**Specific details about the Wellspring:**

*   **Location:** A converted loft space above a quirky bookstore, accessible via a narrow, winding staircase.
*   **Decor:** Minimalist and calming. Warm, earthy tones dominate, with natural wood accents and plenty of soft, indirect lighting.
*   **Atmosphere:** Emphasis on creating a peaceful and restorative environment. Diffusers release essential oil blends tailored to the client's needs. Soft, ambient music (often instrumental or nature sounds) plays quietly in the background.
*   **Treatment Room:** One main treatment room, meticulously clean and organized. Contains a high-quality massage table draped in soft linens, a comfortable armchair for client consultations, and a small, discreet changing area.
*   **Waiting Area:** A small but inviting waiting area with comfortable seating, calming artwork, and a selection of herbal teas and water.
