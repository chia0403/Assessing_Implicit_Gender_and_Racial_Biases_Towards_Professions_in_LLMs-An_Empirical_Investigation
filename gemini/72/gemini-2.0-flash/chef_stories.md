The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy with the smell of salt and rotting fish, a familiar perfume that clung to Chef Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau like the sea air clings to the weathered clapboard buildings of Port Isaac. She stood on the quayside, hands shoved deep in the pockets of her grease-stained chef's whites, the rhythmic creak of the moored fishing boats her only company. Above, the sky was a bruised purple, promising another relentless summer day in the Cornish village. Izzy watched the first sliver of sun peek over the horizon, painting the choppy waves a fleeting, fiery gold. In less than an hour, the fishermen would be back with their haul, their nets overflowing with the day’s catch. And then, the real work would begin.

Her restaurant, "The Salt Kettle," perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the harbor, was Izzy's domain. A ramshackle collection of whitewashed stone and reclaimed timber, it boasted panoramic views and a reputation for serving the freshest, most innovative seafood in Cornwall. Inside, the scent of herbs and woodsmoke already lingered in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the raw tang of the sea outside. Copper pots gleamed under the dim light of a single lamp, and the worn wooden tables stood ready, awaiting the eager crowds that would soon flock to taste Izzy’s culinary magic. The Salt Kettle was more than just a restaurant; it was Izzy’s sanctuary, her passion, and the only tangible link to a past she both cherished and desperately tried to escape.
