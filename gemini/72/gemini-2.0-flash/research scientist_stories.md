Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a research scientist:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of the sub-level research lab cast long, dancing shadows across Dr. Evelyn Iris Hawthorne's face.  A thin sheen of perspiration clung to her brow, reflecting the harsh, sterile glow.  For the past seventy-two hours, Evelyn had been glued to this small, windowless space, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the desperate hope that she was finally, *finally*, on the verge of a breakthrough. The rhythmic hum of the cryogenic storage unit, usually a comforting white noise, now felt like a taunting tick, counting down the seconds to either vindication or utter failure.  Her fingers, numb despite the thin gloves, fumbled with the pipette, carefully extracting a sample from the vial labeled with a messy, almost illegible scrawl: "X-73 - Potential."

A warning klaxon suddenly wailed throughout the facility. Evelyn almost jumped out of her skin. She frantically turned toward the alarm panel. A harsh red light pulsed urgently: "Contamination Alert: Biohazard Containment Unit 4."

Evelyn froze. Biohazard Containment Unit 4â€¦that's where they kept the primates exposed to X-73.

**Setting:**

The story is set primarily within the **Clifton Research Institute**, a sprawling complex located on the outskirts of Denver, Colorado. The Institute is known for its cutting-edge work in virology, immunology, and genetic engineering. It's a place of quiet intensity, where brilliant minds work tirelessly in state-of-the-art labs, often under intense pressure to deliver results.

*   **Sub-level Research Lab 12 (where Evelyn is):** A small, windowless, highly secure lab deep within the institute. It's sterile and utilitarian, filled with expensive equipment and dominated by a large cryogenic storage unit. There are multiple computer workstations, microscopes, and specialized incubation chambers.
*   **Biohazard Containment Unit 4:** A highly restricted area designed to contain potentially dangerous biological agents. It's a series of interconnected, airtight chambers where live animal testing is conducted. Access requires multiple levels of authorization and strict adherence to safety protocols.
*   **The Institute's Exterior:** A modern, imposing structure of glass and steel, surrounded by manicured lawns and high security fencing. It projects an image of scientific authority and advanced technology.
*   **Denver, Colorado (briefly):** The bustling city serves as a contrast to the sterile isolation of the Institute, hinting at the potential real-world consequences of the research being conducted within.

The overall atmosphere is one of intense focus, scientific ambition, and underlying tension. The pursuit of knowledge comes at a cost, and the institute is a place where ethical boundaries are often blurred in the name of progress.
