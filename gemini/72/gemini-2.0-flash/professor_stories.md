## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped across the desolate moor, clawing at Professor Alistair Humphrey Davies' tweed jacket and stealing the warmth from his already numb fingers. He hunched deeper into himself, pulling his battered leather satchel closer, as if it offered some measure of protection against the elements. The skeletal branches of the ancient thorn trees that dotted the landscape clawed at the sky like gnarled fingers, stark against the bruised purple of the twilight. 

He’d been a fool to push on so late. The map, a tattered relic nearly a century old, had promised a shortcut, a quicker route back to the village of Harrowsgate and the promise of a roaring fire at the Black Raven Inn. Instead, it had led him to this… this desolate expanse, a landscape that seemed to breathe with a history he couldn’t quite grasp, a history that felt older than time itself. He shivered, not entirely from the cold. There was something unsettling about this place, a weight in the air that pressed down on him, a silent whisper that tickled at the edges of his academic mind.

He consulted the map again, his brow furrowed in concentration. According to the aged parchment, the standing stones, the ones he was so determined to find, lay just beyond that ridge. Standing stones that could potentially rewrite everything he thought he knew about the Bronze Age. And perhaps, he thought with a flicker of unease, everything he *should* know.

## Setting:

The story is set in the **Yorkshire Moors, England**, in late autumn. Specifically, the opening takes place on a particularly isolated and windswept section of the moor, characterized by:

*   **Desolate landscape:** Largely barren, with expanses of heathland, rough grasses, and scattered bogs.
*   **Ancient thorn trees:** Gnarled and weathered, adding a sense of age and bleakness.
*   **Remnants of history:** Hints of past settlements and activities, like old stone walls and overgrown pathways.
*   **Approaching twilight:** The sun is setting, casting long shadows and deepening the feeling of isolation and unease. The sky is a bruised purple and the wind is bitterly cold.
*   **Remote and isolated:** The nearest village, Harrowsgate, is a good distance away, adding to the feeling of vulnerability. The characters are isolated and at the mercy of the elements and the potential dangers of the moors.
*   **Presence of the "standing stones":** Ancient, imposing structures that dominate the landscape and serve as a focal point for the story. They are steeped in mystery and hint at forgotten rituals and beliefs.
