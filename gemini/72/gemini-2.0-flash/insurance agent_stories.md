## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous dirge, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' perpetually weary existence. He stared at the computer screen, the flickering cursor blinking mockingly at the blank claim form. Another water damage incident. Another leaky pipe. Another shattered dream of an early retirement.

Bart sighed, running a hand through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair. He’d seen it all in his twenty-plus years at Consolidated Mutual. Floods, fires, the occasional rogue squirrel wreaking havoc in an attic. You name it, Bart Higgins had insured it, and subsequently, dealt with the aftermath. 

He swivelled in his creaky chair, his gaze landing on the faded motivational poster hanging crookedly on the wall. “Think Outside the Box!” it declared in bold, bubbly letters. Bart snorted. The only thing he was thinking outside of was the box of lukewarm coffee he’d finished an hour ago.

Suddenly, the phone on his desk buzzed, a jarring shriek that cut through the office's sterile silence. Bart answered it, his voice already laced with a practiced, empathetic tone. "Bartholomew Higgins, Consolidated Mutual, how may I help you?"

The voice on the other end was breathless, panicked. "Mr. Higgins? This is Mrs. Abernathy...Mrs. Mildred Abernathy. I think...I think my house is haunted!"

Bart's hand tightened on the receiver. Haunted houses weren't exactly covered under his standard homeowner's policy. This was definitely not your average water damage.

## Setting:

The Consolidated Mutual Insurance Agency occupied a small, unassuming office on the second floor of a brick building in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint, somewhat sleepy town nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. Havenwood was known for its apple orchards, its annual Harvest Festival, and its uncanny ability to remain untouched by the rapid modernization sweeping the rest of the country.

The office itself was a testament to functional mediocrity. Grey carpet covered the floor, stained in places by years of spilled coffee and the occasional dropped donut. The walls were a pale, institutional green, broken up only by the aforementioned motivational posters and a corkboard overflowing with flyers for local events - bake sales, town hall meetings, and announcements for the Havenwood Historical Society.

Each agent had their own cubicle, a small, confined space furnished with a standard-issue desk, a swivel chair that groaned with every movement, and a computer that seemed to be perpetually struggling to keep up with the demands of modern insurance processing. The air perpetually smelled faintly of stale coffee, printer toner, and the faint, lingering scent of Bart's lemon-scented hand sanitizer - a habit he'd developed after a particularly nasty outbreak of the flu two years prior.

The overall atmosphere was one of quiet monotony, punctuated only by the ringing of phones, the clicking of keyboards, and the occasional sigh of a weary insurance agent contemplating the sheer volume of paperwork that lay between them and the sweet release of 5 PM.
