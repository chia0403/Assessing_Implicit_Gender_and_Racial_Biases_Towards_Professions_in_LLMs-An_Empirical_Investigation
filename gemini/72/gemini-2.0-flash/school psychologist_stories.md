The fluorescent lights of Meadow Creek Elementary hummed a relentless, almost sentient buzz, a sound that both soothed and irritated Dr. Eleanor Grace Ainsworth in equal measure. It was Friday, 4:53 PM, and the last stragglers had finally been collected from after-school programs. The faint scent of floor wax and disappointed peanut butter sandwiches hung heavy in the air.

Eleanor leaned back in her ergonomic chair, the worn fabric groaning under her weight. Her small, cluttered office was a sanctuary of sorts. A mismatched collection of mismatched furniture – a hand-me-down desk from the principal, a donated reading chair from the library, and a suspiciously cheerful, sunshine-yellow rug gifted by the PTA – somehow coalesced into a space that felt uniquely hers. Stacks of paperwork, precariously balanced, threatened to topple at any moment, but she knew where everything was, or at least, she *thought* she did.

Outside, the autumnal afternoon was painting the already vibrant Virginia landscape in hues of burnt orange and fiery red. But inside, trapped within the brick-and-mortar confines of Meadow Creek, Eleanor felt the familiar weight of the week settling on her shoulders. Five days of navigating the turbulent waters of childhood anxieties, behavioral issues, and the occasional, heartbreaking family crisis had left her feeling drained. She just needed a quiet evening with a good book and a large glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. That was all.

Then, a soft knock echoed from the open doorway, shattering the fragile peace she had so desperately tried to conjure.
