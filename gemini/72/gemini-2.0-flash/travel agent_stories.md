Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a travel agent named Beatrice Eleanor Humphrey:

**Opening:**

The insistent chirping of the phone ripped Beatrice Eleanor Humphrey from a fitful dream where she was simultaneously herding feral cats through the Roman Forum and arguing with a miniature Napoleon about the merits of all-inclusive resorts. Groaning, she slapped a hand at the bedside table, finally silencing the offending device. 3:17 AM. Far too early for a sane human being, even one whose livelihood depended on booking insane people on cruises to Antarctica.

"Humphrey's Holidays, this is Beatrice. Can't talk long, the penguins are staging a coup…" she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

A voice, high-pitched and frantic, crackled through the speaker. "Beatrice! Thank heavens! You have to help me! I'm trapped!"

Beatrice’s eyes snapped open. That was Mrs. Higgins, her most demanding, yet most lucrative, client. "Mrs. Higgins? What's wrong? Where are you trapped?"

"In a time warp, Beatrice! A time warp on the 7:30 to Swindon! You have to get me out!"

Beatrice rubbed her temples. Mrs. Higgins had a penchant for the dramatic, but the woman also had a bottomless trust fund and a desire to see every "historical" tearoom in Wiltshire. This was either going to be a very long night, or a very profitable one.

**Setting:**

Beatrice's office, "Humphrey's Holidays," was located in a slightly dilapidated Victorian building on a perpetually rainy street in Bristol, England. The decor was a chaotic, yet comforting, mix of travel posters – vintage ones, mostly – and souvenirs she'd collected over years of her own less-than-glamorous adventures (a chipped Eiffel Tower replica, a slightly-melted Buddha from Thailand, a feather headdress that smelled faintly of mothballs). Stacks of brochures teetered precariously on every surface, threatening to avalanche onto anyone who dared enter.

Beatrice's desk, the epicenter of this organized chaos, was a testament to her personality. A half-finished jigsaw puzzle of the Swiss Alps sat next to a pile of unpaid bills, a miniature zen garden, and a half-eaten box of shortbread. Her computer, a relic from the early 2000s, whirred and groaned with the effort of loading a single web page, and her ancient rotary phone – the one currently disturbing her slumber – was stubbornly clinging to life, just like Beatrice herself. The whole place breathed a sort of nostalgic, slightly eccentric charm, a fitting reflection of the woman who ran it. It was a place where dreams, both realized and completely fabricated, were bought and sold every day, even if the actual sales process was a little bit… messy.
