Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a logger named Silas Blackwood:

**Setting:** The mist hung thick and heavy in the Olympic National Forest of Washington state, clinging to the towering cedars and Douglas firs like a shroud. Rain, a constant companion in these parts, dripped from the brim of Silas’s weathered hat, blurring the already muted greens and browns of the forest floor. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying wood, and diesel fumes, vibrated with the low rumble of the skidder further up the slope. It was early morning, the sky a pale, milky grey that promised another long, hard day. This particular section, known as "Devil's Elbow" to the crew, was notorious for its precarious footing and thick, unforgiving undergrowth.

**Opening:**

Silas Blackwood spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the mud and adjusted the suspenders holding up his heavy canvas pants. He took a long pull from his thermos, the steaming coffee doing little to fight the chill that had burrowed deep into his bones. Forty-seven years he’d been breathing this air, listening to the whine of the chainsaws, feeling the earth tremble beneath the falling giants. Forty-seven years of sweat, sawdust, and the gnawing ache in his back. Today, though, something felt different. It wasn't just the usual pre-dawn dread of facing another day of hard labor. There was a prickle at the back of his neck, a low hum of unease that resonated with the ancient silence of the forest, a silence that even the roar of machinery couldn't quite conquer. As he hefted his axe, its familiar weight grounding him, Silas couldn't shake the feeling that Devil's Elbow was about to earn its name.
