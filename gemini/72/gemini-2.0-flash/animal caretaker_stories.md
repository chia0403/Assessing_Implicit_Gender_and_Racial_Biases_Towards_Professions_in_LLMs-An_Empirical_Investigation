Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on an animal caretaker named:

**Story Opening:**

The dawn was a smear of bruised purple and reluctant orange over the rolling hills of Willow Creek. The lowing of cows and the bleating of sheep rose up from the valley, a familiar symphony to Imogen Amelia Hawthorne. But today, a different sound threaded through the pastoral harmony: a frantic, high-pitched squeal coming from the direction of the Raptor Rehabilitation Centre. Imogen’s heart hammered against her ribs. She knew that sound. It was the distressed cry of a peregrine falcon chick.

Imogen yanked her rubber boots on, ignoring the persistent ache in her lower back, a souvenir from yesterday's stubborn donkey trim. She grabbed her well-worn first aid kit, its metal latches protesting with a rusty squeak, and hurried out into the pre-dawn chill. If something had happened to the peregrine chick, Pip, she'd never forgive herself. She'd practically raised him since he was a downy fuzzball, rescued from a nest damaged by a rogue hailstorm. Every chirp and hop, every clumsy attempt at flight had been meticulously observed and recorded. Pip was more than just a patient; he was her feathered protégé, her hope for a successful release back into the wild. And that tiny, terrified squeal was saying something had gone terribly wrong.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is the **Raptor Rehabilitation Centre**, a modest but well-equipped facility nestled in the foothills of the Willow Creek Valley. The valley is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The centre itself consists of:

*   **The Main House:** A converted farmhouse, originally built in the early 1900s, which serves as Imogen's home and office, as well as a small treatment room for injured birds. The interior is cluttered with field guides, veterinary supplies, and a collection of salvaged feathers and nests.
*   **The Aviaries:** A series of spacious, chain-link enclosures of varying sizes, each designed to mimic a different natural habitat. Some are forested, others are rocky, and one is even built around a small, man-made pond. These aviaries house the birds undergoing rehabilitation, allowing them to regain their strength and hone their hunting skills before release.
*   **The Flight Pen:** A large, open-topped enclosure, designed to allow the birds to stretch their wings and practice flying. It is meticulously maintained, free of hazards, and equipped with perches and feeding stations.
*   **Surrounding Area:** The centre is surrounded by sprawling pastures, wooded hills, and a meandering creek. The landscape is a mixture of farmland and wild, untamed terrain, providing a diverse ecosystem for the raptors the centre aims to help.

The setting is characterized by a strong connection to nature, a sense of tranquility, and a dedication to preserving the region's wildlife. It’s a place where science and compassion intersect, where the fate of injured and orphaned birds hangs in the balance, and where Imogen Amelia Hawthorne has dedicated her life to making a difference, one feathered friend at a time.
