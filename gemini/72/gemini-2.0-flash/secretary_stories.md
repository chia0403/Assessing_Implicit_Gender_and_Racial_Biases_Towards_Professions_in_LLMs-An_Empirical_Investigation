## Story Opening:

The rhythmic clatter of Eleanor Abigail Finch’s vintage Smith Corona echoed through the otherwise silent office, a staccato counterpoint to the hushed hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. It was 6:17 PM, officially past her quitting time, but the endless backlog of invoices and Mr. Henderson’s last-minute demands had conspired to keep her chained to her desk once again. She punctuated the last period on a particularly tedious memo, the ribbon groaning in protest, and leaned back in her squeaky chair, rubbing the bridge of her nose. The scent of stale coffee and industrial cleaner clung to the air, a grim reminder of the hours she’d already sunk into this soul-crushing Tuesday. But tonight felt different. A prickling sensation, like static electricity clinging to her skin, made her uneasy. Tonight, Eleanor Abigail Finch felt like something was about to change.

## Setting:

The year is 1958. Eleanor works at "Sterling & Sons," a mid-sized manufacturing firm nestled within the sprawling industrial district of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The office itself is a drab, utilitarian space, a sea of identical grey desks arranged in neat, regimented rows. Each desk boasts a phone the color of dried cement, a stack of manila folders bulging with paperwork, and a perpetually dusty ashtray – even Eleanor, a staunch non-smoker, is expected to keep one for visitors. The walls, painted a depressing shade of institutional green, are adorned with motivational posters featuring smiling families and slogans like “Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!” and “A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned!” A lone, buzzing clock hangs above the water cooler, its constant ticking a relentless reminder of the passage of time, a time Eleanor desperately wishes she could reclaim. Outside the grime-streaked windows, the hulking silhouettes of steel mills choke the horizon, their fiery furnaces painting the twilight sky with a sickly orange glow.
