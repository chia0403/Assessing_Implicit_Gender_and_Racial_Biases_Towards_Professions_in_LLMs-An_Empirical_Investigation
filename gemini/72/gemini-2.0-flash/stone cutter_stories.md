## The Story Opening:

The dust tasted of regret and granite, a familiar and unwelcome cocktail that perpetually clung to Silas Bartholomew’s tongue. He spat again, the grit a gritty punctuation mark against the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against the stubborn grey stone. It was a sound he’d grown up with, a symphony of stone shaping that had lulled him to sleep as a boy and now, at thirty-two, threatened to drive him mad.

He was carving a headstone, a commission for the recently deceased Agnes Finch. The name itself felt like a judgment, etched in stone that would outlive Silas himself. “Agnes Finch, Beloved Wife and Mother, Rest in Peace.” The irony wasn’t lost on him; Agnes, he remembered from his childhood, had possessed the sharp tongue of a whip and a heart harder than any Aberdeen granite he'd ever wrestled.

He paused, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, smearing a grey film across his already grime-streaked skin. He needed to be careful. One wrong strike, one errant chip, and the whole piece would be ruined. And Silas Bartholomew, Master Stone Cutter of Oakhaven, couldn't afford another failure. Not this week. Not ever.

## The Setting:

Silas Bartholomew’s workshop was a low, sprawling structure built from the very stone he worked. Situated on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a small, windswept village nestled in the rugged hills of northern England, the workshop looked as if it had sprung organically from the landscape. Inside, the air hung thick with stone dust, illuminated by the weak sunlight that filtered through the grimy windows. Tools of all shapes and sizes lined the walls, from delicate chisels capable of carving the finest details to monstrous mallets used to break down enormous blocks of stone. Half-finished sculptures stood shrouded in dust sheets, silent witnesses to Silas’s triumphs and failures. The floor was littered with chips and shards of stone, a mosaic of grey and white that crunched beneath his boots. Outside, a small, overgrown garden provided a splash of unexpected colour against the monotonous grey, a testament to his late mother’s green thumb and a silent reminder of a life that seemed impossibly distant now. The scent of lavender and rosemary, fighting against the ever-present dust, was a small comfort in a world increasingly defined by the harsh realities of stone and sorrow.
