The stale scent of motor oil, mingled with the faint sweetness of brake cleaner, was Amelia Rose O'Connell's perfume. She wore it well. It clung to her grease-stained overalls, permeated the calloused tips of her fingers, and, she suspected, even clung to her dreams. This wasn't a glamorous fragrance, not by a long shot. But it was the smell of honest work, of understanding the intricate dance of metal and mechanics, and in the echoing vastness of O'Connell's Garage, it was the smell of home.

The garage itself was a sprawling behemoth on the outskirts of Havenwood, Montana, a town clinging to the edge of the wilderness with the tenacity of a mountain goat. Built by Amelia's grandfather, a man whose legend was almost as worn as the tire treads outside, O'Connell's Garage was more than just a place to fix cars; it was a community hub, a sanctuary for broken-down dreams, and a monument to grit and determination. Three bays, each illuminated by buzzing fluorescent lights, housed a chaotic collection of tools, half-disassembled engines, and the ghosts of projects past. Outside, a graveyard of derelict vehicles rusted slowly under the unforgiving Montana sun, their metal carcasses serving as a stark reminder of the relentless march of time. Today, the sun beat down on a cherry-red '67 Mustang, its hood propped open like a gaping maw, waiting for Amelia to breathe new life into its slumbering engine.
