## Story Opening:

The cab of the Komatsu D375A bulldozer rattled like a tin can full of gravel. A rhythmic, bone-deep vibration that resonated right through Jebediah Ezekiel “Jeb” Thompson's fillings. Another glorious Tuesday morning at the Dustbowl, and Jeb, as usual, was the conductor of this particular symphony of destruction. He squinted against the rising sun, which painted the scarred landscape in shades of orange and ochre, making the already oppressive heat seem to shimmer and pulsate.

## Setting:

The "Dustbowl," as it was affectionately (and sarcastically) known by the men and women who worked there, was a sprawling opencast iron ore mine carved deep into the belly of the Arizona desert. The red earth stretched as far as the eye could see, a landscape of terraced pits, monstrous haul trucks, and the ever-present fine, red dust that clung to everything – clothes, skin, lungs, and even the inside of your coffee cup. Jagged mountains, remnants of the ancient rock that had held the ore captive for millennia, loomed on the horizon, dwarfed by the immensity of the operation. The air, thick with the smell of diesel and pulverized rock, hung heavy and still, promising another scorching day under the unforgiving desert sun.
