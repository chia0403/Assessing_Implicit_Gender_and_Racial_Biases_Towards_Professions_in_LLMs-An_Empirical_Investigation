The chipped paint of Amelia Hernandez’s desk matched the chipped optimism in her heart.  Rain lashed against the window of "Wanderlust Travel," blurring the already faded poster of the Amalfi Coast into a hazy watercolor.  The aroma of stale coffee and regret hung heavy in the air, a fitting scent for a Tuesday afternoon in November – a Tuesday afternoon that had yielded precisely zero clients and one particularly aggressive email from a woman demanding a refund for a cancelled safari (apparently, the lions had been "too grumpy").  Amelia sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain, and rubbed her temples, the faint scent of lavender from her hand lotion doing little to soothe her frayed nerves.  Her small, almost apologetically cluttered office, tucked away on a side street in the perpetually damp town of Port Blossom, Oregon, felt more like a holding cell than a gateway to adventure.
