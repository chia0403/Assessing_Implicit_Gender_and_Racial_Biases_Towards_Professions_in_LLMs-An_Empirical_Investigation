The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky beneath Amelia Hernandez's fingertips, a familiar discomfort in the otherwise unremarkable diner.  Grease clung to the air, a thick, comforting blanket woven from the scent of frying bacon and burnt coffee.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, casting a sickly yellow glow on the faded checkered vinyl booths and the perpetually smudged glass of the counter.  Rain lashed against the windows of Rosie's Diner, a relentless drumming that matched the frantic rhythm of Amelia's heart.  She wiped down the counter with a practiced hand, the rag barely making a dent in the accumulation of sticky spills and forgotten lives.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night chaos felt different; heavier.  A tension hung in the air, thicker even than the greasy aroma, a premonition that something was about to shatter the tired predictability of her routine.
