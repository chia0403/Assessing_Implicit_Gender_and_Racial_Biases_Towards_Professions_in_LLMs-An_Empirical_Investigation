The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, reflecting the nervous tremor in Finley "Finn" O'Malley's hands.  Finn, a bellhop barely clinging to the frayed edges of respectability, clutched a battered leather-bound suitcase – its worn corners a testament to countless journeys, none of them his own –  with a white-knuckled grip.  The air hung thick with the scent of aged mahogany, pipe tobacco, and something indefinably sinister, a cloying sweetness that clung to the velvet ropes and the ornate, dust-laden chandeliers. Rain lashed against the towering arched windows of the Grand Majestic, a relentless percussion against the backdrop of the hushed, almost expectant, stillness within.  The year was 1928, and the Grand Majestic, once the jewel of Chicago’s South Side, now seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something…or someone…to arrive.
