The November wind, a razor-edged thing, whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Fallen branches, thick as a man's arm, littered the ancient oak grove, a testament to the storm that had raged through the valley the previous night.  Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the frigid air, surveyed the damage with a sigh.  His calloused hands, perpetually stained with the rich brown of Blackwood's soil, tightened around the handle of his trusty pruning shears.  The manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, loomed behind him, its countless windows like vacant eyes staring out at the ravaged landscape.  Elias, Blackwood Manor's groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every twist of its sprawling grounds, every stubborn weed that dared to sprout in the meticulously kept flowerbeds, every creak and groan of the ancient trees. But this stormâ€¦ this storm had left its mark, and Elias had a long day ahead of him.
