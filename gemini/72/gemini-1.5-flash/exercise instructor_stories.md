The humid air hung thick and heavy in the Spin Cycle studio, a shimmering haze reflecting the kaleidoscopic lights that pulsed in time with the relentless beat.  Sweat, glistening like a thousand tiny diamonds, coated every inch of the chrome-plated bikes.  The air thrummed with a synchronized rhythm of grunting exertion and the driving beat of Beyoncé's latest hit.  This was Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's kingdom, a sweaty, endorphin-fueled domain she ruled with an iron fist, clad in neon leggings and a perpetually encouraging smile.  Tonight, however, the usual electric energy felt… different. A palpable tension vibrated beneath the surface of the class, as thick and cloying as the humid air itself.  Amy, normally radiating confidence, felt a prickle of unease crawling up her spine.  Something was off, and she knew, with a certainty that chilled her more than the air conditioning ever could, that tonight’s spin class wouldn’t just be another workout.
