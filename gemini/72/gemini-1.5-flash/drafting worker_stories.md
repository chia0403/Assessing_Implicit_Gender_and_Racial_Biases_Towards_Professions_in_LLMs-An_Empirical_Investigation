The acrid scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion to Elias Thorne,  senior draftsman at Blackwood & Sons Architectural Design.  Elias, a man whose life revolved around the precise lines and meticulous shading of blueprints, sat hunched over his drafting board, the pale glow of his desk lamp illuminating the intricate details of a proposed skyscraper – a glass and steel behemoth planned for the rapidly expanding skyline of New Birmingham.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the firm's aging office building, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of his pen against the Mylar. Outside, the city roared; inside, Elias found solace in the quiet precision of his work, a world where every line was accounted for, every angle perfect, a stark contrast to the chaotic, unpredictable world beyond the pane.  Tonight, however, even the familiar comfort of his drafting table felt strained, a subtle unease prickling at the edges of his concentration.  A new project had arrived, one shrouded in secrecy, and it felt…wrong.
