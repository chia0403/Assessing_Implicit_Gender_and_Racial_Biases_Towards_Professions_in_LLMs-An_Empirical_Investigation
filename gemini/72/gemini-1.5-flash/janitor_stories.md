The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a monotonous tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the slow, methodical sweep of Elias Thorne's mop, danced in the weak beams. Elias, a man whose life was measured in the rhythmic swish of his mop and the squeak of his worn-out shoes, had seen countless generations of students – and their equally countless messes – pass through the hallowed halls of Blackwood.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual cacophony of slamming lockers and boisterous laughter was replaced by an unnerving silence, broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the main hall, each tick echoing with a peculiar finality.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and something else…something metallic and faintly sweet, like blood mixed with ink.
