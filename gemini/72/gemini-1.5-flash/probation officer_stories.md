The stale air hung heavy with the scent of cheap coffee and despair, clinging to the worn floral wallpaper of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office like a persistent cough.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the Brockton County Probation Department, mirroring the relentless downpour of anxieties Amelia carried within.  Her desk, a scarred mahogany behemoth inherited from a predecessor who'd retired to a sun-drenched vineyard in Tuscany (a cruel joke, Amelia thought), was buried under a mountain of case files – each one a potential catastrophe waiting to explode.  The digital clock blinked 7:53 AM, a merciless countdown to the day's inevitable onslaught of lies, broken promises, and the ever-present threat of recidivism.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, sighed, the sound swallowed by the drumming rain and the low hum of the fluorescent lights.  Today's agenda included a meeting with a parolee with a penchant for arson, a surprise home visit on a convicted embezzler, and the dreaded paperwork – paperwork that seemed to multiply exponentially overnight.  Another Monday. Another mountain to climb.
