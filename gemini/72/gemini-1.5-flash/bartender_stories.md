The chipped Formica bar top felt slick beneath Elara Vance’s fingertips as she polished a already gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the windows of “The Rusty Mug,” blurring the neon glow of the adjacent pawn shop into a hazy, iridescent smear.

Even the usual boisterous Friday night crowd hadn't yet materialized; a pre-storm stillness clung to the dimly lit space, making the silence feel almost expectant. Elara, usually a whirlwind of controlled chaos behind the bar, found herself unusually still, her gaze fixed on the swirling vortex of rain outside, a premonition, sharp and cold, prickling at the back of her neck.
