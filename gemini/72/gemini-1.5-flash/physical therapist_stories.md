The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from the barnacle-encrusted pilings.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking below the horizon, cast long shadows across the weathered planks of the dilapidated dock.  Seagulls wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Maine coastline.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and pine, carried a hint of woodsmoke from the distant village of Port Blossom, a cluster of quaint houses clinging precariously to the cliff face. This was her sanctuary, her escape from the sterile, antiseptic world of her physiotherapy practice in the city, a place where the only patients were the battered boats and the aching joints of the local fishermen. Tonight, however, it felt less like sanctuary and more like a battlefield, as Eleanor’s determination to salvage her grandfather's old net was meeting the stiff resistance of decades of neglect and the unforgiving sea.
