The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn Grace Moreau as she wrestled the controls of the Twin Otter.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, clawed at the fuselage, painting the already bruised twilight sky in a shimmering, ethereal white.  Below, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf stretched to the horizon, a frozen ocean punctuated only by the jagged teeth of icebergs, their colossal forms barely visible in the gathering gloom.  Evelyn, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, squinted through the swirling snow, her knuckles bone-white against the worn leather of the yoke.  This wasn't just another supply run to McMurdo Station; this was a fight for survival, against the elements and, perhaps, something far more sinister.
