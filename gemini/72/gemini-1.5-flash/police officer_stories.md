The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia “Amy” Stone’s face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the jagged cliffs of Cornwall.  Rain, thick and relentless, lashed against her waterproof jacket, blurring the already fading light into a murky, indistinct grey. Below, the Atlantic churned, a restless beast gnawing at the rocky coastline, its roar a constant, unsettling soundtrack to the scene before her.  The body, barely visible through the driving rain, lay sprawled amongst the wind-battered gorse bushes, a stark, lifeless silhouette against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  The air hung heavy with the stench of brine and something else… something metallic and undeniably sinister.  This wasn't just another missing person case gone cold; this was something far more… brutal.
