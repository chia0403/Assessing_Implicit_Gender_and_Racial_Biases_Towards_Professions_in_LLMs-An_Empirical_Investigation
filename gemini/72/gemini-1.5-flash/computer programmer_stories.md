The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle shop cast a lurid, orange glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked trench coat.  Water cascaded from the eaves of the crumbling brick building, each drop a tiny percussion instrument in the symphony of the city's nocturnal hum.  Steam rose from the overflowing gutters, mingling with the exhaust fumes and the scent of cheap cigarettes and something vaguely spicy â€“ likely the chili oil from the Lucky Dragon. Elara, a computer programmer with eyes that reflected the city's sleepless energy and hair perpetually escaping its messy bun, hunched deeper into her collar, the damp chill seeping into her bones.  She pulled her worn laptop bag closer, the reassuring weight of it a small comfort in the otherwise overwhelming anonymity of Neo-Kyoto's backstreets.  Tonight, however, anonymity wasn't her friend. Tonight, it was a liability.
