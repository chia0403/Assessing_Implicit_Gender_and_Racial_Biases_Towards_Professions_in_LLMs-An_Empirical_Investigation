The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch's hands, a small comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the office window.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Manchester sprawling below.  Amelia, a secretary of twenty-three years at Thorne & Grimshaw Solicitors, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic clatter of the ancient typewriter in the adjacent office.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, damp wool, and the lingering aroma of yesterday's leftover shepherd's pie from Mrs. Higgins's lunch.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sunlight filtering through the grime on the windowpane, each one a tiny, glittering reminder of the years accumulated within the dusty, imposing Victorian building that housed Thorne & Grimshaw.  This wasn't exactly the glamorous career Amelia had envisioned as a bright-eyed graduate, but it was a job, and in these uncertain times, that was something to be grateful for.
