The rasp of the steel cleaver on bone echoed through the cavernous chill of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's butcher shop, a sound as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above the sawdust-covered floor, danced in the weak light.  The air, thick with the scent of iron and rendered beef fat, hung heavy and sweet, a perfume both repulsive and alluring to those who knew its language.  Barty, his hands stained crimson and his apron stiff with congealed blood, worked with a practiced ease born from decades spent plying his trade in the shadowed heart of Grimsborough's old market district. The shop itself, a relic of a bygone era, groaned under the weight of years, its aged wooden beams whispering tales of bustling markets and forgotten feasts. Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the grime-streaked windows, a relentless soundtrack to Barty's solitary work.
