The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hathaway's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Maple Street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts, usually comforting, was today lost in the bitter tang of approaching snow.  Grey skies pressed down on the quaint, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian houses lining the street, their gingerbread trim barely visible beneath a film of early winter grime.  Amelia, all of twenty-two years old, clutched a battered canvas tote bag overflowing with brightly coloured crayons, half-finished finger-paintings, and the ever-present aroma of slightly over-ripe bananas â€“ the tell-tale signs of her day at "Little Sprouts," the chaotic but cherished child care centre she ran from the sun-drenched, slightly ramshackle basement apartment behind Mrs. Gable's antique shop.
