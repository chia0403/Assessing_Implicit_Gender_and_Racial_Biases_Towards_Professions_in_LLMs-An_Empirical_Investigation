The stale air of the showroom hung heavy with the scent of new car leather and desperation.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow fluorescent lights, danced in the silent expanse between rows of gleaming, impossibly perfect vehicles.  Amelia Jean Worthington, her sensible beige blazer feeling as stiff as the sales targets she hadn't met in three months, stared out at the empty lot.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, mirroring the relentless downpour of her anxieties.  The only sound, besides the rhythmic drumming of the rain, was the low hum of the refrigerator in the break room â€“ a constant, mocking reminder of the lukewarm coffee and even colder leads that defined her existence at "Drive Time Motors."
