The greasy scent of burnt motor oil clung to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume that spoke of long hours spent wrestling with temperamental engines and stubborn bolts.  The air in her garage, Hernandez Auto Repair, hung thick and warm, a hazy blend of exhaust fumes, metal shavings, and the faint sweetness of spilled cola.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, casting a harsh glare on the cluttered workspace.  Tools – gleaming wrenches, battered sockets, and a collection of oddly shaped screwdrivers – hung haphazardly from pegboards, a testament to years of accumulated expertise.  Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the dusty landscape, baking the corrugated iron roof until it radiated a near-unbearable heat.  But inside, under the flickering lights, Amy was in her element.  A half-dismantled engine sat on the workbench before her, a complex puzzle awaiting her skillful hands.  This wasn't just a job; it was a conversation, a challenge, a dance between metal and muscle.  Today's challenge: a vintage Mustang with a temper as fiery as the desert sun.
