The scent of burnt sugar and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that did little to mask the underlying aroma of bleach and ammonia.  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau, owner and sole proprietor of “Izzy’s Mane Event,”  swiped a damp cloth across the already spotless countertop, her reflection shimmering back at her from the polished surface.  The small salon, nestled on a cobblestone side street in the ancient, perpetually twilight-drenched city of Prague, was quiet except for the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner – a stark contrast to the usually chaotic buzz of hair dryers and chattering clients.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the gaslight glow of the street outside into hazy, orange streaks. Tonight, however, the only sound louder than the rain was the frantic thump-thump-thump of Izzy’s own anxious heart.
