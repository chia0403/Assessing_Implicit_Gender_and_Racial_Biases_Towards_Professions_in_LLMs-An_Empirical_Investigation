The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom smelled faintly of crayons and desperation.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun struggling through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted ballerinas.  Crayon shavings, a rainbow graveyard of artistic casualties, lay scattered across the worn carpet, a testament to the day's creative chaos.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient window frames, a sound that mirrored the low hum of anxiety currently vibrating in Eleanor's chest.  It wasn't the usual pre-holiday jitters; this was different.  Something feltâ€¦off.  The usual cacophony of kindergarten joy was muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet that clung to the air like damp wool.
