The scent of stale coffee and slightly burnt popcorn – a leftover from a particularly stressful afternoon – hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled, a mournful symphony mirroring the anxieties of her clients, many of whom were currently huddled in the waiting room, nervously clutching their tax documents like lifelines.
