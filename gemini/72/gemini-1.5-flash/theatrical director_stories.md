The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Aurelia “Rel” Blackwood’s hand, mirroring the tremor of anxiety in her chest.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her cramped, book-lined office, a chaotic counterpoint to the meticulously organised chaos of her life.  The office itself was a testament to her theatrical career: posters of past productions – a riot of colour and forgotten faces – plastered every available inch of wall space, interspersed with framed playbills and half-finished sketches of set designs. The air hung thick with the scent of aged paper, damp wool, and the faint, lingering perfume of lilies, a ghostly reminder of a particularly disastrous opening night.  Outside, the gothic spires of the Blackwood Theatre, a crumbling masterpiece inherited from her eccentric great-uncle, clawed at the stormy sky, a fitting backdrop to Rel's current predicament.  Tonight, the curtain was rising on her most ambitious production yet – a reimagining of Shakespeare’s *King Lear*, and the weight of its potential failure felt like the entire building pressing down on her fragile shoulders.
