The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep mud of the sanctuary’s back paddock.  Rain, relentless and grey, had been falling for three days, turning the usually vibrant green expanse of Willow Creek Wildlife Rescue into a sodden, muddy swamp.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faintly sweet, almost medicinal aroma of the eucalyptus trees that lined the perimeter fence.  Mia, her thick wool coat offering little respite from the chill, pulled her worn beanie lower, its bobble brushing against her ear.  The rhythmic *cluck-cluck-cluck* of a disgruntled emu somewhere in the distance was the only sound besides the drumming of rain on her oilskin jacket. This was Willow Creek, her sanctuary, her life; a place of both profound beauty and constant, challenging work.
