The fluorescent lights of the Aspen Dental clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the polishing tool in Seraphina “Sera” Moreau’s hand.  The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Sera had come to tolerate, even slightly enjoy, over her seven years in the profession.  Outside, the relentless Colorado sun beat down on the snow-capped Rockies, a stark contrast to the cool, controlled environment within.  Today, however, the usual calm was shattered by the insistent buzz of a particularly frantic drill from Dr. Albright’s office, a sound that usually heralded either a root canal gone wrong or Mr. Henderson’s annual outburst about the cost of fluoride treatments.  Sera glanced at the clock: 2:17 pm.  Another Friday afternoon, another potential eruption looming on the horizon.
