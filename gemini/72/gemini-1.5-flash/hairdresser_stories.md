The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Serenity's Scissors, a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient city of Prague.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow that spilled from the nearby tavern.  Inside, amidst the chaos of stray hairpins and half-empty bottles of shimmering dyes, sat Aurelia “Ria” Novakova, her fingers nimble as she worked on a client's intricate braid.  Ria, with her cascade of fiery red hair escaping its own carefully constructed bun, hummed a melancholic Czech folk tune, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously placed each strand. The only other sound was the rhythmic *snip-snip* of her shears and the low murmur of the rain, a soundtrack to the secrets whispered within the four walls of her little salon.
