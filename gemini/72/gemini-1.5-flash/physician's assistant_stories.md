The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s dark braid across her face as she hurried down the slick cobblestone street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since dawn, plastered her dark hair to her scalp and clung to the hem of her already damp scrubs. The scent of brine and decaying seaweed hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to the ancient port town of Port Blossom like a shroud.  Above, the skeletal branches of the gnarled oak trees clawed at the bruised, grey sky, mirroring the anxiety that gnawed at Amelia’s stomach.  Tonight, the usual quiet hum of Port Blossom, usually punctuated by the rhythmic creak of fishing boats and the distant cries of gulls, was replaced by an unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic slap of the waves against the harbor wall and the frantic beating of her own heart.  This wasn’t just another late-night call to Dr. Albright’s clinic; something felt profoundly wrong.
