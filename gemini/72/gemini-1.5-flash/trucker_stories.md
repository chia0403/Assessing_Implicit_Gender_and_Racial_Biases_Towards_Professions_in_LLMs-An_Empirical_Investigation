Amy gripped the wheel, knuckles white, her breath misting in the frigid cab.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Betsy’s engine, a sound that had become the soundtrack to Amy's life for the past fifteen years. Tonight, however, the familiar comfort was tinged with a growing unease.  The storm was worsening, and she was miles from anywhere.
