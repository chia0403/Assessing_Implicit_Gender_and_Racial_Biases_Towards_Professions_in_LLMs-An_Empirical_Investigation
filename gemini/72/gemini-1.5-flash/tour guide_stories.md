The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and something faintly…rotten.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless soundtrack to the oppressive midday heat, their chirps echoing off the crumbling limestone walls of the Mayan ruin.  Amelia Hernandez, her dark hair plastered to her neck despite the constant fanning of her hand, adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring the already indistinct glyphs carved into the towering temple before her.  Another scorcher of a day in Palenque, and another tour group to shepherd through the mysteries – and mosquitos – of the ancient city.  Today's contingent, a boisterous bunch of Canadians, were already trailing behind, their enthusiasm seemingly inversely proportional to the rising mercury.  Amelia sighed, a small, resigned sound lost in the symphony of the jungle.  This was going to be a long afternoon.
