The biting Alaskan wind whipped around Elara Jean Blackwood, stinging her cheeks and threatening to snatch her camera from its precarious perch on her tripod.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and the icy tang of the sea, frosted her eyelashes, each blink a miniature blizzard.  Before her, the Chugach Mountains rose, jagged teeth against a bruised purple sky, the setting sun painting the snow-covered peaks in hues of fiery orange and bruised plum.  Elara, bundled in layers of wool and down, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  This was it. The shot that could make or break her career.  The shot that would capture the raw, untamed beauty of Alaska, a beauty she'd chased across thousands of miles, braving blizzards and icy rivers, all for this single, breathtaking moment.
