The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her charcoal coat to her back.  Before her, the sprawling Victorian mansion of Blackwood Manor loomed, a gothic silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Gargoyles, leering from the eaves, seemed to watch her with malevolent amusement.  Broken glass glittered like a morbid constellation on the manicured lawn, scattered amongst overturned garden furniture – remnants of a struggle, a scream swallowed by the wind, and now, a chilling silence that pressed in on Eleanor like the suffocating dampness of the approaching night.  The air, thick with the scent of wet earth and something else… something metallic and sickeningly sweet… clung to her like a shroud.  This was her third case this month, but Blackwood Manor felt different.  This felt… personal.
