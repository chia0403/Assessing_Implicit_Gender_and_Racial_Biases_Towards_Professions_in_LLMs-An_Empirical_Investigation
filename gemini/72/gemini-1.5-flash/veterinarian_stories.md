The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Reed's battered Land Rover Defender, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already fading light.  Evelyn, bundled in layers of fleece and Gore-Tex, wrestled with the stubborn latch on the vehicle's rear door, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The remote Alaskan village of Knik Arm clung precariously to the shoreline, a cluster of brightly painted houses huddled together against the encroaching wilderness like frightened sheep.  A thin ribbon of ice, treacherous and unforgiving, separated the village from the mainland, its surface groaning under the weight of the accumulating snow.  The air smelled sharp with the scent of pine and something else, something vaguely metallic, that tugged at the corner of Evelyn's mind, a premonition as cold and hard as the ice itself.  This wasn't just another routine house call; she could feel it in her bones.
