The rasp of granite against steel, a sound as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat, echoed through the cavernous workshop. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, grime-streaked window high above, danced in the shafts of late afternoon sunlight.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and weathered as the stone he shaped, paused his work, the rhythmic scrape momentarily stilled.  He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the sweat stinging a small cut on his cheek â€“ a testament to countless hours spent wrestling with unforgiving rock. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune across the bleak, windswept moors of Dartmoor, a fitting soundtrack to the solitary life he led, carved out as meticulously as the intricate designs on the headstones he created.  His workshop, a ramshackle stone structure perched precariously on the edge of a granite quarry, was a testament to both his skill and his isolation.
