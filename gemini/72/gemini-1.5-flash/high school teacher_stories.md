The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the already littered asphalt like a premature snowfall.  A biting November wind whipped around Amelia Katherine Hayes, tugging at the collar of her worn tweed jacket.  Amelia, or Miss Hayes as her students knew her, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The impending parent-teacher conferences gnawed at her more than the wind chill.

It was known, however, for its exceptionally high caffeine consumption and the pervasive aroma of damp wool – a smell that clung to Amelia’s clothes like a second skin after seventeen years of teaching English within its hallowed (and slightly mildewed) halls.
