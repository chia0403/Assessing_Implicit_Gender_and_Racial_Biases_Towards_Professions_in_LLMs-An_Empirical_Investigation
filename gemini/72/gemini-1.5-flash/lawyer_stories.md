The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Davenport's face as she wrestled the battered fishing boat, *The Salty Siren*, closer to the craggy cliffs of Smuggler's Cove.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the rapidly darkening sky, cast long shadows across the treacherous rocks, painting the churning sea in shades of deep indigo and bruised purple.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead. Mia, a lawyer whose tailored suit was now speckled with seawater and grime, gripped the wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn wood.  She wasn't known for her seafaring skills, but tonight, her destination – a secluded cove hidden from the prying eyes of the mainland – was far more important than her comfort, or her carefully constructed professional image.
