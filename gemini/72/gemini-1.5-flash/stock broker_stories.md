The only sounds were the rhythmic slap of her heels on the slick pavement and the distant, mournful wail of a siren, swallowed by the growing darkness.

The unread emails piled up, a digital Everest of pending deals and looming deadlines – a fitting metaphor for the storm brewing both inside and outside her.
