The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Holloway's auburn hair across her face as she stood on the precipice of the desolate, windswept moors.  Grey skies wept a relentless drizzle, mirroring the turmoil churning within her.

This was it, the location for her latest project, "The Shepherd's Lament," a gothic thriller she'd poured her soul – and the last vestiges of her inheritance – into. The air tasted of peat smoke and impending doom, a perfect atmosphere, she mused grimly, for a story about a woman haunted by her past.  The wind howled a mournful dirge, a soundtrack only nature could provide for Mia's descent into the heart of her ambitious, and perhaps ill-fated, film.
