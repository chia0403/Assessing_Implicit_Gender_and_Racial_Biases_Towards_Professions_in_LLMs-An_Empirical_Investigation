Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced lazily in the stagnant air above the cracked Formica countertop.  Outside, the relentless Texas sun beat down on the faded awning of her salon, tucked precariously between a pawn shop smelling of stale cigarettes and a boarded-up diner that hadn't seen a customer in years.  Esme sighed, the sound swallowed by the whirring of a malfunctioning fan, and dipped her brush into a pot of shocking pink polish, the vibrant color a stark contrast to the grey despair slowly settling over her.  This wasn't the life she'd envisioned. Not even close.
