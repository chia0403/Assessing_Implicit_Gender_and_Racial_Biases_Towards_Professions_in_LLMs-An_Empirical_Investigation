The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the small, windowless office.  Rain hammered against the grimy panes, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the relentless pounding in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's temples.  The year was 1992, and the city of Baltimore, Maryland, held a palpable chill, both in the air and in the suffocating atmosphere of her cramped law office.  Amy, a recent graduate of the University of Baltimore School of Law, stared at the sheaf of papers before her, each one a testament to another case lost to the relentless tide of bureaucracy and corruption.  Across the worn mahogany desk lay a stack of unpaid bills, a stark visual reminder of the precarious balance between ambition and survival.


The setting was a small, gritty office building nestled in a neighbourhood known for its history of industry and its recent struggles with urban decay.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, lingering aroma of cheap cigarettes.  The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, its faded paint and broken windowpanes whispering stories of forgotten dreams and unfulfilled promises.   Amyâ€™s small office, located on the second floor, was cramped and ill-lit, with cheap, plastic furniture that creaked with every movement.  The only respite from the grey walls was a faded poster of the Baltimore skyline, a faded echo of the city's once glorious past.  The quiet desperation in the room, tangible and thick as the city's fog on a cold morning, reflected the overwhelming pressure Amy felt in her career, and in her life.
