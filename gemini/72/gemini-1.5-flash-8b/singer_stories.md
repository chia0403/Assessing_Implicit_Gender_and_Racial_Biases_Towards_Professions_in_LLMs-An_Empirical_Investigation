The chipped porcelain sink of the tiny bathroom reflected Elara Nightingale’s weary face.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumming in her temples.  Elara, a singer whose voice could melt glaciers and whose dreams once soared higher than the cathedral spires of her hometown, found herself trapped in a cramped, damp flat in the shadowed heart of the city.  Not the vibrant, bustling metropolis she’d envisioned, but a grey, echoing labyrinth of narrow streets and forgotten alleyways.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and something indefinably… musty.  This wasn't the stage, the spotlight, the roaring applause that had once fueled her every breath.  This was a dead end, a cul-de-sac of doubt.  Just another Tuesday.
