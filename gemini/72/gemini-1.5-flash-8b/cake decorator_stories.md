The aroma of buttercream and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, a sweet, almost suffocating fog that clung to the chipped paint of Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's tiny bakery, "Crumbs & Dreams."  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a whimsical, sugar-plum-faded forest, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Amy, her fingers stained a delicate shade of rose-pink from the last batch of strawberry shortcake frosting, meticulously piped a tiny, perfect rose onto a miniature wedding cake.  Outside, the rhythmic clatter of city life – distant sirens, the honk of a taxi, the shouted greetings of street vendors – was a constant hum, an almost imperceptible soundtrack to the symphony of her artistry.  Crumbs & Dreams was located in the heart of the bustling, slightly eccentric, Copperfield district, a labyrinth of cobbled alleyways, antique shops, and quirky cafes, where the past seemed to linger as thick as the honey-laced glaze on her creations.  The tiny shop, crammed with colourful tins of sprinkles, tubs of marzipan, and stacks of intricately patterned baking papers, felt more like a sanctuary than a business.  Today, however, a particularly agitated buzz filled the air, a stark contrast to the usual calm.  A large, ornate box lay on the counter, a rather unusual commission for a Tuesday morning.
