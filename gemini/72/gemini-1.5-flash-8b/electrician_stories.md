The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Horseshoe" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones.  Kingston "Kin"  MacTavish, his name practically a rumble in the humid air, swore under his breath.  Another short circuit.  Another frustrating night in the damp, crumbling alleyways of Old Blackwood.  The flickering light above the saloon seemed to mock him, its pulsating yellow a constant, irritating reminder of the complex web of wires and transformers that lay hidden beneath the city’s antique façade. Kin, his greasy, dark hair plastered to his forehead, adjusted the worn leather strap of his toolbox.  The smell of ozone, damp earth, and aged beer clung to him like a second skin.  Old Blackwood wasn't a place for delicate sensibilities, and Kin, despite his quiet nature, had learned to thrive in its grit.


Setting: Old Blackwood, a sprawling, atmospheric city nestled in a valley in the Appalachian Mountains, its buildings were a patchwork of historic architecture, leaning against one another in a testament to its long and winding history.  Rain lashed against the steep, cobblestone streets, turning them into slick, treacherous waterways. The air, thick with humidity and the scent of decaying leaves, carried the muffled sounds of revelry from the pubs and taverns that lined the alleyways and shadowed streets. The city's energy pulsed through a complex network of aging, often-overloaded, electrical systems, making Kin's job a constant dance with potential catastrophe.
