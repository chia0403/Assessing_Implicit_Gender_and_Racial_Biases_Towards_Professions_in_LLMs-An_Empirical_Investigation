The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" warehouse hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne’s daily grind.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light piercing the cavernous space, illuminating rows upon rows of meticulously organized boxes.  Each box, Amelia knew, held the potential for a sale, a connection, a transaction. But today, the air felt thick with the unspoken tension of a slow-moving train, the kind that seemed to accelerate only to shudder to a halt.  The pressure, usually a catalyst for her, felt like a lead weight in her stomach. Amelia adjusted the strap of her worn canvas tote bag, a familiar comfort amidst the overwhelming chaos of the retail behemoth.  She was a salesperson, a 'Relationship Manager' as the company insisted, and today, the relationships seemed less about fostering connection and more about navigating a minefield of unmet expectations.

Setting:

The sprawling warehouse complex of "Everything Under the Sun" occupied an entire city block.  Built in the early 2000s, its vast, open layout belied an almost forgotten, cavernous feel.  Stacks of boxes, painted in a rainbow of dull, industrial colours, dominated the space.  Individual sections were marked off by thin, metal partitions, each housing specific merchandise: gardening supplies, sporting goods, home décor, and countless other products.  Overhead conveyor belts, a relic of a bygone era of streamlined logistics, moved with a slow, rhythmic creak.  The atmosphere was oddly quiet, punctuated only by the rumble of the refrigeration units in the deeper parts of the building.  A faint, but pervasive, scent of old paper and sawdust hung heavy in the air, clinging to the concrete floors and the steel structures.
