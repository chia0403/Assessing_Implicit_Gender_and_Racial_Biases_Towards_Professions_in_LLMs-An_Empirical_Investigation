The biting wind, a razor-sharp northwester, whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled the oversized rig onto the narrow shoulder of Highway 87.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and grit, danced across the cracked earth, obscuring the already fading light.  The year was 2042, and the sun, a bruised plum in the bruised sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the parched landscape.  Elias, a seasoned trucker for the Consolidated Freight Lines, known throughout the sector as "Thorne's Thunder,"  had spent nearly 20 years navigating this brutal stretch of the Transcontinental, a route that had seen its best days long ago, a route now dotted with rusting ghost towns and silent, forgotten farms.  His rig, the "Ironclad," a modified 18-wheeler designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the frontier, groaned and creaked beneath the immense weight of its cargo:  a vital shipment of bioluminescent fungi, experimental strains vital to the struggling ecosystem efforts underway in the Emerald Vale. The temperature plummeted fast as dusk settled, chilling Elias to the bone. A shiver, a flicker of movement in the shadows, and he gripped the wheel, eyes scanning the horizon for anything out of place, anything dangerous. He needed to reach the border before nightfall, and then, his sanctuary: the flickering neon lights of the Dust Devil Diner.
