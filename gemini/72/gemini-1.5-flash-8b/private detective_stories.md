The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover" bar cast a sickly green glow on Amelia Hawthorne, Private Investigator.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, each drop a tiny percussionist in the symphony of the city's nocturnal lament.  The alley reeked of stale beer, damp earth, and something vaguely floral, like a wilted bouquet left to rot.  Amelia, a woman built like a bulldog with a sharp, observant nose and eyes that seemed to pierce the gloom, hunched deeper into her threadbare trench coat.  Her tailored tweed skirt and sensible shoes were the only remnants of her professionalism amidst the grime of the backstreets.  Tonight, she was investigating a missing person – or rather, a missing *something*:  a rare, iridescent hummingbird’s feather, prized by a collector rumored to be a local arms dealer.

**Setting:**  A gritty, rain-slicked alleyway in the underbelly of a sprawling, industrial city known for its shady dealings and even shadier characters.  The Lucky Clover, a dimly lit bar with a history more complex than its faded paint job, sits at the heart of this nocturnal labyrinth.  The air hung thick with the smells of cheap liquor, desperation, and hidden secrets.  The towering warehouses, their windows like vacant eyes staring out into the storm, lined the narrow streets, creating an atmosphere of unease and foreboding.
