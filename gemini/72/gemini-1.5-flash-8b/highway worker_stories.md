The grey November dawn bled across the desolate expanse of Interstate 80, painting the cracked asphalt in hues of bruised purple and faded grey.  Dust devils, whipped by a relentless wind that tasted of salt and cold, danced across the highway, swirling around the solitary figure of  Arthur "Art"  Pendleton.  Art, a highway maintenance worker for the Department of Transportation, was already half an hour into his pre-dawn patrol, the rhythmic thump of his boots on the metal grate of the roadside drainage ditch a lonely counterpoint to the symphony of the wind.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy and still, promising a day as unforgiving as the landscape.  His worn flannel shirt clung to his back, damp with the condensation of the morning chill, and his weathered hands, calloused and stained with a lifetime of tarmac and oil, gripped the handle of his pickaxe, its metal head cool and reassuring in his palm.  He was alone, as always, save for the constant presence of the highway itself, a ribbon of black that stretched into the horizon, seemingly swallowing all sound and feeling.
