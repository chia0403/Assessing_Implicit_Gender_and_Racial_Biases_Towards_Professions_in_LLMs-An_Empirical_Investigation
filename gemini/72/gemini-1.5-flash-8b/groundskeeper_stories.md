The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tugging at the collar of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's threadbare jacket.  Leaves, once vibrant hues of crimson and gold, now scattered like confetti across the pristine emerald.  Barty, his weathered hands calloused from years of tending to the estate's sprawling gardens, shivered, pulling his worn wool cap tighter.  The air, usually perfumed with the sweet scent of roses and honeysuckle, hung heavy with the pre-winter chill.  This was Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate of imposing grandeur, and Barty, the groundskeeper, its silent, unassuming custodian.  He knew the property better than anyone, its hidden pathways and secret nooks as familiar as the lines etched into his own hands.  And tonight, something felt different. Not wrong, but...charged.  An unnatural stillness hung in the air, a hush that contradicted the wind's relentless howl.  Heâ€™d been tending to the azaleas bordering the secluded rose garden when he noticed it.
