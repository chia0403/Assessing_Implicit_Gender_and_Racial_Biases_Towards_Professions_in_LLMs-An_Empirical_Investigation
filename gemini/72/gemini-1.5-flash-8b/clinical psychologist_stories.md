Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the chaotic thoughts swirling in her mind.  The rhythmic drumming was a familiar soundtrack to the anxieties of her patients, a soundtrack she was often tasked with deciphering.

Sunlight, fractured by the rain-streaked windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, while the worn leather armchair opposite her seemed to absorb the tension of the room.  A half-eaten bowl of granola, a testament to a hurried breakfast, sat on the cluttered desk beside a stack of diagnostic manuals and overflowing coffee mugs.  The air, thick with the scent of old paper and damp earth, hung heavy with unspoken anxieties.  It was a Tuesday, just another day in the life of a clinical psychologist battling the storm within.
