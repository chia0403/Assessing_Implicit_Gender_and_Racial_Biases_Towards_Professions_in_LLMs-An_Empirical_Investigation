The fluorescent hum of the Art Deco building, a symphony of perpetual twilight, was the only soundtrack to Elias Thorne's existence.  He polished the brass doorknobs of the gallery's main entrance, the faint scent of aged paint and something indefinably floral clinging to the air.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through stained-glass windows depicting mythical creatures, barely pierced the gloom of the vast, echoing hall.  Dust motes danced in the solitary beam, illuminated like tiny, ethereal insects. This was the "Grand Gallery of the Gilded Age," a monument to forgotten opulence, and Elias Thorne, its silent guardian and, more often than not, its sole occupant.  He was the janitor, the unsung hero of this hallowed, yet strangely desolate space, a realm of sculpted marble, priceless portraits, and the whispers of centuries past.
