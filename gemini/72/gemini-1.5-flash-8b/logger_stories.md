The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Silas Blackwood's face as he wrestled the rusted chains of the logging truck.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, coated everything â€“ the rough-hewn timbers stacked like fallen giants, the chipped paint of the dilapidated cabin perched precariously on the slope, even the breath hissing from Silas's chapped lips.  He was alone, as always, in this desolate corner of the Cascade Mountains, a place where the only sound more deafening than the roar of the chainsaw was the whisper of the pines groaning under the weight of centuries.  The year was 1928.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of woodsmoke that clung to Silas. He knew this place, this mountainside, better than the lines of his own calloused hands.  It was a place of both brutal beauty and profound loneliness, a place where the secrets of the forest whispered tales only the wind and the trees could understand.
