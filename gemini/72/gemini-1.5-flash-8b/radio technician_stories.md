The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio station hummed, a mournful counterpoint to the distant, rhythmic clang of the shipyard cranes.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed through the cavernous, dust-filled space.  Inside, huddled in a circle of flickering incandescent bulbs and the faint glow of his own workbench tools, sat Elias Thorne, Radio Technician.  His name, etched into the metal plaque of the work station, was almost lost in the shadows. The year was 1947, and the air hung thick with the scent of salt and decay.


The station, once a vibrant hub of communication during the war, was now a relic, its antennae rusted and broken, its transmitters silent.  Elias, however, held a flickering ember of hope, a tiny spark of purpose amongst the gloom.  He spent his days meticulously rebuilding the damaged equipment, painstakingly tracing faulty wires and soldering connections, each click of the soldering iron a measured beat in the symphony of silence. He knew the machinery held the key to a forgotten language, a forgotten past. A cryptic message, supposedly sent from a lost vessel, was the reason he was here.  His mission, though shrouded in mystery, was as clear as the reflection of the storm clouds on the metal walls around him. The faded Morse code, meticulously etched on a battered piece of cardboard, stared back at him, a silent challenge.
