The flickering fluorescent lights of the subterranean lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-click-click* of Dr. Elara Vance's fingers against the worn polymer casing of her micro-manipulator.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light piercing the gloom, highlighting the intricate network of wires, tubes, and shimmering crystals that sprawled across the workbench.

It was the heart of Project Chimera, Elara's obsession, and her impending nightmare.  The year was 2242. The lab, tucked deep beneath the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Kyoto, was a sanctuary of scientific endeavour, a quiet haven from the ever-present cacophony of the outside world.  But tonight, the silence was pregnant with a foreboding unease, a pressure that pressed against Elara's chest like a physical weight.
