The fluorescent lights of the "Super Saver Mart" hummed, a monotonous drone that seeped into Amelia Nightingale's bones.  Every Tuesday, this relentless hum felt like a personal affront.  The store, a sprawling concrete box situated in the heart of the forgotten industrial district of Newhaven, seemed to swallow the city's anxieties whole.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the chipped paint of the self-checkout kiosks and the perpetually sticky conveyor belts.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the dreariness within, a bleak canvas painted with the muted colours of impending winter.  Amelia, clad in a faded purple uniform that felt more like a shroud than clothing, scanned another can of beans.  The rhythmic *ping* of the barcode reader was the only sound accompanying the slow, agonizing drip of the fluorescent lights, and the gentle thrum of her own weary heart.
