The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she trudged across the frozen expanse of the Blackwood Manor grounds.  Snow, thick and undisturbed, crunched under her boots, each step echoing in the stillness of the early morning.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone looming against the bruised twilight sky, felt colder than the air itself.  It was a place of shadows and whispered secrets, a place Amelia, animal caretaker for the eccentric Lord Ashworth, had come to know intimately.  Her worn leather gloves, stained with countless smears of mud and animal feed, offered little protection from the relentless cold.

The setting was a sprawling, historical estate in the Scottish Highlands.  Blackwood Manor, with its towering turrets and crenellated walls, stood isolated on a high plateau overlooking a vast valley shrouded in mist.  The estate itself was vast and overgrown in parts, with ancient oak trees that stretched towards the sky like skeletal fingers.  Hidden courtyards and secret passages whispered of centuries past, while the air itself seemed to hold the echoes of forgotten voices and long-dead rituals.  Beyond the manor walls, the desolate landscape stretched out towards a brooding loch, its surface a mirror reflecting the leaden sky.  Amelia, however, was focused on the specific, enclosed enclosure of the manor's animal collection. She carried a heavy sack of nuts and seeds, the rhythmic thump of it against her side a calming counterpoint to the wind's howl.
