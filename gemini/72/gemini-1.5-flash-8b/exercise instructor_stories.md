The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the deserted park.  The leaves, once a vibrant tapestry of gold and crimson, were now scattered and lifeless, crunching underfoot like brittle glass.  A lone, skeletal oak, its branches clawing at a bruised, grey sky, stood sentinel over the frozen expanse of the playground.  This was Amelia's favourite spot, the hidden gem of her early morning circuit classes, the place where she coaxed strength from the very essence of the winter air. But today, the silence felt heavier than the usual crisp chill.  No laughter echoed from the swings, no rhythmic thump of exercise balls, no eager shouts of encouragement.  The park, usually a vibrant hub of activity, was a ghost town.  Amelia, however, was far from deterred.  Her routine was ingrained, a part of her being as essential as the morning sun.  Her heart, though, thrummed a little faster.  Something wasn't right.
