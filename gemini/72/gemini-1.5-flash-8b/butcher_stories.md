Barnaby "Blade" Blackwood, a man whose face was a roadmap of knife scars and weathered determination, surveyed his domain.  The shop, a cramped space crammed with the pungent aroma of freshly-slaughtered lamb and the sharp tang of spiced sausage, was his castle, his sanctuary, and his livelihood.  He wasn't just a butcher; he was a connoisseur of meat, a whisperer of the beast, a silent custodian of the finest cuts.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the rows of gleaming steel hooks that held the carcasses of various animals, each one a testament to Barnaby's meticulous work.  Dust motes danced in the scant light, illuminating the intricate patterns etched into the scarred oak counter, patterns that only Barnaby understood.  Outside, the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carts echoed on the cobblestone streets of the burgeoning port city of Port Veritas, a sound that always, somehow, spoke to Barnaby of the promise—and the peril—that awaited.
