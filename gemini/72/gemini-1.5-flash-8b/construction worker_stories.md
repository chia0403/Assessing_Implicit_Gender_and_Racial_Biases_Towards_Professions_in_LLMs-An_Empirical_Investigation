The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the construction site, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  Dust devils danced across the raw earth, swirling around the skeletal framework of the skyscraper, a monument to ambition and, frankly, a monument to the sheer insanity of the project.  Steel beams, like gigantic, skeletal fingers, clawed at the bruised, overcast sky.  Elias, a man weathered by sun and toil, felt the familiar tremor of pre-dawn cold run through him, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of distant jackhammers.  He tightened the knot of his bandana around his forehead, the coarse fabric a comforting weight against the bone-deep chill.  It was 4 AM on the third day of January, and the only sound louder than the wind was the drumming of his own heart against his ribs.  This was his life.  A life lived on the unforgiving precipice of progress.  This was his world.
