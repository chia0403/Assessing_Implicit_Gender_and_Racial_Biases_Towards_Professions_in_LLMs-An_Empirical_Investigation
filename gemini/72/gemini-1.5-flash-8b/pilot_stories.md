The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Hawthorne's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks as she strapped into the cockpit of the 'Ironclad'.

Milly traced the frost-bitten constellations etched across the icy window, a familiar pattern mirroring the complex systems that governed the Ironclad, the experimental aircraft that was her lifeblood, and her only connection to a world that was rapidly fading.  The year is 2247.
