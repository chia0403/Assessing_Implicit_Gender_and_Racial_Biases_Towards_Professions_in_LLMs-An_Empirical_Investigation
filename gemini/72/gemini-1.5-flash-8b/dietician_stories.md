The aroma of roasted vegetables, a delicate blend of rosemary and garlic, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of antiseptic that clung to the walls of the clinic.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, Registered Dietitian, adjusted her glasses, a slight frown etching itself on her usually serene face.  The sterile white of the examination room, usually a soothing balm to her eyes, felt jarring today, overwhelmed by the vibrant colors of the overflowing fruit basket on the reception desk.  A single, perfectly ripe mango, its skin shimmering like polished jade, sat precariously on the edge of the basket, seemingly mocking her frustration.  She knew, deep down, this was a lost cause.

**Setting:**  The sun-drenched clinic, nestled in the heart of a vibrant, yet struggling, urban community in the Pacific Northwest.  The building, while modern, was painted in calming shades of sage green and pale yellow, indicative of the holistic approach promoted by the practice.  Outside, the emerald-green foliage of towering evergreens offered a stark contrast to the grey, concrete canyons of the city that bordered the clinic.  This particular examination room, while designed with efficiency in mind, held a history of failed programs and emotional tolls, a feeling that seemed to be reflected in the worried expression of the young woman,  Anya Petrova, sitting across from her.
