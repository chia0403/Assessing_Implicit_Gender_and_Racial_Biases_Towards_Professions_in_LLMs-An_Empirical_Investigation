The flickering fluorescent lights of the back alley hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's solitary existence.  Rain, a relentless, pewter-colored curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron walls of the dilapidated building complex, mirroring the relentless drumming of Barty's thoughts.  He was a plumber, a master of pipes and plungers, of clogs and gurgles, a man whose life, like the labyrinthine pipes he so often navigated, was a complex series of twists and turns, more often than not ending in a frustratingly slow drip, drip, drip.

Barty, a man of slight build with a perpetually weary expression and hands perpetually stained a dull ochre, hunched over a leaking pipe that snaked beneath the crumbling brickwork.  The air hung heavy with the smell of mildew and something faintly metallic, a constant companion in these cramped, subterranean spaces.  He sighed, the sound lost in the cacophony of the storm.  This particular alley, a forgotten pocket of the city, was notorious for its cryptic problems.  Residents, mostly elderly and fiercely independent, possessed a baffling talent for turning simple plumbing mishaps into epic dramas worthy of a Greek tragedy, complete with accusations, loud shouts, and, occasionally, the dramatic slamming of doors.  This particular leak, Barty suspected, was more than just a leaky pipe. It was a symptom of something far deeper, something he wasn't sure he was equipped to diagnose.
