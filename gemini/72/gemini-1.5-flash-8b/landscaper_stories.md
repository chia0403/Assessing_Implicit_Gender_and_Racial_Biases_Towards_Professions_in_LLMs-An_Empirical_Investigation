The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum colour, bled across the overgrown rhododendrons surrounding the sprawling estate of Lord Ashworth.  Dust motes danced in the fading light, swirling around Amelia Blackwood, her brow furrowed in concentration.  A chipped trowel, held loosely in her calloused hand, scraped against the stubborn clay clinging to the roots of a struggling azalea.  The scent of damp earth and something subtly metallic, like old pennies, hung heavy in the air. This wasn't just any garden; it was a labyrinth of hidden pathways and forgotten corners, a place where history whispered in the rustling leaves.  Amelia, a landscaper with hands as sure as her instincts, felt the weight of expectation pressing down on her.  Lord Ashworth, a man whose face was as impenetrable as the ancient walls surrounding his manor, had entrusted her with a task more intricate than merely trimming hedges.


Setting:  The sprawling, historically significant estate of Lord Ashworth, nestled amidst the rolling hills of the English countryside.  The estate, a complex of stone walls and overgrown gardens, is steeped in whispers of secrets and long-forgotten lives.  The surrounding landscape, a mix of ancient woodlands and verdant meadows, provides a contrasting backdrop to the grand, yet decaying, magnificence of the estate.
