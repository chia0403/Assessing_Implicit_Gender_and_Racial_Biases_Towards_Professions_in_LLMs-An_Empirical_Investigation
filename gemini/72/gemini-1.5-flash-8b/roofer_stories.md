The grey Manchester sky, a perpetual drizzle clinging to the skeletal branches of the ancient plane trees lining the cobbled streets, mirrored the mood of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof he was perched precariously on, each drop a tiny, insistent hammer blow against his weary bones.  Barty Finch, 32, and a roofer of some renown (or, perhaps, infamy, depending on the perspective of the homeowner) was far from the bustling city centre, situated in a quiet, backstreet known more for its crumbling terraces than its trendy boutiques.  Below, the rhythmic clang of a nearby builder's hammer echoed the hollow ache in his own chest.  He'd been at this particular flat roof job for what felt like a lifetime, the endless expanse of slate tiles stretching into the overcast distance a monotonous, grey expanse. His fingers, calloused and cracked from years of grappling with lead flashing and rusty gutters, gripped the treacherous wooden planks.  The building, a three-storey Victorian brick monstrosity, stood stubbornly against the relentless onslaught of the elements, just like Barty himself.
