The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper against the jagged peaks of the Frostfang Mountains, whipped at Sergeant Elara Stonehand’s worn leather tunic.  She hunched deeper into the narrow crevice, her breath clouding in the frigid air.  The snow-covered pass, a treacherous ribbon of white snaking between towering granite walls, was her domain, her prison.  For three weeks, she’d patrolled this desolate stretch of the northern border, the silent sentinel guarding the fragile peace between the Kingdom of Aeridor and the savage tribes of the Frostfell.  The peace, she knew, was as fragile as the ice clinging to the mountainside.

The setting sun, a fiery disc sinking below the jagged horizon, painted the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced across the snow.  A lone, ancient fir, its branches laden with rime, stood sentinel against the storm, its gnarled silhouette stark against the deepening twilight.  The air, heavy with the scent of pine and impending winter, held the unspoken promise of danger, a chilling echo of the wild creatures that roamed the shadowed valleys beyond the pass.  Elara’s rifle, nestled against her back, was her only comfort, her only weapon against the encroaching darkness.
