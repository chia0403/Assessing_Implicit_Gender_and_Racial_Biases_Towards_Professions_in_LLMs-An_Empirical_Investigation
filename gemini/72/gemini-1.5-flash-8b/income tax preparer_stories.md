The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed, a relentless, white drone that mirrored the frantic energy of Amelia Hernandez.  Amelia, a meticulous income tax preparer with a perpetually tired smile and a binder overflowing with meticulously organized tax forms, stared at the latest iteration of Form 1040.  Across the small, crowded office, the rhythmic click-clack of a keyboard punctuated the cacophony of murmured conversations and the occasional frustrated sigh.  Today, April 15th, the air crackled with a palpable tension, a silent countdown to the deadline's midnight hammer blow.  Amelia, despite her years of experience, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach. This year's tax season felt different.  The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air.  

The office, a small, windowless room crammed into the back of a strip mall, was more a testament to practicality than comfort.  Three fluorescent lights fought a losing battle against the gloom, casting harsh shadows on the worn linoleum floor.  A chipped Formica desk separated Amelia from the rest of the cramped space, where other tax preparers hunched over their own mountains of paperwork.  Beyond the cramped office, the bustling, midday activity of the city swirled past the strip mall's parking lot, seemingly oblivious to the frantic efforts within.  The only reminder of the outside world was the insistent hum of traffic that seeped into the tiny office through the poorly insulated walls. This year, more than ever, Amelia longed for a quiet coffee shop, a comfortable chair, and a book.
