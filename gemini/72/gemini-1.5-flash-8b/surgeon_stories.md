The scent of antiseptic, normally a soothing balm, now hung heavy in the air, tinged with the metallic tang of despair.  Outside, the storm howled like a wounded beast.  It was the kind of night that whispered secrets to the lonely, and Elara, despite her outwardly composed exterior, felt the chill of those secrets seeping into her bones.
