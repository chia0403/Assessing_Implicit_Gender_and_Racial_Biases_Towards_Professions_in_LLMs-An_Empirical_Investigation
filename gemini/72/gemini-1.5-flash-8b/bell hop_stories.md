The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Magnolia Hotel's lobby.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the haze of cigarette smoke clinging to the air.  Barnaby "Barney" Butterfield, a bellhop with a perpetually worried frown etched into his face, wiped a stray coffee stain from the registration desk with a practiced, almost frantic, motion.  The Grand Magnolia, once a jewel of the city's burgeoning tourism scene, now felt more like a faded photograph, its grandeur slowly succumbing to the relentless march of time and the city's evolving tastes.  Each creak of the aging wood floors, each distant wail of a siren from the city streets, amplified the feeling of quiet desperation that clung to Barney like a damp shroud.  He was twenty-five, but looked ten years older, weighed down by the unspoken anxieties of a life seemingly stalled in the lobby of a hotel that had seen better days.  The polished brass of the door handles felt colder than the winter air outside as he stared at the arriving guests, each potential solution to the hotelâ€™s dwindling business, or so he wished, carrying their burdens into the grand but fading hotel.
