The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones.  A single streetlamp sputtered, its bulb a fractured eye staring out at the downpour, mirroring the weary expression on Elara Nightingale's face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the bar, a relentless percussion that drowned out the muted jazz wafting from a cracked vinyl record player nestled in a corner. Elara, a bartender with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a voice like polished granite, wiped down the sticky mahogany bar, the scent of stale beer and cheap whiskey clinging to the air like a shroud.  The Rusty Mug, a ramshackle haven tucked between a crumbling market building and a dilapidated theatre, was her refuge, her kingdom, and her prison.  Tonight, however, the prison felt particularly oppressive.
