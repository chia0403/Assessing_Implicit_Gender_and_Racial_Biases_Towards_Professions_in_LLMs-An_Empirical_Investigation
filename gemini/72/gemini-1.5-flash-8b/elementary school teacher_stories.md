The chipped paint on the classroom walls, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh with the humidity.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a swirling vortex of crayon shavings and discarded construction paper that perpetually clung to the air.  This was Ms. Amelia Peabody's kingdom, a chaotic, colourful kingdom she'd ruled over for six years at Oakhaven Elementary.  The air buzzed with the low hum of whispered conversations, the rhythmic thump of tiny feet shuffling across the polished wooden floor, and the occasional, almost imperceptible, whimper of a child struggling with a complex math problem.  Amelia, a woman whose neatly-combed auburn hair often seemed to defy the classroom's general disarray, smoothed down the frayed edge of her worn-out cardigan, a small smile playing on her lips.  It was Tuesday, and that meant the second-grade class had a new challenge:  building a miniature model of the solar system.
