The scent of pine needles and damp earth clung to the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Anya Petrova as she stepped out of her battered, but beloved, Jeep Wrangler.  The chirping of unseen birds, punctuated by the distant rumble of a logging truck, filled the crisp autumn morning air.  Sunlight, filtered through the canopy of the ancient redwood forest, painted the forest floor in dappled gold and shadow.  This was her sanctuary, the secluded practice nestled within the whispering groves of the Redwood National and State Parks.  Dr. Anya Petrova, a chiropractor with a reputation for calming nerves and coaxing pain away, knew this wasn't just a job; it was a calling.  Her small, one-room clinic, nestled amongst the colossal trees, was a testament to her belief in the body's innate healing power.  Rough-hewn wooden beams supported a low-slung, thatched roof, the walls lined with shelves laden with jars of essential oils and handmade remedies.  Sunlight streamed through a single, tall window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air, casting a warm glow on the worn leather couch.  Today, a new patient waited.
