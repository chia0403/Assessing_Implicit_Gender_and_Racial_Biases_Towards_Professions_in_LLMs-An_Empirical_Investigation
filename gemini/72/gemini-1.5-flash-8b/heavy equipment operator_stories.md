This desolate landscape, her usual domain of controlled power and precision, suddenly felt menacing, alive with unspoken anxieties.  A lone hawk circled overhead, its shadow a fleeting, silent observer.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling, hung heavy in the vast, unforgiving space.
