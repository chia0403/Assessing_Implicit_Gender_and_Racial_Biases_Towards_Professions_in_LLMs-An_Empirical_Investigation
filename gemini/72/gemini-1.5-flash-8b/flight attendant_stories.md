The flickering neon sign of the "Sunrise Express" cast an eerie, orange glow across Amelia Cavendish's face as she surveyed the empty cabin.  The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, a scent that clung to the recycled air like a phantom.  She adjusted the frayed hem of her uniform, a deep sapphire blue that seemed to absorb the dim light.  Outside, the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Veridia shimmered beneath a sky choked with smog, an oppressive blanket of grey and orange.

Amelia, a flight attendant with the Sunrise Express, was alone on board the Zephyr 747, an overnight flight to the remote island city-state of Aethelgard.  Normally the cabin would buzz with the pre-flight chatter of passengers, the rhythmic click-clack of rolling suitcases, the familiar symphony of a departing flight. Tonight, though, only the hushed hum of the air conditioning and the distant, rhythmic thrum of the engines filled the silence.  This was her second solo journey on the Zephyr 747, a route known for its unexplained incidents, whispers of the "island curse" that plagued the isolated destination.  The unnerving stillness pressed down on her, a weight more profound than the jet's empty seats.
