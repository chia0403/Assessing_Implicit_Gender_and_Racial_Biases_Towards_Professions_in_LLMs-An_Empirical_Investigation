The biting wind, a relentless grey whip, clawed at the exposed skin of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch as he surveyed his dwindling barley fields.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of dried earth, danced across the cracked furrows, mocking the meager yield.  Autumn had arrived in the valley of the Whispering Pines, not with a gentle rustle of leaves, but with a bone-deep chill and the suffocating silence of impending drought.  Barty, weathered and gaunt, his face a roadmap of sun-etched wrinkles, felt the familiar ache of despair tighten in his chest.  He was a farmer, a Finch through and through, tied to the land, but lately the land felt more like a cruel mistress, demanding more than she offered.  His hands, gnarled from years of toil, rested on the worn wooden handle of his hoe, the metal cold against the thin fabric of his worn jacket.  The year had been a disaster;  three consecutive failed harvests had stripped the valley of its lifeblood, leaving only barren earth and a gnawing hunger in the hearts of the villagers.
