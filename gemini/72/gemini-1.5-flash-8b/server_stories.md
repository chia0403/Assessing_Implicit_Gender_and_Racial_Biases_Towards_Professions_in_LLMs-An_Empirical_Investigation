The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Milly"  Montgomery's face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the relentless rhythm of her day.  Inside, the dimly lit tavern smelled of stale beer, burnt coffee, and something vaguely floral â€“ probably desperation.  Tonight, the only patrons were a trio of burly lumberjacks, their faces ruddy from the night's work and the inevitable copious amounts of ale consumed, and a lone, elderly woman hunched over a chipped mug, her eyes tracing the swirling patterns of the steam.  Milly, her uniform a faded crimson that had seen better days, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer among the clinking glasses and low, rumbling conversations.  The Rusty Mug was her stage, and she was tonight's lead performer.
