The fluorescent hum of Dr. Amelia Kensingtonâ€™s dental office buzzed, a constant, low thrumming counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her instruments.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the ornate stained-glass window depicting a snarling griffin, sliced through the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating a small, almost claustrophobic space.  Rows of polished dental chairs, each bearing the faint, lingering scent of antiseptic, lined the walls, whispering stories of countless conversations, whispered anxieties, and the quiet, often painful, triumphs of oral health.  Amelia, a woman whose sharp features seemed softened by the gentle, almost ethereal glow emanating from the overhead lamps, meticulously polished a porcelain crown, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The city of Oakhaven, a sprawling metropolis nestled between rolling hills and a jagged coastline, thrummed just beyond the paneled walls of her practice, a distant echo of the relentless energy she felt pressing down on her.
