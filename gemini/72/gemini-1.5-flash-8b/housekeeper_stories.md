The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige from years of lukewarm suds and forgotten teaspoons, reflected the flickering gaslight.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light slicing through the gloom of the drawing-room, illuminating a single, solitary figure:  Eloise Featherstone, housekeeper at the grand estate of Blackwood Manor.  Her starched cotton apron, a muted shade of dove grey, clung to her slightly, a testament to the humid July evening.  The scent of lavender, almost overwhelming, hung heavy in the air, a perfume carefully chosen and maintained by the absent Lady Blackwood.

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling edifice of grey stone, clung to the hillside like a brooding sentinel.  Ivy, thick and emerald-green, clawed at the stonework, its tendrils reaching out to caress the weathered brick.  The creaking of the ancient timbers, a constant, low hum, echoed through the vast emptiness of the house.  Moonlight, fractured by the dense canopy of trees, painted the grounds in an ethereal, silver hue.  A chill wind whistled through the gaps in the shutters, rustling the velvet curtains and whispering secrets to the antique furniture within.  The only sound other than the wind and the distant hoot of an owl was the rhythmic squeak of Eloise's worn boots as she navigated the winding, shadowy corridors. The house held its breath, awaiting the return of its mistress.
