Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thumping in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's chest.  The air, thick with the scent of damp concrete and stale coffee, hung heavy in the small, sparsely furnished room.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the mounting frustration.  Amy, a probation officer for the 17th Judicial District, stared at the file folder in her hand, its cover worn smooth from countless hours of handling similar cases.  Inside, the details of Leo Vance's life – a life she was tasked with guiding, but felt increasingly powerless to shape – sprawled out like a tangled skein of frayed threads.  The setting was the grimy, overlooked neighborhood of Oakhaven, a place where hope seemed as elusive as a summer's rain shower after a prolonged drought.  Poverty and despair hung in the air as thick as the humid August air, leaving Amy feeling increasingly out of her depth and desperate to find a thread to pull on, any thread.
