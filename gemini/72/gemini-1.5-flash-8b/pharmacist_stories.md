The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" cast long, eerie shadows across the shelves crammed with bottles, jars, and vials.  Amelia Beatrice Blackwood, a pharmacist with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and hands surprisingly gentle despite the relentless demands of her profession, meticulously checked the expiration date on a bottle of cough syrup.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and antiseptic, was oddly still, almost oppressive.  Outside, the city of Veridia hummed with a restless energy, a constant thrum of activity that felt distant, almost muffled, within the hushed confines of the shop.  

Veridia, a city built on the skeletal remains of a forgotten empire, was famed for its peculiar weather patterns.  Today, an unnatural stillness hung in the air, a stillness that amplified the faint, rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome counting down the seconds to something unknown.  The antique clock was a peculiar addition to the otherwise modern pharmacy, a relic seemingly misplaced yet somehow perfectly in tune with the unsettling calm that had descended upon the shop.
