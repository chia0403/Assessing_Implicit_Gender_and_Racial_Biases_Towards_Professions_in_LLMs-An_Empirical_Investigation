The chipped paint of the Victorian-era building, a faded lavender hue, seemed to sigh with the humid August air.  Rain lashed against the ornate windows of the Willowbrook Rehabilitation Centre, a constant, insistent drumming that echoed the restless energy within Amelia Blackwood, Occupational Therapist.  Amelia, with her perpetually rumpled linen shirt and perpetually hopeful expression, stared out at the storm-wracked landscape.  The grey sky mirrored the anxieties swirling in her stomach.  She was only a few weeks into her new position at Willowbrook, and already the weight of the place, of its melancholic history and the silent suffering of its residents, felt like a physical burden.  The rhythmic patter of the rain was a soundtrack to her burgeoning doubts.

Willowbrook was a sprawling institution, a testament to a bygone era of quiet dignity and unyielding dedication to care.  Grand hallways, echoing with the ghostly whispers of long-gone patients and the muffled sounds of therapy sessions, led to rooms that held the tangible residue of lives lived.  Sunlight, often a rare visitor, struggled to pierce the dense foliage of the overgrown garden surrounding the building.  A perpetual, damp chill clung to the air, a tangible presence that permeated the very fabric of the place.  The scent of antiseptic and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a constant, subtle reminder of the fragile balance between life and the relentless march of time.
