The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, low thrumming that vibrated through Amelia Cartwright's bones.  Rows of humming metal boxes, stacked high like silent, metallic skyscrapers, stretched into the gloom, their blinking lights painting erratic patterns on the walls.  Dust motes, illuminated by the cold glare, danced in the air, swirling around her as she navigated the labyrinthine pathways.  This was the heart of "Project Chimera," the sprawling, top-secret network designed to connect every facet of the world’s communication systems.  Amelia, a systems analyst with sharp, inquisitive eyes and a penchant for meticulously organized notebooks, was responsible for the intricate web of data flow.  Tonight, though, the thrum was different.  A discordant, almost rhythmic pulse was interwoven with the usual hum, a subtle anomaly that had been creeping into the system’s logs over the past few days.  It was faint, nearly imperceptible, but Amelia sensed it. Something wasn't right.  This wasn’t just a glitch.  This was a whisper of something...else.
