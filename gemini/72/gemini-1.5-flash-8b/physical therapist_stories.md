The chipped porcelain sink of the cramped bathroom hummed with the faint, almost imperceptible, thrum of the city.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated building, a relentless percussion that mirrored the insistent throbbing in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s temple.  Elara, a physical therapist with the kind of weary grace that only comes from years spent coaxing broken bodies back into motion, stared at her reflection.  The once vibrant auburn hair was now streaked with greying, a testament to late nights spent in the sterile, clinical environment of the Rehabilitation Center, and the early mornings spent battling the city's relentless concrete jungle to get there.  The city, a monstrous beast whose hunger for human energy she now felt mirroring in her own depleted reserves.

The setting:  A dilapidated, multi-tenant building in the heart of the perpetually rainy city of Aethelgard.  Its mottled brick walls, stained with grime and patched with faded paint, seemed to absorb the gloominess of the overcast skies.  Rain-slicked alleyways snaked between the buildings, echoing with the muffled sounds of a city struggling to breathe.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and exhaust fumes, clung to Elara like a second skin.  The Rehabilitation Center, a stark, utilitarian structure just a few blocks away, was a stark contrast to this grimy urban landscape.  Yet, it held a profound, if unspoken, connection to her. It was where Elara had found her calling, where she had witnessed the human spirit's remarkable ability to heal and to persevere.  But tonight, even the steady rhythm of the city's heartbeat felt out of sync with Elara's own.
