The scent of freshly cut hair, a potent mix of lavender shampoo and sweat-soaked anxieties, hung thick in the air of "The Clipper's Crown."  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windows of the tiny barbershop, illuminating the chipped paint and faded posters advertising vintage razors.  This was the haven, the sanctuary, of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a barber with hands as steady as granite and a tongue sharper than any straight razor.  Barty, a man weathered by time and countless trims, found solace in the rhythmic snip-snip of his clippers and the quiet murmur of his clientele.  Today, however, the usual hum of conversation was absent, replaced by a heavy, unspoken tension.  Outside, the city thrummed with its usual cacophony of honking taxis and the distant rumble of the train tracks.  But inside, The Clipper's Crown felt strangely still, like the wind had forgotten to blow.
