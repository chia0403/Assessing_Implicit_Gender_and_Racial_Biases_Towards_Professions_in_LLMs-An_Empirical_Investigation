The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull rose from years of spilled nail polish, reflected Elara Nightingale’s face.  Her eyes, usually alight with the vibrant hues she coaxed onto her clients’ fingertips, were shadowed, the colour of a stormy sea.  A single, perfect crimson droplet clung to her cheek, a stark contrast to the smudged, bruised lilac adorning the chipped porcelain of the counter.  Elara sighed, the sound a low rumble echoing in the tiny, cluttered salon.  "Another one," she muttered, staring at the tangled ball of crimson thread that, as always, remained stubbornly knotted within the heart of her latest creation.

The salon, “The Polished Petal,” was tucked away on a cobbled side street of the bustling, rain-slicked city of Aethelgard.  Narrow, twisting alleyways lined the route, their rough stone walls a kaleidoscope of grays and greens.  Damp brick buildings, their facades worn smooth by the centuries, huddled close, casting long, dramatic shadows that danced and stretched with the city's restless pulse.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and nail polish; a comforting, yet oddly pungent, aroma that Elara had grown accustomed to, even loved, over the years.  A few dusty, antique mirrors reflected the pale light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating swirling patterns of dust motes that drifted in the afternoon gloom.  The rhythmic hum of a nearby streetcar was the only other sound, a constant thrumming pulse that seemed to both soothe and chafe the delicate nerves in Elara’s body.
