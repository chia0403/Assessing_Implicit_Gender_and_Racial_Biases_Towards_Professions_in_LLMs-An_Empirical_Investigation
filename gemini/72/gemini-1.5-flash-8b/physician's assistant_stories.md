The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless, white noise that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood’s bones.  The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a suffocating counterpoint to the chaotic rush of panicked voices and the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors.  Amelia, Physician's Assistant, adjusted her nametag, the polished steel cool against her palm.  The room, a swirling vortex of trauma and urgency, was her office for the night.  Outside the clatter of ambulances and the sirens wailing in the distance formed a ceaseless soundtrack to the city’s relentless struggle for survival.  Amelia knew this song well.

This particular night was particularly brutal.  The city, usually a cacophony of vibrant life, felt a stark, echoing void in its heart tonight, punctuated by the frantic rhythm of desperate pleas for help.  Broken bodies, overwhelmed systems, and a city bruised and battered reflected in Amelia’s tired eyes. Tonight, a grim dance of adrenaline and exhaustion was about to begin.
