The vast, manicured lawns, once vibrant emerald, now wore the muted hues of late autumn, stretching out from the imposing stone façade of the manor like a faded tapestry. Athelney, a brooding gothic masterpiece perched on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, had seen better days, just like Elias himself. The salt air, relentless and unforgiving, gnawed at the stonework and seeped into the very bones of the house, just as it had seeped into Elias’s, leaving him with a permanent ache in his joints.
