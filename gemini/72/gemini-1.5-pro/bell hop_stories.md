The brass fixtures of the Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered under the weight of a thousand tiny gaslights, casting an amber glow across the lobby’s marble floor.  Rain lashed against the tall arched windows, a rhythmic counterpoint to the tinkling of a distant piano.  It was a night for secrets and hushed conversations, a night tailor-made for the clandestine comings and goings that Archibald Finch, the hotel's most junior bellhop, had come to expect.  Archie, as he preferred, stood tucked away in an alcove beside a towering potted fern, his pillbox hat perched precariously on his head, idly polishing the brass buttons of his uniform. The Grand Majestic, a monument to Gilded Age opulence perched on the edge of the churning Atlantic in the fictional town of Port Blossom, Maine, was a world unto itself.  Tonight, however, the air crackled with an unusual tension, a subtle shift in the usual symphony of rustling silks and murmured greetings.  Archie could feel it in the stiff set of the arriving guests’ shoulders, in the hurried whispers of the staff, and in the way the hotel’s resident Persian cat, Mr. Fluffernutter, kept darting nervous glances at the ornate grandfather clock in the corner. Something was brewing.
