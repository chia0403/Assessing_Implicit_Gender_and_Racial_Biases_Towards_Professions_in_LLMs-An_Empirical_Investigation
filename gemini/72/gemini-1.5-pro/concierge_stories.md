The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered, a kaleidoscope of polished marble, glittering chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of affluent guests. Rain lashed against the tall windows overlooking the Place Vendôme in Paris, turning the cobblestones into a reflective mosaic.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows on the plush velvet furniture.  Behind the imposing mahogany concierge desk,  Geneviève Dubois, impeccably dressed in her charcoal grey uniform with a silver nametag pinned neatly to her lapel, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. It was the beginning of December, and the air, thick with the scent of pine needles and expensive perfume, hummed with the anticipation of the holidays. Genevieve, however, sensed a different kind of anticipation, a subtle tension beneath the surface of festive cheer.  A single, anonymous envelope lay on her desk, its stark white a jarring contrast against the dark wood. It was addressed simply: "To the Concierge."
