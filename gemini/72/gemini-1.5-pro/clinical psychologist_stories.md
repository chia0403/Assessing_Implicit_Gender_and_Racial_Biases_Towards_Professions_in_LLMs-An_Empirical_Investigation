Rain lashed against the gothic arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her latest patient.  The room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic district of Ashwood, Massachusetts, usually exuded a calming atmosphere.  Persian rugs softened the polished oak floors, a crackling fireplace fought back the autumn chill, and shelves overflowing with well-worn books hinted at a sanctuary of knowledge and understanding.  But tonight, the flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to amplify the tension in the air, catching the glint of unshed tears in young Mr. Henderson's eyes.  Eleanor, her own reflection a pale ghost in the rain-streaked glass, steepled her fingers and waited patiently, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hallway and the relentless drumming of the storm.
