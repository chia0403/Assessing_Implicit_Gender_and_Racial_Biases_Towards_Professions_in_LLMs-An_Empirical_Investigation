The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the sycamore trees lining Ashworth Avenue, sending dried leaves swirling like dervishes around Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s worn work boots.  Her breath puffed out in frosty plumes as she surveyed the sprawling, neglected gardens of the Weatherby estate.  Wrought iron gates, rusted with the patina of age and neglect, guarded the entrance, framing the dilapidated mansion looming like a gothic behemoth against the bruised twilight sky.  Mia shivered, pulling her threadbare fleece tighter around her.  This was her biggest job yet.  Restoring the Weatherby gardens to their former glory. A daunting task, but one she was determined to conquer.  The faint scent of decay mingled with the earthy aroma of damp soil, a peculiar perfume that always invigorated Mia. This was her element.  This was where she thrived.
