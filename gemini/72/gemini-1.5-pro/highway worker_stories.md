The biting November wind whipped across the desolate stretch of I-80, carrying the faint scent of diesel and dust.  A tumbleweed, brittle and brown, skittered across the asphalt, pausing momentarily at the steel-toed boots of Elias Vance.  Elias, his weathered face framed by a thick, grey beard, adjusted his orange hard hat and surveyed the scene with a sigh.  The flashing arrow board screamed its warning to oncoming traffic, but out here, in the vast emptiness of the Wyoming high desert,  it felt more like a lonely beacon than a safety precaution.  A broken-down semi, its trailer listing precariously, blocked the right lane, its driver pacing nervously nearby.  This was Elias’s office: the endless ribbon of highway stretching to the horizon, where the sky bled into the ochre earth.  He’d seen it all in his thirty years with the Wyoming Department of Transportation – blizzards that swallowed the road whole, scorching summer days that melted the tar, and enough fender benders to fill a scrapyard. But today, a strange unease prickled at him, a feeling that this particular call-out was different.  The air hung heavy, charged with an almost electric tension, and the silence, broken only by the whine of the wind, felt oppressive.
