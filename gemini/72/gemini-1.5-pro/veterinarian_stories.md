The biting November wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's dark hair across his face as he trudged across the frozen mud of the farmyard.  The air, thick with the smells of manure and woodsmoke, stung his lungs, but Elias barely registered it. He'd spent most of his thirty-two years in this valley, nestled between the brooding peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains of western Montana, and was well accustomed to the harsh beauty of the place. The sky, a vast expanse of bruised purple, threatened snow.  Around him, the ramshackle buildings of the Peterson ranch huddled together like frightened sheep, their paint peeling and roofs sagging under the weight of past winters.  The call had come in just as the first sliver of dawn had cracked the horizon: a prized mare, down and unresponsive. Elias knew the mare, a spirited Appaloosa named Whisper, and a knot of dread tightened in his gut.  He hoped he wasn't too late.
