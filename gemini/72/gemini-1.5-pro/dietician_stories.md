The insistent California sun, already high and hot at 8:00 am, beat down on the lemon tree outside Amelia Reyes's office window. Its branches, laden with almost ripe fruit, scratched lightly against the glass, a gentle counterpoint to the insistent chirping of a mockingbird. Inside, the air conditioning hummed a low, steady song, battling the encroaching heat. Amelia Reyes, MS, RD, registered dietician and owner of "Nourish," sat at her polished wooden desk, reviewing the nutritional intake of a new client, a professional cyclist with an alarming addiction to energy gels.  Her Santa Barbara office, nestled between a bustling yoga studio and an organic grocer, reflected her philosophy: clean lines, natural light, and an overall sense of calm productivity.  A stack of cookbooks rested precariously on the corner, threatening to topple onto a vase filled with sunflowers, their faces turned towards the hopeful promise of the day.  But Amelia felt a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. Something about the cyclist’s log felt…off. More than just the over-reliance on processed sugars. It was a feeling she’d learned to trust over her years of practice, a subtle dissonance that hinted at something hidden beneath the surface.
