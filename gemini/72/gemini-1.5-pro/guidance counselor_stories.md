The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the frantic chirping of unseen crickets lodged somewhere in the walls of Northwood High.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window overlooking the student parking lot, turning the asphalt into a shimmering, oil-slicked mirror. October in the Oregon Cascades meant perpetual damp, a chill that seeped into the bones and settled there like a stubborn guest.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm tea against her teeth, the faint scent of chamomile doing little to soothe the gnawing unease in her stomach.  This was the third student this week to disappear, and unlike the usual teenage dramas of runaway romances and impulsive road trips, something about these absences feltâ€¦ different.  Colder.
