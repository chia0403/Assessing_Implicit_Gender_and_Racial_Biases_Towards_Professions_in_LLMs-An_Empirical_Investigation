The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Brilliance" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *snip-snip-snip* emanating from within.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the deserted main street of Willow Creek, Oregon.  Inside, amidst the warm, comforting scent of coconut shampoo and the faint hum of a vintage hairdryer, Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, sculpted a precise fade into the thick, dark hair of his client. Willow Creek wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and most of its residents preferred practicality over high fashion, but Elias approached each haircut as a work of art.  He believed everyone deserved to feel their best, even in a town where the most exciting event of the week was the arrival of the bookmobile.
