The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of overripe bananas and playground sand.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty leaves of the ancient oak tree in the center of the Little Wonders Daycare playground, dappled the worn astroturf.  Amelia "Millie" Grace Hawthorne crouched beside four-year-old Leo, who was meticulously constructing a fortress of twigs and leaves.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves overhead, momentarily distracting Millie from Leo's explanation of the fortress's elaborate defense system against imaginary dragons.  It was a typical Tuesday afternoon at Little Wonders, nestled in the heart of the bustling, yet strangely serene, Willow Creek neighborhood.  The air vibrated with the happy shrieks of children, the rhythmic thump-thump of a skipping rope, and the faint melody of a lullaby drifting from the infant room.  Millie, despite the ever-present chaos, felt a sense of calm settle over her.  This was where she belonged, surrounded by the boundless energy and unbridled joy of the children she cared for.  But the peace wouldn't last.  A glint of metal caught her eye in the shadowed corner under the oak tree, something that most definitely didn't belong in a daycare playground.
