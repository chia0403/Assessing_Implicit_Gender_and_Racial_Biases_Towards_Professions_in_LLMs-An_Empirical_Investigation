The wind, a biting, relentless force straight off the Rockies, whipped at Amelia Grace Holloway's chapped lips as she surveyed the snow-dusted expanse of the Holloway Ranch.  January in Montana was a beast, a test of endurance for both man and beast, and this year, the beast was particularly ferocious.  The ranch, nestled in a valley carved by the icy Clearwater River, was a patchwork of frozen fields and skeletal trees, the only splashes of color coming from the rust-red barn and the smoke curling from the chimney of the weathered ranch house. Amelia, her breath clouding the air, pulled her thick wool coat tighter around her, the worn leather of her gloves creaking as she adjusted her grip on the reins of her sturdy mare, Bess.  The distant howl of a coyote echoed through the valley, a lonely, mournful sound that seemed to perfectly capture the desolate beauty of the landscape. This was her life, her legacy, a thousand acres of hard-earned earth and sky that had belonged to Holloways for generations, and she wouldn’t trade it for anything, not even a day without the biting Montana wind.  But something was different this year, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of the ranch, a tension in the air as thick as the falling snow.  Amelia couldn’t put her finger on it, but she knew, deep in her bones, that this winter held more than just the usual hardships.
