The sugary scent of almond paste hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling outside the bakery window.  Inside "The Gilded Lily," amidst a flurry of edible glitter and the rhythmic whir of a stand mixer, Eloise Aurelia Bellweather, her auburn braid wound tight around her head, meticulously piped a cascade of buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake. The bakery, nestled in the heart of the quaint, seaside village of Port Blossom, Maine, was her sanctuary, a world of spun sugar dreams and edible artistry.  This particular cake, a towering confection of vanilla bean sponge and raspberry Chambord filling, was destined for the town mayor's daughter's wedding, a high-profile affair that Eloise had poured her heart and soul into. Little did she know, the delivery of this cake would lead her into a far more complicated creation than any she'd ever attempted in the kitchen.
