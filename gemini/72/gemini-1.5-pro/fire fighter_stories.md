The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she perched precariously on the edge of Mrs. Henderson's gabled roof. Below, the sleepy town of Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, was shrouded in a pre-dawn gloom.  The only illumination came from the flickering orange glow emanating from the attic window of the two-story Victorian and the flashing blue and red lights of the Oakhaven Fire Department's Engine 1, parked haphazardly on the frost-covered lawn.  Pine needles, crisp and brittle under the weight of the early winter, crunched beneath Mia's boots. Smoke, thick and grey, curled around her, carrying the acrid scent of burning cedar.  This wasn't the usual chimney fire call they got this time of year. This was something different. Something much worse.
