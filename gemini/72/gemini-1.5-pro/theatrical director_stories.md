The faded velvet curtains of the Rialto Theatre whispered against the draft, a mournful sigh echoing the state of Amelia Thorne’s career.  Dust motes danced in the single work light illuminating the center of the stage, where a chipped plaster cherub clung precariously to a crumbling column – a remnant of the Rialto’s more glorious, pre-war days.  Outside, the November wind howled down Main Street in Harmony Springs, Ohio, a town whose name felt increasingly ironic to Amelia.  She huddled deeper into her threadbare coat, the script of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" clutched in her gloved hands like a lifeline.  This production, a desperate attempt to revive both the Rialto and her reputation, was opening in three weeks, and right now, it felt less like a dream and more like a looming catastrophe. The cast, a motley collection of enthusiastic amateurs and has-been professionals, were proving more challenging than a flock of particularly stubborn pigeons.  And the theatre itself, once the jewel of Harmony Springs, was now a dilapidated testament to forgotten dreams, its grandeur obscured by layers of neglect.  Amelia exhaled, her breath fogging in the cold air.  This had to work.  It just had to.
