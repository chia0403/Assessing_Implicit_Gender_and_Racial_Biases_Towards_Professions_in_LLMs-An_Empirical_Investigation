The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Clover Diner cast an anemic green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleaker Street.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” Reyes, a probation officer with the 14th Precinct, stirred a lukewarm cup of coffee, the bitter taste mirroring the dreariness of the November night. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head – a headache she’d been nursing since her 6 a.m. shift began. Amy’s worn leather satchel sat beside her, overflowing with case files, each one a testament to the broken lives she tried, often in vain, to piece back together. Tonight, however, one file in particular weighed heavily on her mind: the case of Marcus "The Hammer" Hamilton, a repeat offender with a penchant for violence and a disturbingly casual disregard for the law. He was due to check in two hours ago.  The diner's bell chimed, announcing a new arrival, and Amy instinctively reached for her pepper spray, a nervous habit formed over five years navigating the underbelly of the city.
