The biting wind whipped across the obsidian ramparts of Castle Drakon, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of snow.  Flakes, large and lazy, drifted down, clinging to the crenellations and dusting the shoulders of Elias Thorne, Captain of the Night Guard.  He leaned against the cold stone, his breath clouding the air before him.  Elias, a man built like an oak, with weathered skin and eyes the colour of a winter sky, surveyed the vast expanse of the Whisperwood that stretched out below.  The forest, cloaked in a preternatural stillness, seemed to hold its breath, waiting. The only sound was the rhythmic crunch of Elias's boots as he paced his section of the wall, the sixth night of his seven-day rotation.  Castle Drakon, perched atop the treacherous peak known as the Dragon's Tooth, had stood sentinel for centuries, a bulwark against the shadowed lands beyond the Whisperwood.  Tonight, however, a different kind of chill permeated the air, a disquiet that settled deep in Elias's bones.
