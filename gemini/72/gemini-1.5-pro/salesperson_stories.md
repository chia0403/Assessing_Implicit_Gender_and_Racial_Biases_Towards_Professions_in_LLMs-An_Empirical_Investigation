The fluorescent lights of the Discount Dreams mattress warehouse hummed a monotonous C sharp, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's existential dread. Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the rows of unsold gazebos and discounted patio furniture.  Amelia, full name Amelia Isabella Reyes, adjusted the itchy polyester of her Discount Dreams uniform, a royal blue polo shirt two sizes too big.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and the only other person in the cavernous warehouse was Dale, the perpetually-dozing security guard slumped in his chair by the front entrance.  The air hung thick with the scent of new foam and Amelia's fading optimism.  She'd been promised the world when she took this job â€“ commissions, bonuses, the chance to climb the ladder to regional sales manager. Six months in, she was still hawking "closeout specials" to the occasional lost tourist and struggling to make rent on her tiny studio apartment. This, she thought, staring out at the desolate landscape, was definitely not the dream.
