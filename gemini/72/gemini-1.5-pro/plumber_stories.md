The rusty wrench slipped in Elias Finch's grease-stained hand, sending a bolt clattering into the shadowy depths of the crawl space beneath Mrs. Gable's pre-war Victorian.  Dust motes, disturbed by the sudden movement, danced in the single beam of Elias's headlamp, illuminating a cobweb thicker than a fisherman's net.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling, that clung to the back of Elias's throat. Port Blossom, Oregon, wasn't known for its dry basements, especially not in the older part of town, where the houses clung precariously to the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Pacific. But this dampness, this smell...it was different.  Elias shifted his weight on the damp earth, the beam of his headlamp catching a glint of something unnatural amidst the tangle of pipes and rusted detritus.
