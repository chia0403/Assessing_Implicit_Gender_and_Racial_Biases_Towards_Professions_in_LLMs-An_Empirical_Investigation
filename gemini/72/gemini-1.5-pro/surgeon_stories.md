The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the gothic spires looming against the bruised pre-dawn sky of Edinburgh.  A thin scrim of sleet coated the ancient stone, making the footing treacherous.  Inside, the warm glow spilling from the tall, arched windows promised refuge from the unforgiving Scottish winter, but Elias felt no warmth.  The pager clipped to his belt vibrated insistently, a constant, low thrum of urgency echoing the anxiety coiling in his stomach.  It was December 23rd, barely 4:00 am, and already the hospital held a palpable sense of dread.  Elias knew it wasn't just the weather.  It was the feeling that hung in the air every year just before Christmas â€“ a mix of hope and despair, of lives hanging in the balance, a stark reminder of the fragility of existence.  Tonight, that fragility was about to become very real.
