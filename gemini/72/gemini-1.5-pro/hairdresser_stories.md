The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins, clutching a crumpled coupon for a perm and a gossip magazine thicker than a city phone book.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, proprietor and sole stylist of the salon, sighed inwardly. Mrs. Higgins' perm was a bi-weekly ritual, as predictable as the tides, and always accompanied by a litany of complaints about the weather, the price of tomatoes, and her ungrateful daughter-in-law.  Shear Perfection, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique store in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, wasn't exactly glamorous. But for Amelia, it was home, a haven of hairspray and hope in a world that often felt like one big bad hair day. The salty air drifted in through the open window, carrying the faint scent of seaweed and the distant cries of gulls.  A faded poster of Farrah Fawcett feathered hair smiled down from one wall, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era of big hair and bigger dreams.  Amelia, with her own dark curls pulled back in a practical ponytail, plastered a professional smile on her face and greeted Mrs. Higgins with forced cheer. "Morning, Mrs. Higgins!  Ready for some fabulous volume?"
