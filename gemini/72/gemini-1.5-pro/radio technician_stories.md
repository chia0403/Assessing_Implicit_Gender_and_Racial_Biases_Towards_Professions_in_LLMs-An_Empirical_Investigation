The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Bolt Garage and Radio Repair" cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Harmony Creek, Nevada.  Inside, amidst a chaotic tangle of vacuum tubes, dusty chassis, and coiled wires, Elias Vance meticulously soldered a connection on a 1938 Zenith console radio. The scent of ozone mingled with the faint, metallic tang of old capacitors. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a steady rhythm accompanying the crackle and hiss emanating from the half-disassembled radios scattered around the shop.  Harmony Creek, a town clinging precariously to life on the edge of the Mojave Desert, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and Elias's business reflected that.  He mostly repaired broken televisions and the occasional ham radio, a dwindling trade in a world obsessed with smartphones and satellite communication. But tonight, something different was on the workbench.
