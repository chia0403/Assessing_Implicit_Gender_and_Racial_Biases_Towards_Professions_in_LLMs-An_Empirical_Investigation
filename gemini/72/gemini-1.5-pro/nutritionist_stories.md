The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, rustling the crimson and gold leaves clinging precariously to the ancient oaks lining Sycamore Street. He pulled his tweed jacket tighter, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling his nostrils, a familiar aroma of autumn in Alder’s Bend.  His breath plumed before him as he ascended the creaking steps of the grand, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian house. This was number 27, the home and clinic of the late, and locally legendary, herbalist, Ms. Elara Thistlewick.  Elias, a certified nutritionist with a penchant for evidence-based practice, had inherited the property and its legacy somewhat unexpectedly,  a quirky bequest from a distant relative he’d never met.  Inside, dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight filtering through the stained-glass windows depicting fantastical flora and fauna.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of dried herbs, a mixture of soothing chamomile and something pungently unfamiliar that tickled his nose.  Elias, armed with a clipboard and a healthy dose of skepticism, was here to take stock of his inheritance, a task that seemed increasingly daunting with every creak of the floorboards and whisper of the wind.
