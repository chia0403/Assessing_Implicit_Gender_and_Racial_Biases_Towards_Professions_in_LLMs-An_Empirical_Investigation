The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s dark brown hair across her face as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude’s Community Hospital.  The ancient stone buildings, a patchwork of additions dating back to the 18th century, huddled together against the grey, pre-dawn sky of coastal Maine.  Seagulls cried overhead, their calls sharp against the low rumble of the incoming tide. Mia tugged her fleece tighter, the damp chill seeping through the worn fabric.  Inside, the warm glow emanating from the Emergency Room entrance promised a temporary reprieve, but she knew the calm before the storm wouldn’t last.  A Friday night in Haven Harbor meant anything could walk – or be wheeled – through those double doors.  And tonight, a particularly nasty nor’easter brewing off the coast promised to deliver more than just rain.
