The biting wind whipped down Cobblestone Alley, carrying the scent of sawdust and something faintly metallic.  It snagged on the thick canvas awning of "Finnegan's Fine Meats," causing the rusted bell above the door to chime a discordant welcome. Inside, bathed in the warm, halogen glow of the shop, Elias Thorne, his apron stained crimson and his cleaver gleaming, surveyed his kingdom of hanging carcasses.  The shop, a narrow wedge squeezed between a failing bakery and a perpetually shuttered antique store, was lined with refrigerated display cases showcasing glistening cuts of beef, plump sausages, and racks of ribs that seemed to shimmer under the lights. Elias, a man built like an oak barrel with hands as rough as bark, ran a calloused thumb along the edge of his cleaver, the metal cool against his skin. This was his domain, a place of sharp edges and primal scents, where he reigned supreme.  The approaching Christmas rush meant long hours and aching joints, but Elias wouldn't have it any other way.  He breathed deep, inhaling the familiar aroma, a blend of blood, sawdust, and the faint, sweet tang of aging meat.  This was home.
