The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Reyes’s hair across her face as she hurried down Sycamore Street, the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves thick in the air.  Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains of New York, was a town steeped in autumnal beauty, a picturesque tableau of fiery maples and rust-colored oaks clinging to the steep hillsides.  But for Mia, the charm was often lost in the relentless chill and the isolation.  This morning, however, she felt a flicker of anticipation.  Her first patient at the newly opened Oakhaven Rehabilitation Center, a converted Victorian mansion overlooking the valley, was scheduled for 9:00 am.  The case was unusual, the details shrouded in secrecy, and it had piqued Mia’s professional curiosity, a welcome distraction from the quiet unease that had settled over the town since the first snow dusted the peaks a few weeks prior. The grand, somewhat dilapidated building loomed ahead, its stained-glass windows catching the weak sunlight, hinting at the stories held within its aging walls.
