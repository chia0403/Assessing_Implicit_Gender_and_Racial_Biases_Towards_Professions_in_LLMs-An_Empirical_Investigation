The rain hammered against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Michael vanquishing a rather pathetic-looking dragon, the crimson and gold warped by the downpour.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, Esq., tapped a manicured nail against the mahogany desk, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the storm. Her office, perched high on the fifteenth floor of the Wainwright Building in St. Louis, usually offered a breathtaking view of the Gateway Arch and the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Today, however, the cityscape was swallowed by a churning grey mist, leaving Amelia feeling as though she were adrift in a solitary, gothic tower.  The only light in the room came from a Tiffany lamp with a shade depicting dragonflies in iridescent flight, casting an ethereal glow on the stacks of legal briefs threatening to avalanche across her desk.  The air smelled of old books, expensive leather, and the faintest hint of brewing Earl Grey, a testament to the near-constant presence of her perpetually frazzled assistant, Ms. Perkins. This evening, however, Amelia was alone, save for the storm and the looming shadow of the case that had landed, quite literally, on her doorstep that very morning.
