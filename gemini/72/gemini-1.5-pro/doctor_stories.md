The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery and mirroring the gnawing unease in his gut.  Greystones, a small fishing village perched precariously on the Yorkshire coast, was usually a picture of stoic tranquility.  But this morning, the air hung thick with a peculiar stillness, broken only by the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead.  The slate-roofed cottages, normally vibrant with the sounds of fishermen mending nets and children playing, were eerily silent.  Even the rhythmic crash of waves against the cliffs seemed muted, as if the sea itself held its breath in anticipation of something unknown. Inside, Dr. Thorne, his stethoscope still cold against his chest after a house call, stared out at the turbulent grey sky. The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden floor of his surgery, a space cluttered with medical texts, jars filled with strange tinctures, and the faint, antiseptic scent of carbolic acid. He had a feeling this was going to be a day unlike any other.
