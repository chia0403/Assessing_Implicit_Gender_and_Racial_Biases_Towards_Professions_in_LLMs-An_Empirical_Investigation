The relentless Florida humidity clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, making his starched white shirt wilt before he even reached his client's porch.  Spanish moss draped from the live oaks lining Palmetto Avenue, casting long, languid shadows that did little to alleviate the oppressive heat.  Elias adjusted his tie, a vibrant splash of teal against the otherwise monochrome ensemble he considered his professional armor, and smoothed down his already impeccably combed dark hair.  Number 22, the house he was visiting, was a faded pastel pink, a relic of a bygone era when Miami was less glitz and more grit.  A rusted wrought-iron flamingo stood sentinel by the peeling front door, its chipped paint a testament to the corrosive power of salt air and time.  Elias, a meticulous man, noted the state of disrepair with a practiced eye, already calculating potential risks and premiums. This was, after all, just another day in the life of a State Farm agent in Coral Gables.  Today's appointment: Mrs. Consuelo Ramirez, whose homeowners insurance was up for renewal, and who, according to his notes, had a penchant for baking guava pastries and harboring a deep distrust of anyone selling anything.
