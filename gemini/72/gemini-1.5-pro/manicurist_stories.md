The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Grace Dupree like a damp shawl.  Spanish moss dripped from the live oaks lining Calhoun Street, casting long, languid shadows across the pastel-coloured storefronts.  Inside "Polished to Perfection," Amelia’s own nail salon, the whir of a rotating nail drill momentarily broke the otherwise sleepy afternoon quiet.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating swirling motes of dust and the rainbow array of nail polish bottles lined up like tiny soldiers on mirrored shelves. The scent of acetone hung in the air, a familiar and not entirely unpleasant perfume that permeated every corner of Amelia’s small but meticulously organized domain. Today, however, a nervous energy buzzed beneath the surface of the usual calm, a tremor in Amelia’s usually steady hand as she applied a delicate floral design to Mrs. Henderson’s acrylics. Something was different.  A feeling, a premonition, a subtle shift in the air that suggested this sweltering Tuesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
