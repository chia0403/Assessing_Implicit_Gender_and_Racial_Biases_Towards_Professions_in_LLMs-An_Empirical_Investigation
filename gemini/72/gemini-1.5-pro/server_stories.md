The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Salty Siren Diner, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the churning in Amelia Grace Holloway's stomach.  It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind of night that sucked the warmth right out of the coastal Oregon town of Port Blossom.  The diner, usually bustling with fishermen and tourists, was almost deserted. Amelia, her name tag pinned slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, leaned against the counter, idly tracing circles in the condensation with a damp dishrag.  The only other occupants were two grizzled old men playing checkers in a booth by the window, their game punctuated by the clatter of ceramic pieces and the occasional grumbled comment about the weather.  The air smelled of stale coffee, fried fish, and a faint, lingering scent of sea salt that clung to everything in Port Blossom.  Outside, the neon sign of the Salty Siren flickered intermittently, casting an eerie green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Amelia sighed, the sound swallowed by the drumming rain.  This was going to be a long shift.
