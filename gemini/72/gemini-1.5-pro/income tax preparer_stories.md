The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold Finch's office cast a sickly yellow glow over the meticulously organized chaos of his desk.  Tax season was in full, furious swing, and Harold, whose full name was Harold Percival Finch III, was drowning in a sea of W-2s, 1099s, and schedules of every imaginable letter.

He was running on coffee, stale donut crumbs, and the faint hope that he might actually sleep before July.  The phone rang, its shrill jingle jarring him from his calculations.  "Finch Tax Preparation, Harold speaking," he answered, his voice raspy and edged with a caffeine-induced tremor.
