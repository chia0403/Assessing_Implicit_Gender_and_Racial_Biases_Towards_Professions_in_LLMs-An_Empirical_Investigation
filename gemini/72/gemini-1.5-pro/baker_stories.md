The aroma of burnt sugar and cardamom hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume clinging to Elina Thistlewood's apron like a second skin.  Dawn was barely a whisper over the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a small town nestled in the valley between two slumbering peaks. The bakery, "Thistle & Crumb," was a cozy haven of warmth against the chill morning, its windows fogged with the promise of fresh-baked delights. Elina, her dark braid dusted with flour, hummed a lilting tune as she wrestled a particularly stubborn batch of sourdough from the depths of the wood-fired oven.  Outside, the only sounds were the rustling of leaves in the ancient oak that gave the town its name, and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer, heralding another day in Oakhaven.
