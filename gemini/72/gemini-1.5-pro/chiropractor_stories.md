The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the knot in his tie, a nervous habit he'd picked up somewhere between graduating magna cum laude from Palmer College of Chiropractic and inheriting his grandfather's dilapidated practice in the sleepy, forgotten town of Havenwood, Oregon. Havenwood, population 3,248 (and dwindling), wasn’t exactly a hotbed of spinal subluxations.  The only things booming here were the logging trucks rumbling through at 3 am and the persistent rumours of the mythical Havenwood Hag, a creature said to lure lost hikers deep into the whispering pines of the surrounding Redwood National Park and leave only their boots behind. Elias, a man of science, scoffed at such folklore.  Yet, as a shiver ran down his spine, unrelated to any discernible vertebral misalignment, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Havenwood held secrets deeper and darker than any anatomy textbook could reveal. The clock chimed seven, the sound echoing in the unsettling silence of his empty waiting room.  Another Tuesday night. Another night where the only company he had was the faint smell of pine needles clinging to his damp jacket and the growing suspicion that he'd made a terrible, terrible mistake.
