The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones was a constant lullaby in the life of  Isabelle "Izzy" Rossignol. Her small atelier, nestled between a bustling bakery and a rather dubious apothecary on Rue de l'Ã‰toile, was a sanctuary of shimmering silks and whisper-thin cottons.  Paris in 1888 hummed with a restless energy, a city on the cusp of transformation, but within Izzy's four walls, time seemed to slow.  Sunlight, filtered through the large paned window facing the street, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, catching the iridescent sheen of spools of thread and the sharp glint of her silver thimble.  A half-finished ballgown, a froth of ivory lace and pearl beading, lay draped over a dress form, waiting for its final touches.  The air was thick with the scent of lavender sachets and the faint, metallic tang of pins. Izzy, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, frowned at a sketch, a charcoal smudge on her cheek mirroring the smudge of doubt in her deep brown eyes. The upcoming Exposition Universelle loomed, a chance to showcase her talent to the world, but the pressure to create something truly extraordinary was almost suffocating.
