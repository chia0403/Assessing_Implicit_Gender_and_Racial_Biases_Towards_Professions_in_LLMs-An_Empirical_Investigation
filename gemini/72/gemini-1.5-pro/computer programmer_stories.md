Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already hazy Seattle skyline into a smudge of grey and neon.  The rhythmic click-clack of Elias's mechanical keyboard sliced through the white noise of the downpour, a counterpoint to the low rumble of distant thunder.  His apartment, perched high in the sleek, obsidian Zenith Tower, reflected his personality: minimalist, efficient, and dominated by the glow of screens.  Empty takeout containers were stacked neatly beside his custom-built PC, its cooling fans whirring like a miniature jet engine.  Elias, clad in his usual uniform of a faded grey hoodie and worn jeans, barely registered the storm raging outside. His focus was entirely consumed by the lines of code scrolling across his monitor, each keystroke a small victory in his battle against a particularly stubborn bug.  Tonight, he was determined to crack it. Tonight, Elias Thorne was going to change the world, one line of code at a time.
