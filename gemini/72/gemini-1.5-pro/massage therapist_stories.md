Rain lashed against the windows of "Knots Untied," blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear of pink.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a fragile shield against the November chill creeping in under the door.  Elara Juniper Finch, LMT, kneaded the tension from Mrs. Higgins' perpetually knotted shoulders, her own worries momentarily forgotten in the rhythmic push and pull. The small massage therapy studio, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed psychic shop on Bleecker Street, was Elara's sanctuary, her escape from a life that felt increasingly tangled.  Tonight, however, the usual calm was replaced by a low thrum of unease. Mrs. Higgins, normally a fount of neighborhood gossip, was unusually quiet, her breathing shallow and quick.  And beyond the rhythmic drumming of the rain, Elara could have sworn she heard another sound, a faint scratching at the back door, like something – or someone – wanting in.
