The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes that danced across the cobbled streets of Prague. He pulled his worn leather jacket tighter, the collar scratching against his unshaven cheek.  Elias, full name Elias Vance Thorne, hadn't slept properly in days, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the manic energy that always preceded a new project. This time, it was different.  This wasn't just another low-budget indie flick cobbled together with borrowed equipment and the goodwill of friends. This was *The Golem's Whisper*, his magnum opus, a gothic horror film set against the backdrop of Prague's ancient Jewish Quarter, a place steeped in myth and shadows.  He stood before the Old Jewish Cemetery, its uneven headstones clustered together like teeth in a decaying jaw, a palpable sense of history pressing down on him.  This wasn't just a location; it was a character in his film, a silent witness to centuries of stories, some whispered, some screamed.  And Elias, the perpetually anxious director, was about to add his own.
