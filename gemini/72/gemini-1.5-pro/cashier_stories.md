The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quik-E-Mart cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Reyes, illuminating the faint dusting of flour on her cheek from the pan dulce she’d devoured for breakfast. It was 5:58 AM, two minutes before her shift officially started, but Amelia was already perched on her stool behind the register, the rhythmic beeping of the lottery ticket scanner a monotonous soundtrack to her pre-dawn existence. Outside, the Arizona sun was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of bruised purple and burnt orange, promising another scorching day in the desolate town of Dust Devil Junction.  The Quik-E-Mart, a beacon of processed food and lukewarm coffee, was the only sign of life for miles, a lonely outpost on the long, dusty stretch of Highway 17.  A tumbleweed, propelled by the desert wind, skittered across the empty parking lot, a perfect metaphor for Amelia’s own feeling of being stuck in the middle of nowhere.
