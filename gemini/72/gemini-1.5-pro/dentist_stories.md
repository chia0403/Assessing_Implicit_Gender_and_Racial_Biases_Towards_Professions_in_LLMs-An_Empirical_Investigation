The rain hammered against the tall, arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, a rhythmic drumming that seemed to vibrate the antique porcelain spittoon in the corner. His waiting room, usually bright and airy thanks to the large skylight, was submerged in a twilight gloom. The only illumination came from a Tiffany lamp on the oak reception desk, casting long, dancing shadows of the potted ferns across the polished wooden floor. Elias, a man of precise habits, checked his Hamilton pocket watch for the tenth time in as many minutes. 5:57 pm. Three minutes until Amelia Hayes, his last patient of the day, was due. He adjusted the crisp, white collar of his lab coat, the faint scent of clove oil clinging to the fabric, a familiar and comforting aroma in his meticulously ordered world. Outside, the wind howled through the narrow cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a small, secluded town nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, a place where secrets were as common as maple trees.
