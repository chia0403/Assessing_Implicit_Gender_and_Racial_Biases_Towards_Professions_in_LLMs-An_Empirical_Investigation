The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune as the November wind gusted in, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves.  Elara Thistlewick, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from conditioning morning glories, looked up from her workbench.  Petal & Plume wasn't much – a small shop tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique store in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine – but it was hers.  Outside, the grey Atlantic churned restlessly against the rocky shore, mirroring the quiet unease blossoming in Elara's chest.  This November felt different. Colder.  Emptier.  And the strange, iridescent flowers that had begun washing ashore a week ago were only adding to the unsettling atmosphere.
