The clatter of trams and the hawkers' cries of "Fresh haddock!" and "Apples, a penny a pound!" barely penetrated the dusty calm of Elias Finch's workshop.  Nestled between a bustling public house and a greengrocer perpetually overflowing with bruised fruit, Finch's Tailor Shop occupied a sliver of a building on Pennyfeather Lane, in the heart of London's Whitechapel district.  The year was 1888, a damp and foggy November clinging to the cobbled streets. Inside, gas lamps cast a flickering, theatrical light upon bolts of cloth stacked to the ceiling â€“ rich velvets, sturdy tweeds, and shimmering silks whispering stories of far-off lands. Elias, a man of slight build with eyes the color of aged whiskey and fingers nimble as spiders, meticulously stitched the final button onto a gentleman's waistcoat. The faint aroma of pipe tobacco and beeswax hung in the air, mingling with the sharper scent of freshly cut wool. A half-finished coat lay draped over a dress form, its shadowy silhouette hinting at an elegant shape yet to be fully realized.  Elias hummed a tuneless melody, the rhythmic click of his needle a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of the street outside. He had a feeling this coat, this particular commission, was going to be rather unusual.
