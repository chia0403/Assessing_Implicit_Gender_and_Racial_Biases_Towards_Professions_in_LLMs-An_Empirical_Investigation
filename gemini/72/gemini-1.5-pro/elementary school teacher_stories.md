The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the controlled chaos of Friday afternoon. Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking the playground, blurring the vibrant jungle gym into a watercolor mess of primary colors. Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Oregon, usually exuded a cozy charm.

The children, usually buzzing with the anticipation of the weekend, were unusually subdued, their whispers clinging to the corners of the room like cobwebs. Mrs. Vance, a woman whose smile was as warm and familiar as a well-loved storybook, felt a prickle of unease beneath her cardigan.  Something wasn't right.
