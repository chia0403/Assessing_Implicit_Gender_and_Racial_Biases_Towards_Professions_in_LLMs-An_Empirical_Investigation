Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Thorne's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of downtown Chicago.  Amelia, CEO of Thorne Dynamics, a cutting-edge robotics firm, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass, her gaze fixed on the churning grey of Lake Michigan far below.  The sleek, minimalist space, usually a beacon of calm efficiency, buzzed with an unusual tension. The air crackled with unspoken anxieties, mirroring the electric storm raging outside.  A half-eaten container of sushi sat forgotten on her pristine white desk, next to a tablet displaying schematics for the "Project Nightingale" prototype â€“ a revolutionary medical android that was the culmination of five years of relentless work, and the potential key to Amelia's legacy.  Tonight, however, the project felt less like a triumph and more like a ticking time bomb.
