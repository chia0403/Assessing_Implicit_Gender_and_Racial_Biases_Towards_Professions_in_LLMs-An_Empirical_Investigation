The humidity hung thick and heavy in the air, a damp blanket draped over the Art Deco facade of the "Body By Bellini" studio.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, mirroring the rhythmic thrum of the 80s synth-pop blasting from within. Inside, beneath the glow of neon pink strip lights, Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, clad in a vibrant teal leotard and matching sweatbands, bounced on the balls of her feet, her energy a stark contrast to the dreary weather outside.  A whistle hung loosely around her neck, and a wireless microphone clipped to her cheekbone amplified her voice as she shouted encouragement to the small but dedicated group huddled before her.  "Five more, ladies! Feel the burn! Sculpt those glutes! Imagine you're climbing a mountain of profiterolesâ€¦ and you can't eat them until you reach the top!"  The studio, normally bustling, was sparsely populated this Tuesday morning; the relentless downpour had clearly deterred even the most devout fitness fanatics.  But those who had braved the storm were rewarded with Amy's undivided attention, a perk rarely enjoyed in her usually packed classes.
