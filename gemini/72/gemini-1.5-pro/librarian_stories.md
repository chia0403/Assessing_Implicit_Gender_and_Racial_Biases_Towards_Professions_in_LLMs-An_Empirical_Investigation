Inside, the air hummed with the quiet rustle of turning pages and the distant clink of Mrs. Higginsâ€™ perpetually refilled teacup.  Eleanor Ainsworth, the head librarian, perched on a rolling ladder, her fingers trailing along the spines of the antiquarian collection.  The library, a two-story Victorian edifice of red brick and whimsical gargoyles, sat nestled amongst the bustling, yet strangely timeless, shops and cafes lining Sycamore Street in the heart of Hollow Creek, Massachusetts.  The scent of woodsmoke drifted in from the nearby town square, where vendors were setting up for the annual Harvest Festival, a charming counterpoint to the hushed reverence within the library walls.  Eleanor, however, was far more captivated by the mystery concealed within a leather-bound volume dating back to 1789 than by the festivities outside.  A faint, metallic glint from the spine caught her eye, something embedded between the aged leather and the yellowed pages.
