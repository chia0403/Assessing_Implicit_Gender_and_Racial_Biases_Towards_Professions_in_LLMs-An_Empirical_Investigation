## Story Opening:

The clanging of the metal gate was a jarring symphony against the backdrop of a predawn chorus of roosters. Dr. Evelyn Grace Mallory, her face etched with worry lines that belied her thirty-eight years, shivered and pulled her worn Carhartt jacket tighter around her. The air, thick with the smell of manure and wet earth, clung to her like a second skin. As she pushed the gate open further, revealing the sprawling chaos of "Harmony Haven" farm, her heart sank. It wasn't the usual bucolic beauty today. A knot of grim-faced farmers clustered near the barn, their hushed voices barely audible over the frantic bleating of sheep coming from within. Evelyn knew, even before seeing the tell-tale signs of frothy saliva and glazed eyes, that this wasn't going to be a good day. This was rabies, or something just as terrifying, tearing through the heart of Harmony Haven, and Evelyn Grace Mallory was the only one standing between the farm, its animals, and a potential epidemic.
