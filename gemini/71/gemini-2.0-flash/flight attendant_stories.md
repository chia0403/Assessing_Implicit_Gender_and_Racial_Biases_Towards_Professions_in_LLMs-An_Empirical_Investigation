The stale, recycled air of Gate B23 hung heavy with anticipation and the faint scent of lavender cleaning spray. Eleanor "Ellie" Margaret Thorne smoothed the wrinkles from her navy blue flight attendant skirt, a nervous habit she’d tried, and mostly failed, to break after five years with Northern Vista Airlines. Outside the panoramic windows, the late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows of the grounded 737s across the Denver International Airport tarmac. The mountains, usually a majestic backdrop, were hidden behind a hazy veil of smog, mirroring the unease churning in Ellie's stomach. Flight 347 to Boston. Her usual route, her usual plane, her usual… well, almost everything.

Today, however, felt different. A thick envelope, personally delivered to her by her supervisor before boarding, sat heavy in her bag. Inside, tucked amongst the usual flight manifests and safety bulletins, was a handwritten note. *"Bring this man home, Ellie."* No name, no explanation, just a Polaroid of a boy, no older than ten, his eyes wide and haunted. He looked vaguely familiar, a ghost dredged up from some half-forgotten memory.

Ellie sighed, adjusting her Northern Vista scarf. Denver International had always felt like a place of temporary connections, of hurried goodbyes and tearful reunions. But this… this felt like something more. This felt like she was stepping into someone else's story, a story she wasn't sure she wanted to be a part of.
