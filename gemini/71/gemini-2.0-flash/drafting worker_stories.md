## Story Opening:

The smell of old blueprints and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air of the drafting room, a comforting, familiar miasma that was as much a part of Edgar Thompson’s morning as the rhythmic thrum of his T-square against the oversized drafting table. He squinted at the intricately drawn cross-section of a bridge support, the thin, sharp lines a testament to years of meticulous practice. Edgar, a man built more like a comfortable armchair than a sleek skyscraper, felt a knot tighten in his stomach. Today was the day. Today, the “Thompson Initiative,” as he’d dubbed it in his head, was finally going to see the light of day, or, more accurately, the fluorescent glow of Mr. Harrison’s notoriously dim office.

## Setting:

The setting is the bustling but slightly dilapidated drafting room of the “Harrison & Sons Bridge Construction Co.” located in the industrial district of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, circa 1978. The room itself is a large, rectangular space with high ceilings and long rows of drafting tables arranged in a grid. Natural light struggles to penetrate the grime-covered windows overlooking a maze of railroad tracks and warehouses. The walls are painted a faded, institutional green, and plastered with outdated engineering diagrams and motivational posters featuring slogans like "Precision is Progress!" and "Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!" (which Edgar always found ironic, given the solitary nature of his work). In one corner, near a perpetually overflowing bin of discarded coffee filters, sits a hulking blueprint printer that groans and clatters like a dying beast. The air is thick with the scent of ink, paper, and the underlying aroma of ambition and quiet desperation that permeates the lives of the workers striving to keep the city's bridges standing.
