## Story Opening:

The cloying sweetness of honeysuckle hung heavy in the humid Georgia air, thick enough to choke a hummingbird. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her face flushed and freckled from the relentless sun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her glove. It left a streak of dirt on her forehead, perfectly mirroring the grime that already decorated her forearms. She squinted at the unruly tangle of bougainvillea, its thorny branches threatening to consume the wrought-iron gate of the Caldwell estate. Another day, another botanical battlefield. Amelia sighed. Landscaping, she was learning, was less about idyllic serenity and more about brutal, glorious warfare.

## Setting:

The Caldwell estate was nestled in the affluent suburb of Ansley Park, Atlanta. A sprawling Greek Revival mansion, its white columns gleaming in the Georgia sunshine, it was the epitome of old money and Southern grandeur. The grounds, however, were another story. Neglected for years, they had succumbed to the insidious advance of nature. Ivy climbed the crumbling brick walls, azaleas grew wild and untamed, and the once meticulously manicured lawn was now a patchwork of weeds and crabgrass. The air hummed with the buzzing of insects and the mournful chirping of crickets, a symphony of wilderness in the heart of the city. It was a challenge Amelia relished, a chance to breathe life back into forgotten beauty. But as she gazed upon the scale of the project, a tiny tremor of apprehension, like the first hint of a summer storm, stirred within her. This was going to be more than just weeding and pruning. This was a restoration.
