## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** A cramped, dimly lit editing suite in a post-production house in Burbank, California. Empty pizza boxes and half-drunk energy drinks litter the surfaces. The hum of computers and the rhythmic clicking of a mouse fill the air. A large monitor dominates the room, currently displaying a fragmented scene of a medieval battlefield.

**Opening:**

The red numbers on the monitor glared back at Alistair Finch, mocking him with their relentless progress. 3:17 AM. Three hours and seventeen minutes since he'd last seen anything resembling a real bed. Alistair, Academy Award-winning director and current hostage of his own ambitious medieval epic, "The Crimson Banner," rubbed his bloodshot eyes, the grit under his eyelids feeling like tiny shards of glass. He scrubbed a hand through his already disheveled hair, a salt-and-pepper mess that betrayed the beginnings of a mid-life crisis he was far too busy to acknowledge.

“Again, Leo,” he mumbled, his voice hoarse. “From the top. And this time, can we *please* get the goddamn flailing arm of Sir Reginald to look less like he’s hailing a taxi and more like he’s been cleaved clean through by a battleaxe?”

He slammed the spacebar. The scene rewound. Sir Reginald, a burly extra whose agent had clearly oversold his “dying dramatically” skills, began his ungainly flop once more. Alistair sighed, a sound like air leaking from a punctured lung. The Crimson Banner. It was supposed to be his masterpiece, his crowning achievement. Instead, it felt like a monstrous, demanding child he couldn't possibly satisfy. And right now, at 3:17 AM, surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the ghastly spectacle of Sir Reginald's dismemberment-gone-wrong, Alistair Finch was starting to seriously doubt if he had any masterpieces left in him at all.
