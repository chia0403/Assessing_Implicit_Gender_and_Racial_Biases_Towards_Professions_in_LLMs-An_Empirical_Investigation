The fluorescent lights of "Wanderlust & Widgets Travel, Ltd." hummed a relentless, annoying tune, a discordant counterpoint to the soothing images of turquoise waters and snow-capped mountains plastered across the office walls. Eleanor Patricia Finch, meticulously rearranging a stack of brochures for a river cruise down the Danube, sighed. Another Tuesday morning, another onslaught of spreadsheets, screaming toddlers on hold, and the existential dread that came with selling dreams most people couldn't afford.

Eleanorâ€™s fingers, usually so deft at navigating the labyrinthine booking systems, fumbled with the glossy paper. She loved travel, truly, deeply. The smell of jet fuel excited her, the crunch of unfamiliar gravel beneath her shoes thrilled her. But lately, she felt more like a cog in a very large, very beige, machine. The only exotic locale Eleanor was likely to see this year was the breakroom down the hall.

Outside, the rain hammered against the plate-glass window, blurring the already drab cityscape of downtown Birmingham, England. Puddles formed quickly in the gutters, reflecting the dull sky like tiny, distorted mirrors. The sound was a constant, monotonous drone, threatening to drown out the last vestiges of Eleanor's wanderlust. It was the kind of weather that made people dream of escape, which, ironically, was Eleanor's job. But lately, she felt trapped just like them. Trapped behind a desk, selling the illusion of freedom, while the real adventure passed her by.
