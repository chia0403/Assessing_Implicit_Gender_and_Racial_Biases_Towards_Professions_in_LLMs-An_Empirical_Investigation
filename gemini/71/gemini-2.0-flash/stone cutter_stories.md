The dust was always the same shade – a gritty, pale gray that clung to everything in Aethelred Stonecutter's life. It coated the rough-hewn beams of his workshop, settled on his calloused hands like a second skin, and even seemed to infiltrate his lungs, lending his voice a perpetual rasp. The workshop itself, a cavernous space carved directly into the side of the Whispering Cliff, was more like a natural amphitheater than a human dwelling. Daylight spilled in through the wide, arched opening, illuminating the dance of dust motes and the silent ranks of unfinished gargoyles, stern-faced angels, and half-formed mythical beasts that lined the walls.

Aethelred, fifty years a stone cutter and counting, preferred it that way. He had little patience for the sun-drenched fields and bustling marketplaces of the valley below. Up here, with only the wind and the echoing clang of his hammer for company, he felt a strange sense of communion with the very earth, a deep understanding of the cold, unyielding beauty held within the heart of the stone. He preferred the company of granite and marble to that of men, for the stone, at least, never lied. And in the Kingdom of Eldoria, lies were as plentiful as the gray dust that defined Aethelred Stonecutter’s solitary world.
