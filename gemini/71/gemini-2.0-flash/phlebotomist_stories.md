Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of the Mount Olivet Hospital Emergency Room buzzed with the frantic energy of a trapped wasp. It was 3:17 AM, the tail end of a particularly rough Saturday night. The air hung thick with the smells of antiseptic, stale coffee, and suppressed anxiety. Half-empty gurneys lined the hallway, their occupants a silent chorus of pain and fatigue. Nurses hurried past, their faces etched with a mixture of urgency and exhaustion. The rhythmic beeping of monitors provided a jarring counterpoint to the muffled sobs coming from behind the curtain of Trauma Bay 2.

**Story Opening:**

The scent of rubbing alcohol clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the chaos. Dr. Evelyn Reed, a phlebotomist with five years under her belt and lines permanently etched around her kind eyes, adjusted the elastic tourniquet on the arm of a teenage boy who was currently rambling about seeing purple elephants. He’d come in an hour ago, incoherent and agitated, after reportedly consuming something “really, really good.”

Evelyn sighed inwardly. This was her fourth drug-induced hallucination of the night. "Just take a deep breath, sweetie," she said, her voice calm and soothing, a practiced balm against the rising tide of panic she often encountered. "This will just be a quick pinch."

Her gloved fingers expertly located the vein, plump and inviting beneath the boy’s skin. She inserted the needle with practiced precision, the telltale flash of crimson filling the collection tube. But as she reached for the next tube, a piercing scream erupted from Trauma Bay 1, silencing the boy’s elephant ramblings and sending a shiver down Evelyn’s spine. It was a scream of pure, unadulterated terror, a sound that cut through the ER's cacophony and left a chilling silence in its wake. Suddenly, a voice on the intercom crackled to life, "Code Blue, Trauma Bay 1. Code Blue."
