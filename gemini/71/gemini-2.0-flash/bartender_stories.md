The sticky residue of spilled beer clung to Arthur Finch's fingers as he wiped down the mahogany bar for what felt like the hundredth time that night. Outside, a relentless November rain battered against the large, arched windows of "The Crooked Tankard," a pub nestled deep in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town. The air inside was thick with the comforting aroma of peat smoke, stale ale, and unspoken stories, the kind that only whispered themselves to bartenders and late-night stragglers.

The Crooked Tankard was a labyrinth of low ceilings, hidden nooks, and mismatched furniture, a testament to its supposed origin as a smugglers' den centuries ago. Wobbly wooden tables were scattered across the flagstone floor, each illuminated by a flickering gas lamp that cast long, dancing shadows. A grandfather clock, impossibly ancient and perpetually five minutes slow, ticked ominously in a dark corner. Above the bar, a dusty collection of antique tankards hung precariously, their silver tarnished and reflecting the dim light in a thousand glimmers. The walls were adorned with faded tapestries depicting scenes of mythical creatures and heroic battles, their colors dulled by time and countless spilled pints. It was a place that felt both comforting and unsettling, familiar and strangely alien, all at once. And tonight, for Arthur Finch, it felt like a prison.
