## Story Opening:

The tar smelled like scorched rubber and broken promises, a familiar scent that clung to the sweat soaking through Leo Maxwell's t-shirt. He squinted against the brutal midday sun, the hazy Baltimore skyline shimmering in the distance like a mirage. Below him, the narrow brick row houses of Hampden stretched out, a patchwork quilt of mismatched siding and weary front porches.

Leo tugged at the brim of his worn Orioles cap, shoving a stray lock of salt-and-pepper hair from his forehead. He hated these small jobs, the ones where Mrs. Henderson’s leaky dormer window was the day's entire objective. Give him a sprawling warehouse roof, something that took a week to complete, a challenge that demanded grit and precision. But times were lean, and a man had to eat. Besides, Mrs. Henderson paid in cash and always had a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade waiting for him. That counted for something.

He ran a calloused hand over the patch of weathered shingles, his gut twisting with a familiar unease. Something about this roof felt… wrong. Not structurally, not exactly. But the way the shadows clung to the valleys, the silence even the cicadas seemed to avoid, sent a prickle crawling up his spine. He’d learned to trust that feeling over the years. It was the same warning he got before a sudden squall, the same instinct that told him a beam was about to splinter.

He just wished he knew what it was trying to tell him now.
