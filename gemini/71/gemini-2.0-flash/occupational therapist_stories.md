## Story Opening:

The scent of industrial-strength cleaner still clung to the air, a faint, metallic tang that scratched the back of Eleanor Vance's throat. It was a smell she'd come to associate with hope, oddly enough. Hope that germs were being banished, hope that surfaces were being sanitized, hope that her patients were inching their way back to a life worth living. She exhaled slowly, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear with the back of a gloved hand. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a monotonous drone that was almost soothing after the cacophony of beeps and alarms from the ICU. She took another deep breath, steeling herself for the next challenge, the next small victory. Today, it was Mr. Henderson and his recalcitrant zipper.

## Setting:

The story begins in a small, brightly-lit occupational therapy room on the third floor of **St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center** in Hartford, Connecticut. The walls are painted a cheerful, if somewhat generic, shade of sunshine yellow. One wall is dominated by a large, cork bulletin board cluttered with motivational posters featuring cats hanging on for dear life and platitudes about resilience. A therapy table, covered in a wipeable vinyl, sits in the center of the room, surrounded by various tools: adaptive cutlery, grip strengtheners, button hooks, and a disconcerting collection of brightly colored, oversized toys. A cluttered bookshelf in the corner holds textbooks on kinesiology and neurorehabilitation interspersed with well-worn copies of crossword puzzle books and Sudoku. The window looks out onto a small, fenced-in patio area where patients can practice walking on uneven surfaces or maneuvering wheelchairs over ramps. The overall impression is one of determined optimism, a space designed to coax movement and functionality back into bodies ravaged by injury or illness.
