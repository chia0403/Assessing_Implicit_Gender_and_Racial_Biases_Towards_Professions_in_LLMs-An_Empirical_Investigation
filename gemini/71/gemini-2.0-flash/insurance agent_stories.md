The humid Florida air, thick as pea soup and smelling faintly of rotting mangoes, clung to Harold Franklin Peterson like a second skin. He tugged at the starched collar of his short-sleeved Oxford, the damp fabric already sticking uncomfortably to the back of his neck. Outside, the relentless sun hammered down on the pastel-colored bungalows that lined Mimosa Street in Tarpon Springs, turning the already vibrant hues into blinding mirages. Harold hated Mimosa Street. He especially hated Mimosa Street in August.

He stood on the porch of number 32, squinting at the peeling paint of the flamingo mailbox. Another day, another potential policyholder. He adjusted his tie, took a deep breath, and pressed the doorbell. A high-pitched, almost hysterical bark erupted from inside. Harold sighed. This was going to be a long one. He could feel it in his bones, a dull ache that mirrored the weight of brochures and promises he carried in his briefcase. Harold Franklin Peterson, insurance agent extraordinaire (at least, that's what his business card said), was ready to face whatever mayhem lay behind that flimsy, screen-door barricade.
