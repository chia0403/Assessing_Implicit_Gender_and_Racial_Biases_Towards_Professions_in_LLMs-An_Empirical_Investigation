The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, doing its best to suffocate Mrs. Eleonora "Ellie" Carmichael before she even reached the front doors of Cypress Creek High. Even at seven in the morning, the parking lot shimmered with heat. Ellie, bless her heart, was never one for air conditioning, preferring a window open and a gentle breeze, a habit that made her classroom a source of perpetual debate amongst her students.

Cypress Creek High, nestled in the heart of rural Oglethorpe County, wasn't exactly a picture postcard. The brick building, a product of the 1970s, bore the marks of time: chipped paint, faded banners proclaiming past football victories, and the lingering aroma of floor wax and something suspiciously resembling burnt popcorn. A scattering of beat-up pickup trucks and aging sedans dotted the parking lot, testament to the hard-working, no-frills ethos of the community. Beyond the schoolyard, fields of cotton stretched as far as the eye could see, a silent, stoic landscape that had witnessed generations of families rise and fall with the cyclical rhythms of the agricultural year.
