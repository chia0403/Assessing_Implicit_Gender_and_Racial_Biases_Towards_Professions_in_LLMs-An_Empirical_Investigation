**Story Opening:**

The scent of wintergreen and strained optimism hung thick in the air of the rehab center. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance wiped a stray bead of sweat from her brow, pushing a strand of her unruly auburn hair behind her ear. Mrs. Higgins, a woman who swore she'd dance at her granddaughter's wedding in July despite a recent hip replacement, was giving it her all on the parallel bars. Ellie knew the old woman was in pain, she could see it in the way her knuckles whitened as she gripped the metal, but damn if Mrs. Higgins wasn’t a fighter.

"Just a little further, Mrs. Higgins," Ellie encouraged, her voice gentle but firm. "Imagine yourself gliding across that dance floor, light as a feather."

Mrs. Higgins chuckled, a rasping sound that turned into a wheeze. "Light as a feather, eh? I haven't been light as a feather since I was sixteen! More like…a slightly disgruntled anvil now."

Ellie grinned, a genuine smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes. "Well, even disgruntled anvils can cut a rug. Let's get you to the end, and then we'll call it a day."

But as Mrs. Higgins took another shaky step, the door to the rehab center swung open, letting in a gust of icy wind and a figure that made Ellie's blood run cold. A figure she hadn't seen in nearly fifteen years. A figure she’d tried, and mostly succeeded, in forgetting.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the *Golden Years Rehabilitation Center*, a modern, brightly-lit facility located in the small, lakeside town of Havenwood, Wisconsin. The main rehab area is spacious, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, resistance bands, parallel bars, and various weights. The walls are painted a cheerful, calming blue, and large windows overlook the snow-dusted trees surrounding the lake. Despite the advanced technology, there's a warm, almost familial atmosphere fostered by the dedicated staff and the close-knit community they serve. The center serves as a vital hub for the aging population of Havenwood, offering physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy services. Outside of the center, the story might also venture into the quaint, snow-covered streets of Havenwood, a town known for its cozy cafes, antique shops, and the serene beauty of Lake Havenwood itself.
