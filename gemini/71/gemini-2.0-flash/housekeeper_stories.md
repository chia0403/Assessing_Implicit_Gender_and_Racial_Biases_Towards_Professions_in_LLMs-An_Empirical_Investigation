The clatter of antique silver against porcelain jolted Elsie Mae Cartwright awake. It wasn't the sound itself, which she was accustomed to, but the *timing*. It was barely five AM. On a Tuesday. And Mr. Archibald Finch, the current owner of the dilapidated Finch Manor, didn’t even *eat* breakfast in the formal dining room anymore, preferring reheated pizza in front of the Turner Classic Movies channel in his threadbare armchair.

Elsie Mae sighed, smoothing the wrinkles out of her floral-patterned cotton nightgown. She’d only managed about three hours of sleep, plagued by a recurring nightmare of dust bunnies the size of chihuahuas gnawing on the legs of mahogany furniture. This house was her bread and butter, her sole income since her late husband, Harold, had succumbed to his sweet tooth and a lifetime of diabetes. Finch Manor, and its eccentric, increasingly forgetful owner, was all she had left.

The Manor itself was a hulking Gothic monstrosity, perched on a windswept bluff overlooking the rocky coast of Maine. Built in the late 1800s by Archibald's great-great-grandfather, a shipping magnate with more money than sense, it boasted turrets, gargoyles, and enough rooms to house a small army. Now, those rooms were largely empty, filled only with cobwebs, shadows, and the ghosts of Finches past. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and the faint, lingering aroma of lavender potpourri, a relic from a bygone era. Outside, the ever-present wind howled like a mournful spirit, rattling the ancient windowpanes and whistling through the gaps in the weather stripping.

Elsie Mae climbed out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold, bare floorboards. She reached for her slippers, a worn pair of fuzzy pink rabbits, and shuffled towards the door. Something was definitely amiss, and Elsie Mae, after twenty years of dedicated service, knew Finch Manor better than Archibald Finch himself. She felt a prickle of unease. The silver wasn't just clattering; it was *crashing*. Something was wrong.
