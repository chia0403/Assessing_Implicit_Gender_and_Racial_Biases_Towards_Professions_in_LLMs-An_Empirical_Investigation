## The Whispering Weeds

The early morning mist clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a regretful ghost. The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and blooming wisteria, barely stirred as Bartholomew "Bart" Finchley, Grounds Keeper, emerged from the potting shed. He was a man built like an oak, sturdy and weathered, with hands perpetually stained green. His face, etched with the lines of years spent coaxing life from the soil, held a quiet wisdom that belied his simple occupation.

Blackwood Manor itself loomed behind him, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and gargoyles perched atop the highest turrets. It had been in the Blackwood family for generations, a silent sentinel guarding secrets whispered on the wind. Bartholomew knew them, or at least, he knew the echoes. He'd heard the stories - the tragic deaths, the unexplained disappearances, the faint melody that sometimes drifted from the sealed-off West Wing.

He pulled his woolen cap further down over his ears and breathed deeply, the cold air stinging his lungs. Today, the formal gardens needed tending. Specifically, the rose bushes that lined the eastern wall were overgrown and threatening to choke out the delicate lavender beneath. He knew, from years of observation, that these particular roses were particularly susceptible to the encroaching weeds. They were the most temperamental of the bunch, requiring a special touch, a whisper of encouragement. And Bartholomew Finchley, Grounds Keeper, was just the man to give it to them. He just hoped, as always, that the manor's secrets wouldn't try to bloom alongside them.
