The stale, acrid smell of burnt sugar and cheap cigarettes hung heavy in the air, clinging to the peeling wallpaper of the Dixie Belle Diner like a stubborn ghost. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "OPEN 24 HRS" sign into a hazy, distorted mess. Inside, the only patrons besides Detective Isabella Rose Thorne were a trucker nursing a lukewarm coffee and a young couple, heads bent together, whispering secrets that didn't seem to interest anyone but themselves.

Isabella, known to most as Izzy, had been staring at the same half-eaten plate of greasy hash browns for twenty minutes. The diner, located smack-dab in the armpit of New Orleans' Ninth Ward, was her usual stakeout spot. It was close to the projects, offered a good view of the street, and the coffee, while borderline toxic, was strong enough to keep her awake through the graveyard shift. Tonight, the target was Benny "The Bayou Butcher" Bergeron, a low-level hustler suspected of escalating to something far more sinister: a string of disappearances plaguing the area. Izzy had a gut feeling, a knot that tightened in her stomach whenever she even thought of Bergeronâ€™s ratty grin, that he was the key. All she needed was the proof.
