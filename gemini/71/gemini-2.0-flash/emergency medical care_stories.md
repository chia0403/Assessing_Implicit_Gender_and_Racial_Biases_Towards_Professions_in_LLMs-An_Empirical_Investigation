**Setting:**

The setting is a bustling, sun-drenched farmer's market in the small, but growing, town of Havenwood, Colorado. Stalls overflowing with vibrant produce, handcrafted goods, and the aroma of freshly baked bread line the town square. Families stroll leisurely, children chase pigeons, and local musicians strum folksy tunes, creating a lively and almost idyllic atmosphere. However, the thin mountain air and unpredictable weather of the Colorado Rockies constantly threaten to disrupt the peace.

**Story Opening:**

The morning sun beat down on Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance’s face as she adjusted her EMT backpack. The canvas, worn from years of service, was a comforting weight against her shoulders. Ellie navigated the cheerful chaos of the Havenwood Farmer’s Market, her senses on high alert. She wasn't here to browse the artisan cheeses or sample the homemade jams; she was on standby, a volunteer precaution since the Havenwood EMS was short-staffed that Saturday.

A smile played on her lips as she exchanged nods with familiar faces – Mrs. Henderson, whose prize-winning pumpkins were legendary, and young Timmy, who always insisted on showing her his collection of pet rocks. But even amidst the friendly chatter and the scent of blooming wildflowers, Ellie couldn’t shake a nagging feeling of unease. The perfect Saturdays, the ones painted in hues of sunshine and laughter, were often the ones that shattered the quickest. And Havenwood, nestled in the embrace of the Rockies, had its share of hidden dangers.
