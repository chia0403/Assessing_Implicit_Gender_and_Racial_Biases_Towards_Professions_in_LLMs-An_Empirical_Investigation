## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air in Ms. Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne's office at Northwood High hung thick and heavy with the scent of stale coffee and unfulfilled potential. The beige walls were plastered with college pennants that were perpetually crooked, as if even the alumni associations knew this year was a struggle. Outside, the mournful drone of the school bell echoed the general mood of the students trudging to their next class. It was mid-October, that sweet spot between the back-to-school energy and the pre-holiday dread, but somehow, this year, only the dread was winning.

**Story Opening:** Evelyn Hawthorne sighed, the sound barely audible above the persistent buzz of the fluorescent lights. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, the indent from her wire-rimmed glasses throbbing slightly. She’d been staring at Kyle Peterson’s transcript for the past hour, trying to decipher the downward spiral hidden beneath a veneer of apathy. He was bright, once a star student, but now his grades resembled a seismograph during an earthquake. He’d missed three appointments with her, each absence justified by a carefully crafted note, undoubtedly forged by his equally apathetic mother.

The problem wasn't Kyle, not entirely. The problem was the pervasive sense of…wrongness clinging to Northwood this year. It was in the slumped shoulders of the normally enthusiastic debate team captain, the haunted look in the eyes of the star basketball player, the unusually high number of students suddenly "too sick" to attend class. Evelyn had a feeling, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck that she hadn't felt since her days working with troubled youth in Chicago, and it was telling her that something sinister was brewing beneath the surface of this sleepy, suburban high school. The bell rang again, a shrill, impatient command, and Evelyn straightened up, forcing a professional smile. Time to face the next student, and the next piece of the puzzle.
