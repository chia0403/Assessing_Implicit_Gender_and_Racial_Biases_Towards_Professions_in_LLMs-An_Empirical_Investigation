The wind, a relentless prairie howler, buffeted the cab of Big Bertha, rattling the coffee in its dented stainless steel thermos and making Martha "Marty" Kowalski wish, not for the first time, she’d invested in one of those fancy air-ride suspension seats. She’d been on this stretch of I-80 through Wyoming for close to three hours, the only company the endless expanse of sagebrush and the low drone of her eighteen wheels chewing up the asphalt. The sun, a cold, indifferent eye, hung low in the western sky, painting the scrubland in shades of bruised purple and faded gold.

The setting was the heart of a late November afternoon. Marty was hauling a load of processed beef jerky - ironically, for "The Healthy Choice" brand - from Omaha, Nebraska, to a distribution center just outside of Reno, Nevada. The landscape was bleak, unforgiving, and deceptively beautiful in its starkness. The wind, the cold, and the isolation pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the solitary life she’d chosen. The radio crackled static, broken only by the occasional, distorted voice of a fellow trucker relaying weather updates.

Marty squinted, adjusting her mirrored sunglasses. She was a woman built like a linebacker, with hands that could crush a beer can and a heart, she'd like to believe, just as strong. Her grey hair, pulled back in a tight braid, peeked out from under her faded baseball cap, emblazoned with the logo of her late husband’s old trucking company, "Kowalski Hauling – We Deliver, Rain or Shine." It was a promise she intended to keep, even if the sunshine was a rare commodity these days. Up ahead, shimmering like a mirage on the heat-hazed horizon, was a sign: “Bitter Creek – Next Exit.” And Marty, with a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of the road itself, thought, "Time for a pit stop."
