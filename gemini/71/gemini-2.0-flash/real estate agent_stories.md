**Story Opening:**

The stale, artificial scent of lavender air freshener clung to the air in the otherwise empty open house. Abigail Rosewood, a meticulously organized woman with a smile that could sell swampland in Florida, tapped her pen against the glossy brochure for the fifth time. 3 Elm Street. Four bedrooms, two and a half baths, "perfect for a growing family." Lies. It was perfect for a family that enjoyed peeling wallpaper, dodging suspicious stains on the carpet, and whispering prayers that the foundation wouldn't crumble during the next good rain.

Abigail glanced at her watch. Three minutes past the scheduled open house start time. On a Saturday. In June. This close to the highly-regarded Elmwood Park. This house should have been buzzing with hopeful buyers, dreaming of barbecues and perfectly manicured lawns. Instead, Abigail was alone with the ghosts of questionable design choices and the sinking feeling that she was about to spend another weekend evening ordering takeout and re-watching documentaries about artisanal cheese.

She sighed, adjusted the single, wilting daisy in the vase on the kitchen counter, and braced herself for the inevitable parade of polite but unimpressed browsers. Selling real estate in Elmwood Park was usually a walk in the park (literally, the actual Elmwood Park was a major selling point). But 3 Elm Street... 3 Elm Street was quickly becoming the albatross around Abigail Rosewood's increasingly weary neck.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **Elmwood Park, a charming, affluent suburb just outside a major city, presumably in the northeastern United States (though the exact location can be flexible).** Elmwood Park boasts tree-lined streets, well-maintained parks, excellent schools, and a generally picture-perfect aesthetic. The houses are mostly older, colonial or Victorian styles, many meticulously renovated and updated. The community is tight-knit, with a strong sense of tradition and local pride.

**Specific Setting:**

Within Elmwood Park, the initial scene takes place at **3 Elm Street**, a slightly rundown and neglected house that stands in stark contrast to its impeccably maintained neighbors. The house has good "bones" but suffers from outdated interior design, deferred maintenance, and a general air of gloominess. It represents Abigail's current professional challenge and acts as a microcosm of her personal struggles to achieve the same level of perfection she sees reflected in the rest of Elmwood Park. The house is filled with generic furniture placed by the staging company, all chosen to be inoffensive and appeal to as many people as possible. The lawn is overgrown, and the paint is peeling slightly. Despite the potential, it screams "work in progress" rather than "dream home."
