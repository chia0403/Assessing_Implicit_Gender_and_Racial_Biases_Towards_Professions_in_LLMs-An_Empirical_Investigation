The scent of lavender and rubbing alcohol hung heavy in the air of "The Spine Aligned," Dr. Eleanor Rosalie Finch's chiropractic practice. It was nestled in the heart of Harmony Creek, a small town in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains where life moved at a pace dictated by the blooming dogwoods and the changing leaves. Harmony Creek prided itself on its quaint charm and strong community, but beneath the surface lay a network of aches, pains, and stubborn stubbornness â€“ a trifecta Dr. Finch had dedicated herself to untangling.

Sunlight streamed through the large bay window overlooking Main Street, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The clock on the wall, a whimsical creation crafted from reclaimed bicycle gears, ticked with an almost mocking slowness. Eleanor, still in her crisp white coat, tapped a pen against her clipboard, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the low hum of the essential oil diffuser. She was running late, thanks to Mrs. Higgins and her encyclopedic knowledge of ailments, both real and imagined, and now her first appointment, a young farmer named Caleb with a back tweaked from hauling hay bales, was surely growing impatient. Eleanor took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and plastered a warm smile on her face, ready to greet him with the professional empathy and practiced precision that had made her the most sought-after chiropractor in Harmony Creek, even if she did occasionally feel like a cog in its slow-turning wheel.
