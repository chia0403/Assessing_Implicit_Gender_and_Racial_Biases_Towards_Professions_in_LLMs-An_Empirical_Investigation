The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorneâ€™s beard, stinging his cheeks and threatening to tear the camera from his gloved hands. He hunched deeper into his thick wool coat, its pockets weighed down with extra batteries and memory cards, and squinted at the swirling snow. The monochrome world of Iceland in February was breathtaking, but treacherous.

He stood on the black sand beach of Reynisfjara, the basalt columns of Reynisdrangar looming like jagged, frozen giants in the distance. The roaring Atlantic pounded against the shore, each wave a frothing white monster desperately trying to swallow the land. Elias had been chasing this light for days, the ethereal, almost translucent glow that only seemed to exist in the moments before a snowstorm fully hit. It was a painter's dream, a photographer's holy grail, and Elias Thorne was determined to capture it.
