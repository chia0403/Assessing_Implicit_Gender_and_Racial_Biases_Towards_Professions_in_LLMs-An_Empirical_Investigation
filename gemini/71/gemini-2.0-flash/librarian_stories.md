The scent of old paper and lemon oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that was as familiar to Eleanor Ainsworth as her own heartbeat. Outside, the Yorkshire moors were being whipped into a frenzy by a November gale, but inside the Northcliff Library, a sanctuary built from weathered stone and quietude, the only sound was the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the reading room. Eleanor, Head Librarian of Northcliff Library, straightened the spine of a particularly battered copy of “Wuthering Heights” for the tenth time that morning. The Brontës were popular with the locals, particularly during these bleak, windswept months.

Eleanor glanced out of the leaded windows, watching the wind thrash at the ancient oaks surrounding the library. A lone figure, hunched against the wind and rain, was making their way up the cobbled path. Eleanor felt a prickle of unease. Northcliff Library was rarely busy on days like this. Who would brave the elements for a book? And more importantly, why did that figure seem to carry an air of…foreboding?
