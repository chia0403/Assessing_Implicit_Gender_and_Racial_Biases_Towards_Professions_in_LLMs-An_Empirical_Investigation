## Story Opening:

The dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun that pierced the gloom of the office. Agnes Petherington, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, squinted at the ledger before her. The numbers, a neat, if somewhat lifeless, procession of debits and credits, blurred at the edges. Outside, the relentless clang of the shipyard hammered a rhythm against the windows, a constant reminder of the world's relentless activity. Agnes, however, preferred the quiet order of her ledgers, the comforting certainty of balanced accounts. Today, however, even that sanctuary offered no solace. A nagging discrepancy, a mere five shillings out of place, had plagued her all week, a tiny pebble lodging uncomfortably in the shoe of her meticulous mind.

## Setting:

The year is 1938. The setting is the office of "Blackwood & Sons, Shipbuilders" in the bustling port city of Glasgow, Scotland. The office is a cramped and dimly lit space, tucked away at the back of the sprawling shipyard. The walls are painted a faded, institutional green, peeling in places to reveal the brick beneath. A large, oak desk dominates the room, cluttered with stacks of invoices, order forms, and bound ledgers, each meticulously labeled in Agnes’s precise hand. A single, bare bulb hangs from the ceiling, offering meager illumination. A small, cast iron fireplace sits cold in the corner, a testament to the long, damp Scottish winters. The air hangs heavy with the scent of coal dust, salt spray, and the faint, lingering aroma of pipe tobacco. Outside, the relentless cacophony of the shipyard – the clang of hammers, the hiss of steam, and the shouts of workers – constantly intrudes, a stark contrast to the silent world within Agnes Petherington's office.
