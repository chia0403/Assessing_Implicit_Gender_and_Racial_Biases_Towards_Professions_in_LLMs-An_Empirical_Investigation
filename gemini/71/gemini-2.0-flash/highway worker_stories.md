**Story Opening:**

The shriek of the grinder sliced through the morning mist like a rusty cleaver, a brutal counterpoint to the dawn chorus struggling to emerge from the surrounding woods. Harold "Harry" Abernathy winced, adjusted the safety glasses perched on his nose, and leaned into the machine again. It was a familiar dance, the grinding wheel singing its abrasive song as he worked to smooth the ragged edge of the newly patched pothole on Highway 17. His back ached, his lungs burned from the dust, and he hadn't had enough coffee, but at least the sun was starting to burn off the fog. One more pass, and he could move on to the next one. He hoped it wasn't as deep as this one.

**Setting:**

Highway 17, winding its way through the dense, evergreen forests of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. The highway itself is a two-lane black ribbon, cracked and worn despite its periodic patching. The surrounding scenery is a tapestry of towering firs, moss-draped maples, and the occasional glimpse of the shimmering blue waters of the Hood Canal through the trees. The air is perpetually damp, carrying the scent of pine needles and the salty tang of the nearby sea.

The specific location is a remote stretch of Highway 17, about fifteen miles outside the small logging town of Forks. The nearest house is at least a mile away, and the only sounds besides the traffic and Harry's machinery are the rustling of the wind in the trees and the occasional call of a raven. A portable traffic sign, flashing a warning message, stands a hundred yards up the road, creating a lone beacon in the still-dim morning light. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet isolation, broken only by the disruptive presence of modern industry.
