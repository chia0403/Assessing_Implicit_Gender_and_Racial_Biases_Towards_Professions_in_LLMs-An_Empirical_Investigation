## Story Opening:

The copper tang of static clung to Amelia Hayes like a second skin, a familiar perfume in the low-lit hum of her workshop. Tonight, the static was particularly aggressive, a chattering chorus threatening to drown out the weak, rhythmic pulse she was trying to isolate. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, held a soldering iron like an extension of her own hand, its tip hovering over a cluster of intricately woven wires on a vintage receiver panel. The air hung thick with the scent of burning flux and the faint ghost of forgotten cigarettes.

She hadn’t expected the coded message to arrive tonight. In fact, after months of silence, she’d almost convinced herself it was a prank, a cruel jest whispered on the airwaves by some bored ham operator. But the rhythmic blips, barely audible beneath the cacophony of interference, were undeniable. They matched the sequence, the key. It was real.

Amelia Hayes, radio technician and reluctant custodian of secrets, was about to plunge back into a world she’d desperately tried to leave behind.

## Setting:

Amelia’s workshop was a chaotic symphony of organized disarray. Tucked away in the converted attic of her small, weathered cottage on the windswept coast of Maine, it was a sanctuary, a haven carved out of the silence that often threatened to engulf her.

The room itself was cramped, its sloping ceiling making it difficult to stand upright in certain corners. Every surface was covered in a layer of dust, a testament to the years of forgotten projects that lay dormant, waiting for Amelia's touch. Shelves groaned under the weight of vacuum tubes, capacitors, resistors, and countless other electronic components. Half-dismantled radios, their innards splayed open like anatomical displays, sat on workbenches alongside oscilloscopes, signal generators, and multimeters, all bathed in the pale green glow of their digital displays.

Outside, the relentless roar of the Atlantic Ocean provided a constant soundtrack. The crash of waves against the rocky shore was a primal rhythm, a constant reminder of the untamed wilderness that surrounded her. From her small, grimy window, Amelia could see the blinking light of the distant lighthouse, a lonely sentinel against the inky blackness of the night. It was a beautiful, isolating place, perfect for hiding secrets and listening for whispers carried on the wind and across the airwaves.
