The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Hayes hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Eleanor Abigail Penhaligon's Tuesday morning.

Her small, meticulously organized desk, located in the outer sanctum of Mr. Archibald Hayes' private office, was her universe. A universe of staplers, strategically placed sticky notes, and a perpetually lukewarm cup of Earl Grey tea.
