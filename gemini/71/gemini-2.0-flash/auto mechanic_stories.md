## Story Opening:

The oily rag in Thomas Ashton’s hand was more comforting than his morning coffee had been. He wiped it across the grime-caked valve cover of a 1967 Mustang, the rumble of a nearby semi-truck vibrating through the concrete floor of Ashton Automotive. He’d been staring at the damn thing for twenty minutes, the rhythmic wipe-wipe-wipe a meditation against the rising tide of frustration. The engine block was stubborn, the bolts rusted tight, and the owner, a fussy professor with a tweed jacket collection that rivaled Thomas’s tool collection, was expecting it back by the end of the week. Thomas sighed, a puff of exasperation that mingled with the smell of gasoline and burnt rubber. He loved his work, the problem-solving and the satisfaction of bringing a dead engine back to life. But days like today, when every bolt fought him and the sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof turning the shop into an oven, made him question his life choices. He tossed the rag onto the workbench with a frustrated thud. "Alright, you metal beast," he muttered, cracking his knuckles, "let's see who's tougher."

## Setting:

**Ashton Automotive** is a sprawling, single-story metal building located on the outskirts of the small, dusty town of Redemption, Arizona. It's a place where the desert sun bleeds the color from everything, and the only relief from the heat comes from the ancient, overworked air conditioning unit that coughs and wheezes in the corner of the office. Inside, the shop is a controlled chaos of tools hanging on pegboards, spare parts stacked on shelves that threaten to collapse under their weight, and the lingering aroma of oil, grease, and WD-40. Classic cars in various states of disrepair occupy most of the bays, reflecting Thomas's passion for vintage vehicles. The walls are plastered with pin-up calendars from decades past, faded posters of muscle cars, and handwritten notes detailing the intricacies of different engine types. Outside, a gravel parking lot is littered with the carcasses of abandoned projects, baking in the relentless heat. Ashton Automotive isn't pretty, but it's Thomas's kingdom, a place where he feels most at home, surrounded by the familiar scent of metal and the promise of bringing forgotten machines back to life.
