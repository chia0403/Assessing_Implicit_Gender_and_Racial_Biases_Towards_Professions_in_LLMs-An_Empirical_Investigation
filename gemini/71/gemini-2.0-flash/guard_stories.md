The damp, salt-laced air clung to Gareth Rhys's thick, wool uniform, a constant reminder of his posting. He shifted his weight against the chipped stone of the watchtower, the cold seeping through the worn leather of his boots. Below him, the city of Port Azure sprawled like a sleeping beast, its cobblestone streets glistening with a recent drizzle. The early morning sun, struggling to break through the perpetually overcast sky, cast a weak, ethereal light on the rows of tightly packed houses, their red-tiled roofs a familiar comfort.

Port Azure was a city built on trade and whispers, nestled precariously between the jagged, unforgiving cliffs of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains and the churning grey expanse of the Azure Sea. The scent of brine and fish mingled with the richer aromas of spices and exotic wood that permeated the air, a heady blend that was both intoxicating and slightly nauseating after five years on the city watch. It was a place of opportunity and danger, of shimmering silks and hidden daggers, a place Gareth Rhys had come to both love and loathe. Today, however, something felt different, a prickling unease beneath the mundane rhythm of the port city waking. The gulls cried overhead, their calls echoing off the weathered stone of the harbor walls, a mournful soundtrack to the day that was just beginning.
