## Story Opening and Setting

**Opening:**

The clanging of metal against metal echoed through the pre-dawn chill, a familiar and grating symphony to Elara Willowbrook’s ears. Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she wrestled with the stubborn latch on the feed shed door, the metal cold against her gloved fingers. She grumbled a half-formed curse under her breath, a habit born of years spent battling recalcitrant farm equipment and equally stubborn livestock. Finally, with a grunt of triumph, the latch sprang open, releasing a wave of the comforting, earthy scent of hay and grain into the crisp morning air. Today, like every day, the animals were waiting.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds at **Willow Creek Wildlife Sanctuary**, a sprawling, 150-acre haven nestled in the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside. The sanctuary is a patchwork of habitats: dense woodlands teeming with deer and songbirds, sun-drenched meadows dotted with wildflowers, and a meandering creek that gives the place its name. Buildings include a large central barn, multiple specialized enclosures for injured or orphaned animals, a small veterinary clinic, and a quaint, rustic farmhouse where Elara and the other two permanent staff members reside. The air is clean and fresh, carrying the constant hum of nature – the chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves, and the distant hoot of an owl. The sanctuary is far enough from civilization to feel secluded, yet close enough to a small town to allow for easy access to supplies and veterinary assistance. It's a place of peace and healing, dedicated to the rehabilitation and release of injured or orphaned wildlife.
