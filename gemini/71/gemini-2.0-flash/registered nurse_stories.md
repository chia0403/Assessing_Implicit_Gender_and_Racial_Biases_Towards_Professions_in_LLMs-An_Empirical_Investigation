The clock ticked with malevolent precision, each second echoing the throbbing in Amelia Josephine Hayes's temple. At 3:17 AM, the fluorescent hum of St. Jude's Pediatric Unit felt less like a beacon of hope and more like an interrogation lamp. Amelia, RN, BSN, leaned against the nursing station counter, the cold metal seeping into her starched uniform. The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and the faint, cloying sweetness of grape-flavored antibiotics. Outside, a late-winter storm raged, lashing the hospital windows with icy rain.

St. Jude's itself was a sprawling labyrinth of muted pastel walls and linoleum floors, located in the heart of a blighted industrial district in Pittsburgh. Originally built in the 1950s, it had seen better days. Funding was tight, the staff perpetually overworked, and the building itself seemed to breathe a sigh of weary resignation. While newer, more modern hospitals glittered on the outskirts of the city, St. Jude's remained, a haven for families who couldn't afford anything better, a place where miracles were often hand-stitched with patience, prayer, and a whole lot of duct tape.
