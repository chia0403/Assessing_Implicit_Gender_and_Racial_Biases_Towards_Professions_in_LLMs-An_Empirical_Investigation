The humid Louisiana air clung to the skin like a second, unwelcome shirt, even this early in the morning. Marie Elena Dubois, her name a lilting melody against the swampy drawl of the surrounding bayou, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her oil-stained hand. The sun, a bruised peach bleeding over the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the moss-draped cypress trees that choked the waterway.

She stood perched precariously on a rickety wooden dock, her tool belt digging uncomfortably into her hip. The dock was attached to a small, brightly painted houseboat, its cheerful exterior a stark contrast to the grim reality of its neglect. Rusty metal flaked away from the window frames, and the faint smell of mildew hung heavy in the air. This was the Belle Ã‰toile, home to old Mr. Thibodeaux, and Marie was here to wrestle with its ancient, temperamental electrical system, a system that seemed to be held together more by prayer and baling wire than actual circuitry.
