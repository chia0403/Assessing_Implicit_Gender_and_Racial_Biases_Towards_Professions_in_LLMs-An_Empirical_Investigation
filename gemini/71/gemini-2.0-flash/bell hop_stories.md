## Story Opening:

The brass bells of the revolving door sang a familiar tune, a discordant clang that usually signaled a fresh wave of tourists or weary business travelers. Today, though, it heralded a disaster. Reginald Arthur Fitzwilliam, bellhop extraordinaire of the Grand Majestic Hotel, recognized the off-key warble instantly. The hinges, lubricated just last week, were already sticking again. Which meant, invariably, Mrs. Van Derlyn was on her way.

Reginald plastered on his most professional smile, a smile honed over five years of navigating the eccentricities and demands of the Grand Majestic's clientele. He smoothed the crisp fabric of his burgundy uniform and adjusted his pillbox hat, a gesture that had become almost involuntary. He needed to look the picture of composure, the epitome of five-star service. Because Mrs. Van Derlyn, with her diamond-encrusted poodle and her penchant for complaining about the slightest infraction, was the ultimate test. He took a deep breath, the scent of polished mahogany and fading lilies filling his lungs. Let the chaos commence.

## Setting:

The Grand Majestic Hotel stood proudly on Fifth Avenue in New York City, a monument to Gilded Age opulence. Its marble facade, tarnished by decades of city grime and exhaust, still hinted at the grandeur within. Sunlight streamed through the towering windows of the lobby, illuminating swirling Art Deco patterns etched into the floor. Crystal chandeliers, dusted religiously by the maintenance staff, hung like frozen waterfalls, casting shimmering light onto the plush velvet seating and the imposing reception desk fashioned from imported Italian marble. A grand staircase, lined with portraits of former hotel owners and famous guests, swept upwards towards the higher floors, a silent invitation to explore the labyrinthine corridors and lavish suites.

The lobby was a microcosm of the city itself â€“ a bustling hub where fortunes were made and lost, where romances blossomed and faded, and where Reginald Arthur Fitzwilliam, a cog in the machine, silently observed it all. The air hummed with the murmur of hushed conversations, the clatter of room service trays, and the distant strains of a live pianist, all blending into a unique symphony that defined the very essence of the Grand Majestic. The scent of expensive perfume, rich leather, and lingering cigarette smoke permeated the air, a heady cocktail that both exhilarated and exhausted Reginald in equal measure. This was his domain, his stage, and, for better or worse, his life.
