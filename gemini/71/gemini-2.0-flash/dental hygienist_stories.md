**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of Bright Smiles Dental in Oakhaven, Ohio buzzed with a relentless, high-pitched hum. It was 7:48 AM on a Tuesday, and the air already smelled of minty fluoride and the faintly metallic tang of amalgam. Outside, a weak, autumnal sun was struggling to break through the fog rolling in off the Cuyahoga River, painting the parking lot in shades of grey. Bright Smiles wasn't exactly *bright* in the early morning hours.

**Story Opening:**

Dorothy Lucille Albright, wearing her favorite scrub top - a cheerful pattern of tiny smiling teeth - meticulously wiped down the dental chair in Operatory Two. The squeak of the paper towel against the vinyl was almost hypnotic, a comforting routine before the day's onslaught of plaque and periodontal pockets. Usually, she found a certain satisfaction in the methodical work, the gentle precision required to coax pearly whites from neglected gums. Today, however, a gnawing anxiety kept her from fully immersing herself. It wasn't the usual pre-appointment jitters about a particularly nervous patient, or a looming root canal procedure she’d be assisting with. No, this was different. This felt…wrong. Like a chipped molar you can't stop running your tongue over, a constant, irritating awareness that something was about to go very, very bad.
