The salt-laced wind whipped off the North Sea, tugging at the brim of Astrid Bjornstadâ€™s well-worn wool hat and stinging her cheeks the color of ripe cranberries. The sky above, perpetually bruised and sullen, mirrored the tumultuous waves crashing against the rugged cliffs of Isle of Skye. Astrid, her canvas propped against a jutting rock formation, squinted against the glare, the wind a constant, insistent whisper in her ear, trying to steal the strokes from her brush.

She was perched precariously on the edge of Neist Point, the westernmost point of the island, a place where the land seemed to fight a losing battle against the relentless ocean. Below her, the lighthouse stood sentinel, its white beam a fleeting dance in the swirling mist. This was her sanctuary, her muse, the very air she breathed translated into swirling strokes of blue and grey on the canvas before her. The biting cold seeped through her thick gloves, numbing her fingers, but Astrid barely noticed. She was lost in the dance of light and shadow, the symphony of the wind and waves, all desperately trying to capture the soul of this wild, unforgiving landscape before the impending storm devoured it whole.
