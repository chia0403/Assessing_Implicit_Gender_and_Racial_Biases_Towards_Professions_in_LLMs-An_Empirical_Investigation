Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the hairdresser character's full name included:

**Setting:**

The setting is the small, but trendy, coastal town of Seabreeze, Oregon. The town itself clings precariously to the edge of the Pacific, its colorful storefronts and weathered clapboard houses huddled together against the sometimes brutal winds. While tourists flock to Seabreeze during the summer months for its charming boutiques, quirky art galleries, and dramatic cliffside views, the off-season brings a quieter, more introspective atmosphere. Seabreeze is known for its surprisingly vibrant arts scene, a tight-knit community of eccentrics, and a persistent rumor of a hidden pirate treasure buried somewhere along the coast. The time is a late November afternoon, just as the first hints of winter begin to nip at the air.

**Story Opening:**

Coraline Magnolia Finch slammed the door of "Shear Bliss," her salon, a little harder than she intended, the jingle of the bell above the door echoing unhappily in the late afternoon quiet. The scent of perm solution and hairspray hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of a day spent battling split ends, unruly curls, and Mrs. Abernathyâ€™s increasingly bizarre requests for rainbow-colored highlights. Coraline, a woman who generally embraced vibrancy, felt utterly drained. The grey, oppressive sky mirrored her mood. She'd hoped to catch the last sliver of sunset over the Pacific, a ritual that usually restored some of her spirit, but the thick fog rolling in rendered that impossible. It was going to be one of *those* nights, she could feel it in her bones, a night where the ghosts of bad perms and existential dread threatened to take over.
