## Story Opening:

The midday sun beat down on the cracked tarmac of Dust Devil Airfield, blurring the horizon with heat shimmer. Amelia Jane "AJ" Harding wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her grease-stained glove, the pungent smell of aviation fuel clinging to her skin. The wind, a hot, dry whisper, rustled through the skeletal remains of a tumbleweed caught on the barbed wire fence separating the airfield from the endless expanse of the Mojave Desert. AJ squinted at the dust devils dancing in the distance, tiny tornadoes kicking up miniature sandstorms, mimicking the larger chaos brewing inside her. Her stomach was a knotted mess of anticipation and apprehension, and the insistent thrum of her own heartbeat was almost louder than the drone of the ancient radial engine coughing to life in the belly of her beloved, and temperamental, P-51 Mustang, "Betsy." This was it. Today was the day she proved them all wrong.

## Setting:

The story is set in the **Mojave Desert, California, in the year 1957.** Dust Devil Airfield is a small, privately owned airfield carved out of the harsh landscape. It consists of a single, well-worn runway, a dilapidated hangar overflowing with spare parts and tools, a cramped office barely bigger than a closet, and a small, sun-bleached windsock that hangs limply in the still air. The surrounding landscape is barren and unforgiving, a vast expanse of scrub brush, rocky outcrops, and sand dunes stretching as far as the eye can see. The nearest town, a forgotten speck on the map called Salvation Flats, is a grueling hour's drive away and offers little more than a gas station, a diner, and a lingering sense of despair. The air is thick with the smell of dust, gasoline, and the faint, persistent aroma of Joshua trees. The heat is oppressive, the silence profound, and the isolation absolute. This is a place where only the toughest survive, a place where dreams either soar or wither and die under the relentless desert sun.
