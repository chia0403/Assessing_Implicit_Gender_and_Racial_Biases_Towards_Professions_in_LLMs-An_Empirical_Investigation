## Story Opening:

The stale coffee tasted like defeat. Tiffany Alexandria Davis, Paralegal Extraordinaire (at least, that’s what she called herself in her head), took another bracing gulp, willing it to fuel her through the mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf her desk. Outside, a relentless Chicago wind howled, rattling the aging windows of the Law Offices of Petrov & Klein. Inside, the atmosphere was just as bleak. Mr. Petrov, a man whose charisma peaked sometime around the Nixon administration, had been breathing down her neck all morning about the filing deadline for the Henderson vs. AgriCorp case, a Goliath-and-David scenario Tiffany was beginning to think even David couldn’t win.

He’d even had the gall to complain about the perfectly aligned tabs in the exhibit binders, claiming they were “too distracting.” Distracting from what? His own inability to string together a coherent argument? Tiffany suppressed a sigh and scrolled through the email chain, her eyes glazing over with legal jargon and deposition transcripts. She was close, so close to cracking the nut on this one, to finding the smoking gun that would prove AgriCorp knowingly contaminated the Henderson family’s farmland. But time was running out, and the weight of their hope, their desperation, felt heavier than any legal precedent in the state of Illinois.

## Setting:

The Law Offices of Petrov & Klein occupied the third floor of a pre-war building in the heart of Chicago’s Loop. The building itself was a testament to a bygone era of grandeur, with its ornate cornices and marble lobby, but inside Petrov & Klein, time seemed to have stood still sometime in the late 1980s. The walls were a drab beige, punctuated by framed, yellowing diplomas and motivational posters featuring eagles soaring above majestic mountains. The air was thick with the scent of dust, old paper, and the aforementioned stale coffee, which was brewed in a perpetually stained pot in the cramped, perpetually messy kitchenette. Tiffany’s desk, strategically positioned near the window for maximum natural light (and people-watching opportunities), was a controlled chaos of legal pads, sticky notes, and color-coded files. It was her little island of order in a sea of legal disarray, a sanctuary where she could sift through the minutiae of the law and, occasionally, dream of a world where justice prevailed.
