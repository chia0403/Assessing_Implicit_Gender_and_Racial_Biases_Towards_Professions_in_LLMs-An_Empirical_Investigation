## Story Opening:

The air in "Zenith Therapies" hung thick with the scent of lavender and regret. Amelia Rose Davies, her own shoulders aching despite the day just beginning, adjusted the plush bolster on the massage table. She’d been massaging away the tension of Northwood’s elite for seven years, but some days, like today, it felt more like absorbing it. The muted chime of the entrance announced her first client. Amelia took a deep breath, plastered on her professional smile, and hoped, desperately, it wasn't Mrs. Abernathy, the woman who complained about the temperature of the hot stones being "slightly too tepid, bordering on glacial."

## Setting:

**Zenith Therapies**, nestled on the second floor of a renovated Victorian building in the heart of the upscale Northwood neighborhood, was a sanctuary of curated calm. Sunlight streamed through sheer curtains, illuminating polished hardwood floors and strategically placed bamboo plants. The reception area was a minimalist masterpiece of smooth, white surfaces and calming artwork.

Amelia's massage room, "Tranquility Cove," was subtly different. Warmly lit by salt lamps, the walls were painted a soothing shade of seafoam green, adorned with framed photographs Amelia had taken herself – crashing waves on the Cornish coast, a snow-dusted forest in the Adirondacks. A small fountain trickled softly in the corner, masking the sounds of Northwood’s bustling streets below. A bookshelf overflowing with anatomy texts, aromatherapy guides, and dog-eared novels stood against one wall, a testament to Amelia's commitment to her craft and her penchant for escapism. The room felt less sterile, more lived-in, a reflection of Amelia's own blend of professional expertise and genuine empathy. It was a space where she hoped, despite the occasional Mrs. Abernathy, people could truly find a moment of peace.
