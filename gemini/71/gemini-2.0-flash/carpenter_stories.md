The scent of pine and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. It was in his beard, embedded in the creases of his weathered hands, and even seemed to emanate from the very pores of his skin. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of his workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the intricate carvings that adorned a half-finished rocking horse resting on his workbench.

Elias Thorne’s workshop, a ramshackle affair clinging precariously to the edge of the Whispering Woods just outside the village of Oakhaven, was more than just a place of business; it was his sanctuary. Its mismatched collection of hand tools, accumulated over a lifetime, were extensions of himself, his heart and hands intertwined with the grain of every piece of wood he touched. He’d inherited the workshop, along with his father's skill, a legacy carved in muscle memory and steeped in the tradition of generations of Thorne carpenters. Oakhaven, nestled in a valley carved deep by ancient glaciers, relied on his skill for everything from sturdy barns to delicate cradles.

But this morning, the usual rhythm of saw and plane felt discordant. Elias, his brow furrowed with worry, ran a calloused hand over the smooth curve of the rocking horse's mane. He had promised it to little Maisie Bellweather for her fifth birthday next week, but his heart wasn't in it. The whispers had started again, carried on the wind that swept through the Whispering Woods, whispers of something ancient and unsettling stirring in the depths. And Elias Thorne, carpenter of Oakhaven, knew in his bones that wood wasn't the only thing he’d soon be shaping.
