The fluorescent lights of the examination room hummed a relentless, buzzing song that vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth’s very bones. Outside, the late afternoon sun, filtered through the blinds, painted uneven stripes across the sterile, pale-green walls of her practice. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The faint scent of fluoride and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a smell she both reviled and strangely comforted in its familiarity.

She was perched precariously on the edge of her rolling stool, a tiny, almost dainty figure amidst the imposing machinery that defined her life. Eleanor had inherited Ainsworth Dental from her father, a gruff but skilled practitioner who believed in a no-nonsense approach to oral hygiene. Now, three years after his passing, she was striving to uphold his reputation while subtly infusing the practice with her own brand of compassionate care, a task that often felt as daunting as extracting a stubborn wisdom tooth.

Her practice, Ainsworth Dental, was located in the heart of Havenwood, a small, picturesque town nestled in the rolling hills of western Massachusetts. The town square, with its charming gazebo and antique shops, exuded a timeless, almost idyllic charm. But behind the friendly smiles and perfectly manicured lawns lay the same anxieties and insecurities Eleanor saw reflected in the mouths of her patients every day – anxieties she, too, felt gnawing at her.
