The dust tasted like defeat. Jebediah "Jeb" Calhoun spat a thick glob into the parched earth, watching it disappear in the relentless Texas sun. His calloused fingers, cracked and stained with dirt and grease, tightened around the worn leather reins. He squinted at the shimmering horizon, a blurred line of heat haze that mocked the meager trickle of water still clinging to the bottom of the stock tank.

Jebediah wasn’t a man prone to despair. He’d faced down drought, stampedes, and even a rogue twister that had rearranged his barn into something resembling abstract art. But this… this was different. This was a slow, agonizing death for the land, and for his livelihood.

The setting was the Broken Spur Ranch, nestled in the heart of Concho County, Texas. It was a sprawling expanse of sun-baked earth, dotted with scrub oak and mesquite, stretching as far as the eye could see. The main ranch house, a sturdy, single-story structure built of limestone, stood as a testament to Jebediah’s grandfather’s grit and determination. Faded paint clung stubbornly to the clapboard, whispering tales of bygone prosperity. The corrals, usually teeming with longhorn cattle, were now eerily empty, save for the skeletal remains of a few stray tumbleweeds. The air hung heavy with the scent of dry grass and the silent anticipation of rain that refused to come. The Broken Spur, once a vibrant artery of the Texas cattle trade, was slowly fading into the landscape, a victim of the unforgiving climate and the relentless march of time.
