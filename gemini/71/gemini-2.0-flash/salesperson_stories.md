Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a salesperson named Archibald "Archie" Finch:

**Setting:**

The story opens on a blisteringly hot Tuesday in mid-July. The air hangs thick and heavy with humidity over the faded, pastel-colored streets of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Tourists, their skin already lobster-red, shuffle along the boardwalk, clutching dripping ice cream cones and cheap souvenirs. The rhythmic crash of the waves against the sandy shore is a constant, almost hypnotic, background noise. A palpable air of desperation clings to the storefronts lining the main drag; each shop a gaudy display of t-shirts, seashell wind chimes, and promises of “authentic” pirate treasure.
**Story Opening:**

Archibald "Archie" Finch smoothed down his tie, the knot feeling suffocating in the oppressive heat. His starched white shirt, despite his best efforts, was already clinging uncomfortably to his back. He squinted at the shimmering asphalt of Ocean Boulevard, the glare bouncing back like a physical blow. He’d been stationed outside “Captain Bob’s Treasure Trove” for a solid hour, trying to intercept unsuspecting vacationers with his pitch: a revolutionary, rust-proof, beach-combing metal detector guaranteed to unearth untold riches. So far, his only interaction had been with a seagull that seemed intent on stealing his ham and cheese sandwich.

Archie sighed, a small, defeated sound lost in the cacophony of arcade bells and the barker's insistent calls. He was starting to think his boss, a man named "Captain" Bob who was about as salty as a pretzel, had a sick sense of humor assigning him to this spot. Not only was it the hottest corner in Myrtle Beach, it was also perpetually overshadowed by the giant, fiberglass pirate looming over the entrance. The pirate, with its painted grimace and outstretched treasure chest, seemed to mock Archie's own anemic sales record.

He adjusted his glasses, the cheap plastic frames digging into the bridge of his nose. “Another day, another dollar,” he muttered, though he knew, realistically, it was more likely to be another day, another zero. He just needed one good sale. Just one to prove he wasn't a complete and utter failure at the only job he could land after his… *unfortunate* incident with the synchronized swimming team sponsorship.

Just then, a family of four, sunburned and laden with beach toys, approached. Archie perked up, a flicker of hope igniting in his weary eyes. This could be it. This could be the sale that turned his day around. He plastered on his most winning smile, a smile he'd perfected in countless sales seminars, and stepped forward. "Excuse me, folks! Are you ready to discover the hidden treasures of Myrtle Beach?"
