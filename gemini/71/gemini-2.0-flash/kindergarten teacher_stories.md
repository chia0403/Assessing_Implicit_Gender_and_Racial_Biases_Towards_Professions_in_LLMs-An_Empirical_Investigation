The biting Chicago wind whipped off Lake Michigan and clawed its way down North Sheridan Road, making Mrs. Eleanor Penelope Bloom clutch her oversized tote bag tighter as she hurried towards Bright Beginnings Academy. Little snowflakes, like excited, jittery dancers, swirled around her ankles, threatening to make her slip on the already treacherous sidewalks. Eleanor, a bastion of calm and sunshine in a world often governed by chaos, hummed a jaunty tune under her breath – something she’d learned from her class, probably a ridiculously catchy song about a purple octopus riding a bicycle.

Bright Beginnings Academy wasn’t fancy. Tucked between a Korean BBQ restaurant and a dry cleaner, it occupied the ground floor of a weathered brick building that had seen better days. But inside, Eleanor had cultivated a haven of vibrant colors, the air thick with the scent of paint, Play-Doh, and the sweet, faintly unsettling aroma of perpetually damp, little-kid socks. Construction paper turkeys adorned the windows, their googly eyes peering out at the swirling snow, and a half-finished mural depicting a fantastical underwater world covered the longest wall. This was Mrs. Bloom’s kingdom, a kingdom where glitter reigned supreme and the only rule, unspoken but understood, was that everyone had a good time (even if "good time" meant meticulously lining up all the miniature plastic dinosaurs by height). Today, however, Eleanor felt a prickle of unease. The Christmas program was just a week away, and securing fifty five-year-olds in synchronized harmony, even for the fleeting duration of “Jingle Bells,” felt less like teaching and more like attempting to herd a flock of particularly energetic, sugar-fueled squirrels. And little Timmy Higgins, bless his heart, insisted on singing “Jingle Bells, Batman Smells” at the top of his lungs, despite Eleanor’s gentle, repeated corrections. This year, more than ever, she felt the need for an extra strong cup of coffee and a whole lot of patience.
