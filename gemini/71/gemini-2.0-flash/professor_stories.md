## Story Opening:

The scent of old paper and forgotten dreams clung to Professor Eleanor Vance like a second skin. Dust motes, disturbed by her restless hand, danced in the weak afternoon sunlight filtering through the grime-streaked windows of her office. Eleanor sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a monstrous timepiece that seemed to measure her life in seconds lost to unanswered questions. She’d been staring at the same passage in Ptolemy’s *Almagest* for the better part of an hour, the archaic Greek swimming before her eyes, its secrets stubbornly refusing to yield. Normally, she found solace in the celestial calculations, a connection to the cosmos that transcended the mundane. But today, even the ordered universe felt chaotic, mirroring the turmoil churning within her. It had been three weeks since… since the incident, and the silence from the authorities was deafening.

## Setting:

The setting is the cluttered, book-lined office of Professor Eleanor Vance, Professor of Ancient Astronomy at the prestigious but slightly crumbling Blackwood University. Blackwood, nestled in the remote and perpetually foggy hills of northern Vermont, is a university steeped in history and whispered rumors. The office itself is a testament to Eleanor’s lifelong obsession with the stars. Stacks of astronomical charts, ancient texts, and modern research papers threaten to topple from overflowing shelves. A large, ornate telescope, seemingly out of place in the small space, stands sentinel by the window, its brass tarnished with age. The walls are adorned with faded prints of constellations and portraits of influential astronomers, their eyes seeming to follow Eleanor’s every move. The overall impression is one of overwhelming knowledge, a beautiful chaos that only she can navigate, yet simultaneously, a feeling of being trapped, surrounded by ghosts of the past and the weight of unfulfilled potential. Outside, the campus is a labyrinth of gothic architecture, shrouded in a perpetual mist that lends an air of mystery and unease to everything. The air itself feels thick with secrets.
