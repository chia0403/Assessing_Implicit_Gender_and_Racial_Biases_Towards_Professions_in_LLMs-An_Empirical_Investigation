Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a plumber named Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins:

**Story Opening:**

The stench hit Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a brick wall the moment he crossed the threshold. It wasn't just the normal, everyday sewer-adjacent aroma he'd come to tolerate, almost appreciate, over twenty years in the plumbing business. This was different. This was…historical. He pinched the bridge of his nose, the oily scent of decades-old grime clinging to the hairs inside. "Lord," he muttered, pulling a thick rubber glove over his calloused hand. "What died in here?"

He squinted into the gloom, pulling out his trusty Maglite. The beam danced across peeling wallpaper, stained with a mosaic of water damage, and settled on the offending fixture: an antique, porcelain throne, its floral decorations chipped and faded, choked with something dark and… viscous.

Bart sighed. Mondays. They were always something special.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the basement bathroom of the **Oakhaven Manor**, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the Hudson River. The mansion, now a historic landmark and sporadically used as a venue for weddings and events, has seen better days. Dust motes dance in the weak sunlight filtering through a grimy, high window. Cobwebs cling to the corners of the room like macabre decorations. The air is thick with the musty scent of damp wood, decaying plaster, and, of course, whatever putrid concoction is currently residing in the toilet. The bathroom itself is a time capsule, a bizarre blend of ornate Victorian design and the lingering scent of forgotten disasters. A cracked, marble sink sits beneath a tarnished, brass faucet. The floor is tiled in a mosaic pattern of cracked and missing tiles, and a rusted radiator hugs one wall, radiating only the faintest whisper of warmth. This isn't just a plumbing job; it's an archaeological dig.
