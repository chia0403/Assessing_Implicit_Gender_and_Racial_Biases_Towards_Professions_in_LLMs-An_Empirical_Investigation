## Story Opening:

The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Davies' numb fingers as she stared out the rain-streaked window. Dawn was a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly grey over the churning Atlantic. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient, single-paned glass in its frame. Amy took a long, scalding sip of her tea, the bitter taste doing little to alleviate the icy knot in her stomach. Today was the day. Today, she was going to face him.

The handwritten note, tucked carelessly amongst the usual assortment of bills and junk mail that had arrived two weeks ago, had been simple, chillingly so: *He wants to talk. Ask for the lighthouse.*

The lighthouse. The very mention of it sent shivers crawling up her spine. She’d tried to dismiss the note, to tell herself it was some kind of morbid joke, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that it was real. And as a journalist, a damn good one, she couldn't ignore the promise of a story, no matter how much she wished she could.

## Setting:

The setting is the small, windswept island of Inishmore, off the west coast of Ireland. Amy is renting a sparsely furnished, one-room cottage near the docks of Kilronan, the island's main village. The cottage, called "Teach na Gaoithe" (House of the Wind) by the locals, is made of rough-hewn stone and painted a faded, almost pastel blue. It's isolated from the other houses, perched on a low cliff overlooking the crashing waves. The interior is cramped and damp, smelling faintly of peat smoke and salt air. A small, cast-iron stove in the corner provides a meager source of heat, while a single electric bulb hangs from the exposed rafters, casting a weak, flickering light. Outside, the landscape is dominated by jagged cliffs, windswept fields of emerald green, and the ever-present roar of the ocean. The Aran Islands are known for their ancient stone walls, crumbling forts, and a rich tradition of folklore and storytelling, all of which contribute to the island's stark beauty and sense of isolation. The lighthouse, a towering white structure, is visible from Amy's window, perched on the highest point of the island, a silent sentinel watching over the tumultuous sea.
