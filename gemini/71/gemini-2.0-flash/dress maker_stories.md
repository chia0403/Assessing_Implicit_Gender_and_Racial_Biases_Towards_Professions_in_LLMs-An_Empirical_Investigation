Okay, here is a story opening and setting with a dressmaker as the main character:

**Setting:**

The year is 1937. The location is a small, bustling village nestled in the Cotswolds, England, called Upper Slaughter. Rolling hills surround the village, dotted with sheep farms and quaint stone cottages. Time seems to move at a gentler pace here, yet the encroaching shadow of war in Europe casts a subtle unease, even amongst the idyllic beauty.

**Opening:**

Agnes Beatrice Hawthorne, her fingers nimble despite the perpetual prick of pins, squinted at the bolt of emerald green silk. Sunlight, streaming through the leaded glass window of her tiny workshop, illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air and caught the sheen of the fabric. “Just the colour for Lady Ashworth’s birthday ball,” she murmured to herself, her voice a soft melody against the rhythmic click of the scissors as she began to cut. Outside, the muffled sounds of the village – a milk cart rattling over cobblestones, children’s laughter echoing from the village green – provided a comforting backdrop to her work. But today, those sounds were almost drowned out by the persistent drumbeat of anxiety in Agnes' chest. Her normally steady hands trembled slightly as she considered the commission. It wasn't just the complexity of the gown – a swirling masterpiece of draped silk and delicate lace – it was the weight of expectation, the whispers she'd overheard in the market, the feeling that this dress, more than any she’d created before, had to be absolutely *perfect*. This dress could be her ticket away from Upper Slaughter, from the ghosts of the past that clung to her like the scent of lavender.
