The rusted wrench slipped in Elias Finch's grease-stained hand, sending a bolt pinging into the shadowed recesses beneath Mrs. Abernathy’s claw-footed bathtub. Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the humid, close air of the cramped bathroom.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of his headlamp, illuminating peeling wallpaper patterned with faded pink roses and cherubs.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of lavender bath salts battling the underlying, metallic tang of ancient plumbing. This was the fifth house call Elias had taken in the sweltering July heat of Zenith, Mississippi, a town where the sweet tea flowed as freely as the gossip, and the plumbing seemed determined to stage a collective revolt.  He pushed his sweat-dampened hair back from his forehead, the gesture smearing a streak of grime across his temple. Mrs. Abernathy’s leaky faucet was proving far more stubborn than he’d anticipated, and the setting sun painting the stained-glass window of the bathroom a bloody crimson did nothing to improve his mood.
