The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Millie" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she stared at the dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliff edge. Salt spray from the churning Atlantic below kissed her cheeks, a constant reminder of the raw, untamed beauty of Monhegan Island, Maine.  The clapboard siding of the Blackwood Manor, once a vibrant shade of seafoam green, was now a peeling, ghostly grey, mirroring the overcast sky.  Millie pulled her threadbare scarf tighter around her neck, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite her thick wool coat. This wasn't the kind of assignment she usually took – lifestyle pieces for the Portland Gazette were more her speed – but the disappearance of renowned novelist, Elias Blackwood, from this very house three months prior, had piqued her curiosity and her editor's interest.  The island, usually bustling with summer tourists, was now a desolate whisper of its former self, inhabited only by a handful of hardy year-round residents, all tight-lipped and wary of outsiders, especially journalists.  Millie, notepad and pen clutched in her gloved hand, took a deep breath of the salty air and started up the overgrown path, the crunching of dried leaves under her boots the only sound in the oppressive silence.  She had a feeling this story was going to be more than just a missing person piece.
