The late October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied spirals around Ms. Eleanor Ainsworth’s ankles as she hurried across the blacktop of Maplewood Elementary.  A faint smell of woodsmoke clung to the crisp air, a harbinger of the colder months to come. The setting sun cast long shadows from the squat, brick building, turning the playground equipment into looming silhouettes against the fiery backdrop. The last of her second-graders had just boarded the bus, leaving an unusual quiet in its wake. Eleanor, normally energized by the chaos of her classroom, felt a prickle of unease settle in her chest.  It wasn't just the encroaching darkness; something felt…off. The swing set swayed gently, despite the lack of wind at ground level, and a single, bright red crayon lay abandoned near the sandbox, a stark splash of color against the fading light.
