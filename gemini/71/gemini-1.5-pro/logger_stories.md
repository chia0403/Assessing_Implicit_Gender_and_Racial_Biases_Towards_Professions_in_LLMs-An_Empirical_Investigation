The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, clawing at Elias Blackwood’s thick wool jacket as if trying to peel it from his back.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots, a sound like dry bones protesting with each step. The air, crisp and clean enough to sting the nostrils, carried the scent of pine resin and damp earth, a familiar perfume Elias had inhaled since he was a boy.  He stood on the edge of Blackwood’s Claim, a swathe of ancient forest nestled high in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State, a legacy passed down through generations of Blackwoods.  The setting sun, a bruised purple orb sinking behind the jagged peaks, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched across the snow-dusted clearing, making the already imposing trees seem even more monstrous.  This forest was Elias’s lifeblood, his inheritance, and now, his burden.  The roar of the chainsaw, silent for the past week, echoed in the stillness, a ghost of the work that had stopped, a reminder of the trouble that had arrived in this isolated haven.
