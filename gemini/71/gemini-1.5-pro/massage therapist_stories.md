The Himalayan salt lamps cast a warm, apricot glow across the Serenity Now Massage Therapy clinic, painting the waiting area in hues of calm. Rain lashed against the large bay window, obscuring the usually vibrant view of the Seattle waterfront.  Eliza Jane Cartwright, her hands still slightly damp from the last client's aromatherapy massage, glanced at the clock. 6:58 pm. Two minutes until her final appointment of the day, and what a day it had been. From a tense CEO with knots the size of golf balls in his shoulders to a marathon runner whose legs felt like petrified wood, Eliza had kneaded and soothed away the stresses of the city, one aching muscle at a time.  The chime above the door tinkled, announcing the arrival of Mr. Henderson, her mysterious 6:00 pm regular. He always booked a deep tissue massage, never spoke a word during the session, and always paid in cash. Tonight, however, something felt different.  A flicker of movement in the reflection of the rain-streaked window caught Elizaâ€™s eye, and a prickle of unease ran down her spine. It wasn't Mr. Henderson.
