Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Vivienne Hawthorne's 42nd-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight view of the Chicago skyline.  The city lights, usually a vibrant tapestry below, were diffused into hazy, shimmering blobs.  Inside, the only illumination came from the cool glow of Amelia's computer screen and the muted desk lamp casting a warm circle on the polished mahogany surface.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm Earl Grey sat forgotten beside a stack of meticulously organized files, each labelled with the precise, no-nonsense efficiency that had propelled her to the position of Chief Operating Officer at Thorne & Wellington, one of the oldest and most prestigious law firms in the city.  The air in the office, usually crisp and scented with Amelia's signature blend of sandalwood and citrus, was thick with the tension of an unfinished battle.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain, was a deceptive calm before a storm that threatened to engulf not only Amelia, but the entire firm.
