The wind, a constant companion in the vastness of the Montana plains, whipped Amelia Grace Blackwood's hair across her face as she surveyed the land. The sky, a bruised purple and orange canvas of a setting sun, cast long, dramatic shadows across the rolling hills of the Blackwood Ranch.  Generations of Blackwoods had worked this land, their lives etched into the very soil, and Amelia, the latest in a long line of stubborn, resilient ranchers, felt the weight of that legacy in her bones.  The ranch house, a sturdy, two-story structure built from weathered wood and local stone, sat nestled in the lee of a small rise, smoke curling invitingly from its chimney.  October had arrived, painting the aspen groves a fiery gold against the deep green of the pines, and a crispness hung in the air, a harbinger of the long winter to come. This year, however, the crispness carried a different edge, a tension that Amelia couldn't quite put her finger on, a feeling that something was amiss in the familiar rhythm of the land.
