The cabin lights of the Avianca Airbus A330 dimmed, casting a soft, ethereal glow on the sleeping passengers. Outside, the bruised purple canvas of the pre-dawn sky hinted at the imminent sunrise over the Andes.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of recycled air and the faint ghost of someone's duty-free perfume.

This particular flight had been relatively uneventful, save for a minor turbulence spell over the Caribbean and a particularly demanding passenger in 27B who'd insisted on a gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free meal despite not having pre-ordered one.  But Isabella had a feeling, a prickling at the back of her neck, that the calm was a fragile illusion, a deceptive prelude toâ€¦ something.  She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but the air felt charged, pregnant with a silent anticipation.
