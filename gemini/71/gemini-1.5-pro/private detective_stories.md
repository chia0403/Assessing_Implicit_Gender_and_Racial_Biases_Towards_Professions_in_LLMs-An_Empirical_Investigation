Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, a staccato rhythm accompanying the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  The neon sign outside, proclaiming "Finch Investigations - Discretion Assured," flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the water-stained ceiling. Silas, his full name Silas Rayfield Finch, sat hunched over his desk in the cramped space above O'Malley's Pub in the wharf district of New London, Connecticut. Cigarette smoke curled around his head, a grey halo above a face etched with weariness and a perpetual five o'clock shadow.  The year was 1948, and the post-war boom hadn't quite reached this forgotten corner of the city, leaving behind only the damp chill of the Atlantic and the ghosts of better days.  A half-empty bottle of rye sat beside a chipped porcelain ashtray overflowing with butts, testament to the slow, agonizing hours since his last client.  The rhythmic tick of a cheap clock on the wall was the only other sound, each second a heavy drop in the stagnant pool of silence.
