The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the ancient, leaded windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the storm brewing within him.  It was late November in the small, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged Northumberland coast.  The colourful cottages that clung precariously to the cliffs, usually cheerful beacons against the grey sea, were tonight hunched and subdued under the oppressive sky. Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the hallway and the crackling of the coal fire in the small waiting room stove.  Elias, his broad shoulders slumped with weariness, stared out at the turbulent water. He'd been operating for twelve hours straight, the scent of antiseptic still clinging to his skin like a second, unwelcome layer.  The fishing trawler, the *Sea Serpent*, had capsized just outside the harbour, and the survivors, battered and hypothermic, had pushed his small, rural practice to its limits.
