The relentless Arizona sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Springs, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Inside the cool, sterile confines of Harmony Springs Pharmacy, Elias Thorne, meticulously organized as always, polished the antique brass mortar and pestle that sat on the counter.  It was a relic from his grandfather, the pharmacy's founder, and Elias considered it a tangible link to a simpler time, a time before insurance companies and pharmaceutical reps dictated the rhythm of his days. The bell above the door chimed, a discordant clang in the otherwise peaceful afternoon, announcing the arrival of his first customer.  Elias tucked the polishing cloth into his pocket and plastered a professional smile on his face.  He knew Harmony Springs, knew its inhabitants, their ailments and their secrets, and he braced himself for whatever this scorching Tuesday had in store.
