The clatter of pots and pans was Elara Thistlewick's morning symphony.  Her small kitchen, tucked away in the back of The Wandering Wisp, a ramshackle tavern nestled between the Whispering Woods and the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, was a whirlwind of flour dust and the fragrant steam of simmering spices.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges, filtering through the grimy windowpanes and illuminating the well-worn wooden countertop where Elara, her fiery red braids escaping their tie, expertly kneaded dough for the day's bread.  The Wisp wasn't much to look at from the outside – its paint peeled like sunburnt skin and the sign creaked ominously in the slightest breeze – but Elara had transformed its kitchen into her sanctuary, a place where she could weave culinary magic from the simplest ingredients.  This morning, however, the air hummed with a different kind of energy, a tension that crackled like lightning before a storm.  Something was brewing, and Elara, with her uncanny knack for sensing the shift in the wind, knew it had nothing to do with the stew bubbling on the stove.
