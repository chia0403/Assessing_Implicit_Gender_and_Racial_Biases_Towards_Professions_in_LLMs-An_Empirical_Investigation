The biting November wind whipped around the corner of Hemlock Lane, rattling the windowpanes of Seraphina Iris Thorne's dressmaking shop. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, lavender, and the faint metallic tang of pins.  Golden light from a sputtering gas lamp illuminated the cluttered workspace: bolts of velvet and silk piled high on shelves, half-finished gowns draped over dress forms, and a scattering of pearl buttons glinting on the worn wooden floor. Seraphina, her nimble fingers stained with chalk and ink, hunched over a sketchpad, the flickering lamplight casting long shadows across her sharp cheekbones. Outside, the cobbled streets of Hollow Creek, a small, isolated town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, lay shrouded in a pre-winter gloom, a silence broken only by the occasional howl of the wind and the distant, rhythmic clang of a church bell.  It was a town steeped in secrets, whispered stories, and age-old traditions, a place where the line between reality and folklore often blurred, and tonight, Seraphina felt that blur more keenly than ever.
