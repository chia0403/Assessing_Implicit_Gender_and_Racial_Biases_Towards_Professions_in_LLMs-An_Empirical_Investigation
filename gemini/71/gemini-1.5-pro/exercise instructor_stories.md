The relentless Miami sun, already a brutal force at 7:00 AM, beat down on the turquoise yoga mats spread across the rooftop of the Solara Luxury Condominiums.  A gentle ocean breeze, scented with salt and sunscreen, did little to temper the heat.  Beatrix "Bea" Rodriguez, clad in vibrant coral leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted her microphone headset.  Her dark hair, pulled back in a high ponytail, swayed with each movement.  Twenty expectant faces, a mix of tanned retirees and toned millennials, gazed up at her.  Bea flashed a dazzling smile, the kind that could simultaneously melt butter and inspire fifty burpees. "Good morning, Solara!  Ready to sweat out those toxins and salute the sun?" Her voice, amplified through the speakers, resonated across the rooftop, echoing faintly against the backdrop of the waking city. The turquoise water of Biscayne Bay glittered in the distance, a shimmering promise of cool relief after the burn that was about to commence.
