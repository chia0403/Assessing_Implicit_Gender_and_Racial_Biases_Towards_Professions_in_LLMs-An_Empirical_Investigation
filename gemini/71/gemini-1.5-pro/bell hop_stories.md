The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh, pushing in gusts of rain-slicked Chicago air that smelled of exhaust fumes and hotdogs.  Inside, the lobby glittered, a cathedral of polished marble and crystal chandeliers.  Beneath the opulent glow, Elias Finch, all of nineteen years old and clad in a crisp, burgundy uniform with brass buttons, shifted his weight from one foot to the other, the worn leather of his bellhop shoes squeaking softly on the pristine floor.  It was a slow Tuesday evening in November, the kind where the only guests seemed to be the permanent residents – aging socialites who treated the Majestic as their personal fiefdom and tipped in condescending smiles rather than dollars. Elias, however, was on high alert. Tonight, the notorious "Orchid Thief" was rumored to be targeting the hotel’s prized collection of rare orchids, displayed in the penthouse conservatory during the annual Floralia exhibition.
