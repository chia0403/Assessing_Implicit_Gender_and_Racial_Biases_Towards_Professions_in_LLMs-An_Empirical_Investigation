The relentless Cairo sun beat down on the dusty window of "Pharaoh's Flights," baking the already faded hieroglyphics adorning the glass. Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, sighed and dabbed at a bead of sweat trickling down her temple.  The air conditioner, affectionately nicknamed "Tut's Tomb" for its glacial inefficiency, wheezed pathetically in the corner, offering little respite. Amelia's travel agency, tucked between a bustling spice market and a rather dubious-looking hookah lounge, wasn't exactly glamorous. But it was hers, a testament to her lifelong dream of bringing the wonders of Egypt to the wider world, one meticulously planned itinerary at a time. Today, however, the only wonder Amelia felt was how she was going to survive the afternoon without spontaneously combusting. The scent of cinnamon and cardamom drifted in from the market, mingling with the sweet, cloying aroma of the hookah smoke, creating a heady, almost hallucinogenic perfume.  A lone fly buzzed lazily around a half-eaten date, abandoned on her desk amidst a scattering of brochures and flight confirmations.  Outside, the cacophony of Cairo – car horns blaring, donkeys braying, vendors hawking their wares – rose and fell in a familiar, chaotic symphony. It was just another sweltering Wednesday in the heart of Egypt.
