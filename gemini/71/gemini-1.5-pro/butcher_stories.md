The biting wind, scented with brine and woodsmoke, whipped around Elias Thorne as he hoisted a freshly slaughtered pig onto the iron hook in his shop.  The sign above, "Thorne's Fine Meats," creaked rhythmically in protest, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Elias, his thick fingers already reddening in the pre-dawn chill, ignored both the wind and the sign. His attention was solely on the heavy carcass, the pearly pink flesh gleaming under the single gas lamp that illuminated the sawdust-covered floor of his butcher shop. Nestled between a fishmonger and a bakery perpetually exuding the aroma of burnt sugar, Thorneâ€™s Fine Meats was a small, unassuming establishment in the port town of Oakhaven, a place where the salty air carried whispers of both fishing tales and darker, more unsettling rumors. The cobblestone streets, usually bustling with life, were deserted at this hour, the only sound Elias's own ragged breathing and the distant clang of a ship's bell echoing across the harbor.  Today was the annual Harvest Festival, and Elias had a mountain of orders to fill before the townsfolk descended upon his shop, eager to stock their larders for the coming winter.
