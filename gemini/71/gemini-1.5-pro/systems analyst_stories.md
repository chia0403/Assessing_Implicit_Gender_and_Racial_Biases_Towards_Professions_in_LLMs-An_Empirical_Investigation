Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings headquarters, blurring the already fading twilight of a November evening in Chicago.  Inside, the air thrummed with the low hum of servers and the frantic click-clack of keyboards.  Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez, a systems analyst with an uncanny ability to decipher code like ancient hieroglyphs, stared intently at the cascading lines of text on her monitor.  Her brow furrowed, a single strand of dark hair escaping her neatly tied bun. Something was off. The system, Zephyr's newly implemented logistics platform, dubbed "Hermes," was exhibiting anomalous behavior â€“ tiny fluctuations in processing speed, almost imperceptible, but enough to prickle her finely tuned instincts.  These weren't bugs; they felt...deliberate.  And if they were deliberate, that meant someone was inside the system, playing games where they shouldn't be.
