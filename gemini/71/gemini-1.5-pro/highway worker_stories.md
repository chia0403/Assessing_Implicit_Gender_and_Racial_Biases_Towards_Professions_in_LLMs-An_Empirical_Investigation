The sun, a malevolent orange eye low on the horizon, glared off the cracked asphalt of Interstate 70. Dust devils danced across the shimmering heat haze, twisting like miniature tornadoes across the barren landscape of western Kansas. Here, where the only landmarks were the occasional tumbleweed and the endless, straight ribbon of road, Elijah Jedediah Jones stood, his orange safety vest practically glowing against his sun-weathered skin.  He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, the gritty dust clinging to his skin like a second layer.  A battered thermos, dented and faded, rested at his feet beside a pile of bright orange cones marking off a section of the shoulder where a pothole the size of a small dog had opened up, seemingly overnight.  Elijah squinted at the approaching semi-truck, its engine a low growl in the stillness, and sighed. This was going to be a long, hot day.
