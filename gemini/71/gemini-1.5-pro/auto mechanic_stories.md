The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Texaco parking lot, carrying the scent of stale gasoline and burnt coffee.  Frost glittered on the weedy edges of the lot and clung to the rusted chain-link fence surrounding  "Rosie's Roadside Repairs."  Inside the single, cavernous garage bay, a single bare bulb cast a harsh light on Eleanor Beatrice Vance as she wrestled with the rusted exhaust manifold of a '72 Ford pickup.  Grease smudged her knuckles, her short, cropped hair escaping from beneath her oil-stained baseball cap, and a determined frown etched itself on her face.  The rusty bolt wouldn't budge, and the pickup's owner, a burly man named Big Ed, was due back any minute, expecting a miracle.  Rosie's, named after Eleanor's grandmother who'd taught her everything she knew about engines, was the only thing Eleanor had left of her family, and she wasn't about to let some stubborn bolt ruin it.
