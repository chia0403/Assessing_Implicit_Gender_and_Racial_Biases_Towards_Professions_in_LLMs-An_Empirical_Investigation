The rusty bell above the door of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" jingled merrily, a discordant counterpoint to the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  Salt spray hung in the air, thick and clinging, a constant reminder of the sea that gnawed at the edges of Port Blossom, Maine.  The year was 1923, and the town, a collection of weather-beaten clapboard houses huddled against the relentless Atlantic wind, felt as though it existed at the very edge of the world. Finnian, a wiry man with eyes the colour of a winter sky and hair the shade of freshly brewed coffee, leaned against his barber chair, a well-worn copy of the "Portland Press Herald" folded neatly in his lap.  The shop, small and dimly lit, smelled of bay rum, pipe tobacco, and the faint, metallic tang of scissors recently sharpened.  A single, bare bulb cast long shadows across the checkered linoleum floor, highlighting the faded glory of the framed sepia photographs adorning the walls: stern-faced fishermen, proud schooners, and a surprisingly vibrant image of a younger Finnian, hair slicked back, posing with a prize-winning marlin.  The silence in the shop was broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, patiently counting down the minutes until the next customer, or perhaps the next storm.
