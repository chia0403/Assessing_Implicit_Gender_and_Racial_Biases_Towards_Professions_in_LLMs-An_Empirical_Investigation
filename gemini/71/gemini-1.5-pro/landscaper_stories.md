The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson oak leaves he was raking into a neat pile.  Frost crunched under his worn work boots as he surveyed Mrs. Abernathy's sprawling backyard in the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut.  A thin layer of ice glazed the koi pond, and the skeletal branches of the Japanese maple clawed at the overcast sky.  Elias, bundled in a thick flannel shirt and his trusty Carhartt jacket, exhaled a plume of white breath. Winter was coming, and with it, the end of another landscaping season.  He had one last job to finish here – winterizing Mrs. Abernathy's prized rose bushes – before he could shut down for the year and retreat to the warmth of his small cabin in the woods. But something about the stillness of the air, the way the shadows stretched long and thin across the manicured lawn, made Elias uneasy. It was more than just the approaching winter.  It felt like something else was waiting, hidden amongst the browning hydrangeas and dormant perennials.
