The flickering fluorescent light above buzzed in a rhythm that mirrored the thrum of anxiety in Amelia Grace Hawthorne's stomach.  It was 5:58 pm on a Thursday, the kind of late-summer evening that held the promise of barbeques and fireflies, but for Amelia, it meant only two more minutes of politely fending off increasingly irate callers demanding to speak to Mr. Henderson, who, as she'd explained for the hundredth time that day, was on a "fishing trip."  The air in the reception area of Henderson & Sons Legal Associates, usually thick with the scent of stale coffee and Mrs. Henderson's overpowering lilies, was now tinged with the metallic tang of an approaching thunderstorm. Rain lashed against the large plate-glass window overlooking a deserted Main Street in the small town of Oakhaven, Illinois. The town, charmingly quaint by day, took on a decidedly gothic feel in this weather, the Victorian architecture looming like disapproving sentinels.  Amelia glanced at the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging with a hypnotic regularity.  5:59 pm. One more minute.
