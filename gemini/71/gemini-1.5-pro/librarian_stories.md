The frosted breath of November clawed at the mullioned windows of the Parnassus Public Library, etching fleeting ferns of ice across the glass. Inside, nestled amongst the towering stacks and the hushed whispers of turning pages, Eleanor Vance, the head librarian, meticulously sharpened a pencil.  The scent of aged paper, leather, and the faintest hint of woodsmoke from the nearby fireplace filled the air, a comforting balm against the encroaching chill. Parnassus, nestled in the heart of the Vermont mountains, was a town steeped in quietude and the rhythm of the seasons.  Eleanor, a woman as sturdy and enduring as the ancient maples lining Main Street, had presided over the library for over thirty years, becoming as integral to the town’s fabric as the church bell or the general store. This particular Tuesday morning, however, held an unusual stillness, a preternatural quiet that pricked at the edges of Eleanor’s awareness.  Something was different. Something was amiss.
