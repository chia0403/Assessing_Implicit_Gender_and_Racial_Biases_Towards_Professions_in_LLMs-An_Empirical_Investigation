This was her third delivery of the day, and the Fitzgerald mansion, looming before her like a grand, timber-framed sentinel, was proving to be as demanding as its reputation suggested.  Every room, from the vaulted-ceiling great room to the six opulent bedrooms, was undergoing a complete overhaul, orchestrated by Eleanor, to transform it into a winter wonderland of rustic chic for the holiday season.
