The persistent drizzle seemed to mirror Dr. Elias Thorne's mood.  Grey skies pressed down on the small town of Port Blossom, Maine, a place where the scent of salt and pine usually invigorated him, but today only amplified the dull ache behind his eyes.  His dental practice, nestled between a perpetually closed antique shop and Mrs. Higgins' bustling bakery (the aroma of cinnamon rolls a constant temptation), usually hummed with the low whir of drills and the cheerful chatter of his patients.  But today, a Tuesday in late November, the only sound was the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the waiting room, a sound Elias suddenly found intensely irritating.  He glanced out the window, watching the rain slick the already glistening streets, and sighed.  This was the slowest day he'd had in months, and the silence was starting to feel oppressive.
