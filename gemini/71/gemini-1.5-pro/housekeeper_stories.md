The biting November wind rattled the leaded panes of Ashworth Manor, a sound Elizabeta "Liza" Petrova had come to associate with the creeping loneliness of late autumn in the Yorkshire Dales.  Grey clouds scudded low across the moors, obscuring the usually majestic peaks, and casting long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled hawthorn trees that lined the long, gravel driveway. Inside, the vastness of the manor seemed to amplify the silence, broken only by the rhythmic swoosh of Liza’s mop against the polished flagstones of the grand entrance hall.  A single shaft of weak sunlight, filtering through the stained-glass depiction of a griffin clutching a sword, illuminated the swirling dust motes dancing in the air – the only visible companions to Liza in the echoing emptiness.  Lord and Lady Ashworth were in London for the season, leaving Liza, the sole housekeeper, as the silent guardian of their sprawling, centuries-old estate.
