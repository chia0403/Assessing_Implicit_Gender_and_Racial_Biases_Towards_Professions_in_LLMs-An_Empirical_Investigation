The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  The crisp January air, though painful on exposed skin, held the exhilarating scent of pine and damp earth that she associated with the Wildwood Animal Sanctuary.  Nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, the sanctuary was a haven for rescued and rehabilitated animals, a place where the cacophony of city life faded into the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. Amy, bundled in her thick parka and snow boots, was the head primate caretaker, a role she cherished despite the long hours and occasionally demanding residents.  The sun, a pale disc barely peeking over the snow-dusted peaks, cast long shadows across the sprawling enclosure, a complex network of interconnected habitats designed to mimic the animalsâ€™ natural environments.  This morning, however, an unnatural silence hung in the air, a silence that prickled the hairs on the back of Amy's neck and sent a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.
