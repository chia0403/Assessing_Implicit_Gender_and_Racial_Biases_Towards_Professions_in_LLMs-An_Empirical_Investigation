The biting wind whipped snow against the windows of the Darrow Animal Clinic, rattling the panes in their frames.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and something faintly, worryingly sweet. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her auburn braid coiled tightly at the nape of her neck, knelt beside a whimpering Labrador, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The clinic, nestled in the heart of the small, isolated town of Havenwood, Colorado, was usually a haven of calm, but tonight, the silence was punctuated by the dogâ€™s distressed whimpers and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick seeming to amplify the unsettling sweetness in the air.  Outside, the blizzard raged, cutting Havenwood off from the rest of the world, a swirling white curtain obscuring even the familiar glow of the gas station across the street.  It was going to be a long night.
