The salt-laced wind whipped through the open windows of Seraphina Iris Moreau's studio, scattering charcoal dust and rustling the half-finished canvases that leaned against the peeling plaster walls.  Her studio, a converted lighthouse keeper's cottage perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a testament to organized chaos.  Paint tubes squeezed dry lay beside brushes stiff with dried crimson and cobalt.  A chipped porcelain palette, smeared with the ghosts of a hundred sunsets, sat precariously on a stack of art books dedicated to the Dutch Masters.  Outside, the sky hung low and bruised, mirroring the turbulent waters below, the only sound the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks and the distant, mournful cry of a gull.  The Isle of Skye, in late November, was a place of stark beauty and unforgiving weather, a perfect reflection, Seraphina thought, of the turmoil within her own soul.
