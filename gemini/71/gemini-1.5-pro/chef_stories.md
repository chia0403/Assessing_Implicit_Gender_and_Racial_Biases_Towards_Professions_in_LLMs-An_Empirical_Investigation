The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Rousseau, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tucked them behind her ear, a futile gesture as the next gust undid her work.  Before her, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling laundromat, sat "Le Petit Chou", its warm yellow awning a beacon against the grey Parisian sky.  Amy, head chef and reluctant owner of the tiny bistro, inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of buttery croissants and freshly brewed coffee a balm against the chill.  Inside, the small dining room hummed with the quiet murmur of conversation and the clinking of cutlery â€“ a symphony of breakfast in the heart of the Marais. This morning, however, the usual comforting rhythm felt tinged with a nervous energy, an anticipation Amy couldn't quite place.  She pushed open the heavy wooden door, the tiny bell above it jingling a welcome, and stepped into the warmth, ready to face whatever the day held.
