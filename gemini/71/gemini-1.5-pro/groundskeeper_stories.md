The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's cheeks, turning them the same ruddy hue as the fallen maple leaves he was currently wrangling into a neat pile. Frost crunched under his heavy work boots as he surveyed the grounds of Eventide Manor, a sprawling Victorian edifice that seemed to sigh under the weight of the grey, overcast sky.  Iron gates, intricately wrought with ivy now withered and brown, marked the entrance to the estate, and a long, winding drive, bordered by overgrown box hedges, disappeared into the gloom of the approaching twilight.  Eventide had seen better days, a fact reflected in the peeling paint of its gables and the untamed wilderness slowly encroaching on its once meticulously manicured lawns.  Elias, however, found a certain melancholic beauty in its decay. For the last fifteen years, he'd been the sole caretaker of these grounds, the silent witness to the slow, inevitable surrender of grandeur to the relentless march of time.  He knew every dip and hollow of the land, every gnarled root that snaked beneath the surface, every whispering secret the old house seemed to breathe into the wind.  And on this particular, frigid afternoon, he felt a distinct unease settling over him, a premonition that the secrets Eventide held were about to be unearthed.
