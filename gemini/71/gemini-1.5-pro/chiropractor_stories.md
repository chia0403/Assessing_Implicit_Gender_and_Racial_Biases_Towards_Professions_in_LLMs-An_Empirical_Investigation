The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically in the window of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, casting a flickering orange light onto the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  The town, nestled between the brooding Cascade Mountains and the restless Pacific, was perpetually shrouded in a damp mist that seeped into the very bones of its clapboard houses. Tonight, the fog was thick enough to choke on, swirling like phantom dancers around the gas lamps that lined Main Street. Inside, Elias Thorne, D.C., rubbed his calloused hands together, the small pops and clicks a familiar symphony of his profession.  The waiting room, with its worn leather chairs and the faint scent of eucalyptus, was empty.  Rain lashed against the windowpane, a mournful counterpoint to the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Elias glanced at it â€“ 11:57 pm.  He was about to lock up for the night when a frantic rapping echoed through the stillness.
