The chipped paint of the rainbow mural on Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom wall seemed to vibrate with the energy of a Monday morning. Sunlight, fractured by the prism of a dangling crystal wind chime, splashed across miniature tables and chairs sized for five-year-olds.  Room 2B, at Sunny Meadows Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, usually hummed with a predictable, if chaotic, rhythm.  But today, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the oversized ladybug clock above the whiteboard. Mrs. Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, stood by the window, a half-unpacked box of glitter glue and construction paper at her feet, a frown creasing her usually cheerful face.  Something was amiss.  The sweet, slightly-musty scent of finger paint and playdough wasâ€¦gone.
