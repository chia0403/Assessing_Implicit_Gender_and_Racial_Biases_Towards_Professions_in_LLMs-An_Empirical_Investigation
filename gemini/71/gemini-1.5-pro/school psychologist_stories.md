The rusted swing set creaked a mournful tune, and the faded hopscotch grid was dusted with frost. The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the bare branches of the ancient oak that dominated the schoolyard, making the scene feel more like a gothic etching than a place where children laughed and played just hours earlier.  Eleanor clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the chill seeping through her wool coat.  She wasn't scheduled to see any students today, but a frantic voicemail from Principal Davies about a concerning drawing made by a typically bright and bubbly second-grader, Thomas Bellweather, had prompted her immediate return to the school.  The message had been vague, laced with an unsettling urgency that pricked at Eleanor's professional instincts.  She reached the side entrance, fumbled with her keys in the biting cold, and stepped inside, the fluorescent hum of the empty hallways echoing around her like a nervous whisper.
