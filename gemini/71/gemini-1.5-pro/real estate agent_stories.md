The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Amelia Hayes as she adjusted the "For Sale" sign on the wrought-iron fence.  The Victorian mansion loomed behind her, a gothic behemoth of peeling paint and boarded-up windows, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Hollow Creek, Virginia.  Amelia, bundled in a camel-colored coat and sensible boots, shivered, not entirely from the cold. This house, known locally as the Whispering Pines Estate, had a reputation. A reputation that extended beyond its dilapidated state and into the realm of the unsettling, the whispered-about, the kind of stories that made children avoid the street after dark.  Amelia, however, wasn't easily spooked.  She was a pragmatist, a realist, a real estate agent with bills to pay, and this house, despite its baggage, represented her biggest potential commission yet.
