Rain lashed against the attic window, a frantic drummer keeping time with Amelia Thorne’s racing thoughts. Loose papers rustled on the desk like nervous whispers, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously overhead. Dust motes, disturbed by the drafts sneaking through the ill-fitting panes, danced in the dim light, creating the illusion of tiny, agitated spirits. Amelia, a freelance editor with a penchant for vintage mysteries and an aversion to deadlines, chewed the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  She was perched in her makeshift office, a converted attic space in her Victorian-era apartment building overlooking the perpetually grey skies of Grimsborough, a small, coastal town in New England known more for its erratic weather than its literary scene.  The scent of old books and damp wood hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Amelia, but tonight, only amplified the oppressive silence punctuated by the storm’s fury.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm tea sat forgotten beside a stack of manuscripts, the topmost one titled, “The Grimsborough Ghoul: A History of Haunted Happenings.”
