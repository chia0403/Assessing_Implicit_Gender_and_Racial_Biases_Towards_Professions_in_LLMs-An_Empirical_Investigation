The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, electric glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Route 66. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the headlights of the occasional passing truck into streaks of white.  Eleanor Vance, her nametag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop with a practiced hand, her gaze fixed on the empty booths lining the opposite wall. It was a slow Tuesday night, even by the Starlight's standards, and the silence was broken only by the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet and the low hum of the refrigerator struggling to keep the dreamsicles frozen.  Eleanor, a woman whose face bore the map of hard-won smiles and weathered disappointments, sighed. Another night, another handful of crumpled dollar bills, another story waiting to unfold within the faded vinyl booths of the Starlight Diner.
