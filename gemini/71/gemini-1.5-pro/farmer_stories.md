The biting wind, a familiar January guest in the valley, whipped across Silas Thatcher's weathered face, stinging his cheeks like icy needles.  Silas, his calloused hands tucked deep into the pockets of his threadbare coat, surveyed the frosted expanse of Thatcher Farm. The valley, nestled between the brooding shoulders of the Greystone Mountains and the whispering pines of the Whispering Woods, was draped in a pristine blanket of snow.  The usually boisterous creek that bisected his land was now a silent, frozen ribbon winding through the white.  Smoke curled lazily from the chimney of his small farmhouse, a beacon of warmth in the frigid landscape, promising the comforting scent of woodsmoke and the crackling cheer of the hearth fire within.  But Silas felt none of the usual solace this scene offered.  This winter, something felt different.  A disquiet hung in the crisp air, heavier than the snow clinging to the branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel at the edge of his property.
