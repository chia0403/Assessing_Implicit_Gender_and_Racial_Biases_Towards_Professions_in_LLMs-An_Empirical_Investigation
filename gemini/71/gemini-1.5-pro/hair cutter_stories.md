The rusty scissors whispered against Elias Thorne's thumb as he gazed out the window of his barbershop, "Thorne's Trim Emporium."  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that sliced through the gaps in the Venetian blinds, illuminating the faded grandeur of what was once the most prestigious tonsorial parlor in Dustbowl, Nevada.  The year was 1957, and the town, much like Elias's clientele, was thinning.  A lone tumbleweed bounced down Main Street, past the boarded-up Rexall Drug Store and the deserted gas station, a testament to the slow exodus that had been bleeding the life out of Dustbowl for the past decade.  The rhythmic clicking of Elias's scissors was the only sound that punctuated the dry, desert air, a steady metronome marking time in a town that seemed to have forgotten how to move forward.
