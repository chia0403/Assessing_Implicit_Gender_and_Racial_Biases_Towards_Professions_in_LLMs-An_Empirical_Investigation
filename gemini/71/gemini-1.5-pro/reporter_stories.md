The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's auburn hair across her face as she stared up at the skeletal remains of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning, grey expanse of the North Atlantic, the hotel had been abandoned for over fifty years, a decaying monument to a bygone era of opulence.  The Isle of Skye, normally a canvas of vibrant greens and blues, was shrouded in a thick, almost oppressive fog this November morning, swallowing the landscape in muted greys and deepening the eerie silence that hung around the dilapidated structure.  Mia, a reporter for the small, but tenacious, Skye Chronicle, pulled her threadbare scarf tighter around her neck and shivered, not entirely from the cold.  This assignment, investigating the persistent rumours of strange lights and unexplained noises emanating from the derelict hotel, was meant to be a fluff piece, a bit of local colour for the slow season.  But the foreboding atmosphere, coupled with the islanders' hushed whispers of the Grand Majestic being "touched by something not of this world," had her feeling decidedly uneasy.
