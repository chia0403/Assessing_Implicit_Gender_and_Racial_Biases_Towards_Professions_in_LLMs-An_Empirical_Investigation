The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia “Amy” Rios like a damp shroud.  Giant ferns dripped with condensation, their fronds brushing against the crumbling stone path. Around her, the ruins of Xunantunich, a Mayan city perched atop a hill overlooking the Belize River valley, pulsed with a palpable, ancient energy. Amy adjusted the microphone clipped to her khaki shirt, a nervous flutter in her stomach despite having delivered this same spiel hundreds of times.  Below, the small group of tourists, sweating in their brightly coloured shirts and shorts, looked up expectantly, their faces shaded by wide-brimmed hats.  A scarlet macaw shrieked from the canopy overhead, adding its vibrant cry to the symphony of cicadas and distant howler monkeys. This was Amy's office, a place where the ghosts of kings and priests mingled with the eager whispers of visitors, and where the weight of history pressed down on the present like the dense, emerald jungle itself.
