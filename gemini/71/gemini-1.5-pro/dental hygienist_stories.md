Sunlight streamed through the large window overlooking Main Street, illuminating the gleaming chrome of the dental instruments laid out on the tray.  Eliza loved this part of the day, the brief lull between patients, a moment to reset and refocus before diving back into the world of plaque, probing, and polishing. Little did she know, this seemingly ordinary Tuesday morning was about to take a decidedly extraordinary turn.
