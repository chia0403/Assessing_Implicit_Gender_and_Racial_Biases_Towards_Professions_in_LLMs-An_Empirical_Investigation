The insistent London drizzle, a fine mist that clung to everything like a second skin, seemed to reflect the perpetual grey mood inside Amelia “Millie” Hawthorne.  Her flat, tucked away on a narrow street in Shoreditch, usually vibrant with colour thanks to her work, felt oppressive this morning.  Half-finished designs littered her workspace: a vibrant poster for a craft beer festival, a minimalist logo for a sustainable fashion brand, and the beginnings of a children’s book illustration featuring a particularly grumpy badger.  The badger, Millie thought, rather mirrored her own feelings about the impending deadline for the beer festival poster.  Outside, the distinctive clatter of a milk float rattled down Brick Lane, a sound that usually signaled the start of a productive day, but today only grated on her nerves. The light, filtering weakly through the grime-streaked window, barely illuminated the mugs and paintbrushes scattered across her desk, a testament to a late night fueled by caffeine and creative frustration.
