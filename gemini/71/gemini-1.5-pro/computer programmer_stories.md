Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic tapping of Amelia “Amy” Chen’s fingers on her keyboard.  The converted space, usually bathed in the warm glow of fairy lights and the scent of jasmine tea, was now a claustrophobic den of blinking monitors and tangled cables. Outside, the wind howled through the eaves of the Victorian house, perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Cornish sea.  Amy, usually meticulous and calm, had abandoned her usual coding zen.  Empty coffee cups littered the desk, interspersed with crumpled pages of algorithms and half-eaten energy bars.  The digital clock on her main monitor blinked 3:17 AM, a stark reminder of the rapidly approaching deadline.  This wasn't just another coding project; this was the culmination of two years of obsessive work, a program that Amy believed could change everything.  And it was failing. Spectacularly.
