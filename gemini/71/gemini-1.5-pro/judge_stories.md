The mahogany clock in Judge Amelia Iris Thorne's chambers chimed four times, a sonorous counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the leaded glass windows.  Greystone, a formidable Victorian mansion perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, had been converted into the courthouse for Port Blossom, Maine.  It was a town clinging to the edge of the continent, a place where the salt spray permeated everything, even the granite foundations of justice.  Judge Thorne, her silver hair pulled back severely in a bun, surveyed the empty courtroom. The last case, a particularly bitter dispute over lobster trap territory, had concluded an hour earlier, leaving a residue of animosity hanging heavy in the air like sea fog.  She rubbed her temples, weary but resolute, a woman carved from the same unforgiving stone that formed the coast she called home.  The storm outside was mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  A new case had landed on her desk, one that threatened to unravel the fragile peace that held Port Blossom together.
