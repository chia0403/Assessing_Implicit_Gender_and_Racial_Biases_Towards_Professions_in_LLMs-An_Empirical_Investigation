The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity. Crystal chandeliers, each a miniature galaxy of refracting light, glittered above the polished marble floor.  The air, conditioned to a perfect 72 degrees, carried the faint scent of lilies and the subtle whisper of hushed conversations.  Behind the gleaming mahogany concierge desk,  Genevieve Aurelia Dubois, her name tag pinned precisely to the lapel of her impeccably tailored navy suit, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  Outside, the Parisian twilight deepened, casting long shadows across the Place de la Concorde.  A sudden flurry of activity announced the arrival of a tour group, their boisterous chatter a stark contrast to the hotel's usual refined murmur. Genevieve adjusted her pearl earrings, a small, knowing smile playing on her lips. This was her domain, a stage upon which the dramas, comedies, and occasional tragedies of her guests unfolded.  Tonight, she sensed, would be no different.
