The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he crouched beside the rusted chassis of a 1938 Zenith console radio.  Flakes of ochre paint, disturbed by his tinkering, drifted down like confetti onto the cracked concrete floor of the abandoned Grand Majestic Theatre. Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight that pierced through a boarded-up window high above, illuminating the intricate web of vacuum tubes and wires Elias was meticulously examining.  The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of Harmony Creek, Indiana, now echoed only with the ghosts of vaudeville laughter and the whisper of Elias's soldering iron.  Its ornate plasterwork, depicting cherubic musicians and gilded lyres, was crumbling, mirroring the decaying fortunes of the town itself.  Harmony Creek, once a bustling hub thanks to the railroad, had withered into a near ghost town, leaving the majestic theatre and Elias, the last remaining radio repairman for miles, as relics of a forgotten era.
