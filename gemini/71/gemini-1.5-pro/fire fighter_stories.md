The biting wind whipped at Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s turnout coat, sending icy fingers down the back of her neck.  Flakes of lake-effect snow, fat and wet, swirled around the flashing red and blue lights of the engine, obscuring the already dilapidated two-story house. The address was 47 Elm Street, perched precariously on the edge of the frozen Niagara River, in the perpetually grey and damp town of Lewiston, New York. A plume of smoke, thick and black as an oil slick, billowed from the second-story windows, staining the twilight sky a sickly yellow.  The frigid air crackled with the snap and hiss of the hungry flames, a symphony of destruction that Mia knew all too well.  This wasn't just a house fire; this was a battle, and she, along with the crew of Engine 3, were about to charge into the heart of it.
