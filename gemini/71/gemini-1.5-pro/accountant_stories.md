The frosted glass door of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's office, etched with the discreet legend "A. Cartwright, CPA," rattled slightly as a gust of wind whipped down Bleecker Street, scattering crisp, brown leaves across the damp pavement.  November in Greenwich Village held a particular charm, a blend of cozy anticipation and melancholic beauty that Amy usually found invigorating. This year, however, the damp chill seemed to seep into her bones, mirroring the pervasive unease that had settled in her gut. Her office, usually a sanctuary of order and precisely arranged files, felt suffocating.  The mahogany desk, polished to a gleam, reflected the flickering gaslight streetlamp outside, throwing elongated shadows across the walls, turning familiar objects into grotesque caricatures.  Beyond the window, the vibrant tapestry of the Village – the bustling trattorias, the overflowing bookshops, the artists hawking their wares – felt miles away, separated by a pane of glass and something far more substantial.
