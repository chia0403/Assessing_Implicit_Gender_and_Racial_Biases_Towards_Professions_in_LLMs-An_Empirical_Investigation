Rain lashed against the window of Elias Thorne's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Elias Vance Thorne, a man whose crisp suits and polished shoes belied a soul steeped in the bitter tang of instant coffee and dashed dreams, stared out at the decaying brick facade across the street.  The neon sign of the "Lucky Clover Pawn" flickered erratically, a sickly green pulse in the grey afternoon.  His office, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery in the less-than-glamorous district of Zenith City known as "The Narrows," was as far from the glittering insurance towers downtown as a man could get.  He swiveled his chair, the squeak a mournful cry in the otherwise silent room, and picked up a half-eaten ham sandwich wrapped in wax paper.  Another Friday afternoon, another lunch eaten at his desk, another week spent peddling policies to people who looked at him with a mixture of pity and suspicion.  This was his life, a monotonous rhythm of claim forms and premium payments, a world of actuarial tables and the fine print.  But today, something felt different.  A premonition, perhaps, a prickling at the back of his neck that whispered of change, of something unexpected lurking just around the corner.
