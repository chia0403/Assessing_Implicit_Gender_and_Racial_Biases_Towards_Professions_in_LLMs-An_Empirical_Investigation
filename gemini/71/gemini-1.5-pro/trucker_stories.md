The neon glow of the Desert Rose Diner spilled out onto the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, painting the swirling dust devils in hues of pink and turquoise.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying bacon, a familiar comfort to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez.  It was 3:17 am, the coldest part of the desert night, and Amy, hunched over a mug the size of her fist, watched the ice crystals melting on the windowpane. Outside, her rig, a gleaming chrome and crimson Peterbilt 389 she’d affectionately dubbed “The Crimson Comet,” idled patiently, its twin stacks puffing plumes of white exhaust into the inky sky.  Amy was three days into a cross-country haul from Los Angeles to Atlanta, a route she knew like the back of her hand.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling unease crawled up her spine, a feeling she couldn’t quite shake off, like the desert itself was holding its breath.
