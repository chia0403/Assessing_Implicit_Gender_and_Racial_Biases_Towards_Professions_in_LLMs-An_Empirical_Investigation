The air in the Bumblebrook Daycare center buzzed with the chaotic symphony of toddlerdom.  Tiny hands smeared finger paint across construction paper, blocks clattered to the floor in rhythmic bursts, and the high-pitched squeal of delighted laughter echoed off the pastel-painted walls.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her blonde hair pulled back in a messy bun secured with a crayon-decorated clip, surveyed the scene with a mixture of fondness and exhaustion.  It was only 9:30 am, and already, a small boy named Leo had managed to get blueberry yogurt in his hair, two dolls had lost their heads in a dramatic re-enactment of a monster movie, and someone, Amy still hadn't figured out who, had managed to clog the miniature toilet in the playhouse bathroom. Bumblebrook, nestled in the heart of a quiet, leafy suburb of Maplewood, New Jersey, was usually a haven of playful learning, but some days, like today, felt more akin to navigating a glitter-bombed obstacle course.  And today was shaping up to be one of *those* days.
