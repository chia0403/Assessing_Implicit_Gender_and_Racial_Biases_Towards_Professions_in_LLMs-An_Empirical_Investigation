Inside the speeding ambulance, Amelia "Mia" Catherine Dubois gripped the metal railing, her knuckles white against her olive skin.  The flashing blue and red lights painted the interior in a frenetic strobe effect, illuminating the concerned furrow in Mia's brow and the determined set of her jaw.  A dispatch crackle broke through the siren's scream: "Possible cardiac arrest, elderly male, 18 Rainbow Row. ETA two minutes."  Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already slick cobblestones, transforming the usually picturesque street into a treacherous obstacle course. Mia braced herself, the scent of antiseptic and the metallic tang of approaching rain thick in the air, the weight of another life hanging in the balance.
