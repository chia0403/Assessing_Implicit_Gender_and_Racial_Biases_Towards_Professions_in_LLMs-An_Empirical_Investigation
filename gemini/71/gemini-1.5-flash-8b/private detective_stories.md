The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderwood.  Detective Alistair Finch, a man whose trench coat seemed permanently damp and whose eyes held the weary wisdom of a thousand unsolved cases, hunched further into the doorway.  He’d been tracing the thread of a missing person – a notorious art collector named Isabella del Rio – for the past three weeks, and the trail had led him to this forgotten corner of the city, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways and decaying Victorian buildings that whispered secrets in the wind.  Alderwood, a city within a city, a place where the past clung to the present like a shroud.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something subtly sweet, like overripe fruit, hung heavy in the night.  Alistair's worn leather briefcase, containing his meagre possessions and a half-eaten sandwich, was his only companion in the gloom. He traced the chipped paint on the crumbling storefront, the faded lettering of a now-closed apothecary.  The sign read: "Flora's Remedies: Healing for Body and Soul."  This particular night, he was certain, held the answer to the enigma of Isabella del Rio's disappearance.
