The biting wind, a relentless claw of icy air, ripped at Elias Blackwood's worn coat.  He hunched deeper into the shadowed alcove, the only warmth radiating from the flickering embers of the small fire he’d coaxed into life.  The vast, snow-dusted peaks of the Cascade Mountains loomed like silent sentinels above the valley, their jagged silhouettes lost in the swirling grey mist.  Elias, a logger for twenty years, knew this landscape as intimately as the calloused hands that had shaped it.  He was born and raised in the rugged terrain, the rhythms of the forest as ingrained in him as the taste of pine sap and the scent of damp earth.  This remote, high-country clearing, nestled in a valley carved by glaciers, was his current domain.  He was alone, save for the creaking of the old cabin’s timbers and the constant, mournful howl of the wind.  The air, thick with the smell of pine and frost, held a palpable sense of foreboding.  He knew, deep within the marrow of his bones, that this was no ordinary winter.
