The fluorescent hum of the lab vibrated through Amelia "Em" Nightingale's bones, a constant, low thrum that mirrored the pulse in the veins she so often accessed.  It was a Tuesday, the usual cacophony of beeping machines and hushed murmurs filling the sterile air of the City General Pathology lab.  The fluorescent lights, harsh and unforgiving, cast long shadows from the rows of blood-filled tubes meticulously organized in their designated slots.  Em, a phlebotomist with eyes that held the quiet wisdom of countless drawn pints and a sharp, almost scientific, curiosity, felt the familiar hum of anticipation thrumming beneath her meticulously applied gloves. Today, the samples were different. Today, the urgency in the air was palpable.  Three particularly complex cases from the trauma ward, all with the same inexplicable symptomâ€”a flickering, unsettling glow emanating from the veins of the patients.


Setting: A bustling, high-tech pathology lab within a large, urban general hospital.  Rows upon rows of gleaming metal workbenches and refrigerators filled the space, punctuated by the beeps and whirring of sophisticated machines.  The sterile environment, designed for precision and efficiency, felt oddly oppressive at times, its clinical perfection accentuated by the unsettling, palpable tension.
