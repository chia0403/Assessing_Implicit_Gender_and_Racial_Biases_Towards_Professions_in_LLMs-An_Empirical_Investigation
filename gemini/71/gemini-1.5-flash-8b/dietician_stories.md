The humid air hung heavy, thick with the cloying sweetness of jasmine and the almost imperceptible tang of something… metallic.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Dr. Anya Petrova's thoughts.  Anya Petrova, registered dietician and owner of "Nourish," a tiny, brightly painted clinic tucked away on the outskirts of the bustling port city of Lagos,  felt a knot tighten in her stomach.  Her latest patient, a young woman named Ifeoma, was refusing to eat.  Not a simple case of anorexia, Anya feared, but something far more insidious.  The metallic tang in the air, a scent Anya couldn't quite place, felt oddly intertwined with the growing desperation in Ifeoma's eyes.

The clinic itself was a testament to Anya's resourcefulness.  Brightly coloured fabrics, handwoven in vibrant hues, hung from the walls, almost clashing with the clinical white of the examination tables.  The air, despite the relentless rain, was infused with the aroma of steaming spices and freshly baked bread – a calculated distraction from the potential dangers within.  Small, carefully arranged herb gardens nestled between the few dusty potted plants, a deliberate counterpoint to the city’s industrial heart. Outside, the chaotic sounds of Lagos, the horns of taxi-motocycles, the cries of street vendors, formed a backdrop to the quiet desperation unfolding within the four walls of her clinic.   Anya knew this city inside and out, and yet, this case felt different.  It felt... dangerous.
