Sunlight, fractured and pale, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the swirling air.  Stacks of books, some ancient, some tattered, some overflowing with her own handwritten notes and sketches, lined the walls, their spines whispering secrets of forgotten worlds.  A chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring blankly, sat on a rickety desk draped with faded velvet.  It was a constant, silent reminder of the delicate balance between the real and the imagined, a battle Amelia waged daily within these hallowed, if slightly damp, halls.
