The biting wind whipped Amelia Petrova’s auburn hair across her face as she stared out the panoramic window of the high-rise brokerage office.  Below, the cityscape of Neo-Kyoto sprawled, a breathtaking tapestry of gleaming skyscrapers and meticulously manicured gardens, a stark contrast to the grey, churning sky above.  Amelia, a seasoned real estate agent with a sharp eye for detail and an even sharper tongue, felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  Today was the day she presented the “Whisperwind Estate,” a sprawling, centuries-old property rumored to be haunted, to a notoriously demanding client.


The office, a stark white space with polished concrete floors and minimalist furniture, hummed with the low thrum of unseen activity.  A cluster of agents, clad in impeccably tailored suits, huddled over spreadsheets and whispered deals.  Amelia, however, felt isolated, her thoughts a whirlwind of potential pitfalls and glowing testimonials.  The whispering wind, a constant presence outside, seemed to echo her inner turmoil.  She adjusted her perfectly sculpted crimson blazer, the material faintly rustling as she absently traced a pattern on the glass with a finger.  The property, located on a secluded hillside overlooking the city, held a certain enigmatic charm, but the whispering tales of past residents – tales of chilling whispers and unexplained events – held a far more unsettling allure.  The potential sale was not just about bricks and mortar; it was about appeasing a client, managing expectations, and perhaps, facing the ghosts of the Whisperwind Estate herself.
