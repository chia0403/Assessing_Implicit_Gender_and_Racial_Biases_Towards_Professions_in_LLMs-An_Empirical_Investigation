The biting wind whipped across the cobbled streets of Aethelgard, stinging Elara Oakheart’s cheeks.  Dust devils, kicked up by the countless carts and carriages rumbling through the marketplace, danced around her worn leather boots.  Aethelgard, the city nestled in the shadow of the Whispering Peaks, pulsed with a frantic energy.  The scent of roasting meats mingled with the acrid tang of smoke from the city's numerous forges, a symphony of commerce and industry that rarely stilled.  Elara, a Royal Guard, stood sentinel at the bustling gates, her breath fogging in the frigid air.  Her duty, as it had been for the past three years, was to ensure the smooth passage of travelers and the quiet order of the city within.  The worn brass of her breastplate, etched with the royal crest, reflected the flickering lamplight.  Tonight, however, the usual murmur of the market felt somehow… different.  An uneasy quiet, heavy and expectant, hung in the air.
