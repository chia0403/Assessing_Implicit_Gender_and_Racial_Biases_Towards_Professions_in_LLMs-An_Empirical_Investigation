The greasy haze hung heavy in the air, clinging to the worn-out vinyl seats of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny, ramshackle garage tucked away on the back alleys of Newhaven.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, illuminating swirling clouds of blue smoke from a nearby dumpster fire.  Rain, a relentless drumming against the corrugated metal roof, seemed to echo the ceaseless whir of the antique air compressor. This was Bartholomew "Barty"  Featherstone's world.  Barty, a man whose hands were as weathered and scarred as the vintage car engines he coaxed back to life, leaned over a sputtering Ford Falcon.  The car, a faded teal, sat on a precarious metal stand, its engine bay a labyrinth of tangled wires and rusted hoses.  A faint, metallic smell of burnt oil mingled with the cloying aroma of cheap coffee brewing in the corner. The garage, despite its evident squalor, held a surprising tranquility â€“ the sort that came from dedication and the quiet hum of machinery.
