The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High Guidance Office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's weary existence.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a swirling vortex of papers, folders, and half-eaten granola bars scattered across her desk.  Amelia, a guidance counselor with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless teenage anxieties, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another barrage of existential crises, whispered in hushed tones and typed in frantic emails.  The rhythmic clang of the school bell, a constant reminder of the chaos beyond her door, punctuated the air.


The setting: Northwood High, a sprawling, somewhat dilapidated brick building nestled in the foothills of the Cascades.  Decades of weathered paint clung to the exterior, mirroring the worn-down emotional landscape of the students she counseled.  The guidance office, tucked away on the second floor, felt like a silent, unassuming fortress, shielding her from the boisterous energy of the school hallways.  Inside, the scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar, suffocating presence.
