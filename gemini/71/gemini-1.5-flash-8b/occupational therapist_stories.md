Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the rehabilitation center, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, a monotonous hum that only amplified the echoing silence of the empty therapy room.  Outside, the November wind howled, a mournful dirge accompanying the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from the leaky gutter.  Amy, a licensed occupational therapist with five years of experience, stared at the meticulously organized piles of exercise equipment: resistance bands, weighted balls, hand grips, all silent witnesses to the countless struggles she'd witnessed, and the equally countless successes.  Today, however, felt different.  Today, felt devoid of hope.

The setting was the Beaconwood Rehabilitation Center, a sprawling, once-grand building now showing its age.  Built in the 1950s on the outskirts of a quiet, once-thriving city now struggling with economic decline, the center housed a diverse array of patients, each with their own unique journey of recovery.  The building was cold and damp, smelling faintly of antiseptic and mildew.  The air, thick with the scent of damp plaster and the remnants of yesterday's therapeutic activities, hung heavy in the room. Amy knew that each patient's story was a tapestry woven with threads of resilience and loss, and she was, in a strange and melancholic way, deeply connected to them all.
