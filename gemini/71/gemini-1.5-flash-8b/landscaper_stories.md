The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's worn fleece around her, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the garden.  Not a single verdant blade dared to peek through the skeletal branches of the dead rose bushes, their once-vibrant crimson now a faded, dusty shade of rust.  This wasn't the manicured masterpiece she’d envisioned, the lush tapestry of colour she’d promised the grieving widow, Mrs. Eleanor Vance.  This was a wasteland.  It was, frankly, terrifying.

The estate, sprawling and imposing, was nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Yorkshire Moors.  Autumn leaves, a kaleidoscope of ochre and russet, crunched beneath her boots, a stark contrast to the oppressive silence of the place.  A thick fog clung to the valley, swallowing the distant peaks in a pearly shroud.  The only sound besides the wind's mournful howl was the rhythmic drumming of rain against the ancient stone walls, a sound that seemed to amplify the sense of desolation.
