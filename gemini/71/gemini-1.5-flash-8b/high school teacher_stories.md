The fluorescent lights of Ms. Evelyn "Evie" Ashworth's tenth-grade English classroom hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of pencils against paper.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, slicing through the grime-coated windows of the old, brick building, highlighting the faded posters of Shakespearean plays and the chipped paint around the chipped, worn teacher's desk.  Evie, perched behind her desk, stared at the sprawling, almost illegible, essay in front of her.  It was a Tuesday, the precise midpoint of a week that felt, as always, like it was stretching on for an eternity.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and the faint, cloying sweetness of cheap coffee.  Outside, the relentless drone of traffic from the nearby highway – a constant hum that had become the city's soundtrack –  echoed into the classroom.  The year was 2024, and Evie, with her perpetually tired eyes and a trench coat that had seen better days, felt utterly lost.
