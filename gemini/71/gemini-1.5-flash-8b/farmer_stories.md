The biting wind, a relentless prairie cur, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered coat, stinging his cheeks with icy needles.  Dust devils, swirling miniature cyclones, danced across the cracked earth of the Thorne family farm, a patchwork of parched fields stretching to the horizon.  The only sounds besides the wind's mournful howl were the rhythmic creak of the old well pump, struggling to coax water from the parched aquifer, and the occasional, desperate caw of a lone crow.

Elias Thorne, a man weathered as deeply as the land he tilled, knelt beside a withered corn stalk, its husk brittle and empty, a stark testament to the year's failure.  He ran a calloused finger over the dry stalks, a familiar ache tightening in his chest.  He had seen the rains fail for a season or two before, but thisâ€¦this felt different.
