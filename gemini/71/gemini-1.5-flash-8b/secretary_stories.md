The chipped Formica countertop reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of the third-floor office, casting a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Nightingale's meticulously organized papers.  Each document, each memo, each meticulously typed letter, was a tiny, silent testament to the relentless rhythm of the corporation's heartbeat.  Amelia, a secretary in the sprawling legal department of Sterling & Sterling, was a cog in a vast machine, but a cog that, if meticulously lubricated, could keep the whole thing running smoothly.  Today, however, the clatter of the machine was unusually loud, echoing the growing anxiety in her chest.  The filing cabinets, usually stoic sentinels of order, seemed to press in on her, their metal surfaces shimmering with a distorted reflection of her own worried face.  The air, heavy with the scent of stale coffee and fear, seemed to thicken around her.  The deadline for the Smith & Jones case loomed, a dark and formidable presence.  Every whispered rumor, every frantic phone call, amplified the pressure.


The office, a sterile expanse of polished mahogany desks and impersonal cubicles, was a monument to corporate efficiency.  Rows of identical beige chairs faced identical beige computers, all seemingly identical to the countless others in the vast, grey office building downtown.  Sunlight, a pale ghost, barely penetrated the gloom of the towering skyscraper, illuminating only the dust motes dancing in the stagnant air.  The only hint of individuality was the faded floral wallpaper in the break room, a pathetic attempt at humanizing a place designed for productivity, a stark contrast to the cold, hard reality of Amelia's workplace.
