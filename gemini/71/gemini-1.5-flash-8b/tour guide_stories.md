The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's auburn hair across her face, stinging her cheeks.  She adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel, its contents – maps, brochures, and a chipped ceramic mug – rattling reassuringly.  Below her, the cobbled streets of  Olde Stonehaven, a town nestled deep within the Yorkshire Dales, wound like a tangled skein of gray stone under a bruised purple sky.  Twisted, ancient oaks, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for the bruised twilight, framed the narrow, winding lanes.  The scent of woodsmoke, mingled with the damp earth, clung to the air, a comforting aroma that contrasted starkly with the chill permeating the early autumn evening.  Amelia, a tour guide with eyes that held the stories of countless centuries, sighed contentedly.  Tonight's "Legends of Olde Stonehaven" tour was shaping up to be an unforgettable one.
