The biting wind whipped dust devils across the cracked earth of the Dustbowl, swirling around the weathered sandstone courthouse of Dry Creek.  The sun beat down mercilessly on Judge Elara Blackwood, her dark hair plastered to her temples, sweat beading on her brow despite the thin cotton of her dress.  Inside, the courtroom, small and suffocatingly hot, awaited her arrival.  A lone fly buzzed incessantly against the dusty window, a tiny, insistent percussion against the oppressive silence.

The year was 1939.  The Great Depression had clawed its way into every corner of the Dustbowl, leaving behind a landscape of parched fields and broken dreams.  Small towns like Dry Creek, clinging to the fading hope of the land, were the epicentre of its cruelty.  Judge Blackwood, a woman hardened by the harsh realities of her harsh existence, knew the weight of every case that entered her courtroom. Each dispute, however small, held within it the potential to unravel the fragile fabric of their community.  Her worn leather briefcase, stuffed with papers yellowed with age and dust, rested on the worn oak table beside her.  The courthouse clock, its hands stubbornly marking the slow passage of time, seemed to mirror the pace of the lives it measured.
