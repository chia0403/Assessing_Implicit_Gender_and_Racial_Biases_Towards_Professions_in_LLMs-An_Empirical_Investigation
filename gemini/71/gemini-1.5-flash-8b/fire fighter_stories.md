Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the fire station, mimicking the relentless drumming in Captain Amelia "Amy"  Everett's head.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cramped, smelling-of-burnt-toast break room.  A stale aroma of coffee and something vaguely chemical hung heavy in the air.  It was 3 AM, and the usual Tuesday night quiet of Station 11 had been shattered by the frantic, escalating blare of the pager, a sound that always dug a little deeper into her already frayed nerves.

The station, nestled between a sprawling industrial park and a surprisingly verdant strip of old growth forest, felt like a concrete cage tonight.  The muted green glow of the forest through the grimy windows somehow seemed to mock the sterile interior.  Beyond the rusted metal gates, the dark, inky woods held an unspoken, unsettling promise.  Tonight, that promise smelled of smoke.
