The fluorescent lights of the "Precision Drafting Department" hummed a relentless, almost mournful, tune.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminating the intricate, meticulous lines etched onto the drafting tables.  Elias Thorne, a man whose face was perpetually shadowed by the perpetual twilight of the drafting room, meticulously adjusted his drafting pen.  His hands, calloused and scarred from years of graphite-stained fingers and the relentless pressure of precision, moved with practiced grace over the tracing paper.  He was a drafting worker, a craftsman of the invisible, his designs often unseen until brought to life by others' hands. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, paper, and a faint, almost imperceptible, whiff of ozone, a lingering reminder of the massive power grid humming just outside the departmentâ€™s walls.


Setting:

The Precision Drafting Department was a cavernous space within the sprawling, decades-old "Ironclad Industries" complex.  Rows upon rows of drafting tables, each laden with tracing paper, blueprints, and the ubiquitous clutter of drafting tools, stretched into the gloom.  The room itself felt more like a library of ideas than an office, a testament to the thousands of designs that had passed through its walls, each one representing a bridge, a building, a machine waiting to be brought into existence.  The rhythmic whir of machinery from the factory floor, amplified by the cavernous space, provided a constant, low-level hum that was as much a part of the room's atmosphere as the motes of dust in the air.
