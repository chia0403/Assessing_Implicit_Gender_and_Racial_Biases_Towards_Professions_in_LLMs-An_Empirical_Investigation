Professor Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest whisper of forgotten library dust, stared out the rain-streaked window of her cramped office at the sprawling, gothic spires of Blackwood College.  The air, thick with the scent of damp stone and decaying leaves, mirrored the oppressive gloom clinging to her thoughts.  It was the first Tuesday of October, a day traditionally reserved for the meticulous cataloguing of rare manuscripts â€“ a chore Eleanor found both satisfying and increasingly tedious.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain against the leaded glass punctuated the silence, a soundtrack to the growing unease gnawing at her.

The stone buildings, weathered and worn, seemed to hold their breath, their silent observation a constant pressure on the already weighty atmosphere.  Eleanor had taught at the college for fifteen years, her life woven inextricably into the very fabric of its history.  But lately, the echoes within these walls felt less like whispers and more like the insidious rustle of unseen, and unwelcome, presences.
