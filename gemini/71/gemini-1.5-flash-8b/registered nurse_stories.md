The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a constant, insistent drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Grace Harding's very bones.  The sterile white walls reflected the chaotic energy of the room, a kaleidoscope of frantic movement, beeping machines, and the low, worried murmurs of patients and their families.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience, stood hunched over a gurney, her stethoscope pressed against the frail chest of a young woman.  The rhythmic, shallow breaths were a stark counterpoint to the relentless rhythm of the heart monitors.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, clung to her, a tangible weight against her already weary shoulders.  Outside the emergency room doors, the sounds of the city—car horns, distant sirens—formed a jarring soundtrack to the internal chaos unfolding within.  It was a Wednesday night in November, and the city's relentless pulse was only growing stronger.
