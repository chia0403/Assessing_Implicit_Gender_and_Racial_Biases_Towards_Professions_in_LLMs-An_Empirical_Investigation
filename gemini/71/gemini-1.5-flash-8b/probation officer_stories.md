Outside, the wind howled, carrying with it the echoes of distant sirens and the muffled cries of a city struggling in the downpour.  Amy was alone, except for the whispers of the files and the insistent patter of the rain.  The scent of damp earth and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that had become synonymous with the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.
