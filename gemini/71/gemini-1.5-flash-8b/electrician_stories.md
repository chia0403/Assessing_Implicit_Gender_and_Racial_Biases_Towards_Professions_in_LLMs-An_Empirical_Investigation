The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electrical Fix-it" cast a lurid, sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alleyway.  Water, churned into a torrent by the sudden downpour, pooled around the cracked pavement, reflecting the distorted, multi-coloured lights like a fractured mirror.

Sweat beaded on his brow, mingling with the oily residue of decades spent working with electricity.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and burnt plastic, was punctuated by the rhythmic hiss of the faulty circuit breaker, a symphony of static and impending doom.
