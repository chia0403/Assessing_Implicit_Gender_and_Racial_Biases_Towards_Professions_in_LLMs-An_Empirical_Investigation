The chipped paint of the "Grand Guignol" theatre, peeling like sunburnt skin, clung to the faded crimson walls.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating the swirling chaos within.  This was the sanctuary, the crucible, of Alistair Finch-Hartley, Director.  Alistair Finch-Hartley, a man whose life was a carefully constructed tapestry of velvet curtains and whispered stage directions, now found himself wrestling with a tempest of conflicting emotions.  The air in the dressing room, usually thick with the perfume of lavender and anticipation, was thick with the metallic tang of desperation.  His latest production, "The Crimson Countess," a gothic melodrama meant to thrill the jaded patrons of the East End, was spiralling towards disaster.  Set in the crumbling grandeur of a forgotten English manor house, the play, he'd hoped, would be a masterpiece, a triumph over the financial straits the Grand Guignol had found itself in.  But the actors were restless, the set was falling apart, and Alistair's carefully laid plans were unraveling faster than a badly stitched costume.
