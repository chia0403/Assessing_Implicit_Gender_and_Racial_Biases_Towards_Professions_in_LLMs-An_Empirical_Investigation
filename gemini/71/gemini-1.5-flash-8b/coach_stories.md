Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated community centre, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Hawthorne's head.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and stale coffee, hung heavy in the cavernous space.  Rows of worn-out gym mats, testament to countless hours of sweat and struggle, lay scattered across the floor.  This was the heart of the "Phoenix Falcons," Amelia's fledgling youth basketball team, a team struggling not just against the other neighbourhood squads, but against the very fabric of their community.  Amelia, a woman hardened by years of dedication and disappointment, stared out at the half-dozen teenagers hunched over their water bottles, a mixture of frustration and boredom evident in their slumped shoulders.  The Phoenix Falcons were losing their grip.  The season was slipping through their fingers like sand.  The city lights flickered outside, casting an eerie glow over the empty streets, a stark contrast to the flickering flame of hope Amelia desperately tried to nurture within the Phoenix Falcons.
