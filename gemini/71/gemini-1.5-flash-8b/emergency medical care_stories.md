The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the panicked whispers and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the defibrillator.  Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's General Hospital, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Carmichael, a Registered Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with five years' experience under her belt, but a lifetime of worry etched into her tired eyes.  

The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy in the small, crowded waiting area.  A scattering of worried faces, pale and drawn, observed the flurry of activity around the central triage desk.  The rhythmic beeping of heart monitors and the distant wail of a siren mingled with the urgent murmur of voices, creating a cacophony that Amy was all too familiar with.  Tonight, however, felt different.  There was a particular intensity, a sense of foreboding that chilled her to the bone.  It wasn't just another Tuesday night.
