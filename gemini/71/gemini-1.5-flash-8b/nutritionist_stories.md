The aroma of roasted turmeric and ginger, thick and intoxicating, hung heavy in the air of Dr. Anya Sharma's tiny, sun-drenched Brooklyn apartment.  Sunlight, filtered through sheer curtains, painted streaks of gold across the meticulously organized kitchen.  Empty takeout containers, neatly stacked, hinted at the whirlwind of late-night consultations and urgent client calls that had marked the previous week.  Anya, a registered dietitian and certified nutritionist with the formidable Dr. preceding her name, stirred a vibrant green smoothie in a glass.  The vibrant, almost luminescent, green was a testament to the kale and spinach she'd blitzed into its depths â€“ a perfect balance of nutrients, she thought, a microscopic battle against the dietary demons she so often fought alongside her patients.  Her phone buzzed, a jarring interruption to the otherwise peaceful morning.  It was a text from a client, a 20-year-old college student named Leo, requesting a last-minute appointment.  Anya sighed, a familiar tremor of anxiety playing over her.  She knew that certain clients demanded extra time, extra empathy, and extra patience, a fact that had become a defining characteristic of her career. This particular client, Leo, fell squarely into that category.  The clock ticked, and the scent of turmeric lingered, a subtle promise of the day to come.
