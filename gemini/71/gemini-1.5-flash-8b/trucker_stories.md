The flickering fluorescent lights of the roadside diner cast long, distorted shadows across the Formica table, highlighting the grease stains that had become a permanent part of the d√©cor.  Outside, a biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nebraska, stinging Amelia "Mel" Mallory's cheeks as she sipped her lukewarm coffee.  The rhythmic clatter of semi-truck tires, a constant soundtrack to her life, was strangely absent.  The empty highway, stretching into the horizon like a faded ribbon, mirrored the emptiness in her heart. Mel, her 18-wheeler, aptly named "The Wanderer," parked a few hundred yards down the road, felt adrift.  This wasn't the familiar ache of miles travelled, but a deeper, unsettling loneliness, a gnawing feeling that something was fundamentally wrong.


**Setting:** A deserted roadside diner in the flatlands of Nebraska, near the edge of a seemingly endless highway.  The diner itself is a worn-down, faded relic of a bygone era, a frequent pit stop for truckers, reflecting the isolation and vastness of the American heartland.
