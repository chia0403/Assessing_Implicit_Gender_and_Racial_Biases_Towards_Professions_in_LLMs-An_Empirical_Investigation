The biting wind whipped at Dr. Elara Nightingale's coat, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the frayed edges of her scarf.  Below, the cobbled streets of the Old Quarter snaked their way through the towering, fog-shrouded buildings of  Aethelgard.  A perpetual twilight hung in the air, a pall cast not only by the weather, but by the city's brooding history.  Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering from the flickering gas lamps, illuminating the grim stone faces of the buildings and the anxious expressions etched onto the faces of the passersby.  This was no ordinary day in Aethelgard; whispers of a strange new illness, the "Night Fever," were spreading through the populace, turning healthy faces pale and the usually vibrant market stalls eerily quiet. Elara, a physician with a reputation for her uncanny ability to diagnose the obscure, found herself drawn into the heart of this growing epidemic.  The cityâ€™s ancient, and often uncharitable, healers scoffed at her modern methods, but Elara knew the root of the Night Fever held a deeper mystery, one that lurked not only in the shadowed alleys and crowded markets but perhaps, in the very fabric of the city itself.
