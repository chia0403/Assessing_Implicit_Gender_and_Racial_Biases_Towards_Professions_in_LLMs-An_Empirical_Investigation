The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingaleâ€™s weary existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale, antiseptic glow, mirroring the swirling thoughts in her head.  Her cubicle, a small, beige box nestled in the vast expanse of the reception area, felt more like a prison cell than a place of work.  The relentless hum of the phones, the rhythmic clatter of keyboards, and the barely-contained anxieties of the executives rushing through the polished mahogany doors all conspired to chip away at her patience. Elara, a receptionist by title, felt more like a silent observer, a ghost in the machine, her presence barely acknowledged, her very existence a whisper in the deafening roar of the corporation.

The setting was the sprawling, modern glass and steel complex of Zenith Corporation, located on the northern edge of the city, overlooking a perpetually smog-choked skyline.  Inside, the air conditioning whispered its cool, sterile breath, battling the pervasive aroma of expensive coffee and desperation.  The meticulously-arranged cubicles and pristine conference rooms, while undeniably impressive, contained a stark, almost clinical emptiness.  Outside, the city thrummed with a life that seemed to ignore the quiet, calculated rhythm of the corporation.
