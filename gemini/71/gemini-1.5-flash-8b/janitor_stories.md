The fluorescent hum of the "Apex Institute for Advanced Astrophysics" vibrated through Silas Blackwood's worn sneakers, a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming that echoed the relentless rhythm of his life.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow light, danced in the air, mimicking the swirling patterns of thought in his head as he pushed his mop across the polished floor of the observatory's main hall.  He was Silas Blackwood, janitor extraordinaire – or, at least, that's what he told himself, the words a faint shield against the crushing weight of his day-to-day existence.

The hall, a vast cathedral of polished granite and gleaming metal, housed the colossal telescope, its mirrored eye staring blankly into the blackness beyond, a silent witness to the cosmos.  Around him, the remnants of the day's activity lay scattered like fallen stars.  Empty coffee cups, discarded papers filled with incomprehensible equations, and stray lab coats, each with a faint scent of ozone and something indefinably alien, littered the space.  This particular Tuesday, a particularly baffling array of spilled liquids – neon green, iridescent purple, and a milky white that seemed to shimmer with an inner light – lay scattered near the telescope's base.  Silas groaned inwardly.  Another day, another mystery.
