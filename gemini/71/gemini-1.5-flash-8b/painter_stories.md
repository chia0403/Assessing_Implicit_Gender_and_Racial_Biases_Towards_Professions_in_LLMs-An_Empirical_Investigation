The chipped paint of the "Artist's Nook" sign creaked in the afternoon breeze, a mournful soundtrack to the relentless drizzle that plastered the cobblestones of  Old Market Square.  Rain slicked the weathered timbers of the gallery's awning, reflecting the pale, bruised light filtering through the clouds.  Inside, Amelia Blackwood, a painter with eyes the colour of storm-grey skies and a palette as restless as the sea, hunched over her easel.  Layers of ochre, cadmium red, and viridian blue lay scattered across her worn, oak-topped table, a chaotic testament to the painting she was wrestling with â€“ a portrait of the perpetually grumpy market gardener, old Mr. Grimshaw.
