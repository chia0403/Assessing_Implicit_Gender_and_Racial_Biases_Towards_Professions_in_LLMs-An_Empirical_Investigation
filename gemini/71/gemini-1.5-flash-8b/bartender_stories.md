The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a lurid, sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Town.  A biting wind, carrying the scent of brine and woodsmoke, whipped through the narrow alleyways, rattling the windows of the pub.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale beer, roasted peanuts, and desperation.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood's domain, the Rusty Mug, a haven for weary travellers and forgotten dreams, a place where stories whispered on the wind found a temporary home amongst the clinking glasses and murmured conversations.

Barty, a man sculpted from years of hard living and a heart that had learned to guard itself, leaned against the mahogany bar, a chipped mug in his calloused hand. His sharp eyes, the colour of stormy seas, scanned the patrons.  Tonight, a particularly restless energy thrummed beneath the surface of the low hum of the bar.  The usual mix of grizzled sailors, travelling merchants, and down-on-their-luck souls were present, but an unsettling quiet seemed to hang over them all, like a premonition of something terrible.
