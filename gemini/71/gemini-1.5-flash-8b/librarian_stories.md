The flickering fluorescent lights of the Hemlock Hollow Public Library cast long, skeletal shadows across the stacks, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed through the cavernous space, drowning out the quiet rustle of turning pages.

Behind it, a dimly lit room, the Whispering Gallery, awaited her.
