The wind, a relentless, bone-chilling whisper, clawed at the weathered canvas of Silas Blackwood's bunkhouse.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red earth, danced across the parched, cracked plains of the Montana badlands.  Silas, a man carved from granite and sun-baked leather, huddled deeper into his worn sheepskin, the scent of pine and smoke from the nearby campfire a meagre comfort against the encroaching cold.  Outside, the jagged peaks of the Beartooth Mountains, a backdrop of perpetual twilight, seemed to loom, their silent, watchful forms mirroring the isolation that had become Silas's constant companion.


The year was 1887.  Silas Blackwood, rancher and undisputed king of the Blackwood Basin, surveyed his domain from the porch of his weathered cabin.  The vast expanse of the valley stretched before him, dotted with the skeletal remains of winter's dead grass, and the few, struggling, green shoots of the nascent spring.  A lone hawk circled overhead, its shadow a fleeting menace against the vast, empty sky.  This was the heart of the untamed West, a land sculpted by storms and shadowed by legends, a place where the only company a man could trust was the quiet rhythm of the wind and the enduring loyalty of his livestock.
