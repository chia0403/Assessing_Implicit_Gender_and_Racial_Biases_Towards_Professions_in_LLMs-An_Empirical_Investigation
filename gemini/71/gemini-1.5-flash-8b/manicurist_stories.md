The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose from years of spilled polish and forgotten dreams, reflected Amelia Hawthorne’s face.  Her gaze, usually sharp and focused, was hazy with the after-effects of a particularly demanding afternoon.  Tiny droplets of crimson clung to the edge of the sink, a ghostly echo of the vibrant red she’d been applying just moments before.  The scent of lavender, always a comfort, seemed muted today, swallowed by the pervasive aroma of burnt sugar from the nearby bakery.  Amelia sighed, tracing the delicate swirls of a rose tattoo on her wrist with a calloused finger.  Outside, the midday sun beat down on the bustling, narrow streets of Montmartre, Paris.  Cobblestones, warm underfoot, shimmered with heat.  The air, thick with the murmur of conversations and the clanging of metal on metal from a nearby artisan blacksmith, felt heavy.   Her tiny salon, "Le Clou de Rose," tucked between a bustling boulangerie and a shop overflowing with handmade jewellery, hummed with the quiet, rhythmic whirring of a small fan and the gentle click of manicuring tools.  Amelia knew this was her place, her sanctuary – until the whispers started again.
