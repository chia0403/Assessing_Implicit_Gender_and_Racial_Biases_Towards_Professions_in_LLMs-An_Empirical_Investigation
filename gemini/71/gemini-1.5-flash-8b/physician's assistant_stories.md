The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's hair across her face as she hurried down the narrow, cobbled streets of Alderwood.  Rain, a relentless curtain, plastered the ancient stone buildings to a gloomy sky.  Alderwood, nestled deep in the shadowed valleys of the Whispering Mountains, was a town steeped in history and shadowed by a perpetual chill, a chill that seemed to seep into the very marrow of its inhabitants.  Amelia, a Physician's Assistant with the understated practicality of a seasoned traveler, felt it acutely.  This was her first assignment in Alderwood, and the palpable unease hung heavier than the moisture in the air.  The townâ€™s residents, with their weathered faces and wary eyes, seemed to whisper secrets only the wind could carry.  Her assignment, a month-long stint to assist Dr. Elias Thorne at the dilapidated, but historically significant, Alderwood Clinic, had begun with a peculiar case: a rash of inexplicable fevers, striking the town's livestock and, more ominously, its people.  Amelia shivered, not just from the cold, but from a growing sense of foreboding.  The clinic, a relic of a bygone era, stood like a skeletal hand reaching towards the sky, its single, flickering light the only beacon in the encroaching twilight.  The air itself seemed to hum with unseen energies, an unspoken language that only the elders of the town seemed to understand.
