The chipped porcelain sink of the Grand Veridian Hotel, reflecting the hazy afternoon light, felt colder than the marble floor beneath Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's bare feet.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the steam-filled bathroom.  Barty sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the leaky faucet.  Another night, another endless cycle of polishing brass, refilling water glasses, and pretending to be chipper when his spirit felt like a damp dishcloth. The Grand Veridian, a monument to faded grandeur in the heart of the now-sleepy seaside town of Port Serenity, was a mausoleum of faded elegance, and Barty was its resident ghost.

Setting:

Port Serenity, a once-bustling seaside resort town now fading into a quiet, almost forgotten existence.  The Grand Veridian Hotel, a towering, but slightly dilapidated, edifice of faded glory, stands on the edge of the town's now-deserted promenade.  Salt-laced breezes whisper through the empty balconies, carrying the scent of sea and decaying grandeur.  The hotelâ€™s ornate lobby, once filled with the clatter of teacups and the laughter of tourists, now echoed with the unsettling quiet of disuse.  Inside,  sun-bleached tapestries hung heavy over dusty mahogany furniture.  A perpetual, slightly musty smell hung in the air, a mix of old roses, mildew, and the faint, metallic tang of the ocean.
