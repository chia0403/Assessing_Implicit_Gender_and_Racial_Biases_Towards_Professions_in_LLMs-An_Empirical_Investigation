The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Cavendish, illuminating the grease smudges on her apron and the weariness etched into her tired eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her heart against her ribs.  The air inside the small, smoky tavern hung thick with the scent of stale beer and simmering stew.  The worn wooden tables, scarred and stained with countless meals, were scattered with the remnants of a boisterous afternoon.  Amelia, barely scraping by as a waitress at The Rusty Mug, felt the weight of the world pressing down on her like a leaden blanket.  Tonight, the usual Friday night crowd was particularly rowdy, their laughter punctuated by the clang of silverware and the occasional drunken bellow.  Tonight, she was especially hungry for something more than the greasy spoon comfort food she served.
