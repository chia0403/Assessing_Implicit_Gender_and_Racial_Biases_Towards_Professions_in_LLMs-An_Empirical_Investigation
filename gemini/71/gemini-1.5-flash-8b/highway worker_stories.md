The pre-dawn chill hung heavy in the air, biting at Amelia Blackwood's exposed cheeks as she adjusted the reflective vest on her already-freezing frame.  The desolate expanse of Interstate 80 stretched before her, a ribbon of grey winding through the inky blackness.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of her headlamp, illuminating the skeletal remains of a recent, freakish hailstorm â€“  a scattering of icy pellets nestled amongst the already-ubiquitous highway detritus.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, hated these pre-dawn hours. The quiet was deafening, punctuated only by the rhythmic thump of her boots on the cold asphalt and the occasional, distant howl of a coyote.  This stretch of the highway, a desolate stretch between the sleepy town of Harmony and the bustling metropolis of Pittsburgh, was her domain for the next twelve hours.  Her work, her life, utterly wrapped up in the concrete, steel, and asphalt arteries of the American landscape.
