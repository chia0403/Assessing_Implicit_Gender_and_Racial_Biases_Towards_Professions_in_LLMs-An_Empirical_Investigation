The rasping whine of the stone saw was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  He’d heard it since he was a boy, nestled amongst the chipped granite and echoing whispers of the quarry, nestled deep within the shadowed foothills of the Whispering Peaks.  He’d grown with the rhythmic clang of hammer on chisel, the soft, groaning sigh of splitting rock, and the pungent smell of earth and dust that clung to him like a second skin.  Elias Thorne, son of a stone-cutter and inheritor of a trade as ancient as the mountains themselves, knew no other life.

The quarry, a vast, cavernous space gouged from the mountainside, was Elias’s world.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the jagged rock faces, cast long, dancing shadows that shifted and writhed with the movement of the wind whistling through the crevices.  Dust motes, like tiny, ethereal butterflies, swirled in the air, illuminating the rough-hewn granite blocks stacked haphazardly against the walls.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the metallic tang of the tools, smelled of the relentless passage of time. Water, trickling down the unseen pathways of the mountain,  created miniature waterfalls and glistening pools reflecting the sky's fleeting hues.  A network of winding paths, worn smooth by generations of stone-cutters, snaked through the chaotic landscape, leading to the central work area where Elias worked, surrounded by the rough-hewn shapes that whispered of futures long past.
