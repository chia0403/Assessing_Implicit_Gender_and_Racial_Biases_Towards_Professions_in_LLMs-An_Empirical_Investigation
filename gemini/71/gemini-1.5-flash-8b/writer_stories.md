The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the steam a fragile, fleeting veil against the biting December air.  Outside, the snow crunched under the weight of a thousand tiny feet, the hushed symphony of winter echoing the quiet hum of her own thoughts.  Her tiny cottage, nestled at the edge of Blackwood Moor, felt like a cold, grey sarcophagus, the only warmth emanating from the flickering gas lamp in the hearth and the simmering pot of chamomile tea on the small, scrubbed wooden table.  Amelia Blackwood, writer of gothic tales and obscure histories, was staring out at the encroaching darkness, the vast expanse of the moor a canvas painted in shades of inky grey and bruised purple.  Within her, a story was stirring, a whisper of something ancient and terrible, something that craved to be set down on paper.  The unsettling chill, a constant companion of the moor, seemed to seep into her very soul, whispering promises and threats in a language only she could understand.  The wind howled a mournful dirge, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's pen against the worn, leather-bound journal resting on the table.  Today, Blackwood Moor would yield its secrets.
