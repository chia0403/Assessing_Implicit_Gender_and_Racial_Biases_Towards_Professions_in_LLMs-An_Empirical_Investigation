The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Reel" cafe cast a lurid, orange glow on the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto.  Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the cramped, back-alley space, a soundtrack to the low murmur of conversation and the clinking of teacups.  Inside, amidst the hazy scent of jasmine and stale coffee, sat Elias Thorne, director of acclaimed, though often controversial, films like *The Crimson Labyrinth* and *Echoes of the Silent City*.  Elias, a man whose sharp features were softened only by the faint weariness etched into his brow, stared at a meticulously crafted storyboard, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the muted palette of the cafe. He was agonizing over the final scene of his new film, tentatively titled *The Serpent's Whisper*.
