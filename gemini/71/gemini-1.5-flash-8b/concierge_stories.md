The rain hammered against the ornate copper roof of the Grand Astor, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat echoing through the hushed lobby.  Inside, amidst the swirling scent of polished mahogany and freshly brewed Earl Grey,  Amelia Ainsworth, concierge extraordinaire of the Grand Astor Hotel, meticulously arranged a selection of bespoke umbrellas.  Each one, a miniature masterpiece of lacquered wood and shimmering silk, pulsed with a subtle, almost imperceptible, shimmer.  Amelia, a woman whose elegant composure could withstand any tempest, surveyed her handiwork with a practiced eye.  Tonight, the Astor hosted a particularly discerning clientele: the esteemed members of the Crimson Quill Society, a literary collective renowned for their exacting standards and even more exacting tastes.  Tonight, their arrival was expected.

The setting: The Grand Astor, a majestic hotel nestled at the heart of the sprawling, fog-laden city of Aethelgard.  High above, the skeletal branches of ancient, gnarled trees clawed at the pale moonlight filtering through the heavy clouds.  The air, thick with the scent of impending rain and damp earth, carried the hushed whispers of the city's secrets, secrets that seemed to coil and condense within the very stones of the hotel itself.
