The fluorescent hum of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was a constant, almost oppressive, drone.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-coated windowpane, cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile white walls.  Dust motes danced in the single ray that pierced the gloom, a stark contrast to the meticulously organised, if slightly depressing, array of instruments lining the cabinets.  Eleanor Vance, her reflection staring back from behind the half-smoked cigarette resting in her ashtray, sighed. Another Tuesday. Another tedious extraction. Another patient who wouldn't listen.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance's dental practice was located in the decaying heart of Oakhaven, a once-proud suburb now struggling under the weight of economic hardship and neglect.  The chipped paint on the storefront and the boarded-up windows of neighboring shops spoke volumes about the neighborhood's decline.  A persistent smell of stale coffee and antiseptic lingered in the air, mingling with the earthy scent of the neglected park across the street.  The faded floral wallpaper in her waiting room hinted at a time when Oakhaven had been a place of vibrant, middle-class life. Now, the only vibrant thing was the pervasive sense of quiet desperation.
