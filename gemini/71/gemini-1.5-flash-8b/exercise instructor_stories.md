The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to the sweat-slicked floors of the "Apex Fitness" studio.  Sunlight, fractured by the multi-colored stained glass windows, painted shifting patterns on the gleaming chrome equipment.  Amelia "Amie" Nightingale, a petite woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its meticulously braided constraints, surveyed the room with a practiced eye.  Her navy exercise-top, usually flawlessly tailored, was now damp with exertion, clinging to her toned arms.  Amie, thirty-two, and the studio's resident "Energizer Bunny" of an instructor, was preparing for her 9:00 am "Power Surge" class.  A symphony of pre-workout chatter, echoing off the mirrored walls, was slowly morphing into the focused buzz of anticipation.  A half-dozen expectant faces, already dripping with the promise of a rigorous workout, stared at her from various stretches of cardio equipment. The rhythmic thump of a nearby elliptical machine beat a persistent, almost hypnotic rhythm against the low hum of the air conditioning.  This was Amie's domain, her kingdom of sweat and sculpted bodies, a kingdom she ruled with a combination of infectious enthusiasm and unwavering, if often unspoken, demands.
