The fluorescent lights of the Economy Class galley hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Carter's life for the past three years.  She wiped down the sticky residue of lukewarm coffee from a tray table, the scent of stale peanuts clinging to the air like a shroud.  Outside, the churning clouds of the pre-dawn sky promised a turbulent flight, and Amy, despite the practiced calm etched onto her face, felt a flicker of unease.  This wasn't just another flight. This was Flight 742, a route she knew intimately, and yet, tonight, every familiar landmark—the rolling hills of the Appalachian Mountains, the flashing lights of the city's airport—felt strangely ominous.


Setting:

The cramped, sterile galley of a commercial airliner, just before dawn.  A chill wind howled outside, battling against the hum of the plane's engines.  The flight's destination is a major East Coast city, but the specific city is vague.  The focus is on the enclosed environment, the feeling of isolation, and the unsettling feeling of something being off.  Amy's meticulous routines, her quiet strength, and the persistent sense of dread she feels all contribute to the atmosphere.
