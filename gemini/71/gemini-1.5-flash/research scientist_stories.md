The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Grace Holloway, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thermal layers she wore.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf stretched before her, a blinding white canvas under the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Icebergs the size of small countries calved silently into the churning, grey sea, their fractured edges glittering with an ethereal, dangerous beauty.  Evelyn shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The tremor that ran through her was a nervous one, born of anticipation, of the weight of years of research culminating in this single, crucial moment.  Tonight, under the watchful gaze of the Southern Cross, she would attempt to extract the ancient secrets held captive within the ice â€“ secrets that could rewrite the history of life on Earth.
