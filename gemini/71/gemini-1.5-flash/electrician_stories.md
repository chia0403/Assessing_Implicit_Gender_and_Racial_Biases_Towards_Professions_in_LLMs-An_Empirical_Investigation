The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Blackwood Lane, rattling the loose windowpanes of the dilapidated Victorian mansion before Elias Thorne.  Elias, a man whose calloused hands spoke more eloquently of his trade than any polished resume ever could, shivered, pulling his worn leather jacket tighter.  His breath plumed out in ghostly white clouds, instantly swallowed by the frigid air. The mansion, Blackwood Manor, loomed before him, a gothic behemoth of decaying grandeur, its once-proud stonework stained with the shadows of countless winters and, Elias suspected, a few secrets besides.  His toolbox, heavy with the tools of his electricians' craft – screwdrivers, wire strippers, and a trusty voltage tester – felt comforting against his hip.  He was here to fix the manor's electrical system, a job he'd taken reluctantly,  drawn in by a mixture of desperate need for work and an unsettling curiosity about the place.
