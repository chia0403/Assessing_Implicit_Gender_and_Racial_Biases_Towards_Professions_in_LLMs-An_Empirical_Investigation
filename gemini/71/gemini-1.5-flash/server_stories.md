The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky beneath Amelia Hernandez's fingertips, a familiar discomfort in the otherwise unremarkable diner.  Grease slicked the air, a cloying perfume of frying bacon and burnt coffee clinging to everything â€“ the vinyl booths, the checkered floor, even Amelia herself, despite her best efforts.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the clatter of plates and the low murmur of conversations, a soundtrack to the endless cycle of refills, complaints, and the occasional dropped fork that punctuated Amelia's Tuesday night shift at the Rusty Spoon.  Outside, the late-October wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the dusty windowpanes and promising a night of icy rain.  Inside, the Rusty Spoon offered only the lukewarm comfort of lukewarm coffee and the weary camaraderie of fellow servers, all hoping for a lull in the rush before closing time.
