The recycled air hung thick and stale, a peculiar blend of lavender hand lotion and airplane fuel, clinging to Seraphina "Sera"  Montgomery like a second skin.  Sera, a veteran flight attendant for Transatlantic Airways, adjusted her meticulously knotted scarf, the deep crimson a stark contrast to the sterile white of her uniform.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Heathrow Airport bled from inky black to a bruised purple, the promise of a sunrise barely visible through the swirling fog.  Inside the nearly deserted crew lounge, the quiet hum of the refrigerators and the distant, muffled announcements were the only sounds accompanying the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging with the measured patience of a life lived entirely in the air.  Tonight's flight, however, felt different.  A palpable unease settled in Sera's stomach, heavier than the duty-free whiskey she'd resisted the urge to indulge in.  This wasn't just another transatlantic flight; something feltâ€¦off.
