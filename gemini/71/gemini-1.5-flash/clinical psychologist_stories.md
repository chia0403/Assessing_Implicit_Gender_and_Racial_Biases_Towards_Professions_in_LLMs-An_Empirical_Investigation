The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn hatchback door closed against the howling wind.  Rain, thick and relentless, lashed against the windshield of her battered Subaru, blurring the already indistinct outline of the solitary lighthouse that marked the entrance to the craggy peninsula.  It was a fittingly bleak welcome to the Isle of Skye, a place where the wind seemed to carry the weight of centuries and the sea roared with the voices of forgotten shipwrecks.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specialising in trauma and grief, had come seeking respite from the relentless pressure of London life, but the raw, untamed beauty of the island felt less like a refuge and more like a mirror reflecting the turbulent emotions she hoped to leave behind.  The small, isolated village of Portree huddled in the distance, its lights like scattered embers against the inky canvas of the stormy night.  This wasn't a holiday; this was a retreat, a chance to reconnect with herself before the relentless tide of her patients' suffering pulled her under once more.
