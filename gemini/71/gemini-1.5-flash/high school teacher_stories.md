The stale scent of old textbooks and over-ripe bananas hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windows of Northwood High's history classroom, danced in the silence.  It was 3:17 pm, the precise moment when the echoing hush after the final bell usually descended, broken only by the squeak of her worn-out chair as she shifted, the rustling of papers, and the occasional sigh escaping her lips.  Today, however, the silence felt different, heavier, pregnant with an unspoken tension that vibrated in the very floorboards beneath her feet.  Outside, the usual cacophony of teenage laughter and screeching tires was muted, replaced by an unnerving stillness that seemed to press against the aged brick walls of the building.  Ms. Vance, a woman whose life revolved around the predictable rhythm of lesson plans and grading papers, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  Something was wrong. Very wrong.
