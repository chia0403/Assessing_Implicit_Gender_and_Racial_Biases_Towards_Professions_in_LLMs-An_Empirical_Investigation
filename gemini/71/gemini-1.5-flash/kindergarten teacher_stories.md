The chipped paint of the alphabet border peeled away like sunburnt skin, mirroring the peeling layers of Ms. Aurelia "Auri" Hawthorne's patience.  It was 8:03 AM, three minutes past the official start of the kindergarten day at Sunny Meadows Elementary, and already, chaos reigned.  A miniature tornado of glitter-encrusted limbs and shrieking laughter swirled around the brightly-colored construction blocks, threatening to topple the painstakingly constructed castle that little Timmy had been working on since before the bell. The air hung thick with the scent of impending tantrums, spilled juice boxes, and the faint, underlying sweetness of glue.  Outside, the October sun cast long shadows across the playground, painting the vibrant leaves in shades of fiery red and burnt orangeâ€”a stark contrast to the vibrant, yet slightly unsettling, energy contained within the four walls of Auri's classroom.
