The chipped Formica countertop felt cold against Elara Vance’s forearms as she meticulously polished a glass, the amber light of the setting sun casting long shadows across the dusty bottles lining the shelves behind her.  The Rusty Mug, nestled on the edge of Dustbowl Gulch, wasn't exactly the kind of place you'd find in travel brochures.  Its exterior was a faded ochre, punctuated by peeling paint and a sign that creaked mournfully in the desert wind. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, sawdust, and a peculiar, indefinable aroma that Elara suspected was a mixture of desperation and regret.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating the few weary patrons nursing their drinks – a grizzled prospector nursing a whiskey, a woman with eyes that held the weight of a thousand unspoken stories nursing a glass of something stronger, and a pair of scruffy gamblers whispering fiercely over a game of cards.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual desert stillness was broken by an unsettling tension, a quiet hum that vibrated beneath the surface of the Rusty Mug's customary desolation.
