The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood, sawdust, and something subtly sweet â€“ the almost imperceptible perfume of rendered fat clinging to the cold stone walls of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's butcher shop.  Barty, a man whose hands were as rough and calloused as a blacksmith's but whose touch with a cleaver was as delicate as a surgeon's, stood hunched over a slab of prime Angus beef, the flickering gaslight reflecting in the glint of his steel.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge through the narrow, cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the brooding Blackmoor Forest.  The year was 1888, and a chill deeper than the autumn air settled over Barty's shoulders, a feeling he couldn't quite shake, even as the warmth of the roasting fire crackled behind him.
