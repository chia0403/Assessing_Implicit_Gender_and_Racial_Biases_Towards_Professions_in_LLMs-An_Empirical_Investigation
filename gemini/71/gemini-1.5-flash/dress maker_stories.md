The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill October wind rattling the leaded panes of Aurelia Thistlewick's workshop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun struggling through the grimy windows, danced in the beams like tiny, mischievous sprites. Aurelia herself, a woman whose age was etched not so much in wrinkles as in the quiet strength of her hands and the knowing glint in her hazel eyes, hummed a low, almost inaudible tune as she meticulously stitched a cascade of delicate silk roses onto a blush-pink gown.  Her workshop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, atmospheric town of Oakhaven, was a chaotic symphony of fabrics: bolts of velvet piled haphazardly against rolls of shimmering satin, spools of thread in every conceivable shade spilling from overflowing baskets, and half-finished garments draped artfully over chairs and mannequins.  The air crackled with creativity, a stark contrast to the grey, brooding sky outside.
