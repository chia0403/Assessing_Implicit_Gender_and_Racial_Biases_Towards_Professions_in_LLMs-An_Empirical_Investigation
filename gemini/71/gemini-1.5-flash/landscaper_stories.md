The dawn mist clung to the emerald slopes of the Cotswolds like a reluctant lover, reluctant to release its hold on the dew-kissed grass.  A thin, pale sun struggled to pierce the gauze, casting long, skeletal shadows from the ancient oaks that guarded the sprawling estate of Ashworth Manor.  This was Elias Thorne's domain for the day, not in the sense of ownership, of course, but in the far more intimate and earthy way of a landscaper. Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as bark and whose calloused fingers knew the secrets of every blade of grass, every stubborn weed, every delicate bloom, surveyed his kingdom with the practiced eye of a seasoned general. The air, still cool despite the rising sun, carried the scent of damp earth and the faint, sweet perfume of honeysuckle, a symphony only he truly appreciated. His battered Land Rover, affectionately nicknamed "The Green Machine," hummed quietly nearby, a faithful steed awaiting its master's command.
