Outside, the bustling city of Alexandria thrummed with life, a stark contrast to the serene, almost sacred quiet of her domain.  But today, the quiet was fractured by a tremor, a subtle shift in the air, a feeling that something…unexpected, was about to disrupt the carefully ordered calm of her world.
