The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort he barely registered.  He gripped the railing of the ferry, the rhythmic churn of the engine a counterpoint to the relentless roar of the wind whipping across the turbulent grey waters of the Pentland Firth.  Below, the churning waves tossed the small boat like a child's toy.  Ahead, the stark silhouette of Hoy Island rose from the sea, a rugged sentinel cloaked in mist, its cliffs a jagged, unforgiving line against the bruised sky.  Elias, renowned architect and lover of brutalist structures, found a perverse beauty in the raw, untamed landscape.  This wasn't some picturesque Tuscan villa he was designing; this was a fortress against the elements, a testament to human ingenuity in the face of nature’s overwhelming power.  The commission, to design a sustainable research facility on Hoy’s windswept northern coast, was as challenging as it was exhilarating.
