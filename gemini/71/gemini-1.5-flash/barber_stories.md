The scent of bay rum and Old Spice hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar aroma that clung to the worn leather of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barber chair like a second skin.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb swinging precariously above, danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of Butterfield's Barbershop.  Barty himself, a man whose hands were as steady as the rocking chair in the corner – a chair that had witnessed countless haircuts and even more confessions – sat perched on a stool, meticulously sharpening his straight razor.  The rhythmic scrape of steel on hone was the barbershop's heartbeat, a steady counterpoint to the mournful whine of a distant factory siren.  Outside, the November wind howled a lonely tune through the cracks in the boarded-up buildings lining Elm Street, a stark reminder of the hard times gripping the small, forgotten town of Havenwood.
