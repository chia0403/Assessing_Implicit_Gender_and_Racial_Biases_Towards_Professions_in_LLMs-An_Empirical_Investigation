The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic clatter of Amelia Katherine Finch’s high heels on the polished terrazzo floor.  Amelia, or Amy as everyone except the CEO insisted on calling her, adjusted the pristine white collar of her blouse, a small, almost imperceptible twitch of anxiety betraying her otherwise perfectly composed façade.  The air in the reception area, usually thick with the cloying scent of lemon-scented air freshener and expensive cologne, was today tinged with a nervous tension, a silent hum of anticipation that vibrated beneath the surface of perfectly arranged orchids and the gleaming chrome of the coffee machine.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful symphony against the skyscraper’s glass facade, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost suffocating calm within.  This was not just another Monday morning at Zenith.  This was the day the audit began.
