The rasping shriek of metal on metal sliced through the pre-dawn quiet, a sound as familiar to Silas “Si” Blackwood as the taste of lukewarm coffee.  He flinched, not from the noise itself – years spent patching potholes had dulled most of his senses – but from the premonition it held.  The rhythmic thrum of the grader he’d been operating a moment before had died, leaving only the unsettling silence of the Nevada desert at 4:17 AM, broken only by the distant, mournful wail of a coyote.  The rising sun, a bruised purple orb struggling to break free from the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal Joshua trees that clawed at the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the Loneliest Road in America.  Si, his breath misting in the cool morning air, knew this wasn't just a mechanical failure. This was something… else.
