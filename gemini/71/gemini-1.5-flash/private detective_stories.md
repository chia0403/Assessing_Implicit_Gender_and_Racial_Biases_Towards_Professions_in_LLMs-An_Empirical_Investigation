The chipped porcelain mug warmed Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s hands, doing little to thaw the November chill that clung to the rain-slicked streets of San Francisco.  Fog, thick as pea soup, swirled around the crooked Victorian houses lining Lombard Street, clinging to the wrought-iron balconies like spectral shrouds.  From her cramped, book-lined office – more a glorified attic than anything else – Izzy could hear the mournful wail of a foghorn battling the rhythmic crash of waves against the nearby cliffs.  The scent of damp earth and salt hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the city's unforgiving beauty and the secrets it held close.  Tonight, however, the city’s usual melancholy felt amplified, mirroring the gnawing unease that had settled in Izzy’s gut since the cryptic phone call earlier that evening.  The voice, raspy and barely audible, had only whispered a single name before hanging up:  Julian Thorne.  And that name, Izzy knew, was the key to a mystery far darker and more dangerous than she had initially anticipated.
