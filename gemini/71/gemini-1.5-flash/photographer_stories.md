The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the railing of the *Seraphina*, a battered fishing trawler that smelled perpetually of diesel and cod, and adjusted the worn leather strap of his Leica around his neck.

The sky was a bruised purple, the kind that promised a spectacular, if brutal, sunset.  He was miles off the coast of the Shetland Islands, a remote archipelago where the land ended and the wild, untamed ocean began â€“ the perfect setting, he thought, to capture the raw, untamed beauty that always eluded him in the sterile confines of the city.  He was here, on this perilous assignment, to photograph the elusive "Phantom of the Floes," a legendary aurora borealis said to appear only under the most extreme conditions.
