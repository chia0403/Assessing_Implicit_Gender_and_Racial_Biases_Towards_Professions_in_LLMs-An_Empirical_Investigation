The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Aurelia “Auri” Bellweather’s pulse.  Auri, whose title was officially “Head Concierge,” but who preferred the simpler, more encompassing “problem-solver,” was knee-deep in a chaotic flurry of crumpled reservation slips, misplaced luggage tags, and a half-eaten croissant (a casualty of a particularly demanding guest demanding a gluten-free, vegan, and ethically sourced croissant at 3 AM).  The Grand Majestic, a crumbling monument to a bygone era of opulent travel, stood proudly, if somewhat precariously, overlooking the cobbled streets of Prague’s Old Town.  Its ornate façade, a tapestry of gothic arches and baroque flourishes, hid a labyrinthine interior that housed a collection of eccentric guests as colourful and unpredictable as the city itself. Tonight, however, the usual delightful chaos felt amplified, a discordant symphony orchestrated by a particularly ferocious thunderstorm and a surprisingly high number of delayed flights.
