The biting November wind whipped Sergeant Evelyn "Evie" Reed's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red.  She tugged her worn leather jacket tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped skin.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Blackwood Lane clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the rapidly fading light.  Blackwood, a town perpetually cloaked in a melancholic mist, seemed to sigh with the wind, a sound Evie had grown accustomed to over her ten years on the force, yet one that never failed to unsettle her. Tonight, the unsettling was amplified tenfold.  The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and something else… something metallic and faintly sweet, like old blood and decaying leaves.  This wasn’t just the usual quiet desperation of Blackwood; this felt… different.  Different and deeply wrong.
