The diesel grumbled a low, throaty song, a counterpoint to the howling wind that clawed at the sides of Earl "Big Earl" Thompson's eighteen-wheeler.  Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already indistinct Wyoming landscape into a swirling grey canvas.  The wipers fought a losing battle, smearing the downpour into streaks that mimicked the fatigue etched onto Earlâ€™s face.  He gripped the worn leather of the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the tan, the rhythmic thump of the tires on the Interstate the only constant in this desolate, storm-wracked night.  Ahead, the taillights of the rig in front of him were mere pinpricks of red, swallowed almost entirely by the oppressive darkness.  The only other light visible was the faint, ethereal glow of the distant, snow-capped peaks, a stark contrast to the murky expanse of the highway stretching out before him, a ribbon of asphalt disappearing into the heart of the approaching blizzard.
