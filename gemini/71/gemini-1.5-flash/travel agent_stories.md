The chipped paint of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's desk was a fitting metaphor for her life.  Flaking turquoise, once vibrant, now muted and worn, much like her enthusiasm for meticulously crafting bespoke itineraries for the discerning clientele of "Wanderlust Voyages." Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart. The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the exotic scents of faraway lands usually swirling around her â€“ sandalwood from India, the sharp tang of pine from the Canadian Rockies, the sweet, almost cloying perfume of jasmine from Bali.  Tonight, however, the only journey Amelia felt capable of was the short, dreary walk home.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Edinburgh's Old Town glistened under the streetlamps, each puddle reflecting a blurry, rain-streaked version of the city's brooding beauty.  But Amelia, buried under a mountain of paperwork and the weight of a particularly difficult client, saw only the dreary reality of her impending deadline and the very real possibility of losing her small, struggling agency.
