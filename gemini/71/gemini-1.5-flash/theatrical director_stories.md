This was a fight for survival, a battle waged not against critics, but against damp, decay, and the gnawing doubt that whispered, icy and insistent, in the hollow spaces behind her ribs.  Inside, the air hung thick with the ghosts of a thousand forgotten performances, the scent of dust and despair a potent perfume compared to the vibrant, heady aroma of greasepaint and possibility she craved. Isolde, a woman whose lifeblood was the clashing cymbals and soaring arias of the stage, felt strangely muted under the weight of this monumental task.
