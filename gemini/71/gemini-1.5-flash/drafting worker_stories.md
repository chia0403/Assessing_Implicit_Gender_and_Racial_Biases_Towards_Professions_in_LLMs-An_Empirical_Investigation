The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch-scratch-scratch of Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s pencil on Mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny constellations, danced in the weak shafts of sunlight filtering through the grimy office windows.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, squinted at the complex blueprint spread before her, a sprawling network of lines representing the soon-to-be-built Northwood City Library.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the sharp, chemical tang of drafting ink, a familiar scent that had permeated her life for the past five years, ever since she’d graduated top of her class from the Institute of Architectural Technology.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful song, rattling the windowpanes and mirroring the growing unease in Amy’s gut.  This project, the Northwood City Library, was proving to be anything but straightforward.
