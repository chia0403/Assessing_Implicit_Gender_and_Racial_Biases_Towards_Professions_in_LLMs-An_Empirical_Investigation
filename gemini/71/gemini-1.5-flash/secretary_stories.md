The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, a meager comfort against the pre-dawn chill seeping through the drafty window of her tiny office.  Rain lashed against the glass panes of the imposing Blackwood Building, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Amelia, a secretary whose life consisted of alphabetizing files, answering phones, and brewing endless cups of lukewarm coffee, wasn't used to this feeling – a knot of icy dread tightening in her stomach.  The Blackwood Building, a gothic monument to late 19th-century industry, usually hummed with a predictable, if slightly oppressive, efficiency.  But tonight, the usually vibrant city sounds were muffled, swallowed by the storm, leaving only the rhythmic slap of rain and the echoing silence of the deserted office floors.  The only light came from her desk lamp, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering neon sign of a late-night diner visible across the rain-slicked street.  Amelia knew something was wrong. Deep down, a chilling certainty pulsed, colder than the rain outside.
