The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia “Mia” Hernandez.  It clung to her scrubs, to the polished chrome of the instruments gleaming on the tray beside her, even seeming to permeate the pale green walls of Dr. Albright's office. Rain lashed against the panoramic window overlooking the bustling streets of downtown San Francisco, a blurry, grey watercolor painting outside the pristine white world of her dental hygiene station. Mia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, carefully checked the settings on the ultrasonic scaler, the low hum a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Today was shaping up to be a busy one, a typical Thursday, filled with the usual mix of anxious first-timers, chatty regulars, and the occasional patient who seemed to hold their breath throughout the entire cleaning.  But nothing, Mia thought, could truly prepare you for *him*.  The appointment listed simply as "Mr. Silas Blackwood, 10:00 AM,"  and the brief, chilling note scrawled across the top of his chart: "Proceed with extreme caution."
