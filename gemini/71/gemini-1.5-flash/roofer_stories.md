The wind, a relentless sculptor of ice, clawed at Elias Thorne's exposed knuckles as he wrestled a sheet of corrugated metal onto the steeply pitched roof. Below, the town of Havenwood huddled under a blanket of fresh snow, the church spire a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the bruised, grey sky.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds that instantly vanished, shifted his weight, the worn leather of his work boots crunching on the frozen shingles.  The air bit with a ferocity that promised frostbite, and the icy grip on the metal felt almost personal, a testament to the unforgiving January weather that had settled over Havenwood like a shroud.  The job – a repair on the dilapidated roof of Mrs. Gable's Victorian – was proving to be more challenging than even Elias, with his fifteen years of experience battling the elements, had anticipated.  The old wood groaned under his weight, a sound that resonated with the mournful howl of the wind, a symphony of impending collapse.
