The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Palace Hotel lobby, reflecting the weary slump of Augustus "Gus" Pipkin's shoulders.  Gus, a bellhop of twenty-two years with calloused hands and eyes that held the weight of a thousand lost suitcases, shifted his weight from one aching foot to the other. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of lilies and stale cigars, a familiar perfume of faded grandeur.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ornate windows of the Palace, a once-proud dame now showing her age in chipped plaster and peeling gilt.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the city into a hazy, indistinct watercolor.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the enormous grandfather clock in the corner, each second a tiny hammer blow against the suffocating silence of the nearly deserted lobby.  Tonight, however, the silence felt particularly heavy, pregnant with a premonition that Gus couldn't quite name.
