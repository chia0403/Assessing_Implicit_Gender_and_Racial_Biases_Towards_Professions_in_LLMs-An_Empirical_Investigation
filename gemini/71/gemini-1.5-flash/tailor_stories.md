The scent of woodsmoke and simmering goose fat hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  A thin drizzle, the kind that clung to everything and promised a longer, wetter day, plastered Elias's dark brown hair to his forehead as he hunched over a workbench cluttered with bolts of vibrant silk, spools of thread in every conceivable shade, and the half-finished coat of Lord Ashworth, a notoriously picky man whose impatience was only surpassed by his wealth.  Oakhaven itself was a huddle of crooked timber houses clinging to the steep slopes of a valley, the River Dove murmuring a steady, melancholic tune through the mist that swirled between the buildings.  The air, though damp, held a faint sweetness from the nearby orchards, a stark contrast to the sharp tang of the unwashed wool he was currently wrestling with.  The flickering candlelight cast long shadows across his meticulous workspace, making the fine gold embroidery on the coat shimmer like captured starlight.  This was Elias's sanctuary, his kingdom of needles and thread, but even here, the uneasy tremor that had settled in his bones since the letter arrived refused to relinquish its hold.
