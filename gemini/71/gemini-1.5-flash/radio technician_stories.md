The acrid smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, clinging to his grease-stained overalls like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the KNX Radio shack, a rhythmic drumming that competed with the frantic crackle of static emanating from the battered valve radio on his workbench.
