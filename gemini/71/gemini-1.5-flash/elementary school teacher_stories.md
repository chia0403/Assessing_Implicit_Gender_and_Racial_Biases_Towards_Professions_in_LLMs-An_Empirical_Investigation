The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Third Grade!” sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow, agonizing peel of Eleanor Vance's own patience.  It was the last day before summer break, a day traditionally celebrated with the chaotic energy of a thousand caffeinated squirrels, but this year felt different.  A thick, humid Georgia heat hung heavy in the air, clinging to the already stuffy classroom like a second skin.  The usual cacophony of chattering children was muted, replaced by a low hum of restless anticipation, punctuated only by the rhythmic whir of the ancient ceiling fan struggling against the oppressive warmth.  Outside, the cicadas buzzed their incessant summer song, a soundtrack to Eleanor’s simmering frustration.  Her normally vibrant classroom, usually a kaleidoscope of brightly colored artwork and carefully organized learning centers, felt strangely subdued, the vibrant posters dulled under the oppressive heat and the weight of a year’s worth of pent-up energy.
