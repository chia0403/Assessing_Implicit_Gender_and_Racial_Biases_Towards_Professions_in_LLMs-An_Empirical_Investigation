The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the deserted high school football field, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Floodlights, skeletal and unlit, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling gusts.  A lone figure, bundled in a thick, worn-out parka, stood hunched against the chill, his breath puffing out in white clouds. This was Elias Thorne, head football coach of the Westview High Wolverines, and the chill wasn't just in the air. It was in his bones, a deep, gnawing cold that mirrored the icy disappointment settling in his gut.  The season had ended, not with a bang, but a pathetic whimper â€“ a string of humiliating defeats that had left the team, and Elias, utterly demoralized.  The silence of the empty field was broken only by the rhythmic creak of the swing set swaying in the wind, a lonely counterpoint to the tumultuous season that had just passed.
