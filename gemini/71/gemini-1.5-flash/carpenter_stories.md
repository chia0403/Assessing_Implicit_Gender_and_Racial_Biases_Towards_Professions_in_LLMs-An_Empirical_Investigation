The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hauled the last of the cedar planks onto the rickety wharf.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and drying fish, hung heavy and humid over the tiny, windswept island of Aisling.  Aisling, a place where the emerald slopes of the hills tumbled down to meet the restless Atlantic, a place where time seemed to slow to the rhythm of the crashing waves and the creak of weathered wood. Elias, his calloused hands already raw from a day's work, squinted at the horizon, the setting sun painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and crimson.  His small workshop, a ramshackle affair nestled between the fishermen's cottages, was a short walk away, but the beauty of the evening held him captive for a moment longer.  Tomorrow, the timbers for the new lifeboat would need shaping, and Elias, the island's only carpenter, knew his skills were needed more than ever.
