The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne's cheeks, a familiar sting that mirrored the ache in his bones.  He stood on the crest of Widow's Hill, the wind whipping strands of grey from his weathered cap, and surveyed his domain: Thorne's Hollow, a patchwork quilt of emerald fields stitched together with silver ribbons of stream.  Mist clung to the valley like a shroud, obscuring the lower reaches where the barley swayed gently, their heads bowed in the nascent light.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the promise of a summer harvest, held a subtle undercurrent of woodsmoke and something elseâ€¦ something acrid, metallic, that pricked at the back of his throat.  This wasn't the usual scent of the Hollow. This was different. This was wrong.
