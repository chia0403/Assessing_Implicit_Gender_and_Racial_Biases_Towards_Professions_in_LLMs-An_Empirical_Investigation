The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's weathered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the single propeller.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, their snow-laden peaks disappearing into a swirling vortex of snow and mist.  Visibility was down to near zero, the only landmarks the occasional jagged silhouette of a peak, momentarily snatched from the gloom, then swallowed again by the storm.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  She hadn't flown in these conditions in years, not since the incident with the lost climbers on Denali, an incident that still haunted her dreams.  But tonight, there was no choice. A life hung in the balance, suspended somewhere between the earth and the unforgiving Alaskan sky.
