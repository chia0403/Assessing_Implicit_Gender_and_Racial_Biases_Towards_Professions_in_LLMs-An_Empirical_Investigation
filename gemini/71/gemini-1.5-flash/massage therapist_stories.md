The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the windowpanes of Serenity Now Massage Therapy.  Rain hammered a frantic tattoo on the aged slate roof, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of Elara Vanceâ€™s heart.

The usually tranquil sanctuary of her small, Victorian-era practice felt suffocating, the soft glow of the Himalayan salt lamps unable to pierce the gloom settling over her.  A half-finished cup of chamomile tea sat forgotten on her desk, its steam long since dissipated, mirroring the fading hope she felt trickling away with each drop of rain.  The flickering candlelight cast dancing shadows on the neatly arranged towels and the softly lit shelves stocked with essential oils, creating an atmosphere that was usually deeply soothing, but tonight, only served to highlight her inner turmoil.
