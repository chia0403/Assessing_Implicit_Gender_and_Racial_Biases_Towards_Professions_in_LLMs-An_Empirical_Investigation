The first frost of autumn had kissed the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, leaving a delicate sheen of ice on the dew-kissed blades.  A thin, persistent mist clung to the ancient oaks that guarded the estate, their skeletal branches clawing at the bruised purple sky.  Elias Thorne, the groundskeeper, hunched deeper into his worn tweed jacket, the collar pulled high against the biting wind.  His breath plumed out in ragged white clouds as he surveyed his domain â€“ acres of meticulously sculpted hedges, vibrant flowerbeds now surrendering to the chill, and the sprawling, gothic manor itself, a brooding sentinel against the encroaching twilight. The air hummed with a quiet, almost mournful energy, a stark contrast to the usual boisterous activity of the summer months. Elias felt it keenly, a premonition settling in his bones, heavier than the frost on the grass.
