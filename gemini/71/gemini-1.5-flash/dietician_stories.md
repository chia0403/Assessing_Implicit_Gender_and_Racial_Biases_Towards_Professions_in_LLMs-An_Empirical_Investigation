The humid air hung heavy and thick, clinging to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a second skin as she navigated the bustling marketplace of Oaxaca.  The vibrant chaos – a cacophony of hawkers shouting prices, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith’s hammer, and the fragrant perfume of roasting chiles and simmering mole – usually filled Eleanor with a sense of exhilarating discovery.  Today, however, the sensory overload felt oppressive.  The vibrant colours of the fruits and vegetables, usually a source of professional inspiration, swam before her eyes, blurring into a dizzying kaleidoscope.  Her stomach, usually a reliable compass guiding her through the gastronomic wonders of Mexico, churned with a queasy unease.  This wasn't the usual pleasant anticipation of a culinary adventure; this was something else entirely.  This was the unsettling calm before the storm – a storm brewing not in the sky above, but within the very heart of this ancient, enchanting city.
