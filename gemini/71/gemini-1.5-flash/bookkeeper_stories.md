The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Earhart Finch's hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her office.  Dust motes, disturbed by the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom, danced in the air above her cluttered desk, a miniature galaxy swirling amongst stacks of ledger books, neatly organized but threatening to topple at the slightest tremor.  Amelia, a meticulous bookkeeper with a penchant for sensible cardigans and even more sensible shoes, sighed. The rhythmic *click-clack* of her abacus, a relic from her grandfather, provided the only soundtrack to the quiet solitude of Finch & Finch Accounting, a small, family-run business nestled on the windswept corner of Bleaker Street and Sycamore Lane in the perpetually grey town of Ashworth, England.  The air smelled faintly of old paper, damp wool, and the lingering scent of her grandmother's lavender potpourri, a scent as comforting as it was undeniably dated.
