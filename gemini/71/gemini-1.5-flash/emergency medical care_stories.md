The salt spray stung Evelyn "Evie" Reed's face as the Coast Guard helicopter bucked violently in the turbulent air above the churning grey sea.  Rain lashed down, obscuring the already fading light of a late November afternoon.  Below, a small, battered fishing trawler tossed like a child's toy in the monstrous waves, its mast snapped clean off, a stark testament to the storm's ferocity.  Evie, her paramedic's kit strapped tight against her chest, gripped the side of the chopper, her breath catching in her throat.  The air was thick with the smell of brine and diesel, a familiar scent that usually held a certain salty charm. Today, it smelled of disaster. This wasn't just a rescue; this was a fight against the elements, a desperate race against time to reach three men clinging precariously to the wreckage, their lives hanging by a thread.  The radio crackled with urgent chatter, a chaotic symphony of instructions and pleas echoing the turmoil of the storm.  Evie, however, felt a strange calm settle over her.  This was what she was trained for.  This was what she lived for.
