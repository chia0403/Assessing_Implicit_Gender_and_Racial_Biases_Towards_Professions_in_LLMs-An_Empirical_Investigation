The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Ria" Davenport seemed capable of creating.  Ria, perched on a worn, velvet stool behind her antique barber’s chair, hummed a discordant tune as she expertly snipped at a client’s unruly curls.  Her salon, "Shear Genius," wasn't located in some trendy, upscale district; instead, it nestled precariously between a failing bakery and a perpetually-empty laundromat on a cobbled side street in the perpetually-twilight town of Oakhaven. Oakhaven, where the fog rolled in before breakfast and lingered until long after sunset, casting the town in a perpetual, melancholic grey. The only splashes of color were the vibrant, slightly faded posters of 1950s Hollywood glamour Ria had plastered on the walls, a stark contrast to the damp, almost gothic atmosphere outside.
