The chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring blankly at the ceiling, was the first thing Elara Genevieve Hayes noticed as she unlocked the creaky door to Sunny Meadows Daycare.  It was 6:00 AM, the pre-dawn light a weak, watery grey seeping through the grimy windows of the Victorian building.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale Play-Doh and something vaguely floral, a perfume clinging stubbornly to the worn floral wallpaper that peeled in strips near the baseboards.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient windowpanes in their frames, a stark contrast to the hushed quiet inside, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of an old grandfather clock in the hallway.  Elara shivered, pulling her worn cardigan tighter around her, not just from the cold, but from the uneasy feeling that always settled over her in this place, a feeling that ran deeper than the musty smell and peeling paint.
