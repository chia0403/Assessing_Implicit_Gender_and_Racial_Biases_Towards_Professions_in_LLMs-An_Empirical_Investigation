The stale scent of sweat and chlorine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia “Mia” Hernandez.  The Aqua-Fitness Center, nestled incongruously between a laundromat and a pawn shop on the grittier side of Ocean Avenue, hummed with the low thrum of underwater music and the rhythmic splashing of twenty-odd bodies.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the tiled floor, highlighting the faint scuff marks left by countless flip-flops and the occasional rogue water bottle. Mia, her own dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, surveyed her class from the edge of the pool, her bright pink swimsuit barely visible beneath a shimmering layer of sweat.  The midday heat, even this close to the ocean, was relentless. Today's routine, "Ocean's Fury," was proving particularly…fiery.
