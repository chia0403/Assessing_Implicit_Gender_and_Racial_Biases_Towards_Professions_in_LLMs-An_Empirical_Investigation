The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Stone’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, was overshadowed tonight by the metallic tang of blood – a scent that sent a shiver, distinct from the chill wind, down her spine.

Tonight, however, the usual symphony of hoots, rustles, and chirps was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence that prickled at her skin. The moon, a sliver of silver behind a curtain of dark clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows across the enclosures, making the familiar landscape seem both alien and threatening.
