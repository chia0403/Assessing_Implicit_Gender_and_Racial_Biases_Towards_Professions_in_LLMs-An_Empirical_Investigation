The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera”  Delacroix.  Her salon, "Shear Genius," nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of the whimsical, perpetually autumnal town of Emberwood, was bathed in the warm, honeyed glow of the setting sun.

Inside, Sera, with her crimson-streaked hair pulled back in a messy bun and a pair of paint-splattered overalls, was meticulously blending highlights into a client's already vibrant turquoise locks, the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears a counterpoint to the chatter of the town gossip spilling from a crackling radio.
