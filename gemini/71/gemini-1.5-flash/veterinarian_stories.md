The biting Alaskan wind whipped around Dr. Evelyn Reed’s parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick wool.  Ice crystals, sharp as tiny teeth, danced in the frigid air, reflecting the weak, pale sunlight off the snow-laden spruce trees that clawed at the sky.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic crunch of her boots on the packed snow as she trudged towards the isolated cabin perched precariously on the edge of a frozen lake. The cabin, barely visible beneath a thick layer of snow, was her destination – and the scene of a possible emergency.  A frantic call, crackling with static and fear, had reached her earlier that evening: a distressed voice pleading for help for a badly injured wolf.  The caller, a reclusive trapper named Silas Blackwood, had given her only the vaguest directions, leaving Dr. Reed to navigate the treacherous terrain alone, her battered Land Rover long abandoned a mile back on the icy track.
