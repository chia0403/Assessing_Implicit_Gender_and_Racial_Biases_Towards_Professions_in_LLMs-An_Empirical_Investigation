The clatter of trams and the cries of newspaper boys echoed through the cobbled streets of Spitalfields, London, in the autumn of 1903.  A damp chill hung in the air, the kind that seeped into the very bones and clung there like a persistent cough.  Inside his cramped workshop at Number 17 Fournier Street, Elias Finch, Tailor and Draper, meticulously chalked the outline of a waistcoat onto a length of deep indigo wool.  The gaslight hissed above him, casting long, flickering shadows that danced with the nimble movements of his hands. Bolts of cloth in every imaginable hue and texture lined the walls, their rich colours muted in the dim light. The air was thick with the scent of beeswax, freshly pressed linen, and the faintly metallic tang of pins. Elias, a man of compact build with hands calloused by years of meticulous work, hummed a melancholic tune as he worked, his brow furrowed in concentration.  A single raven feather, tucked behind his ear, bobbed in time with his humming, a peculiar but constant accessory.  Outside, the fog was rolling in, swallowing the city street by street, and with it, Elias knew, would come the unusual clientele of the season.
