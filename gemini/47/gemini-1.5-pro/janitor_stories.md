The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Memorial Hospital basement buzzed like trapped wasps. The air hung thick and heavy, a peculiar blend of disinfectant and the faint, metallic tang of blood that seemed to permeate every corner of the building, even down here.  Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket across the slick concrete floor.  Water sloshed over the rim, echoing in the cavernous silence. It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the hospital, a time when even the ghosts seemed to sleep.  The only other sounds were the rhythmic squeak of Elias's aging sneakers and the distant, muffled rumble of the city beyond the thick basement walls.  Tonight, however, something was different.  A low hum, almost imperceptible, vibrated through the floor, and a chill, unrelated to the basement's usual dampness, snaked its way up Elias's spine.
