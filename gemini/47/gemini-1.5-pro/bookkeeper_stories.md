The chipped porcelain sink, stained faintly ochre from years of Birmingham's hard water, gurgled a mournful protest as Elsie Amelia Higgins plunged her hands into the icy depths. The cramped scullery, attached precariously to the back of the Higgins’ modest terraced house, was as frigid as a meat locker on this November morning of 1953. Elsie shivered, her breath fogging the tiny window overlooking the neighbour's overgrown privet hedge.  Beyond the hedge, the low rumble of the Austin works began its daily crescendo, a soundtrack to Elsie's meticulous life.  She dried her hands on a threadbare tea towel, smoothing down the sensible cardigan clinging to her slim frame.  Numbers danced in Elsie's head, neat columns of figures adding, subtracting, balancing – a comforting counterpoint to the gnawing unease that had settled in her stomach the previous evening, a feeling as persistent and unwelcome as a damp patch on a newly plastered wall. Today, those numbers offered little solace.  Mr. Finch, the solicitor for whom Elsie kept the books, had requested her presence at his office first thing, a summons that deviated significantly from their usual Friday afternoon appointment.
