Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The ancient clock on the mantelpiece, a relic from a time when this building housed a shipping magnate rather than Cartwright & Davies, Accountants, chimed seven times. Seven pm on a Friday.  A Friday in November, no less, the kind that seeped into your bones with a damp, clinging chill that no amount of central heating could banish.  Beaâ€™s office, perched high above the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, usually offered a breathtaking view of the harbor. Tonight, however, all she saw was a blurred, grey expanse swallowed by the encroaching darkness and the relentless downpour. The only illumination came from the flickering gaslight beside her desk and the cool glow of her laptop, its screen reflecting the worry etched on her face. The meticulously ordered stacks of files and ledgers, normally a source of comfort and control, seemed to mock her tonight, their neatness a stark contrast to the chaotic tangle of numbers swirling in her mind.
