The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the frost-covered quad of Ashwood Preparatory Academy.  Gargoyles perched on the gothic revival buildings seemed to sneer down at her, their stone faces slick with rain. Ashwood, nestled in the secluded woods of upstate New York, was a place of stark contrasts: old money and scholarships, breathtaking beauty and a palpable undercurrent of anxiety.  Eleanor, clutching a file folder against her chest, felt that anxiety cling to her like the damp air. Inside the folder was the case file of Thomas Ashton, a scholarship student exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior.  His teachers reported withdrawn silences punctuated by outbursts of rage. His artwork, once vibrant and full of life, had become dark and disturbing. Eleanor had a growing unease, a feeling that Thomas Ashtonâ€™s troubles ran deeper than teenage angst.  This wasn't just a case of adjusting to the pressures of Ashwood; something else was lurking beneath the surface, something cold and unsettling.
