The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried across the near-deserted parking lot of Northwood High.  Fluorescent lights buzzed from within the squat, brick building, casting a sickly yellow glow onto the frost-covered asphalt.  Pine trees, heavy with the first snowfall of the season, lined the perimeter of the lot, their dark silhouettes stark against the bruised twilight sky.  Inside, the rhythmic thump of a basketball echoed through the empty hallways – a lonely sound in the rapidly emptying school. Amelia, clutching a stack of graded essays and a thermos of lukewarm tea, shivered, pulling her worn tweed jacket tighter around her.  She was looking forward to a quiet evening grading papers by the fireplace, a stark contrast to the chaotic energy that usually filled the halls of Northwood High.  Little did she know, the quiet wouldn’t last.
