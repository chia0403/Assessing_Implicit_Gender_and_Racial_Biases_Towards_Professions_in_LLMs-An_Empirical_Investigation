The humid Miami air hung heavy, thick with the scent of coconut oil and impending rain. Inside "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a botanica in Little Havana, the whir of the electric nail file was a constant, rhythmic hum.  Elena Maria Rodriguez, her name embroidered in cursive on her crisp white uniform, expertly shaped a client’s acrylics, her dark eyes focused, brow furrowed in concentration.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty front window, illuminating swirling motes of dust and the vibrant array of nail polish bottles lining the wall – a kaleidoscope of reds, blues, greens, and glitters that promised transformation. Elena, despite the oppressive heat and the relentless demands of her work, held a quiet smile, a secret satisfaction in her ability to bring a touch of glamour and joy to the lives of her clients, one perfectly polished nail at a time.  This Tuesday, however, was about to become anything but ordinary.
