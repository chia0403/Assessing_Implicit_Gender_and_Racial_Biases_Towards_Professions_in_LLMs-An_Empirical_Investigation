The flickering gaslight painted the cobbled alleyway in hues of orange and soot, barely illuminating the "Melodies & Memories" sign hanging askew above the dented doorway.  Rain, a constant companion in this part of New Avalon, slicked the cobblestones, reflecting the city’s neon glow like a shattered kaleidoscope.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap perfume, and something vaguely floral that couldn't quite mask the underlying dampness.  Seraphina “Sera” Jane Bellweather, her throat raw from a three-hour set and her stomach growling louder than the rickety upright piano in the corner, slumped against the dressing room mirror.  Her crimson lipstick, once vibrant, was now smeared, mirroring the fading glamour of this once-grand music hall.  Tonight's meagre audience had been less than appreciative, and the club owner, a man whose smile never quite reached his eyes, had shortchanged her yet again.  Sera sighed, the sound lost in the mournful wail of a saxophone leaking through the thin walls.  This wasn't the life she’d dreamed of when she first arrived in New Avalon, clutching her battered guitar case and a heart full of hope.
