The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a low, unsettling tune, reflecting off the sterile white walls of the phlebotomy lab.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the cityscape of Minneapolis into a shimmering, grey wash.  Eleanor Vance, a phlebotomist with ten years of experience and an uncanny ability to find a vein on even the most reluctant patient, tapped a pen against her clipboard, a nervous habit she'd picked up during flu season.  It was a Tuesday morning, just past six, and the pre-dawn quiet was already starting to fracture with the arrival of the first outpatients.  The air held that distinct hospital smell - antiseptic and vaguely metallic - a scent Eleanor usually found comforting, but today, it felt thick with anticipation.  Something felt...off.
