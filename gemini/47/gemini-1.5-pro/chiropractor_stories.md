Across the street, Elias's own shingle, "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness," remained stubbornly dark, a stark contrast to the boisterous revelry emanating from the bar.  It was almost midnight on a Tuesday in January, and the normally bustling Clark Street in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood was deserted, save for a lone, shivering dog walker hurrying past and the occasional taxi splashing through slush-filled potholes.  Elias had stayed late, poring over x-rays and patient files, trying to decipher the source of Mrs. Petrov's persistent sciatica. He rubbed his temples, feeling the beginnings of a headache forming behind his eyes. He just wanted to get home, a warm fire, and a good book awaited him, but a nagging feeling, a prickle of unease, kept him rooted to the spot.  Something felt…off.
