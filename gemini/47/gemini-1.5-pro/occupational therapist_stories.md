The biting November wind whipped Amelia Reyes's dark hair across her face as she navigated the icy walkway to the Elderwood Rehabilitation Center.  Elderwood, a sprawling brick building nestled amidst the stark, snow-dusted pines of the Catskill Mountains, felt isolated even on a clear day, and today, the swirling grey clouds and impending blizzard only amplified its remoteness. Amelia, bundled in a thick wool coat and sturdy boots, shivered and pulled her scarf tighter.  Inside her satchel, carefully packed amongst her assessment tools and therapy putty, was a small, brightly wrapped package.  It was Elias’s birthday today – Elias Vandergelt, her most challenging, and perhaps her most rewarding, patient.  He'd been at Elderwood for six months following a severe stroke, and Amelia, despite the long drive and often harsh weather, found herself looking forward to each session with the enigmatic old man.  Today, however, something felt different.  A strange tension hung in the air, a palpable unease that went beyond the usual pre-storm anxiety.  As Amelia pushed through the heavy oak doors of Elderwood, the scent of antiseptic and overcooked vegetables was overpowered by something else, something faintly metallic… something unsettling.
