The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the open window of  Mademoiselle Elodie Beauregard's atelier, a symphony of urban life she had long grown accustomed to.  Her workroom, nestled above a bustling bakery on Rue de Fleur in the heart of 1888 Paris, was a haven of quiet creativity amidst the city's clamor.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes, illuminated swirling clouds of chalk dust motes dancing above the richly coloured fabrics draped across dress forms.  Elodie, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat chignon, pinned a length of sapphire-blue silk to a mannequin, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The scent of lavender and freshly baked bread mingled in the air, a comforting familiarity that always seemed to inspire her.  This particular commission, a ball gown for the Duchess de Valois, was her most ambitious yet, and its success could catapult her small atelier into the upper echelons of Parisian haute couture.  But beyond the shimmering silks and intricate lace, Elodie harboured a secret, one as carefully concealed as the tiny stitches in her exquisite creations, a secret that threatened to unravel the meticulously crafted life she had built for herself.
