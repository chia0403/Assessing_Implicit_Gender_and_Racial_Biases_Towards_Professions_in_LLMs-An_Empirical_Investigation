The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, Director of the Grand Majestic Theatre, as he stood on the fire escape, a cigarette dangling precariously from his chapped lips.  Below him, the alley reeked of stale beer and discarded dreams, a fitting aroma for the back end of a theatre clinging to life in the dilapidated heart of New Bedford.  The Grand Majestic, once a jewel of the whaling town's cultural scene, now wore its faded grandeur like a threadbare coat.  Peeling paint clung to the brick facade, and the once-proud marquee advertised tonight's performance in flickering, inconsistent neon: "A Midsummer Night's Dream - FINAL WEEK!"  Elias inhaled deeply, the acrid smoke doing little to soothe the gnawing anxiety in his stomach. This wasn't just the final week of Shakespeare; it was likely the final week of the Grand Majestic, period.
