The air hung thick with the medicinal tang of antiseptic and the faint, sugary scent of the bubblegum-flavored fluoride treatments favoured by Dr. Peterson, her perpetually cheerful, if slightly overzealous, boss.  Amelia, perched on the edge of her rolling stool, meticulously sharpened a scaler, the metallic rasp a small, defiant sound against the backdrop of the downpour.
