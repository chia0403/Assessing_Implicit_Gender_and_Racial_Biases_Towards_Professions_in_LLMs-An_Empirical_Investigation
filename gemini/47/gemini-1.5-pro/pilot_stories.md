The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's flight jacket as she prepped the Cessna 172 Skyhawk for takeoff.  The Alaskan wilderness stretched before her, a tapestry woven with snow-dusted spruce forests and the jagged teeth of the Chugach Mountains.  It was a brutal landscape, beautiful and unforgiving in equal measure, and Mia, with her dark, wind-chapped cheeks and a gaze as sharp as a hawk's, knew it intimately.  The small airstrip, little more than a cleared patch of frozen ground near the remote village of Knik, was her launching pad into this vast, untamed world.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with the fiery hues of a dying sunset, promised a challenging flight to Anchorage.  But for Mia, challenges were just part of the job, a job she wouldn't trade for anything. The faint smell of woodsmoke, carried on the wind from the nearby village, mingled with the scent of aviation fuel, a familiar and comforting aroma that always put her at ease.  This was her element. This was home.
