The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of Dartmoor, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's veterinary clinic.  The meager light of a late November afternoon struggled to penetrate the swirling mist, casting long, skeletal shadows of the bare-branched trees against the stone walls.  Inside, the clinic was warm and smelled faintly of disinfectant and hay.  Elias, a tall man with kind eyes and a perpetually worried frown, paced the worn floorboards, his stethoscope swinging rhythmically against his worn tweed jacket. The only other occupants of the room were Mrs. Higgins' ginger cat, Marmalade, curled up asleep on a heated blanket in a corner cage, and a half-eaten pasty sitting forlornly on a chipped enamel plate beside a stack of well-thumbed veterinary textbooks. The silence was broken only by the occasional crackle of the fire in the grate and the mournful cry of a curlew somewhere out on the windswept moor.  Something felt amiss, a prickle of unease that Elias couldn't quite place. It wasn't just the isolation, or the approaching darkness, or even the ominous weather. It was a deeper feeling, a sense of foreboding that settled in his bones like the damp chill of the moor itself.
