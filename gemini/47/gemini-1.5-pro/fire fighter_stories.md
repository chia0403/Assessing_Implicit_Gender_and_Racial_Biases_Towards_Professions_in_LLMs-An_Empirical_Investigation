The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hayes's dark braid across her face as she stared up at the five-story brownstone.  Flames licked greedily at the boarded-up windows of the third floor, sending a plume of acrid smoke curling into the bruised twilight sky above Brooklyn.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the crackling inferno.  The air, thick with the smell of burning wood and something chemical she couldn't quite place, stung Amy's nostrils.  Engine 27 hadn't arrived yet, and the small crowd gathered on the sidewalk behind the police barricade murmured nervously.  A woman clutched a child, both their faces illuminated by the flickering orange glow. Amy, her gloved hands clenched tight around the strap of her helmet, knew every second counted.  This wasn't just a fire; it was a time bomb ticking in the heart of her neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant.
