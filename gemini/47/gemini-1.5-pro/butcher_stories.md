The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat, carrying the scent of sawdust and woodsmoke from the nearby lumber mill.  It was a smell that usually comforted him, a familiar aroma of his hometown, Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged Oregon coast.  But today, the wind felt less like a welcome and more like a warning.  The sky was the bruised purple of a rotting plum, promising a storm that could churn the normally placid Pacific into a frothing beast.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the cleaver strapped to his thick leather apron, the metal cold against his calloused fingers.  He surveyed Thorne Family Meats, its small, gabled storefront nestled between Mrs. Oâ€™Malley's bakery and the dusty, perpetually closed Port Blossom Cinema.  The flickering neon sign above the shop, shaped like a plump pig, buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow over the freshly displayed cuts of meat in the window.  This morning, however, Elias wasn't focused on the prime rib or the plump sausages.  He was staring at the single, crimson handprint smeared across the glass, just below the pig's winking eye.
