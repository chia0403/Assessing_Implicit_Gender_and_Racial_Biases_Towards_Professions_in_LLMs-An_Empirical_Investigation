The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell thick and acrid in the air.  Elijah "Eli" Blackwood, sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead, pressed his boot against the edge of the smoking patch, smoothing the molten black goo into place.  Below him, the sprawling cityscape of Cincinnati shimmered in the heat haze, a tapestry of brick and glass and concrete stretching to the hazy horizon. From his precarious perch atop the twenty-story Wainwright Building, even the Ohio River seemed reduced to a glittering ribbon winding its way through the valley. The only sounds were the distant drone of traffic, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eli's roofing hammer, and the low rumble emanating from the building's ancient air conditioning unit.  A single hawk circled lazily overhead, riding the thermals rising from the baking rooftops. It was the kind of day that made you understand why they called it the dog days of summer.  A day that tested the limits of human endurance, a day made for cold beer and air conditioning, not for toiling under a merciless sun. But for Eli, it was just another Tuesday.
