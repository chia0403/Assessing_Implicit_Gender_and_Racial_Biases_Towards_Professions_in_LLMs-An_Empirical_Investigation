The siren shrieked, a banshee wail cutting through the humid Charleston night.  Rain lashed against the windshield of Medic 1, blurring the already distorted glow of neon signs reflecting on the slick cobblestones of East Bay Street. Inside, Amelia “Mia” Catherine Hayes, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, adjusted her stethoscope and gripped the side bar as the ambulance lurched around a corner.  The radio crackled, dispatch relaying fragmented information: possible GSW, victim down in the alley behind The Blind Tiger, a notoriously rough dive bar. Mia’s stomach tightened. This wasn’t tourist Charleston with its horse-drawn carriages and antebellum charm. This was the other Charleston, the one lurking in the shadows, and tonight, it held someone’s life in its grip.
