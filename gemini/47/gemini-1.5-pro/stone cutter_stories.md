The biting wind whipped off the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the ghostly whisper of crumbling granite.  The sun, a pale disc barely visible through the swirling snow, cast long, distorted shadows across the valley floor where nestled the small village of Whisperstone. Its houses, huddled together like sheep in a blizzard, were built from the same grey stone that formed the towering cliffs above.  In the heart of the village, before a half-finished statue of a griffin, its wing still unfurled from the rough block, stood Elias Thorne, his calloused hands raw and red despite the thick gloves he wore. He squinted at his work, his breath clouding in the frigid air, a frown etching deep lines into his weathered face. This griffin, commissioned by the village elder, was meant to be his masterpiece, a testament to his skill as a stone cutter and Whisperstone’s guardian against the mythical wyverns said to roam the peaks. But Elias’ heart wasn’t in it.  His gaze drifted up towards the mountains, his mind preoccupied not with the creature of stone but with the whispered rumours of a far greater danger lurking in the high passes.
