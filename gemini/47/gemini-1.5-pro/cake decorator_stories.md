The scent of buttercream and almond hung heavy in the air, a sugary fog that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s apron and the tips of her auburn curls. Outside, the blustery November wind rattled the paned windows of "Sugar & Bloom," her tiny cake shop nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique store on the quiet end of Oakhaven’s Main Street.  Inside, fairy lights twinkled, casting a warm glow on the mismatched vintage cake stands and the shelves overflowing with sprinkles, edible glitter, and fondant molds shaped like everything from unicorns to garden gnomes.  Amelia, humming along to a jazzy Christmas tune crackling from the radio, smoothed the fondant icing on a three-tiered masterpiece destined for a society wedding, her nimble fingers working with the precision of a surgeon and the artistry of a sculptor.  This Saturday, usually bustling with customers, was eerily quiet.  The only sound besides the music and the wind was the gentle whir of the stand mixer in the corner, patiently churning another batch of her signature vanilla bean frosting.  Amelia glanced at the clock, a delicate porcelain thing shaped like a cupcake, and frowned. It was almost noon, and she hadn’t had a single customer.  A shiver of unease, a premonition as light as powdered sugar but just as persistent, settled in her stomach. Something was different about this Saturday.
