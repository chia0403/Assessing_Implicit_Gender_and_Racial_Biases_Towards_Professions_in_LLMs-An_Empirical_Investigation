The biting wind whipped across the Derbyshire moors, carrying the scent of damp earth and the mournful cry of a curlew.  Frost glittered on the browning bracken, and the skeletal branches of a lone hawthorn tree clawed at the steel-grey sky. This was Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s favourite time of year. Not for the weather, of course, which could peel the skin from your face faster than a wire brush, but for the stark, uncompromising beauty of it all.  It stripped the landscape bare, revealing the bones of the land, the muscular contours usually softened by a riot of summer green. And it was in these exposed contours that Amelia, trowel tucked into the pocket of her waxed jacket, found her inspiration. This morning, her canvas was Chatsworth Edge, a dramatic escarpment overlooking the Derwent Valley, and her client, the notoriously difficult Lord Beaumont, was expecting nothing less than a miracle.
