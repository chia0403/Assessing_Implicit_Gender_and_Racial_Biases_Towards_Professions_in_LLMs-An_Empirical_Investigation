The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the neon glow of the Gas & Grub sign outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and faintly microwaved hot dogs.  Amelia, her nametag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, tapped her chipped cherry-red nails against the worn countertop. The Quick Stop, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed pawn shop on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Indiana, wasn't exactly glamorous, but it paid the bills.  And right now, bills were all that mattered.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer, breaking the hypnotic spell of the rain and the humming lights.  Amelia plastered a practiced smile on her face, ready for whatever Harmony Creek, and its quirky inhabitants, would throw at her next.
