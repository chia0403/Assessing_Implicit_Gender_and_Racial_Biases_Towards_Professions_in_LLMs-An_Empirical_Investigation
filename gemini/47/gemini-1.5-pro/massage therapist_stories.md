The insistent California sun, filtered through the gauzy curtains, warmed Amelia Reyes’s small treatment room to a comfortable, drowsy temperature. Eucalyptus and lavender hung heavy in the air, a calming balm against the persistent hum of traffic on Melrose Avenue just outside.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a loose bun, adjusted the bolster beneath the empty massage table, smoothing the crisp white sheet with practiced hands.  Her space, “The Kneaded Knot,” tucked away in a charmingly dilapidated bungalow between a vintage clothing store and a perpetually busy nail salon, was her sanctuary.  Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in Amelia's own stomach. It wasn’t the usual pre-client jitters. This appointment, scheduled for 10 am sharp, was different. It was with Jasper Thorne, the reclusive Hollywood composer known as much for his haunting film scores as his eccentric, almost mythical, reputation.
