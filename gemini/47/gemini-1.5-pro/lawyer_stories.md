Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of St. Jude's, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Amelia Hayes’ stiletto heels on the worn marble floor.  The cavernous space of the church, usually filled with the hushed murmurs of prayer, echoed with the storm's fury.  Amelia, her full name Amelia Grace Hayes, Esq., clutched her briefcase tighter, its leather slick with moisture.  The air smelled of damp stone and something else, something faintly metallic that pricked at the back of her throat. It was a smell she recognized from her years as a prosecutor, a smell that whispered of violence.  Beneath the soaring arches and the watchful gaze of the painted saints, a figure lay sprawled in the center aisle, a pool of crimson blooming around them like a macabre rose.  The church's ornate beauty served only to heighten the stark brutality of the scene.  This wasn't how Amelia envisioned spending her Saturday morning, especially not just hours after winning what she thought would be her final, career-defining case.  She was supposed to be on a plane to the Caribbean, celebrating. Instead, she was back in the trenches of Chicago’s unforgiving legal landscape, staring death in the face.
