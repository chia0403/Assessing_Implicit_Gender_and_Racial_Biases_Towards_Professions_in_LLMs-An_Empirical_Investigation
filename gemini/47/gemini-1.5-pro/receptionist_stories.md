The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the ornate Art Deco windows, blurring the view of the usually bustling Times Square.  Amelia, perched behind her polished mahogany reception desk, smoothed the wrinkles from her crisp navy uniform.  The Grand Majestic, with its faded grandeur and eccentric clientele, was a far cry from the sleek, modern hotel she'd imagined working in when she graduated hospitality school. Yet, there was a certain charm to the place, a whisper of forgotten glamour that clung to the frayed velvet drapes and tarnished gold fixtures.  Today, however, the charm was wearing thin. The lobby was deserted save for Mr. Henderson, the resident ghost hunter, who was currently attempting to coax a spirit from a potted fern with a homemade EVP recorder.  Amelia sighed, pushing a loose strand of her auburn hair behind her ear.  This was going to be a long day.
