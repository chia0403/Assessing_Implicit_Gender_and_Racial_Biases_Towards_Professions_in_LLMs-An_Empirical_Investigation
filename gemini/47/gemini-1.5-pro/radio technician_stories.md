The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Diner" cast a sickly green glow across Elias Thorne's grease-stained workbench. Dust motes danced in the single bare bulb illuminating the cluttered interior of his radio repair shop, a cramped space tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the desolate town of Dustbowl, Nevada.
