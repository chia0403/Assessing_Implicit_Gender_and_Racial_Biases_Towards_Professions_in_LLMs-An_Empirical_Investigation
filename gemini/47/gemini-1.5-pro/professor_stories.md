The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the medieval stonework, their grimaces seemingly amplified by the swirling mist that clung to the ancient buildings.  The gas lamps, recently lit against the encroaching dusk, cast flickering pools of orange light, barely penetrating the gloom.  Alistair clutched a worn leather satchel overflowing with student essays, his breath puffing out in white clouds as he made his way towards the warm sanctuary of his rooms in the Old Quad.  He had promised himself a quiet evening grading papers and nursing a glass of sherry, a ritual he cherished above all others.  But the unsettling quiet of the normally bustling quadrangle, and a single, out-of-place magpie perched on the window ledge of his study, gave him a distinct premonition that this evening would be anything but ordinary.
