The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, stinging Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s cheeks even through the layers of fleece and windbreaker. Dawn hadn’t quite broken yet, painting the eastern sky a bruised purple, and the sodium lamps cast long, eerie shadows from the construction cones lining the closed-off lane.  Amy, a compact woman with perpetually wind-chapped lips and hands calloused from years of hard labor, stamped her feet against the cold asphalt, the rhythmic thud a counterpoint to the lonely hum of the generator powering their work lights. The air smelled of diesel and damp earth, the familiar scent of a roadwork morning.  Five miles outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Nevada, a section of the highway had crumbled after an unusually harsh winter, leaving a gaping pothole the size of a small car. Amy and her crew, the only signs of life in this pre-dawn vastness, were tasked with patching it before the morning commute turned this quiet stretch of road into a roaring river of steel.
