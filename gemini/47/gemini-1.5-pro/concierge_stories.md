The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity.  Crystal chandeliers scattered rainbows across the polished marble floor, reflecting in the gleaming brass accents of the art deco furniture.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the tall windows, blurring the view of the Champs-Élysées into a shimmering Impressionist painting.  Inside, however, the air was warm, scented with lilies and the faintest hint of expensive perfume.  This was Antoinette Dubois’s domain.  With her impeccably coiffed auburn hair and a smile that could charm the birds from the trees, Antoinette, the hotel’s chief concierge, surveyed her kingdom with a practiced eye.  Nothing escaped her notice, from the slightly frayed cuff of the bellhop’s uniform to the anxious tapping of a guest waiting for a taxi.  It was a Tuesday in November, a typically slow day, or so she thought.  The ringing of her antique telephone shattered the illusion of calm.
