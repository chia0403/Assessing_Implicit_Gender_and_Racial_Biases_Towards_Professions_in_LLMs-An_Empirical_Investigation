The air smelled of pine resin and damp earth, a familiar and comforting scent to Jed, who had spent most of his thirty-two years amidst these woods. This particular stand of timber, nestled high in the remote Methow Valley of Washington State, was his latest conquest, a dense tapestry of Douglas Fir and Ponderosa Pine earmarked for the insatiable hunger of the sawmills down in the valley.  Jed, his calloused hands already aching with the promise of the day's labour, adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson and surveyed his domain, a lone figure against the backdrop of the imposing wilderness. He knew this place intimately, every ridge and gully, every whispering creek and silent, snow-laden meadow. This was his life, raw and unforgiving, but undeniably his.
