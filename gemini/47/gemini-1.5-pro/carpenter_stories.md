The rasping shriek of a saw biting into oak echoed through the crisp morning air, mingling with the scent of sawdust and pine resin.  Sunlight, still low in the sky, slanted through the open doorway of Elias Thorne's workshop, illuminating a whirlwind of wood shavings dancing in the golden beams.  The workshop, nestled on the outskirts of the sleepy village of Oakhaven, bordered the whispering expanse of Whisperwind Forest.  It was a small, cluttered space, overflowing with the tools and half-finished projects of a dedicated craftsman:  planes hung neatly on a pegboard, chisels rested in a worn leather roll, and curls of wood littered the floor like fallen leaves. Elias, a man built like the oak he so often worked with, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his sawdust-covered hand. His calloused fingers traced the smooth curve of a chair leg he was shaping, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips. He had a commission to finish, a cradle for the village mayorâ€™s first grandchild, and the deadline loomed.  But this morning, an unfamiliar tension hung in the air, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with deadlines.  The forest, usually a source of tranquility, seemed to hold its breath, waiting.
