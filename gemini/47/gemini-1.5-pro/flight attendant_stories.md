The stale recycled air hung heavy in the cabin, thick with the faint scent of airplane coffee and someone's overly enthusiastic application of duty-free perfume.  A sliver of pre-dawn light sliced through the gap in the window shade, illuminating dust motes dancing in the otherwise dim cabin of the Boeing 777.  Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez smoothed down her navy blue uniform skirt, a familiar weariness settling in her bones. Flight 147 from Seoul to New York was almost over, just a few hours left of navigating demanding passengers and lukewarm meals.  Outside, the first blush of sunrise painted the swirling cloud tops a delicate peach, hinting at a crisp autumn morning awaiting them in JFK.  But for Mia, the promise of solid ground held little appeal.  Her apartment in Queens felt less like a home and more like a glorified storage unit, a place to stash her suitcase between trips that increasingly blurred together in an endless cycle of takeoffs and landings.  This particular flight had been particularly trying, with a crying baby in row 22 and a businessman in 1A who seemed to think the call button summoned a personal butler.  As she prepared for the final descent, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that something was different this time. The air crackled not just with static, but with a strange, almost anticipatory energy.
