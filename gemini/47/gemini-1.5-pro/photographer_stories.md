The salt spray kissed Eleanor Vance's face as she leaned precariously over the railing of the *Mermaid's Sigh*, a rickety fishing trawler that was more rust than boat.  The grey dawn clung to the choppy waters of the North Atlantic, painting the sky in bruised hues of purple and gunmetal grey.  Eleanor, clad in a thick, oil-stained fisherman's sweater several sizes too big and fingerless gloves, gripped her vintage Leica M6 tightly, its cold metal a familiar comfort against the biting wind. She was miles off the coast of Newfoundland, a place where jagged cliffs met a restless sea, a landscape as unforgiving as it was breathtaking. This was her element, the raw, untamed beauty a balm to a soul weary of the polished sterility of city life. She was here to capture the heart of the ocean, the fleeting moments of light and shadow that danced on the waves, the stoic resilience of the fishermen who braved these treacherous waters.  This trip was about more than just photographs, though; it was a pilgrimage, a desperate search for something lost within herself, something she hoped the wildness of the sea could help her find.
