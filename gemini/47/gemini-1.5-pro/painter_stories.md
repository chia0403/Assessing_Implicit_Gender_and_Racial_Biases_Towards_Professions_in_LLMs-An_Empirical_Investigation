The biting November wind whipped strands of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the scene before her.  Perched precariously on a three-legged stool at the edge of Widow Finnigan’s overgrown garden, Amelia shivered, pulling her threadbare shawl tighter around her.  The cottage, nestled in a small valley just outside the quaint village of Port Blossom, Maine, was a tumbledown affair, its cedar shingles silvered with age and speckled with moss.  Yet, in the fading afternoon light, with the skeletal branches of the ancient elm tree reaching towards the bruised-purple sky, Amelia saw not decay but beauty.  The tangled chaos of the garden, a riot of late-blooming asters and withered sunflowers, whispered a story of resilience, a stubborn refusal to surrender to the encroaching winter.  It was precisely this kind of melancholy beauty that Amelia sought to capture on her canvas, the kind that resonated deep within her soul and begged to be shared with the world.
