Rain lashed against the grime-streaked window of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Cigarette smoke, thick as a Louisiana swamp fog, clung to the air, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of a desk lamp.  Her office, nestled above a perpetually dusty antique shop on Royal Street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, usually exuded a certain bohemian charm. Tonight, however, it felt more like a coffin, the dripping water a morbid metronome counting down to something unpleasant.  Cassie, all sharp angles and restless energy, paced the worn wooden floor, the heels of her scuffed ankle boots clicking a staccato rhythm against the silence between thunderclaps.  A half-empty bottle of bourbon sat beside a battered typewriter on her desk, a testament to the long and fruitless hours she'd spent trying to decipher the cryptic note that had arrived earlier that day.  It simply read: "The past never truly sleeps, Ms. Moreau. Especially in this city."
