The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, clawing at Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's trench coat as she stood on the edge of Navy Pier.  The Ferris wheel, usually a beacon of bright, touristy joy, was dark and still against the bruised purple sky, its skeletal frame a stark contrast to the swirling grey clouds overhead.  Below her, the usually bustling pier was deserted, the only sounds the mournful cry of gulls and the rhythmic slap of waves against the pilings.  This wasnâ€™t the Chicago Izzy knew. This Chicago held its breath, waiting.  She pulled her collar higher, the damp chill seeping into her bones.  A call had come in just after 2:00 am - a body had been found near the carousel.  And not just any body.  This one was Judge Elias Thorne, found draped over a gilded, prancing horse, a single playing card clutched in his stiff hand.
