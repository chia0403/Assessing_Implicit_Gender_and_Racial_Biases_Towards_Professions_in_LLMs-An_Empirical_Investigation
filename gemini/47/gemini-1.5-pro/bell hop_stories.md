The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, exhaling a gust of frigid Chicago air that whipped at Elias Finch’s perfectly creased trousers.  Snow swirled in miniature blizzards around the wrought-iron lampposts lining Michigan Avenue, painting the already dusk-laden sky a bruised purple.  Built in 1903, the Grand Majestic was a relic of a bygone era, all polished mahogany and glittering chandeliers, a haven for the old-moneyed elite and those who aspired to be. Elias, with his crisp uniform and ever-present smile, was a small, vital cog in this opulent machine. He was, at nineteen, the youngest bellhop the hotel had ever employed, and arguably the most enthusiastic.  Tonight, however, a flicker of unease danced behind his usually bright eyes. The Christmas Eve gala was in full swing, the air thick with the scent of pine and expensive perfume, and something felt… off.  Not wrong, exactly, but different.  Like a subtly shifted chord in a familiar melody.
