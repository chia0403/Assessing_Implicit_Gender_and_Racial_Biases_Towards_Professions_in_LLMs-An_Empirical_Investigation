The humid Florida air hung heavy, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a damp towel.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, even before the 6:00 AM Body Sculpt class had officially begun.  Sunrise painted the eastern sky in shades of vibrant pink and orange, reflecting off the turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico, visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Sandpiper Key Fitness Center.  Amy adjusted the microphone clipped to her neon pink tank top, its wire snaking down and disappearing into the waistband of her black leggings.  A playlist of pulsating electronic dance music throbbed softly through the strategically placed speakers.  Twenty-five brightly colored yoga mats lay scattered across the polished wooden floor, awaiting the arrival of the early-morning fitness enthusiasts who would soon fill the space with their grunts, groans, and the rhythmic thud of dumbbells hitting the floor.  Amy took a deep breath, the scent of chlorine from the adjacent pool mingling with the tang of salt air, and smiled.  This was her domain.  This was where she reigned supreme, motivating, inspiring, and sculpting bodies one burpee at a time.
