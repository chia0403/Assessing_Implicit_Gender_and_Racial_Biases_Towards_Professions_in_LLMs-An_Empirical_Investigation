The chipped Formica tabletop, sticky with the residue of a thousand spilled sodas, reflected the flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner. Rain lashed against the large front windows, blurring the already hazy view of Route 66. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia Grace Holloway, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, sighed and wiped a stray curl of her fiery red hair from her forehead. It was a slow Tuesday night, even for a roadside diner in the middle of nowhere, New Mexico. The only other occupants were a trucker nursing a cup of black coffee and a couple huddled in a booth, arguing in hushed tones. Amelia glanced at the clock above the counter. 11:57 pm. Three more minutes until she could finally lock up and escape the oppressive quiet.  Three minutes until she could go home to her cramped trailer and dream of a life beyond the greasy spoon and the endless expanse of desert highway.
