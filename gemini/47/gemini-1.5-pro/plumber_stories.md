The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Periwinkle, stinging her cheeks and turning her already chapped lips a painful shade of violet.  She tugged her woolen cap further down, its bobble brushing against the rusted "Periwinkle Plumbing - No Pipe Dream Too Small" sign bolted to the side of her battered Ford Transit.  Agnes, perched precariously on her toolbox, squinted at the house before her: Number 13 Hemlock Lane, a gloomy Victorian mansion hunched beneath the shadow of brooding evergreens.  Its gabled roof sagged like a tired dowager, and most of the windows were boarded up, giving the impression of a cyclopean beast with cataracts.  Agnes’s breath plumed out in white puffs as she hopped down, the frozen ground crunching beneath her work boots.  This wasn’t her usual kind of job – leaky faucets and clogged drains in cheerful suburban semis – but Mrs. Grimshaw, the solicitor handling the estate, had promised an exorbitant sum to get the old house’s plumbing up to code before the auction.  Agnes, perpetually struggling to keep her small business afloat, couldn't afford to turn down such an offer, even if the place looked like it belonged in a Gothic horror novel.  She grabbed her wrench and headed for the creaking front porch, a strange shiver dancing down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.
