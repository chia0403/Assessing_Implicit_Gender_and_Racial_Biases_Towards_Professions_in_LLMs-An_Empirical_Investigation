The fluorescent lights of the Albany County Probation Office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the grime-streaked windows, mirroring the grey, oppressive weight settling over her.  Eleanor, full name Eleanor Beatrice Vance, sat hunched over a stack of pre-sentence reports, the cheap particleboard desk digging into her forearms.  Outside, beyond the relentless downpour, the decaying grandeur of downtown Albany, New York, painted a bleak picture.  Brownstones, once proud, now wore peeling paint like open wounds, and the wind whistled through broken windowpanes like a mournful ghost.  This was Eleanor's world: a landscape of broken promises and second chances, where hope often felt as elusive as a dry day in November.  Today, however, felt particularly heavy.  A new case file sat atop the pile, its stark white cover a glaring contrast to the worn manila folders beneath.  The name scrawled across it in thick black marker sent a shiver down her spine:  "Anthony Marino."
