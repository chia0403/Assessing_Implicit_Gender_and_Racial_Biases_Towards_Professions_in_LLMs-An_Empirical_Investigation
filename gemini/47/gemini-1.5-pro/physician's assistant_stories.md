The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark braid across her face as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital. The ancient stone buildings, huddled together against the grey North Sea sky, seemed to groan under the weight of the approaching storm.  Salt spray hung thick in the air, coating everything in a fine, gritty film. Port Blossom, a small fishing town nestled on the craggy coast of Maine, rarely saw weather this harsh this early in the season, and Amy shivered, pulling her worn fleece tighter around her.  Inside, the fluorescent lights of the clinic buzzed, a stark contrast to the brooding gloom outside.  Tonight, Amy was the sole provider on duty, a responsibility that usually settled comfortably on her shoulders, but tonight, something feltâ€¦off. The air crackled with an almost palpable tension, a premonition that hung heavier than the impending nor'easter.
