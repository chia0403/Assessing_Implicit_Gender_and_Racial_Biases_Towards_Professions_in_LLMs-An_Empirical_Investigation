The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually lulled Amelia “Amy” Reyes into a meditative state while she polished glasses.  Tonight, however, the incessant drumming only amplified the throbbing in her temples. The wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves, rattling the single, flickering neon sign that advertised "Coldest Beer This Side of the Mississippi."  Inside, the only other occupants were two grizzled regulars, hunched over a checkerboard in the corner, their game punctuated by grunts and the clatter of plastic pieces.  The Rusty Mug, nestled halfway between nowhere and even-less-than-nowhere on a lonely stretch of Nevada highway, wasn't exactly known for its bustling nightlife, but even for a Tuesday, it was eerily quiet.  Amy glanced at the clock above the dusty bottles of whiskey: 11:57 pm. Three minutes until closing time, three minutes until she could lock the door against the storm and the unsettling silence, and finally head home to her tiny trailer.  Three minutes that felt like an eternity.
