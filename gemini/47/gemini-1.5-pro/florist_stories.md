The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled, a fragile counterpoint to the rumbling thunder outside. Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and lilies displayed there.  Eleanor Ainsworth, her hands dusted with pollen and smelling faintly of freesia, looked up from the intricate funeral wreath she was assembling.  The shop, nestled between a dusty antique store and a perpetually busy dry cleaners on Bleecker Street, was a haven of fragrant calm amidst the chaotic energy of Greenwich Village. Sunlight, when it managed to pierce the frequent New York downpours, streamed through the large front windows, illuminating the rows of potted plants and buckets overflowing with blooms in every shade imaginable. Today, however, the only light came from the warm glow of the lamps Eleanor had strategically placed amongst the foliage, casting long, dancing shadows that swayed with the rhythm of the storm.
