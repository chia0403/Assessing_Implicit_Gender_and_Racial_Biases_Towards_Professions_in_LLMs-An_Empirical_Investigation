The biting November wind whipped around Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Vance as she surveyed the muddy, churned-up field.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the nearly bare oak trees lining the perimeter of Caldwell High School's football stadium.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and the lingering scent of freshly cut grass, hung heavy with the weight of unspoken tension.  It was the night before the biggest game of the season, the regional championships, and the usually boisterous Caldwell Cougars were eerily silent.  Ellie, her breath clouding in the frigid air, pulled her threadbare Cougars jacket tighter around her.  This wasn't just any game; this was a chance at redemption, a chance to prove that Caldwell, a small-town underdog, could take on the Goliath of Northwood High and win.  And Ellie, the first female head coach in the school's history, was determined to lead them to victory.
