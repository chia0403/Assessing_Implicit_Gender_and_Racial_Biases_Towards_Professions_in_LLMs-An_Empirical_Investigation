The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Eleanor Vance's ankles as she hurried along the cobblestone streets of Hollow Creek, Massachusetts. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, mirroring the wisps escaping from the chimneys of the quaint, clapboard houses lining the narrow road.  Eleanor, a registered dietician with a penchant for sensible shoes and oversized cardigans, clutched her briefcase tighter, the leather cold against her gloved hand. She was late. Not disastrously late, but late enough to make her stomach clench with a familiar anxiety.  Hollow Creek, a town seemingly untouched by time, prided itself on its traditions, and punctuality was chief among them. Today's appointment was with the notoriously particular Mayor Agatha Grimshaw, who’d summoned Eleanor to discuss the town’s upcoming harvest festival – and, more specifically, the nutritional value, or lack thereof, of its centerpiece: the legendary Grimshaw Giant Pumpkin Pie.
