The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the desolate expanse of Iceland's Snæfellsnes Peninsula.  Jagged volcanic peaks, capped with perpetual snow, clawed at the iron-grey sky.  Black sand beaches stretched out like mournful ribbons along the churning North Atlantic, the waves crashing against the shore with a rhythmic roar that swallowed all other sounds.  Five brightly colored campervans, their windows frosted with a thin layer of ice, huddled together in a designated parking area overlooking the dramatic cliffs of  Djúpalónssandur beach. Mia, bundled in a thick, moss-green parka and sturdy hiking boots, clapped her hands together, the sound sharp in the frigid air.  Her breath plumed out in front of her, momentarily obscuring the bleak but breathtaking panorama. "Alright, everyone!" she called, her voice clear and strong despite the wind, "Welcome to the gateway to the center of the Earth!"  A ripple of nervous laughter passed through the small group of bundled-up tourists emerging from the vans.  This, Mia knew, was where the real adventure began.
