The biting November wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Black Mesa Plateau, stinging the exposed skin of Rosalie “Rosie” McClintock.  Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, swirling red dirt against a backdrop of steel-grey sky.  Rosie, bundled in a thick Carhartt jacket and perched high in the cab of her Caterpillar D11T dozer, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  The air vibrated with the low rumble of the machine’s idling engine, a familiar rhythm that resonated deep within her.  Below her, the scarred earth stretched out like a giant, freshly tilled garden, marked with the precise lines of the future open-pit coal mine.  This was Rosie’s domain, a harsh and unforgiving kingdom carved out of rock and dust, where she reigned supreme.  Today, however, the usual hum of anticipation that accompanied a new project was replaced by a knot of unease in her stomach.  Something felt… off.  The wind carried a whisper that wasn't just the usual moan of the mesa; it sounded almost like a sigh.  And it was getting colder, much colder, than it should have been for early afternoon.
