The rusty squeak of the barber's pole outside "Shear Perfection" was the only sound that dared interrupt the hushed stillness of Harmony, Nebraska, population 842. Inside, Beatrice Amelia "Bea" Cartwright wiped down her chrome shears with a practiced hand, the scent of bay rum and talcum powder thick in the air.  Sunlight streamed in dusty shafts through the shop's large front window, illuminating faded photographs of intricate pompadours and perfectly sculpted beehives â€“ testaments to Bea's forty-year reign as Harmony's sole hair artist. This Tuesday morning, however, the only customer in sight was a fly buzzing lazily around a wilting fern in the corner.  Bea sighed, the small sound swallowed by the quiet.  Harmony might be a town where everyone knew your name, but it was also a town where everyone knew your hair was due for a trim next Tuesday, and planned accordingly.  This Tuesday, however, something felt different. A low hum vibrated beneath the floorboards, a subtle tremor that had nothing to do with old Mr. Henderson's ancient pick-up truck rattling down Main Street. Bea glanced out the window, a prickle of unease dancing on her skin. The cornfields stretching beyond the town limits shimmered under the summer sun, seemingly undisturbed. But the humming persisted, a low, rhythmic pulse that promised something... something was coming.
