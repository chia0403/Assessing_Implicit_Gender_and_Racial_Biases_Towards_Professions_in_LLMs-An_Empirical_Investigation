The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years as a guidance counselor.  Her office, a converted storage closet sandwiched between the boisterous band room and the perpetually pungent boys' locker room, was a haven of organized chaos.
