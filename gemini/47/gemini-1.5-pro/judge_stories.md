The mahogany in Judge Elias Thorne's chambers seemed to absorb the weak November sun filtering through the gothic windows, leaving the room in a perpetual twilight.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light that illuminated the worn leather of his desk, where a half-eaten apple sat beside a stack of case files, each a miniature monument to human failing. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the grand old courthouse in Ashton, Maine, a town clinging precariously to the rocky coastline like a barnacle on a ship’s hull. Ashton was a place where secrets festered like seaweed in the tide pools, and Judge Thorne, with his sharp eyes and even sharper mind, was often the only one who knew the true depths of their decay.  This morning, however, a different kind of chill settled in his bones, one unrelated to the coming winter.
