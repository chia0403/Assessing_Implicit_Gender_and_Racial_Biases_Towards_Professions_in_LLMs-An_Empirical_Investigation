The aroma of cardamom and browning butter hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Eloise Clementine Thistlewick, her apron dusted with flour and her chestnut braid coming undone, hummed a wordless tune as she slid another tray of spiced apricot danishes into the brick oven.  Her bakery, "The Sugarplum & Spice," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually busy florist on Lavender Lane, was her sanctuary. The narrow cobbled street, lined with quaint shops painted in pastel hues, was still asleep, the only sound the gentle clinking of Eloiseâ€™s tools and the occasional rumble of a delivery truck in the distance.  The rising sun, a sliver of apricot peeking over the rooftops, cast long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating the mismatched chairs and tables scattered around the small space.  It was Thursday, market day in the small town of Hazelbrook, and Eloise had a mountain of baking to do.
