The biting wind whipped off the East River, stinging Amelia Reyes's cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal frame of the Zephyr Tower.  Steel girders clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a metallic skeleton yearning for its glass skin.  Forty-two stories of ambitious, almost arrogant, architecture that Amelia had poured her heart and soul into for the past three years.  Below her, the cacophony of Manhattan – the blare of horns, the distant wail of sirens, the rumble of the subway – was muted, replaced by the rhythmic clang of metal on metal as the construction crew worked late into the evening.  Amelia, bundled in a thick wool coat and a hard hat that did little to tame her unruly curls, felt a thrill of satisfaction, tinged with a familiar undercurrent of anxiety, course through her. This was it.  Her masterpiece. Or, if the critics proved as vicious as she anticipated, her downfall. The Zephyr Tower, perched precariously on the edge of Lower Manhattan, was either going to cement her reputation as a visionary architect, or send it crashing down around her, much like the threatened demolition of the historic tenement buildings it now overshadowed.
