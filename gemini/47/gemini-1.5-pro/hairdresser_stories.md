The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill seeping through the cracks in the salon's aged brick walls.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Shear Divinity" sign into a vibrant, watery smear.  Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name embroidered in elegant cursive on her pristine white smock, surveyed her domain.  Scissors flashed in her nimble fingers, snipping away at the split ends of Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s permed bob with the precision of a surgeon. Shear Divinity, tucked between a laundromat and a suspiciously empty fortune teller's shop in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, was Amelia's life's work, her sanctuary, and occasionally, her prison.  The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival and pulling Amelia from her thoughts.  "Just a moment, darling," she called out, her voice warm and melodic, before turning back to Mrs. Henderson with a reassuring smile. "Almost done."
