The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks even through the layers of thermal fleece.  He adjusted his goggles, the world shifting from a blinding white to a slightly less blinding white, punctuated by the stark, angular shapes of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  The year was 2042, and the once-isolated research outpost had become a bustling hub of scientific activity, thanks to the discovery of the 'Anamoly' – a subglacial lake exhibiting bizarre energy fluctuations. Aris, a glaciologist and geophysicist, had dedicated the last five years of his life to studying it, drawn by its perplexing nature and the promise of unlocking secrets hidden beneath the ice for millennia. The low hum of the station’s geothermal generators was a constant, almost comforting presence against the alien silence of the vast icy desert that stretched to the horizon. Tonight, however, that hum was overshadowed by a different sound, a high-pitched whine that was growing steadily louder, emanating from the direction of the Anomaly itself.  Aris felt a prickle of unease beneath his layers of protective clothing. Something was different. Something was wrong.
