The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as the ferry churned its way across the choppy waters of Puget Sound.  Rain, a persistent drizzle that clung to everything like a damp shroud, plastered her dark hair to her forehead.  Below, the grey expanse of the water reflected the equally grey sky, a monochrome canvas broken only by the occasional flash of white from a seagull’s wing.  Eleanor, bundled in a waterproof jacket far too heavy for the late-May weather, gripped her battered leather briefcase, its contents – assessment forms, therapeutic putty, and a well-worn copy of "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" – jostling against each other.  She was headed to Bainbridge Island, a picturesque escape for Seattleites, but today, for Eleanor, it felt less like a getaway and more like a trek into the unknown.  Her new client, a reclusive artist named Silas Blackwood, lived in a secluded cabin perched precariously on the island's rugged coastline, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the locals.  This wasn't just another occupational therapy assignment; it felt more like an expedition.
