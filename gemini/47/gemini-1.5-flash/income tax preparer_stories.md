The fluorescent lights of Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's tiny tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy with the weight of impending deadlines.

Bea, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun that spoke volumes about the stress levels of the past few weeks,  sipped lukewarm coffee from a chipped mug adorned with a cartoon badger wearing a tiny accountant's hat.  Outside, the April wind howled a mournful dirge, mirroring the anxieties of her clients waiting patiently – or not so patiently – in the cramped waiting room.  The chipped paint on the walls and the worn floral armchair whispered tales of countless tax seasons past, each one as chaotic and demanding as the current one promised to be.
