The polished brass of the Art Deco elevator doors reflected Aurelia “Aura” Bellweather’s crisp, navy suit as they slid open with a sigh of compressed air.  The scent of old money and lilies – a signature of the Vanderlyn – hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Aura as her own reflection. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking Central Park, transforming the cityscape into a shimmering, emerald canvas.  Tonight, however, the glittering lights of Manhattan held less allure than the hushed anticipation thrumming beneath the Vanderlyn’s impeccably maintained façade.  Aura, concierge extraordinaire and keeper of its many secrets, adjusted the discreetly placed headset nestled in her perfectly coiffed auburn hair.  Another night, another intricate dance of desires and demands awaited her in the opulent belly of this gilded cage.
