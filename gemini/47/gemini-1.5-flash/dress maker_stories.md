The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn wooden floors of Esmeralda "Esme" Nightingale's atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windowpanes, dappled the bolts of silk and brocade stacked haphazardly against the walls, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the grey, perpetually overcast sky of 1888 London.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, each a tiny, glittering star in the otherwise gloomy space.  Esme herself, a woman whose nimble fingers could coax magic from thread and needle, sat hunched over a half-finished gown, the rich emerald fabric shimmering under the flickering gaslight sheâ€™d positioned beside her sewing machine.  The rhythmic whir of the machine, a modern marvel in her otherwise antiquated workshop, punctuated the silence, a counterpoint to the persistent drip, drip, drip of a leaky tap somewhere in the building's aging plumbing.
