The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a peculiar counterpoint to the gentle hum of the waiting room's aquarium.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, D.C., watched a fat, orange goldfish lazily circle a plastic castle, its movements mirroring the slow, deliberate rhythm of her own breathing.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her practice, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Seattle into a watercolour wash of grey and silver.  Inside, the air was warm and dry, a sanctuary from the tempest brewing outside.  The plush, oversized chairs were unoccupied, a rare occurrence for a Wednesday afternoon.  Eleanor, however, found the quiet a welcome respite.  The relentless demands of her practice, the constant pressure to alleviate pain and restore mobility, had left her feeling as taut and strained as a tightly wound spring.  Today, the silence offered a chance to unwind, even if only for a fleeting moment before her next patient arrived.
