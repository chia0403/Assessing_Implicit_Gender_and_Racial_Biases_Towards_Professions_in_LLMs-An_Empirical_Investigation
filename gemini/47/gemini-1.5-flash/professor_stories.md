Professor Eleanor Vance, PhD, adjusted her spectacles, the faint scent of old paper and pipe tobacco clinging to the lenses.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her study, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the aged oak panes.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful symphony through the skeletal branches of the ancient elms that clawed at the sky surrounding Blackwood Manor, its silhouette a jagged, inky stain against the bruised purple of the twilight.  Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering gaslight above her desk, casting long, dancing shadows that writhed and stretched like restless spirits across the meticulously organized chaos of her research – stacks of leather-bound books, overflowing drawers brimming with handwritten notes, and a half-empty bottle of sherry, a testament to a long night spent deciphering a particularly cryptic manuscript.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else…something indefinably ancient and unsettling.
