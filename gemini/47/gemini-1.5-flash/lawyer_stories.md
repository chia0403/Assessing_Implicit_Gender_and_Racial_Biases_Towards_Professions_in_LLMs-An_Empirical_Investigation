The salt spray stung Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s face as the ferry churned its way through the churning grey waters of Puget Sound.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since she'd boarded in Edmonds, plastered her dark hair to her forehead.  Below, the Olympic Mountains, shrouded in mist, looked like slumbering giants, their peaks barely visible through the thick curtain of rain.  Mia, a corporate lawyer with a reputation for icy composure and razor-sharp wit, felt anything but composed.  The ferry’s rhythmic chugging was a counterpoint to the frantic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  She gripped her worn leather briefcase, its contents – a mountain of case files related to the impending takeover of  Seabreeze Shipping – feeling heavier than ever.  This trip to Bainbridge Island wasn't for a leisurely weekend; it was the start of a fight that could sink her career, and possibly, something far more precious.
