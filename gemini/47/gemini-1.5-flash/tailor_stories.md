The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn wooden floorboards of Elias Thorne's tailoring shop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the stillness.  Outside, the cobblestones of Bellweather Lane were slick with a recent rain shower, the sounds of the bustling city – the rumble of carts, the shouts of street vendors – muffled by the thick, aged walls of Elias’s shop. Elias Thorne himself, a man whose life seemed as intricately woven as the finest silk he worked with, sat hunched over a half-finished waistcoat, his needle flashing in the dim light.  His fingers, gnarled with age and stained with years of dye, moved with a practiced grace that belied their weariness.  The air thrummed with a quiet intensity, a palpable sense of anticipation hanging as heavy as the scent of lavender, because tonight, Elias was expecting a very special client.
