The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that blanketed the sprawling expanse of the Bar None Ranch.  Icicles, like jagged teeth, hung from the eaves of the weathered bunkhouse, their glassy surfaces catching the weak, watery sunlight.  The air bit with a ferocity that could freeze the marrow in your bones, a familiar sting to Jedediah “Jed” Stone, a man whose face, etched with the lines of sun and hardship, reflected the unforgiving beauty of the Wyoming landscape.  He stood on the porch, a thick woolen coat pulled tight around him, the collar turned up against the biting wind, his gaze fixed on the distant, snow-covered peaks of the Absaroka Range.  The silence, broken only by the mournful howl of the wind, was heavy with the unspoken anxieties of a winter threatening to bury the ranch, and everything Jed held dear, beneath a suffocating blanket of white.
