The recycled air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of cheap perfume and stale coffee, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  She stood by the galley, the rhythmic thrum of the Boeing 747 a constant lullaby beneath the cacophony of the cabin.

Sera, however, caught glimpses between serving lukewarm tea and navigating the maze of cramped aisles, each breathtaking vista a fleeting reminder of the life she’d left behind on the ground – a life filled with dusty books and quiet evenings, replaced now by the constant whir of engines and the demanding rhythms of 30,000 feet. Tonight's flight, a red-eye from London Heathrow to JFK, promised to be particularly challenging.  The whispers of a potential storm brewing over the eastern seaboard added a nervous energy to the already tense atmosphere.
