The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the dusty windowsill, mirroring the slow disintegration of Eleanor's carefully constructed lesson plan.  Rain lashed against the panes of the old, drafty classroom at Oakhaven Elementary, a relentless drumming that matched the nervous tattoo of her fingers against the worn wooden desk.  Outside, the usually vibrant autumn foliage was a sodden, bruised mass of brown and grey.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of wet wool coats and impending doom â€“ the doom of a looming parent-teacher conference with the notoriously formidable Mrs. Petrov, whose son, Dimitri, seemed determined to single-handedly lower the class average in every subject imaginable.  Even the cheerful sunflowers Eleanor had painstakingly drawn on the whiteboard seemed to droop in sympathy.
