The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  Agnes Periwinkle, a woman whose name suggested a whimsical life far removed from the grim reality of her job, sighed, the sound swallowed by the low hum of the fluorescent lights.

Agnes ran a hand through her already unruly auburn curls, the gesture more a manifestation of her inner turmoil than an attempt at tidiness.  She glanced at the clock: 2:17 pm.  Another hour until her meeting with Elias Thorne, a repeat offender whose charming smile never quite managed to mask the simmering menace in his eyes.  The city of Oakhaven, draped in a perpetual twilight of November drizzle, seemed to hold its breath, waiting to see if Thorne would break, again.
