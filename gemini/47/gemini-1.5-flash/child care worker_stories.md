The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the collar of her thick wool coat pulled high.  Loose snowflakes, the first serious flurry of the season, danced in the amber glow cast by the streetlamps, painting the already twilight world in a shimmering, ethereal frost.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts hung heavy in the air, a comforting contrast to the chill that seeped into her bones.  Ahead, nestled between a Victorian bakery with steam puffing from its chimney and a whimsical bookshop overflowing with brightly coloured children’s titles, stood Sunny Days Daycare – Amelia's domain, a chaotic haven of crayon scribbles, half-finished Lego castles, and the incessant, endearing din of twenty-two small humans.  Tonight, however, the usual cheerful cacophony was muted, replaced by an unnerving silence punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reception area.  Something was definitely amiss.
