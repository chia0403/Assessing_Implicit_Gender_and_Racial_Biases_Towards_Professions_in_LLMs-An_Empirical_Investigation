The rasping shriek of metal on metal, a sound Elias Thorne knew better than his own heartbeat, sliced through the pre-dawn stillness.  Elias, a man whose calloused hands spoke volumes about years spent battling unforgiving asphalt and unpredictable weather, squinted at the rising sun painting the eastern sky a bruised purple.  He was perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling highway overpass, the biting wind whipping strands of his greying hair across his weathered face.  Below, the I-70 roared â€“ a concrete serpent slithering through the heart of the Colorado Rockies, a constant, rumbling testament to human ambition and the relentless march of progress.  The air, thin and crisp at this altitude, carried the scent of pine and diesel, a familiar perfume in this desolate stretch of highway between Denver and Grand Junction. This morning, however, the usual symphony of the interstate was punctuated by an unsettling silence, a silence that prickled Elias's instincts like a stray shard of glass in his worn work boot.
