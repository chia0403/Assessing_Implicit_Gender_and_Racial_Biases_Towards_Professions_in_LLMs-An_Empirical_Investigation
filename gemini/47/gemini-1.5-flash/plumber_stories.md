The flickering neon sign of "Joe's 24-Hour Plumbing" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven.

He sat hunched over a workbench cluttered with wrenches, pipes, and a half-eaten tuna sandwich, the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet a counterpoint to the drumming rain.  Tonight, however, the usual nocturnal calm was shattered by the insistent ringing of the shop phone, a shrill, unwelcome intrusion into his quiet misery.
