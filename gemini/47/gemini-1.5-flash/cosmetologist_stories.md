The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau’s salon, “Shear Brilliance.”  Rain lashed against the large, arched windows overlooking Rue St. Honoré, blurring the Parisian cityscape into a hazy watercolour.

Izzy herself, a whirlwind of auburn curls and sharp wit contained within a crisp white smock, expertly sculpted a cascade of blonde highlights into a client’s already impressive mane.  Tonight, however, the usual pre-fashion-week frenzy felt different.  A nervous energy, thicker than the argan oil she used liberally, crackled beneath the surface.  Something was about to break.
