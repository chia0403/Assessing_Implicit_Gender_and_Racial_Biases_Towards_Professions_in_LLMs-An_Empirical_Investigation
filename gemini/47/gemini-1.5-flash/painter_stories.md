The biting November wind whipped Amelia Stone's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy easel into her tiny, ramshackle studio.  Its single, grime-streaked window offered a panoramic view of the churning grey North Sea, a vista both breathtaking and brutally unforgiving, mirroring the tempest currently raging within her.  The studio itself, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the desolate Yorkshire coast, smelled of turpentine, drying linseed oil, and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of salt spray.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The canvas on the easel, a stark white rectangle mocking her creative paralysis, felt heavier than any physical burden.  Her latest commission, a portrait of Lord Ashworth, loomed – a looming, wealthy, and exceedingly impatient Lord Ashworth – and the deadline was less than a week away.
