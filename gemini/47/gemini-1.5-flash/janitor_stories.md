Dust motes, illuminated like tiny constellations, danced in the pale beams, a silent testament to the day's end.

The gothic architecture, with its soaring ceilings and stained-glass windows depicting scenes of long-dead heroes, pressed in on him, a silent, stoic witness to his nightly ritual. Tonight, however, the usual quiet was punctuated by an unsettling stillness, a heavier weight on the air than even the lingering scent of lemon polish could mask.
