The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clung to the plush velvet chairs and the chipped porcelain sink in Serenity Nails.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, shimmering rectangle.  Inside, the only sound louder than the rhythmic drumming of the rain was the low hum of the air conditioner fighting a losing battle against the humid July air.  Amelia Katherine Hernandez, better known as Amy to her clientele and Mia to her closest friends, meticulously filed the edge of a perfectly formed almond nail, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The client, a platinum blonde whose perfectly sculpted eyebrows matched the impeccably maintained manicure, droned on about her chihuahuaâ€™s latest Instagram post.  Amy listened, nodding occasionally, her mind a million miles away from the intricacies of gel application and the minutiae of canine social media.  Tonight, the familiar comfort of Serenity Nails felt less like a sanctuary and more like a gilded cage.
