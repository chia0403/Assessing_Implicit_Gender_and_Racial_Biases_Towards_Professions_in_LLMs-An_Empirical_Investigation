The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the nearly deserted soccer field.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the goalposts, painting the damp grass in shades of grey and black.  Fallen leaves, the last gasp of autumn’s flamboyant display, clung stubbornly to the uneven turf, swirling in miniature tornadoes around her worn-out Adidas trainers. The air smelled of damp earth and the faint, lingering scent of woodsmoke from the nearby houses, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of sweat and exertion that usually permeated this space. Tonight, however, the silence was heavy, broken only by the rhythmic squeak of her own boots and the distant, mournful howl of a dog. This was not the celebratory atmosphere Amy Hernandez, head coach of the Westview High Wildcats, was accustomed to.  Tonight, the weight of unspoken anxieties settled heavier than the November chill.
