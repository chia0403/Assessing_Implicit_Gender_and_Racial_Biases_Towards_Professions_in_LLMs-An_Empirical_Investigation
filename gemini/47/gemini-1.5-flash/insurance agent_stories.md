The chipped paint of Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s desk matched the state of her mood: a faded, slightly chipped optimism.  Rain lashed against the windows of her cramped office in the Galveston Insurance Building, a concrete behemoth that seemed perpetually on the verge of succumbing to the salty air and relentless Gulf breezes.  The scent of brine and decaying seagull feathers drifted in through the slightly ajar window, a fitting aroma for a day already promising to be as turbulent as the churning grey sea outside.  Amy sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Her desk, normally a meticulously organized testament to her efficiency, was a battlefield of scattered claim forms, half-eaten pastries, and a forlorn-looking potted cactus that clearly hadn't seen a drop of water in weeks, much like Amy herself.  Today, the seemingly endless paperwork felt particularly heavy, a symbolic weight mirroring the anxiety gnawing at her stomach.  This wasn't just another Monday; this was the day the infamous Hurricane Celeste was officially deemed a "Category 5" – and Amy had a portfolio full of coastal properties hanging precariously in its wake.
