The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Hayes's otherwise silent existence.

The air, thick with the scent of expensive leather and stale coffee, hung heavy in the cavernous waiting room.  Sunlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows overlooking the bustling city street below, cast long, dramatic shadows across the plush, emerald green carpet.  Outside, a cacophony of car horns and sirens battled for dominance, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost reverent silence that typically reigned within the hallowed halls of Sterling & Steele.  Today, however, a nervous energy crackled in the air, a palpable tension that even Amy, hardened by years of witnessing the anxieties of clients before and after crucial legal battles, could not ignore.
