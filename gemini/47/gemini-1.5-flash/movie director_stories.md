The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Davenport's charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she surveyed the desolate, windswept landscape.  Grey skies bled into a grey sea, mirroring the grey churning in her stomach.  Before her sprawled the skeletal remains of a once-grand Victorian mansion, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic.  Seabirds wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the relentless roar of the ocean.  This was supposed to be the location for *The Siren's Call*, Mia's ambitious, and some would say reckless, new film â€“ a gothic romance she'd poured the last five years of her life into, a project that felt as fragile and exposed as the crumbling edifice before her.  The air hung thick with the scent of salt and decaying wood, a fitting aroma for a story steeped in tragedy and longing.
