The biting wind, a razor-edged thing whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, ripped at Elias Thorne’s thick wool coat.  He hunched deeper into it, the collar scratching against his stubbled jaw, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hanging low on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-covered slopes of Mount Rainier National Forest.  Elias, a man carved from the same granite as the mountains themselves, adjusted the worn leather straps of his axe, the steel head gleaming faintly in the diffuse light.  The air, sharp with the scent of pine and damp earth, held a stillness that was almost unnatural, a quiet before the storm – both meteorological and personal – that was brewing.  This was his logging territory, a place where the giants fell silent under his steady hand, a kingdom ruled not by kings, but by the relentless rhythm of the axe and the groaning of the timber.
