The scent of aged paper and dust motes dancing in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight was, for Eleanor Vance, the perfume of paradise.  She perched on a rolling ladder, its worn metal groaning a familiar protest under her weight, amidst the towering stacks of the Silas Weems Memorial Library.

Eleanor, with her spectacles perched on her nose and a strand of auburn hair escaping her bun, felt utterly at home amongst the hushed whispers and the silent voices of the past.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort feltâ€¦different.  A chill, sharper than the October wind howling outside, snaked its way through the hallowed halls.
