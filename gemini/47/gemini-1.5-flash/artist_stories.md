The salt spray stung Aurelia “Relia” Blackwood’s face, a welcome contrast to the stifling heat clinging to the cobblestones of Port Blossom.  Relia, a painter whose canvases usually depicted the vibrant chaos of Parisian street markets, found herself oddly calmed by the stark, windswept beauty of this remote Cornish fishing village.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead, a counterpoint to the rhythmic slap of waves against the harbour wall.  Her easel, perched precariously on a weathered rock, faced a vista of turquoise water, jagged cliffs rising dramatically from the sea like the teeth of some ancient beast, and a scattering of brightly painted fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbour.  This was a world away from the frantic energy of her usual subjects; a world that whispered promises of solitude, and perhaps, a masterpiece.
