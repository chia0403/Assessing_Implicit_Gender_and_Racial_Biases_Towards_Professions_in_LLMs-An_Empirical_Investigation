The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful dirge across the plains, rattling the windows of Earl "Dusty" Rhodes's rig like skeletal fingers.  Dusty, his full name officially Bartholomew Earl Rhodes, Jr., but never used except on official paperwork, gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, "The Wanderer," a battered but trusty Kenworth W900 with more miles on her than a seasoned astronaut.  The headlights cut twin swaths through the swirling snow, illuminating the endless expanse of Interstate 80 ahead â€“ a ribbon of black ice snaking across a landscape bleached white by a blizzard that had been raging for three days. The cab, smelling faintly of stale coffee and diesel fumes, was his sanctuary, a refuge from the unforgiving elements and the equally unforgiving demands of the open road.  He was heading east, towards Cheyenne, a distant glimmer of civilization swallowed by the storm.  His current load: a shipment of frozen beef destined for a supermarket chain in Denver, a cargo more valuable, and certainly more perishable, than the few dollars left in his worn leather wallet.
