The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorne, its icy fingers probing the gaps in his thermal layers.  He hunched deeper into his parka, the collar scratching against his already chapped cheeks.  The vast, desolate expanse of the McMurdo Ice Shelf stretched before him, a brutal, beautiful landscape of blinding white and unforgiving grey.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic whirring of the research stationâ€™s wind turbines, a mechanical counterpoint to the ancient, implacable silence of the ice.  Aris shivered, but not entirely from the cold.  A tremor of anticipation, laced with a healthy dose of apprehension, ran through him. Tonight, the data transmission was scheduled. Tonight, he would know if years of painstaking research had borne fruit, or if the whispers of something extraordinary were just another Antarctic illusion.
