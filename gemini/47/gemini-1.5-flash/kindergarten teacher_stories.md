The chipped paint of the rainbow-striped wall seemed to weep alongside Ms. Eleanor Vance as she surveyed the miniature disaster zone that was her kindergarten classroom.  It wasn't a truly *terrible* disaster – no fires, no serious injuries, just the typical end-of-day chaos that clung to the air like glitter glue after a particularly enthusiastic arts and crafts session.  Crayon shavings littered the floor like fallen confetti, a half-eaten box of animal crackers lay abandoned near a toppled tower of blocks, and a lone, slightly squashed Play-Doh creation – resembling a particularly lumpy, purple potato – sat forlornly on the windowsill.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the playground, painting the already vibrant colours of the jungle gym in hues of orange and purple.  The air hummed with the final, fading energy of a day spent wrestling with tiny humans and the infinite mysteries of the alphabet.  Eleanor sighed, a sound as familiar to her as the smell of Elmer's glue.  Another day survived.  Barely.
