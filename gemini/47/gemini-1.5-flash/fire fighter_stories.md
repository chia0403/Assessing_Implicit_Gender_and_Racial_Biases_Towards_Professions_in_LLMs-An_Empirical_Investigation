The acrid bite of smoke, thick and black as a raven's wing, clawed at Captain Elias Thorne's throat.  His eyes, though stinging, remained focused on the inferno consuming the old Victorian mansion on Ashworth Lane.  Flames, a malevolent orange dance, licked at the gabled roof, sending showers of burning embers into the inky night sky.  The air vibrated with the frantic crackle of fire and the rhythmic thud-thud-thud of the fire engines parked haphazardly along the rain-slicked street.  The chilling wind whipped around him, carrying the screams of trapped residents â€“ a symphony of terror Elias knew all too well.  This wasn't just another blaze; this was a personal nightmare, the kind that haunted his sleep and clung to him like the soot staining his already grime-covered turnout gear.  For this wasn't just any house; it was the place where he'd spent his childhood summers, the place where the scent of woodsmoke and freshly baked bread once mingled, not the stench of burning wood and fear.
