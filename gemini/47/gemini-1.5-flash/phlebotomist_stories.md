The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s own heartbeat.  Amelia, a woman whose meticulous nature was only surpassed by her uncanny ability to find veins even the most experienced nurses missed,  sighed, the sound barely audible above the low murmur of conversations and the whirring of the centrifuge.  It was 6:17 AM, a time usually reserved for dreams of sun-drenched beaches and lukewarm coffee, not the slightly metallic tang of antiseptic and the ever-present threat of needle-phobic patients. Today, however, promised to be particularly challenging. A backlog of blood tests, a surly new intern, and the unsettling feeling that something was…off, hung heavy in the air, thicker even than the lingering scent of bleach.
