The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed’s battered Cessna 185, rattling the single propeller like a skeleton’s teeth.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their jagged peaks shrouded in a swirling mist that clung to them like a shroud.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid air, squinted through the frosted cockpit window, the altimeter needle stubbornly refusing to budge below 8,000 feet.  The radio crackled with static, a maddening counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine, the only dependable sound in this unforgiving wilderness.  She’d been battling this storm for three hours, her fuel reserves dwindling faster than her hope of reaching the Anchorage airstrip before nightfall.  Tonight, the mountains weren’t just a breathtaking landscape; they were a hungry beast, and Evie was its next meal.
