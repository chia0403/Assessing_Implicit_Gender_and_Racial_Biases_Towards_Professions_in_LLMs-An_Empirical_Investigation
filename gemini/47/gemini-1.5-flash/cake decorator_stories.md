The scent of almond extract and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a sugary perfume clinging to the floral wallpaper of "Sweet Surrender," Aurelia "Auri" Hawthorne's cake decorating studio.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the arched window, danced in the golden rays like tiny, sugared fairies.  Auri herself, a whirlwind of flour-dusted apron and vibrant turquoise hair, hummed a jaunty tune as she meticulously piped delicate roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the ivory fondant a stark contrast to the riotous colours of her surroundings.  Sweet Surrender wasn't just a bakery; it was a chaotic, creative explosion of sugar, sprinkles, and Auriâ€™s boundless energy, crammed into a charmingly dilapidated Victorian storefront on the edge of Willow Creek.
