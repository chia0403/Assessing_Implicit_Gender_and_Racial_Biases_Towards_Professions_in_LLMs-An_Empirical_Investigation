The wrench slipped in Amelia Hernandez’s grease-stained hand, clattering onto the concrete floor of her garage with a sharp clang.  Dust motes, disturbed by the impact, danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of Hernandez Auto Repair. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil, gasoline, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – Amelia’s, from a nick on her thumb she’d sustained wrestling with a stubborn brake caliper earlier that morning.  Outside, the relentless Texas sun beat down on the sprawling, dusty yard, where discarded tires and rusting car parts lay scattered like fallen soldiers after a hard-fought battle.  The rhythmic drone of cicadas formed a hypnotic soundtrack to the usual chaos of her life – a life far removed from the manicured lawns and air-conditioned offices of the wealthier parts of town.  Amelia, however, wouldn't have it any other way. This garage, this mess, this life – it was hers.
