The rasp of steel on bone, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as his own heartbeat, echoed through the chill morning air of the Smithfield Market.  Barty, his face etched with the fine lines of a life spent wrestling carcasses, stood hunched over a magnificent side of beef, the pale fat gleaming under the weak November sun filtering through the grimy skylight.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, mingled with the earthy scent of sawdust and the sharp, almost floral, aroma of freshly-cut herbs.  Around him, the cavernous hall pulsed with a chaotic symphony of grunts, shouts, and the rhythmic thud of cleavers â€“ a morning chorus as old as the market itself.  Today, however, a different note vibrated through the usual cacophony, a low hum of unease that Barty, with his sharp eyes and even sharper instincts, couldn't quite place.
