The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Hernandez could conjure.  Her salon, “Shear Genius,” nestled on the cobbled side street of Rue de la Paix in the old quarter of New Orleans, was a riot of colour and chaos.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rather flamboyant Mardi Gras king, dappled the rich mahogany of the antique styling chairs.  The walls, a faded salmon pink, were adorned with framed magazine clippings featuring Mia’s avant-garde hairstyles – gravity-defying updos, vibrant streaks of unnatural hues, and intricate braids that resembled miniature works of art.  Today, however, the usually bustling salon was eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, each chime a heavy punctuation mark in the suffocating humidity.  Mia, perched on a stool, meticulously cleaning her shears, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  This silence felt different; it wasn’t the peaceful calm before the storm, but the unsettling stillness before a hurricane.
