The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Basement Bonanza" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine "Amy" Holloway's meticulously organized misery.  Dust motes danced in the weak beams, illuminating rows upon rows of slightly-used, slightly-damaged, and slightly-desperate-to-be-sold goods.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, lingering aroma of mothballs â€“ a perfume only a seasoned Bargain Basement veteran could truly appreciate.  Amy, sporting a strained smile that had become her professional default, adjusted the name tag pinned to her already-wrinkled blouse.  Another Saturday, another mountain of inventory to shift before the store's notoriously grumpy owner, Mr. Fitzwilliam, locked up and unleashed his post-closing tirade.  Today's challenge?  A collection of slightly-off-kilter ceramic garden gnomes and a surprisingly large quantity of surplus rubber chickens.  Amy sighed.  It was going to be a long day.
