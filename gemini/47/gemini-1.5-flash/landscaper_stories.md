The dawn painted the eastern sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, a breathtaking spectacle Elias Thorne, a man more accustomed to the earthy smells of damp soil and freshly cut grass than artistic wonders, barely registered.  He was too busy wrestling with a particularly stubborn patch of bindweed that had taken root near the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor.  Blackwood Manor itself stood silhouetted against the rising sun, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and shadowed eaves, its overgrown gardens a testament to years of neglect.  Ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed its way up the crumbling walls, while untamed rhododendrons, bursting with blooms the colour of a corpse's lips, spilled over ancient stone pathways.  This wasn't Elias's usual clientele; he mostly dealt with suburban lawns and meticulously planned flowerbeds. But Blackwood Manor, with its promise of both challenge and a hefty payday, had lured him in.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else… something faintly metallic, almost… blood-like.
