The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s trench coat around her legs as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of the graveyard.  St. Jude’s, they called it, a crumbling monument to forgotten lives nestled on a windswept hill overlooking the perpetually grey North Sea.  Headstones, warped and lichen-covered, leaned at precarious angles like drunken mourners, their inscriptions barely legible under a sky the colour of bruised plums.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume both earthy and unsettlingly sweet.  Tonight, however, it was overshadowed by something far more sinister – the metallic tang of blood, faint but undeniably present, carried on the mournful sigh of the wind.  Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold.  This wasn't the first scene she'd surveyed under such grim circumstances, but something about the desolate beauty of St. Jude's, the palpable sense of despair clinging to the air, sent a chill deeper than any November wind could manage.
