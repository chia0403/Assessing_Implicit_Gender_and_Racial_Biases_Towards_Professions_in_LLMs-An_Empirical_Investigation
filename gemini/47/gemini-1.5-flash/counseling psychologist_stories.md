The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hands, a small comfort against the November chill seeping through the drafty windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the turmoil she suspected simmered beneath the carefully composed façade of her next appointment.

Her next client, a young woman named Clara Dubois, was already fifteen minutes late.
