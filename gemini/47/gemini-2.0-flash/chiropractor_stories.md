## Story Opening:

The persistent, throbbing ache behind Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's left eye began precisely thirty minutes into Mr. Henderson's tirade about his neighbor's chihuahua. Eleanor usually excelled at compartmentalizing, politely listening to the grievances of her patients while simultaneously assessing their gait, posture, and spinal alignment. Today, however, the chihuahua was winning. Each yip Mr. Henderson mimicked felt like a tiny ice pick chipping away at her skull.

"And then," Mr. Henderson wailed, gesturing wildly with his cane, "the little devil leaves its… *deposit*… right on my prize-winning petunias! It’s simply unconscionable, Doctor Ainsworth, unconscionable!"

Eleanor forced a sympathetic smile, the muscles around her mouth protesting the movement. "I understand, Mr. Henderson. That does sound… distressing." She reached for the muscle palpation cream, the familiar scent of eucalyptus momentarily offering a sliver of solace. She needed to get this session over with. The headache, a persistent consequence of neglecting her own well-being, was threatening to derail her entire afternoon.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's practice, "Ainsworth Chiropractic & Wellness," occupied a charming Victorian house on Oak Street in the heart of Willow Creek, a small, picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The house had been lovingly restored, its original stained-glass windows casting dappled light onto the hardwood floors. The waiting room, painted a soothing shade of sage green, featured comfortable armchairs, a bubbling fountain, and a curated selection of books on holistic health and mindfulness.

The treatment room, where Eleanor currently stood with Mr. Henderson, was bathed in natural light from a large bay window overlooking a vibrant garden. A state-of-the-art chiropractic table dominated the space, surrounded by shelves holding various anatomical models, adjustment tools, and aromatherapy diffusers. Despite the calming atmosphere Eleanor cultivated, the air today felt thick with Mr. Henderson’s nervous energy and the oppressive weight of her own throbbing head.
