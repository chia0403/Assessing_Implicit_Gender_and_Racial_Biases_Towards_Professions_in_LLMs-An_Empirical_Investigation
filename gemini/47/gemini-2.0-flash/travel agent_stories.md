## Story Opening:

The fluorescent hum of "Wanderlust Dreams" was a constant, low-level thrum against Amelia Bellwether's sanity. Another Tuesday, another parade of sun-starved souls desperate for escape. Amelia sighed, adjusting the oversized glasses that kept slipping down her nose. The scent of cheap coffee and brochures promising paradise hung heavy in the air, a deceptive aroma considering most of her clients ended up in all-inclusive resorts with watered-down cocktails and screaming children. She scrolled through another email from Brenda Henderson, demanding to know why her "ocean view" in the Bahamas included a sliver of blue sandwiched between a parking lot and a construction site. 

Amelia rubbed her temples, the familiar ache beginning to throb behind her eyes. Maybe she should have taken that accounting job her mother kept suggesting. At least numbers didn't complain about the sand not being white enough. Just as she was about to craft a diplomatically worded response to Brenda (something along the lines of "the ocean *is* visible, technically"), the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Amelia braced herself, plastering on her most cheerful "Welcome to Wanderlust Dreams!" smile.

## Setting:

The setting is the small, slightly run-down travel agency "Wanderlust Dreams" located in the equally unremarkable town of Oakhaven, Ohio.

*   **Exterior:** The agency is situated in a strip mall between a dry cleaner and a discount shoe store. Its exterior is painted a faded turquoise, and the awning, though once vibrant, now bears a patchwork of sun-bleached spots. A neon sign above the door flickers intermittently, adding a touch of seedy charm.

*   **Interior:** The interior is cramped and cluttered. Travel posters depicting exotic locations are haphazardly tacked to the walls, overlapping and creating a chaotic collage. A worn, plush carpet in a garish floral pattern covers the floor. Two mismatched desks sit in the main area, one overflowing with brochures and half-empty coffee cups, the other slightly more organized. A small, dusty globe sits on a shelf in the corner, perpetually spinning, a silent testament to the world beyond Oakhaven. The air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee, printer toner, and the faint, lingering aroma of sunscreen from brochures handled countless times.
