## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The fading grandeur of Blackwood Manor, a gothic Victorian estate perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning, grey waters of the North Sea. Wind howls constantly, rattling the leaded glass windows and whipping around the gnarled branches of ancient yew trees that guard the property. The gardens, though meticulously maintained, bear the permanent scars of the relentless sea air; roses bloom reluctantly, and salt spray dusts the stone cherubs that stand sentinel among the flowerbeds. The Manor itself is a labyrinth of echoing hallways, shrouded in perpetual twilight, filled with the scent of dust and beeswax and the lingering memory of lives lived long ago.

**Opening:**

Rain hammered against the conservatory roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the ache in Alistair Finch’s knees. He crouched amidst the cascading vines of bougainvillea, meticulously pruning away dead leaves with a practiced hand. Alistair, the sole groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor, was a man carved from the same granite as the cliffs below, his face weathered and etched with the stories the wind had whispered to him over the past thirty years. He’d arrived here a green youth, barely out of his teens, with dreams of botany and escape from his humdrum village. Now, pushing sixty, he was as much a part of Blackwood as the gargoyles that leered from the rooftops.

He straightened slowly, the familiar groan in his back answering the mournful creak of the house itself. The conservatory, at least, was warm, a refuge from the biting wind. But even here, surrounded by the vibrant colours of tropical flowers, Alistair felt the cold grip of the place. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather and everything to do with the weight of Blackwood's history, a history that seemed to be stirring once more, whispering secrets from the shadows. Lately, the roses had been blooming out of season, a blood-red riot against the dying light. And Alistair, he couldn't shake the feeling that something… something was wrong.
