## Opening:

The flickering fluorescent light hummed above Arthur Percival Finch's head, casting a jaundiced glow on the overflowing in-tray before him. He pinched the bridge of his nose, the ghost of a headache throbbing behind his eyes. Another Monday, another deluge of paperwork threatening to bury him alive. It seemed everyone in Oakhaven, Ohio, had decided today was the day their basements flooded, their cars collided with deer, or their prize-winning petunias were trampled by rogue raccoons. Arthur sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the office AC. He reached for the first file, a beige folder already fraying at the edges. "Mrs. Henderson, cracked windshield," he muttered to himself, "classic."

## Setting:

Arthur Percival Finchâ€™s life revolved around Finch & Finch Insurance, a family business founded by his grandfather back in 1932. The office, situated on the second floor of a brick building above Oakhaven's only bakery, smelled perpetually of yeast and burnt sugar. It was a small, cramped space, divided into two offices and a reception area. The walls were a depressing shade of beige, adorned with faded landscape paintings depicting scenes of tranquility that Arthur rarely experienced. The linoleum floor was scuffed and worn, a testament to years of shuffling feet and frantic phone calls. Outside the window, Main Street bustled with the predictable rhythms of small-town life: the postman making his rounds, Mrs. Higgins walking her poodle, and the occasional tractor lumbering through, a reminder that Oakhaven was still, at its heart, a farming community. The air was usually crisp, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of open fields. But today, it felt heavy, pregnant with the humidity that always foreshadowed a summer storm, a storm that, Arthur suspected, would only bring him more paperwork.
