## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Maplewood Elementary hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the creeping dread that was settling in Dr. Amelia Eleanor Finch's stomach. It was report card week, that peculiar purgatory where anxiety fermented and parental expectations turned into simmering resentments. She took a slow sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitterness doing little to combat the sweet, sugary aroma emanating from the mountain of donuts someone had thoughtfully left in the staff lounge. Thoughtful for everyone but a school psychologist facing down a day of potentially explosive parent-teacher conferences.

Just then, Mrs. Peterson, a third-grade teacher with a permanent cloud of exhaustion hanging over her head, poked her head in the doorway. "Amelia, you got a minute? Mr. Henderson is here for Timmy's conference. He looks… particularly unhappy."

Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. "Send him in, Mrs. Peterson. Deep breaths, everyone."

She straightened the haphazard stack of Timmy Henderson's artwork on her desk – a vibrant, albeit chaotic, explosion of crayons depicting what Amelia could only surmise was a monster truck rally in space – and plastered on her most reassuring smile. This was it. The first battle of the report card wars.

## Setting:

**Maplewood Elementary School, Smalltown, USA:** The school itself is a sprawling, single-story brick building built in the 1970s. While clean and well-maintained, it carries the weight of its age in its muted color palette and slightly institutional atmosphere. The classrooms are functional and well-stocked, adorned with colorful student artwork and educational posters. The staff lounge, however, is a haven of mismatched furniture, overflowing coffee pots, and the lingering scent of reheated microwave meals. Dr. Finch's office, located down a quiet hallway near the library, is an attempt to create a calming oasis. Soft lighting, a comfortable armchair, and a small collection of soothing artwork help to offset the sterile environment. A bookshelf overflowing with psychology textbooks and children's literature provides a subtle clue to her profession. Outside, the school grounds are a mix of asphalt playground and grassy fields, dominated by a towering oak tree that has witnessed generations of Maplewood students. The surrounding neighborhood is a typical suburban landscape, with tidy lawns, ranch-style houses, and the occasional tree swing hanging from a sturdy branch. It’s a place that strives for normalcy, even when, like during report card week, the cracks in the facade begin to show.
