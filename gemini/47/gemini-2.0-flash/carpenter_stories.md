The late afternoon sun bled through the gaps in the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorne's workshop, painting stripes of orange dust across the cluttered floor. Sawdust, thick as snowdrifts, clung to the legs of his worn overalls, a testament to a day spent wrestling stubborn planks of oak into submission. The air hummed with the faint, persistent thrum of the nearby highway, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias's hammer as he carefully fitted a small, intricately carved wooden bird onto the frame of a child's rocking horse. He squinted, his brow furrowed in concentration, the lines etched deep around his eyes telling tales of long days and quiet nights.

Elias's workshop was a small, dilapidated structure nestled in the back of his property, a sprawling, overgrown orchard that sloped gently towards the distant blue smudge of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The orchard, a forgotten legacy from his grandfather, had surrendered most of its bounty to the weeds and wild creatures. The trees, gnarled and ancient, still bore a few stubborn apples each autumn, but mostly they stood as silent sentinels around Elias's refuge, their branches a skeletal latticework against the ever-changing sky. Inside, the workshop was a chaos of half-finished projects, hand tools scattered across workbenches like fallen leaves, and the comforting aroma of freshly cut wood mingling with the musty scent of old timber and linseed oil. It was here, amidst the controlled chaos, that Elias Thorne found solace, a space where he could lose himself in the grain of the wood and the rhythm of creation, a world away from the judging eyes and hushed whispers of the small town of Harmony Creek that lay just a mile down the road.
