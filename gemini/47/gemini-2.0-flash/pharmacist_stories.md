## Story Opening:

The air in "Prescriptions & Potions," even at 7:00 AM, hung thick with the scent of rubbing alcohol and overripe hand sanitizer. A fluorescent buzz hummed overhead, fighting a losing battle against the quiet determination radiating from its single occupant. Elara Madeline Finch, pharmacist extraordinaire and owner of said establishment, meticulously aligned a row of orange pill bottles, her brow furrowed in concentration. Each label was perfectly straight, each cap tightened to just the right degree.

She was on bottle number thirteen when the bell above the door jingled, announcing a visitor. Elara sighed softly, not with annoyance, but with the weary resignation that came with a small-town pharmacy and a roster full of eccentric, early-rising customers. She smoothed down the front of her sensible, floral-print dress (a deliberate attempt to project approachability) and plastered on her most welcoming smile. "Good morning!" she chirped, her voice already practiced in its blend of cheer and professionalism.

Before her stood a man whose age was a riddle only time could solve. His face was a roadmap of wrinkles, etched by sun and laughter and, perhaps, more than a little hardship. He wore a faded denim jacket, a baseball cap pulled low, and carried a dented, silver thermos. He met Elara's gaze with eyes that were as bright and blue as a summer sky.

"Mornin', Elara," he rasped, his voice like gravel tumbling down a hill. "Got a refill for the ol' ticker."

## Setting:

**Prescriptions & Potions:**

*   **Location:** Nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Willow Avenue in the small, picturesque town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.
*   **Exterior:** A two-story brick building with faded maroon awnings. Window boxes overflow with petunias in the summer months. A large, hand-painted sign above the door displays the pharmacy's name in whimsical, slightly peeling letters.
*   **Interior:** A comforting, if somewhat dated, space. The air is permeated with the distinct smell of pharmaceuticals, a familiar and reassuring scent to the townsfolk.
    *   **Main Area:** Dominated by a long, wooden counter with a slightly chipped Formica top. Behind the counter, shelves are stacked high with neatly arranged medications, vitamins, and sundries. A small, designated area offers over-the-counter remedies, cough drops, and travel-sized toiletries.
    *   **Back Room:** (Not yet revealed in detail) Likely where Elara prepares compounded medications, manages inventory, and occasionally steals a moment to read a book.
*   **Atmosphere:** A place of community and trust. It's more than just a pharmacy; it's a place where people come for advice, a friendly face, and a comforting presence in times of need. Elara has cultivated a welcoming environment, making it a hub for the residents of Havenwood.
