## Story Opening:

The hum of the fluorescent lights was the soundtrack to Eleanor Ainsworth’s life. She loved it. It was a low, consistent drone that masked the chirping of the ancient radiator, the rhythmic clicking of the grandfather clock in the reading room, and even the faint, persistent whisper she sometimes swore she heard emanating from the restricted section. For Eleanor, the hum was the sound of order, of knowledge slumbering and waiting to be awakened.

She adjusted her spectacles, perched delicately on the bridge of her nose, and peered down at the Dewey Decimal System guide. Someone, bless their ignorant heart, had reshelved a biography of Marie Curie under “Aviation.” Eleanor sighed, a sound like air escaping a well-loved cushion. This was why she was here, after all. To be a shepherd of the lost, a guardian of the categorized.

The late afternoon sun, filtered through the leaded-glass windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the oak desk. Dust motes, disturbed by her sigh, swirled in the golden light, momentarily illuminating the faint etchings carved into the wood. The desk, like most things in the library, was old and imbued with a history Eleanor couldn't quite grasp, but desperately wanted to know.

She picked up the misplaced book, the rough, faded fabric of its cover familiar and comforting under her fingertips. As she turned to leave the main desk, heading towards the science section, a glint of something metallic caught her eye. Lodged between the pages of an oversized volume on Victorian architecture lay a small, intricately crafted silver key. It wasn't one of hers.

## Setting:

The story is set in the **Oakhaven Public Library**, a grand, Victorian-era building situated in the quaint, slightly forgotten town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The library is a relic of a bygone era, a testament to the town's brief brush with prosperity during the coal mining boom. It boasts high ceilings, ornate moldings, towering bookshelves that seem to stretch into infinity, and a pervasive smell of old paper and beeswax polish. Despite its age, it's impeccably maintained by Eleanor and her small, devoted staff. The atmosphere is quiet and contemplative, a haven from the bustle of the outside world. While the library sees its share of regular patrons, it also attracts the occasional tourist drawn to the town's antique shops and the rumors of local folklore. The architecture book, the key, and Eleanor's position as librarian will be key to setting the plot into motion.
