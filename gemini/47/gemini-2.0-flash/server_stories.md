The clatter of silverware against porcelain was a constant hum in Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Higgins's ears, a soundtrack she’d grown accustomed to after five years slinging plates and smiles at "The Sea Serpent's Kiss," the only seafood restaurant in Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom itself was a place out of time, stubbornly clinging to its fishing village roots despite the encroaching tide of tourism. Weathered clapboard houses, painted in shades of seafoam and faded buoy red, lined the narrow streets. The salty air, thick with the tang of seaweed and diesel, was a constant reminder of the ocean’s omnipresence.

The Sea Serpent’s Kiss, nestled right on the harbor, was no exception to Port Blossom’s rustic charm. Its peeling, nautical-themed exterior, complete with a faded mermaid painted on the door, hinted at the treasures (and the occasional disappointment) within. The interior was dimly lit, the walls adorned with fishing nets, lobster traps, and framed photographs of local fishermen holding up prize-winning catches from decades past. A single, sputtering neon sign above the bar flickered intermittently, casting a ghostly glow on the patrons nursing their beers and bowls of clam chowder.

Tonight, the Friday before Lobsterfest, was particularly hectic. The air thrummed with anticipation, fueled by the promise of lobster rolls, carnival games, and the annual Blessing of the Fleet. Amy, navigating the crowded tables with practiced grace, balanced a tray laden with steaming plates of fried clams and crispy haddock. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the cool ocean breeze that managed to sneak in through the open windows. She felt a familiar ache in her feet, a persistent reminder of the endless loop she walked night after night. But Amy, with her kind eyes and a smile that could melt the iciest heart, was a cornerstone of The Sea Serpent’s Kiss, and she wouldn't have it any other way... most of the time.
