## Story Opening:

The morning mist clung to the cobblestones of Oakhaven like a persistent lover, softening the harsh angles of the buildings and muffling the rumble of the early morning carts. Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, Master Butcher, stood in the doorway of Finch & Sons Meats, inhaling the damp air. It held the familiar scents of woodsmoke, freshly turned earth from the nearby market gardens, and, underneath it all, the clean, metallic tang of blood and meat. He rubbed his hands together, feeling the chill seep through his thick wool coat, and surveyed his domain. The day was just beginning, and already he could hear the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves approaching, heralding the arrival of old farmer Giles with his weekly shipment of plump, grass-fed lambs.

## Setting:

Oakhaven was a bustling market town nestled in the heart of the rolling green hills of Westshire. Centuries of history were etched into its stone buildings, their ivy-covered facades bearing witness to countless harvests, celebrations, and hardships. The central square, a wide expanse paved with uneven cobblestones, served as the town's beating heart. Here, farmers, artisans, and merchants gathered to trade their wares, their voices a constant hum of activity.

Finch & Sons Meats occupied a prime location on the east side of the square, next to the cheese shop and across from the bustling bakery. The shop itself was a testament to Barty's dedication and craftsmanship. The windows, meticulously cleaned each morning, displayed a carefully curated selection of meats: glistening cuts of beef, neatly arranged sausages, and plump game birds suspended from hooks. Inside, the air was cool and fragrant with the scent of juniper and smoked meats. Gleaming knives hung from a magnetic strip above a massive oak chopping block, worn smooth from years of use. The walls were lined with meticulously labelled drawers, filled with spices and curing salts, each a secret ingredient in Barty's legendary recipes. This was Barty's world, a realm of sharp edges, primal cuts, and the satisfying art of transforming animal into sustenance.
