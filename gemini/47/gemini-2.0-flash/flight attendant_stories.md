**Opening:**

The stale, recirculated air hummed a monotonous tune as Amelia Rose Harding smoothed down the lapel of her navy blue uniform. Her smile, practiced to perfection over five years of airborne service, felt tight and brittle against the backdrop of the pre-boarding chaos. Gate 22 buzzed with the pent-up energy of weary travelers eager to escape the clutches of Denver International Airport, their anxieties and expectations clinging to the air like static cling. Amelia took a deep breath, trying to center herself amidst the fray. Another cross-country flight, another day of smiles and safety demonstrations, another opportunity to navigate the delicate dance between serving passengers and surviving the altitude.

**Setting:**

The year is 2024. Denver International Airport (DIA), a sprawling complex rumored to be riddled with secret underground bunkers and ancient conspiracies, loomed against the clear Colorado sky. Its tent-like peaks, designed to evoke the Rocky Mountains, instead resembled unsettlingly sharp teeth. Gate 22, bathed in the harsh fluorescent glow of the departure lounge, was a temporary purgatory for those waiting to board Flight 347 to Boston. The air was thick with the smell of lukewarm coffee, cheap perfume, and the underlying hum of stressed humanity. Above the clamor, announcements crackled through the aging PA system, a constant reminder of delays, cancellations, and the invisible threads that held this intricate transportation system together. The departure boards flickered with information, promising journeys and destinations, but also hinting at the potential for unforeseen turbulence.
