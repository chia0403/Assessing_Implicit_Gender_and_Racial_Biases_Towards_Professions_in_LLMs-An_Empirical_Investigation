## Story Opening:

The dust hung thick in the air, clinging to everything in Aethelred Stonecarver's workshop like a persistent lover. It coated the rough-hewn timbers of the building, the shelves overflowing with chisels and mallets, and even Aethelred himself, turning his already weathered face into a mask of grey. Sunlight, filtering weakly through the single, grimy window, illuminated dancing motes, each a tiny testament to the stone he’d wrestled into submission for the better part of his forty years.

Aethelred paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a streak of mud in its wake. He’d been working since dawn on the commission, a rather grotesque gargoyle meant to perch atop the new wing of the Earl's manor. He wasn’t particularly fond of the snarling creatures, preferring instead to craft serene angels and stoic saints. But the Earl paid handsomely, and Aethelred had a family to feed, a crumbling cottage to maintain, and a nagging cough he could no longer ignore.

He ran a hand over the gargoyle's half-finished face, feeling the rough texture of the limestone beneath his fingertips. The beast seemed to mock him with its incomplete features, a permanent sneer etched into its nascent grin. "Almost there, you ugly brute," he muttered, his voice raspy from years of inhaling stone dust. "Just a few more blows, and you'll be tormenting the village from your lofty perch." He picked up his mallet, the familiar weight comforting in his hand, and prepared to resume his work. But before he could strike, a sudden commotion outside his workshop shattered the morning's quiet.

## Setting:

The village of Oakhaven nestled at the foot of the Grey Mountains, a collection of humble cottages and sturdy farms clustered around a winding river. Aethelred's workshop, a simple, single-story building constructed of rough-hewn timber and stone, sat on the outskirts of the village, a little removed from the bustle of daily life. It stood on a slight rise, overlooking the rolling fields that stretched towards the dark, imposing forests.

The air was typically crisp and clean, scented with pine from the mountains and damp earth from the river. However, the ever-present threat of rain meant that the skies were often overcast, casting a grey pall over the landscape. Oakhaven was a place steeped in tradition, where life moved at a slow, deliberate pace, governed by the seasons and the rhythms of the land. The villagers were a hardy, pragmatic folk, content with their simple lives, wary of outsiders, and deeply superstitious. Aethelred, despite being a respected craftsman, was seen as something of an oddity, a man who spoke to stone and conjured figures from lifeless rock. His proximity to the edge of the village suited him well, allowing him both access to the community and a degree of solitude he craved.
