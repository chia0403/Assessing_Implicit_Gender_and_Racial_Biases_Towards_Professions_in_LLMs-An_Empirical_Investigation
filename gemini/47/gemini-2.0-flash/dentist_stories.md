**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s dental practice buzzed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the sterile white walls. Outside, a late October squall battered Havenwood, Massachusetts, pelting the windows with rain and howling like a banshee. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of antiseptic mouthwash and the faint, persistent anxiety of a dentist's waiting room. Hanging on the wall, a framed picture of Eleanor smiling bravely beside a champion-sized pumpkin at the Havenwood Harvest Festival seemed a mocking reminder of sunnier days and less stressful occupations.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted the focus on her surgical microscope, the crosshairs blurring slightly at the edges. Rain thrummed against the panoramic window behind her chair, mirroring the frantic drumming in her own chest. Her patient, Mrs. Higgins, a sweet, elderly woman who always brought Eleanor hand-knitted coasters, was currently anesthetized and blissfully unaware that Eleanor had just completely shattered the fragile porcelain veneer she'd been painstakingly repairing for the past hour. "Damn it," she muttered under her breath, the word barely audible above the hum of the suction. This was not how she envisioned her Tuesday afternoon. This was not how she envisioned *any* of her afternoons. She took a deep, steadying breath, the scent of clove oil doing little to soothe her mounting panic. One wrong move, one more chipped edge, and Mrs. Higgins' coaster-wielding kindness might just turn to the sharp, bitter resentment of a wronged customer. Eleanor glanced at the digital clock on the wall. Four more hours of patients, four more chances for disaster. Today, it seemed, the demons of her meticulously ordered world had decided to stage a full-blown revolt, and Eleanor Vance, DDS, was their unfortunate battlefield.
