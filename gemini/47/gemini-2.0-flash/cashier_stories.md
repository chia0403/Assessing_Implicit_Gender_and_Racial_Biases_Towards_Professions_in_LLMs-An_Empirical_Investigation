Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on our main character, a cashier:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of "Good Foods, Great Prices" hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the mundane symphony of suburban life. Aisle five was a desolate wasteland of canned goods, eternally echoing with the scraping of lonely shopping carts. Outside, the mid-July heat shimmered off the asphalt parking lot, promising only sweltering misery. Inside, the air conditioning valiantly fought a losing battle against the oppressive humidity seeping in every time the automatic doors slid open. This particular "Good Foods" was located in the rapidly sprawling outskirts of Meadow Creek, a town known more for its identical subdivisions and predictable weather than any remarkable events.

**Opening:**

"Paper or plastic?" Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth asked, her voice laced with a fatigue that belied her twenty-three years. She didn't even look up, her gaze fixed on the endless parade of groceries marching down the conveyor belt: a box of sugary cereal designed to appeal to cartoon-loving children, a suspiciously bruised avocado, three cans of generic cream of mushroom soup. The robotic question was a reflex, a mantra she'd chanted hundreds of times a day for the last two years. Eleanor's nametag, slightly askew and smudged with something unidentifiable, read simply "Eleanor," but she suspected most customers saw her as nothing more than a blurry face behind the checkout lane, a necessary component of their grocery-acquiring routine.

Today, though, something was different. The air crackled with a subtle energy that had nothing to do with static cling from the endless supply of plastic bags. Eleanor felt it in the prickle of goosebumps on her arms, in the sudden, unnerving silence that seemed to fall over the store as she waited for the customer's response. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and strangely accented, a melody she couldn't quite place.

"Neither, Eleanor," he said, and for the first time that day, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth looked up.
