## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent light above his head hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack that perfectly mirrored the tedium creeping into Edgar Alistair Finch's soul. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the single-paned window of his office and scattering dead leaves against the glass like desperate pleas for warmth. Inside, the only warmth came from the ancient, wheezing space heater humming a counterpoint to the light, and the lukewarm coffee sloshing in Edgar's chipped mug.

He sighed, the sound a puff of condensation that briefly fogged his glasses. Another Schedule C stared back at him, filled with a dizzying array of questionable deductions – “Business Entertainment: All-You-Can-Eat Shrimp Buffet,” “Professional Development: Streaming Service Subscription (Netflix)” – and Edgar felt the familiar pressure building behind his eyes. Just one more form, just one more return to slog through. He had a stack of them reaching nearly to the ceiling in the corner of his office, a testament to the slow, grinding march of tax season, which, in Edgar’s experience, seemed to last for thirteen months out of the year. He was a gatekeeper, a small, insignificant cog in the vast machine that was the American tax system, and right now, he desperately wanted to clock out.

## Setting:

Edgar Alistair Finch's office, nestled above "Bernie's Bait & Tackle" on the outskirts of the perpetually overcast town of Grimsborough, Pennsylvania, was a testament to efficient frugality, bordering on neglect. The walls, painted a depressing shade of beige best described as "institutional bland," were adorned with a single, slightly askew framed print of a bald eagle soaring majestically over what appeared to be a field of tax forms. A battered oak desk dominated the room, overflowing with stacks of paperwork, well-worn tax code manuals, and the aforementioned precarious tower of completed (and incomplete) tax returns.

A rotary dial phone sat stubbornly on the corner of the desk, a relic from a bygone era that Edgar refused to replace. He considered it a reliable defense against unwanted telemarketers and the relentless march of technological progress. A clunky, outdated computer monitor flickered intermittently, its screen displaying the latest version of TaxWise, a software program that, in Edgar's opinion, only complicated matters further.

The air in the office always smelled faintly of stale coffee, aged paper, and the lingering scent of Bernie's bait, which occasionally wafted up through the floorboards. This unique olfactory cocktail, combined with the incessant hum of the lights and the mournful howl of the wind outside, created an atmosphere of perpetual resignation, a feeling that permeated every corner of the small, cluttered space and clung to Edgar like a second skin. This was Edgar Alistair Finch’s kingdom, his lonely tax-preparer’s purgatory, and he was its reluctant, slightly overwhelmed king.
