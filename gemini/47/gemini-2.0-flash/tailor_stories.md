## Story Opening:

The aroma of old parchment, stale coffee, and freshly pressed wool hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar perfume to Elias Thorne. He squinted through the early morning gloom that filtered through the grimy panes of his shop window, the faint light barely illuminating the intricate embroidery he was attempting. A raven, perched precariously on the window ledge, cawed mournfully, as if echoing the chill that had seeped into his bones. Elias shivered, pulling his thread a little tighter. He had a deadline to meet, a reputation to uphold, and a gnawing feeling in his gut that this particular commission – a midnight-blue velvet cloak for the notoriously fickle Duchess Morwenna – was more trouble than it was worth.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne's tailor shop, nestled at the edge of the Crooked Quarter in the city of Veridian, was a study in organised chaos. Bolts of fabric, ranging from the coarse burlap of the working class to the shimmering silks of the aristocracy, were stacked precariously high against the walls. Discarded buttons, spools of thread in every imaginable hue, and scraps of leather littered every surface. A hulking, mahogany cutting table dominated the centre of the room, scarred with the ghosts of countless projects. In one corner, a coal-burning stove wheezed out a meager warmth, while in another, a chipped porcelain cup sat on a stack of pattern books, holding the dregs of Elias's lukewarm coffee. The overall impression was one of cramped, cluttered industry, a vibrant, if somewhat dusty, heart beating in the otherwise drab landscape of the Crooked Quarter.
