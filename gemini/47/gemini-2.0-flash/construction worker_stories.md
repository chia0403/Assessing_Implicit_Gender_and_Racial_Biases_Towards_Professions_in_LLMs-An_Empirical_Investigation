The biting wind, a familiar companion on this godforsaken scaffold, whipped strands of Amelia Rose “Rosie” Riley's auburn hair across her face. She squinted against the glare reflecting off the skeletal frame of the soon-to-be-skyscraper, wiping a streak of grime across her already smudged cheek. Chicago in late November was a brutal mistress, all steel-grey skies and icy gusts that clawed through even the thickest layers of Carhartt.

Rosie, dangling precariously thirty stories above the bustling streets, took a swig from her thermos of lukewarm coffee. The bitter brew did little to thaw the chill that had sunk deep into her bones, but the caffeine promised a temporary reprieve from the monotonous grind of securing the I-beams that formed the building's spine.

Below, the city pulsed with a nervous energy: honking taxis, hurried footsteps, the distant wail of a siren weaving through the urban tapestry. A symphony of chaos that, paradoxically, grounded her. Up here, suspended between heaven and earth, Rosie found a strange sense of peace in the rhythmic clang of her hammer, the satisfying screech of metal on metal, the knowledge that she was, brick by painstaking brick, helping to build something that would outlast her.

The setting was the construction site of what would become the "Aurora Tower," a modern skyscraper in downtown Chicago, near the Chicago River. It was late November, just weeks before Thanksgiving, and the partially erected steel skeleton dominated the skyline. The air was thick with the metallic tang of welding fumes and the gritty dust kicked up by construction vehicles below. The surrounding streets were a constant flow of urban life, a stark contrast to the isolated and often perilous world of the high-rise construction workers.
