## The Story Opening:

The hum of the fluorescent lights was Amelia Corvus’s nightly lullaby. It wasn't a pleasant one, more a low, incessant drone that vibrated through the soles of her worn-out shoes and up into the aching muscles of her back. Tonight, the hum seemed especially loud, almost accusatory, as it bounced off the polished linoleum of the Westbridge Museum of Natural History.

Amelia sighed, the sound echoing in the cavernous Hall of Ancient Mammals. Dust motes, disturbed by her broom, danced in the single shaft of moonlight filtering through the high arched windows. She hated this hall. Not because of the skeletons – surprisingly, she found a strange comfort in their silent, timeless presence – but because of the sheer size. It felt like she was perpetually cleaning the Grand Canyon with a toothbrush.

She paused, leaning on her broom handle, and stared at the towering skeleton of a Baluchitherium, a prehistoric rhinoceros so large it dwarfed even the mammoth beside it. Its bones gleamed under the moonlight, ancient and powerful. Amelia Corvus, Head Janitor and Guardian of the Dust Bunnies at the Westbridge Museum, felt suddenly small and insignificant beneath its gaze.
