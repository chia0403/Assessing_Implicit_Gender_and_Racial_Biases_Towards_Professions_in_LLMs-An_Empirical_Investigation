## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, turning the usually charming streets of Port Crescent, Wisconsin, into a frozen obstacle course. It was mid-January, the kind of winter that settled deep in your bones and refused to leave until well past Easter. The sky, perpetually a dull grey, mirrored the low morale that seemed to cling to the town after the departure of the local paper mill the previous fall.

**Opening:**

The smell of pine needles and disinfectant still clung to Amelia Jane Carter's scrub top as she trudged through the snow towards her car. The single streetlight illuminating the parking lot of the Port Crescent Medical Clinic cast long, dancing shadows that made the already desolate scene feel even more eerie. Another ten-hour day down, another mountain of paperwork looming, and another chorus of sighs and complaints echoing in her ears. Amelia Jane Carter, Physician's Assistant, had always been drawn to healing, to helping, but tonight, the weight of Port Crescent’s collective ailments – both physical and emotional – felt crushing. She fumbled for her keys, the metal cold against her numb fingers, and wondered, not for the first time, if she’d made a terrible mistake coming back home.
