## Story Opening:

The stench hit Elias Theodore Finch like a wall of bad cheese and regret the moment he opened the crawl space door. He coughed, pulling his bandana higher over his nose, and squinted into the gloom. Cobwebs, thick as cotton candy, clung to every surface. He could hear the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of something unpleasant somewhere deeper in the darkness. Elias sighed, a sound that echoed in the confined space. This was the fifth septic tank malfunction this week, and he was starting to think the universe was actively conspiring against him. He grabbed his heavy-duty flashlight, the beam cutting through the murk, and muttered, "Alright, Theodore, let's see what horrors await us in the bowels of suburbia."

## Setting:

The story begins in the affluent, slightly-too-perfect suburban neighborhood of Pleasant Pines, nestled just outside of Harmony Springs, Colorado. The houses are all meticulously manicured, with emerald lawns and matching mailboxes. 12 Willow Creek Lane, in particular, is a sprawling two-story colonial with a wraparound porch and a swing set in the perfectly square backyard. The owner, Mrs. Penelope Worthington, a woman whose hair never seems to stray from its perfectly coiffed position, claims her prize-winning rose bushes are beginning to wilt, and she suspects the septic tank is the culprit. The crawl space, located beneath the back porch, is cramped and damp, a stark contrast to the pristine elegance of the rest of the property. It's a dark, forgotten realm where nature, and unfortunate plumbing mishaps, reign supreme.
