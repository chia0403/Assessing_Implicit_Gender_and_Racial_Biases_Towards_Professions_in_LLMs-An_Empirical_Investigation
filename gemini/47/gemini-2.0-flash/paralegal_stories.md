The fluorescent hum of the Becker, Klein & Sharpe office building followed Sarah Abigail Chen like a buzzing mosquito, a constant reminder that even at 8:17 PM on a Tuesday, she was still tethered to her desk. The view from the 37th floor, usually a glittering tapestry of Chicagoâ€™s skyline, was obscured tonight by a persistent drizzle, blurring the city lights into hazy, impressionistic strokes. Sarah sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear. The legal brief she was wrestling with, a mess of boilerplate language and arcane jargon concerning a messy contract dispute between two competing lumber companies, swam before her eyes.

The scent of burnt coffee, a byproduct of her third attempt to stay awake, permeated the air around her cubicle. It mingled unpleasantly with the faint, lingering aroma of Mr. Becker's perpetually-present pipe tobacco, a smell she'd come to associate with impending doom. Her cramped workspace, crammed with overflowing files, legal pads filled with frantic scribbles, and three half-empty water bottles, felt more like a pressure cooker than a productive zone. Even the cheerful, albeit generic, landscape painting hanging askew on the cubicle wall seemed to mock her weariness. Somewhere down the hall, the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of the cleaning crew's mops echoed through the otherwise deserted floor, a lonely soundtrack to her late-night grind. Sarah took another deep breath, straightened her slightly crooked glasses, and dove back into the labyrinthine world of the lumber industry, hoping to find some sliver of clarity before her brain completely melted.
