Okay, here's a story opening with a dressmaker as the main character, including setting and full name:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of lavender and hope hung heavy in the air of “A Stitch in Time,” Amara Beatrice Bellweather’s dressmaking shop. Sunlight, filtered through the lace-curtained windows, illuminated motes of dust dancing above bolts of silk, velvet, and linen. Amara, her lips pursed in concentration, pinned a delicate sprig of faux forget-me-nots to the bodice of a tea-length dress. The fabric, a pale robin's egg blue, shimmered under her touch, a testament to her discerning eye. Outside, the gentle clatter of hooves and the murmur of polite conversation drifted from the cobblestone street, a comforting soundtrack to her meticulous work. But today, a knot of unease tightened in Amara’s stomach. Mrs. Plumtree's commission, though exquisite, felt like a mere distraction from the unsettling news rippling through the village – a series of disappearances, each leaving behind a whisper of shadows and a lingering chill.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the quaint, fictional village of Willow Creek, nestled in the Cotswolds region of England, in the early 1920s. Willow Creek is known for its picturesque charm, its close-knit community, and its reputation for producing exceptional handcrafted goods. The village square is dominated by an ancient oak tree, its branches gnarled and reaching, offering shade to the market stalls that spring up twice a week. "A Stitch in Time" is located on a quiet side street, its unassuming façade hiding the treasure trove of fabrics, patterns, and half-finished creations within. The surrounding landscape is a patchwork of rolling hills, dotted with sheep and crisscrossed by winding country lanes, a seemingly idyllic backdrop to the growing unease that grips the village.
