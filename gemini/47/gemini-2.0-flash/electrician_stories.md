The stale, metallic scent of ungrounded wires and burnt ozone hung heavy in the air of the abandoned Starlight Cinema. Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, drumming a frantic rhythm that echoed through the cavernous space. Amelia Jane Carter, electrician extraordinaire, squinted, the beam of her headlamp cutting through the oppressive gloom. Dust motes danced in the beam, illuminating faded murals of silver screen stars and the skeletal remains of plush velvet seats, ripped and torn by vandals and time.

The Starlight Cinema, once the jewel of Oakhaven, was now a derelict husk, a monument to a bygone era. Amelia had been hired by the new owners – a pair of optimistic developers with dreams of turning the building into luxury apartments – to assess the electrical system, or rather, what was left of it. Rumours swirled around the old cinema, whispers of strange occurrences, flickering lights, and phantom organ music. Most folks in Oakhaven dismissed them as folklore, tales told to scare teenagers, but even Amelia, a woman of logic and wiring diagrams, couldn’t quite shake the feeling of being watched.

Her boots crunched on the debris-strewn floor as she navigated the labyrinthine corridors, the hum of her testing equipment a lonely counterpoint to the howling wind outside. She ran a gloved hand along a crumbling wall, tracing the path of a long-disused conduit. This wasn't just another job; this was a delve into the past, a journey into the heart of a building that held secrets, both electrical and otherwise. And Amelia Jane Carter, with her trusty multimeter and a healthy dose of skepticism, was determined to uncover them all.
