Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The mid-morning sun beat down on Cypress Creek Estates, a sprawling, meticulously manicured neighborhood nestled just outside Austin, Texas. Towering pecan trees offered only dappled shade, and the air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut St. Augustine grass and the faint, underlying aroma of money. Each house, a testament to Texan affluence, boasted acres of carefully sculpted lawns, vibrant flower beds, and the obligatory water feature â€“ a trickling fountain, a koi pond, or, in one particularly ostentatious case, a miniature replica of the San Antonio Riverwalk.

**Opening:**

Ricardo "Ricky" Eduardo Flores wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his dirt-stained glove, leaving a streak of brown across his forehead. He squinted at the monstrous Victorian mansion before him, its gingerbread trim gleaming blindingly white. He'd been tending Mrs. Abernathy's prize-winning rose bushes for three years now, a task he usually found oddly meditative. But today, the meticulously pruned blooms seemed to mock him with their perfect symmetry and vibrant hues. He was late. Terribly, catastrophically late. And the client waiting for him at the next house down the street was rumored to be even more demanding than Mrs. Abernathy, a feat Ricardo hadn't thought possible until now.
