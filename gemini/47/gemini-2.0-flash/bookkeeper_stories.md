The late afternoon sun, already painting the sky in streaks of bruised purple and weary orange, slanted across the cluttered desk of Abigail Willowbrook. Dust motes danced in the golden beams, illuminating a landscape of meticulously organized chaos: stacks of invoices, neatly bound ledgers, and a half-eaten apple, strategically positioned to catch the occasional drip of her ever-present Earl Grey tea.

Abigail, all five-foot-four of her, sighed and pushed her spectacles higher up her nose. The air in the office of "Thistlewick & Sons, Purveyors of Fine Teas and Imported Delights" was thick with the scent of dried lavender, cardamom, and the faint, lingering aroma of roasting Darjeeling. It was a comforting smell, usually, but today it felt suffocating, a fragrant reminder of the endless accounts that stretched before her like the Yorkshire Dales on a particularly bleak morning.

The office itself was tucked away in a creaking Victorian building on a cobbled side street in the seaside town of Whitby. The building, once a grand private residence, now housed Thistlewick & Sons on the ground floor and a ramshackle antique shop, rumored to be haunted, on the floors above. The sounds of the sea, a constant murmur just beyond the brick facade, occasionally punctuated by the mournful cry of a seagull, offered a sense of vastness that Abigail often craved, especially on days like this when the numbers simply refused to cooperate.
