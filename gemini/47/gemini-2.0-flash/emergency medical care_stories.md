The siren’s wail was a mournful counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's heart. Rain, thick and greasy with the city’s grime, hammered against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the neon blur of the Lower East Side. Amy gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white, trying to ignore the way her gut twisted with a familiar knot of anxiety. This was her third call of the night, and each one had been a descent further into the city’s underbelly.

The address crackled again over the radio, garbled by static and the incessant drumming of the rain. "Possible overdose. Ludlow and Delancey. Subject unresponsive."

Amy swore under her breath. Delancey. Even on a good night, Delancey was a circus of flashing lights, hawkers, and the constant press of humanity. On a night like this, it was a breeding ground for desperation. She glanced at her partner, a young rookie named Ben, whose face was pale under the fluorescent glow of the ambulance interior.

"Ready, Ben?" she asked, her voice tighter than she intended.

Ben swallowed hard and nodded. "Ready as I'll ever be, Amy."

She slammed on the brakes, the ambulance lurching to a halt in a pool of flickering streetlight. The scent of wet garbage, stale beer, and something vaguely chemical assaulted her as she wrenched open the door. This was the Lower East Side at 3 AM: a symphony of broken dreams played out against a backdrop of peeling paint and broken promises. This was Amy's arena, and tonight, it felt particularly unforgiving.
