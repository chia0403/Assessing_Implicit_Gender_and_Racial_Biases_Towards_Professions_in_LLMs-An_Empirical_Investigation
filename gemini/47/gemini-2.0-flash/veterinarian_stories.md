Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and main character's full name:

**Opening:**

The biting wind howled like a banshee through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that guarded the entrance to Bramblewood Animal Sanctuary.  Dr. Eleanor Grace Ainsworth, her face flushed and numb despite the thick wool scarf wrapped around her neck, squinted through the swirling snow.  The sanctuary sign, usually a cheerful depiction of a leaping deer, was barely visible, plastered in a thick layer of white.  Another blizzard.  Just what she needed, considering the reason she was out here: a frantic call about a downed peregrine falcon, its majestic wings tangled in fishing line. 

Eleanor gripped the steering wheel of her battered Land Rover, its engine rattling in protest against the arctic chill, and pressed on. She knew this road like the back of her hand, every rut and pothole a familiar landmark in the unforgiving landscape.  She had dedicated the last ten years of her life to this sanctuary, and nothing, not even a blizzard capable of swallowing a small town whole, would keep her from an animal in need. Even if that meant staring down the face of a legend.
