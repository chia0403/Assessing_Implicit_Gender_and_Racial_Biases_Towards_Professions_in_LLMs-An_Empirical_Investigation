## Story Opening:

The salt air hung heavy, clinging to the faded blue paint of the Victorian house like a lovesick suitor. Rain, more mist than actual precipitation, slicked the already treacherous wooden porch steps. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, gripping the ornate wrought-iron railing, cursed the weather and the listing in equal measure. Ocean View Properties had saddled her with this behemoth - a three-story, turreted monstrosity overlooking the churning Atlantic in the quiet, forgotten corner of Cape Disappointment.

She’d tried to convince Mr. Abernathy, her boss, that showcasing properties in the Hamptons might be more her forte, but he'd just patted her hand with his clammy palm and said, "Ellie, darling, you have a certain… tenacity. This house needs tenacity. Plus, the owners are practically giving it away. Think of the commission!"

Ellie thought of the damp, the potential mold, and the sheer, overwhelming amount of elbow grease required to make this place habitable, let alone desirable. She thought of all the potential buyers, the weekenders from Portland drawn by the romantic promise of the sea, only to be confronted with the grim reality of peeling paint and the incessant screeching of gulls. And she thought of her carefully crafted image as a successful real estate agent, slowly eroding with each listing in this godforsaken place.

Taking a deep breath, Ellie adjusted the shoulder strap of her expensive (and decidedly not waterproof) leather bag and pasted on her most convincing smile. Time to face the music, and hopefully, sell this haunted house before it swallowed her whole.

## Setting:

**The Cape Disappointment Lighthouse area, Washington State.** Specifically, an older, somewhat dilapidated Victorian house perched on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The house is named "Seafoam Manor" and boasts three stories, a turret, and an overgrown garden choked with hardy coastal plants. The weather is perpetually damp, with frequent bouts of rain and heavy fog. The area is sparsely populated, with a mix of long-time residents, fishermen, and a smattering of tourists drawn to the lighthouse and the dramatic coastline. The nearest town, Ilwaco, is a small fishing village struggling to maintain its identity amidst the encroaching forces of tourism and development. The atmosphere is one of faded grandeur and a lingering sense of history, tinged with a pervasive feeling of isolation.
