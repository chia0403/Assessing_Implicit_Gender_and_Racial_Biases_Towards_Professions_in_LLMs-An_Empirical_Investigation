The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain, even at 7:00 AM. Dr. Vivian Eleanor Dubois wiped a bead of sweat from her brow as she unlocked the wrought-iron gate of "Nourish & Flourish," her small nutrition clinic nestled in the heart of the Garden District. The building, a beautifully restored Victorian with gingerbread trim and climbing roses, felt like a cool, welcoming oasis compared to the stifling street.

Inside, the air was crisp and clean, thanks to the industrial-strength air purifier Vivian had insisted on. The aroma of chamomile tea, brewing gently in the kitchenette, mingled with the faint, earthy scent of the organic vegetables she'd picked up from the farmer's market that morning. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, painting the waiting room in jewel-toned hues. Comfortable armchairs upholstered in botanical prints sat around a low table piled with brochures and healthy living magazines. Vivian believed that even the *ambiance* of her clinic should promote well-being.

But today, as she adjusted the angle of the "Live Laugh Lentils" print on the wall (a gift from her eccentric Aunt Millie), a knot of anxiety tightened in Vivian's stomach. Today was the day Mrs. Evangeline Beauregard, the grande dame of the Garden District and notoriously picky eater, was scheduled for her initial consultation. And Vivian had a feeling that even the promise of flourishing health wouldn't be enough to sway the iron will of the legendary Mrs. Beauregard.
