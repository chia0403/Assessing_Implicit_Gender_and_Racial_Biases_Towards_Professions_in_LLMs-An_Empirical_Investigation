**Setting:** The cramped, slightly musty interior of "Al's Diner" in downtown Buffalo, New York. The booths are worn vinyl, cracked in places and patched with mismatched tape. A chipped formica counter dominates the space, overlooked by a stainless steel coffee maker perpetually bubbling and hissing. Outside, the November wind howls, rattling the neon "OPEN" sign in the window and spitting icy rain against the glass. The air inside smells of stale coffee, frying onions, and a lingering hint of disinfectant, a cocktail of aromas familiar and comforting to a weary soul.

**Story Opening:**

Margaret Elizabeth Riley stirred her lukewarm coffee with a spoon, the clinking sound a jarring counterpoint to the gentle murmur of conversation and the rhythmic sizzle coming from the grill. She stared out the rain-streaked window, watching the city lights blur and morph into abstract shapes. It was nearly midnight, and Al’s Diner was one of the few places still flickering with life in this part of town. The case had gone south. Terribly, irrevocably south. Her client, a young man named Daniel Hayes accused of armed robbery, had just been sentenced to fifteen years. Fifteen years for something Margaret still believed he hadn't done. She’d poured everything she had into his defense, nights bled into days, evidence meticulously analyzed, witnesses grilled and grilled again. But it hadn't been enough. The weight of the verdict, the crushing weight of injustice, settled heavily on her shoulders. She hadn't felt this defeated since…well, since her father's case, years ago. Margaret sighed, the sound lost in the low hum of the diner, and took another sip of the bitter brew. Maybe, just maybe, a large piece of Al’s famous apple pie was exactly what she needed to crawl out of this pit.
