The scent of lavender and linseed oil hung thick in the air of the dilapidated Victorian mansion. For Evangeline Aurora Bellweather, it was the smell of potential. Or perhaps, more accurately, the smell of a Herculean task ahead. Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light filtering through the grimy, arched windows, illuminating peeling wallpaper the color of dried blood and a floor so warped it looked like a topographical map of a miniature mountain range.

This was Oakhaven, a once-grand estate on the outskirts of Havenwood, Connecticut, and it had seen better days. Decades better, in fact. The house, a relic of a bygone era, was a monument to faded glory, burdened with the whispers of generations long past and a hefty dose of stubborn neglect. Evangeline, hired by the eccentric and notoriously private owner, Mr. Silas Blackwood, had been given carte blanche to revitalize the house, to breathe life back into its decaying bones. A daunting prospect, yes, but one that thrilled her to her core. This wasn't just a job; it was a chance to resurrect a forgotten beauty, to weave her own artistry into the tapestry of its history.

The setting was crucial: Oakhaven wasn't just a building, it was a character in itself, brooding and imposing, silently challenging Evangeline to unlock its secrets. And Evangeline, armed with her sketchpad, a keen eye for detail, and an unwavering determination, was ready to accept the challenge.
