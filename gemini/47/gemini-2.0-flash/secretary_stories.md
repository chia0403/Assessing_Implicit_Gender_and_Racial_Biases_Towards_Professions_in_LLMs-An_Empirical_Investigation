Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a main character who is a secretary:

**Setting:** The story opens on a dreary, late-autumn morning in 1957 in Chicago. The financial district is a symphony of grey – grey skies, grey buildings, grey suits hurrying along the sidewalks. The wind whips off Lake Michigan, carrying with it the scent of coal smoke and a persistent chill that bites through even the thickest wool coat. The grand, but somewhat dilapidated, Beaux-Arts building of "Continental Imports & Exports, Inc." looms large on LaSalle Street, its bronze doors worn smooth by decades of hurried comings and goings.

**Opening:**

The clatter of Lorraine Beatrice Miller's Royal Quiet De Luxe typewriter was the first sound to break the morning silence on the 14th floor of Continental Imports & Exports. It was 7:58 AM, two minutes before her official start time, and Lorraine was already halfway through retyping a particularly egregious memo penned by Mr. Abernathy. The man's grasp of basic punctuation was, in her considered opinion, a crime against literature. Sighing, Lorraine adjusted her spectacles and straightened the collar of her sensible, navy blue dress. Another day, another battle against grammatical anarchy. The thought brought a wry smile to her lips – a tiny rebellion in the otherwise regimented world of secretaries, coffee breaks, and filing cabinets. She paused, a perfectly formed comma hovering over the carriage return, and glanced out the window. Another grey day, another grey week. But today, Lorraine felt, something was different. There was a prickle of anticipation, a subtle hum in the air, that had nothing to do with the faulty fluorescent light flickering overhead. Something was about to happen.
