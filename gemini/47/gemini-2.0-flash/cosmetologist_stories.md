## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid Louisiana air clung to everything like Spanish moss, even inside "Glamour Gator," a bustling hair salon nestled in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans. The building itself was a converted townhouse, its aged brick exterior softened by overflowing window boxes bursting with vibrant fuchsia bougainvillea. Inside, the air thrummed with the rhythmic whir of blow dryers, the melodic clatter of curling irons, and the lively chatter of clients and stylists alike. The scent of hairspray, fruity shampoo, and a hint of chicory coffee mingled in the air, creating a heady, distinctly New Orleanian aroma. Sunlight streamed through the tall, arched windows, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing above the chaotic, yet carefully organized, stations.

**Opening:**

Vivienne Marguerite Dubois sighed, the sound barely audible above the Bee Gees blasting from the overhead speakers. Her fingers, nimble and practiced, worked quickly, coaxing a stubborn cowlick into submission on Mrs. Broussard's already gravity-defying beehive. Outside, a jazz band wailed a mournful tune, the sound weaving its way into the salon's already cacophonous atmosphere. Vivienne, a cosmetologist for the last ten years at Glamour Gator, had seen it all - from wedding day disasters averted at the last minute to the subtle transformations that gave a grieving widow the courage to face the world again. But today, the air felt different. A low, simmering tension hung in the salon, thick enough to slice with her favorite pair of styling shears. And Vivienne, with her sharp eyes and even sharper intuition, knew it wasn't just because Tiffany had accidentally set off the smoke alarmâ€¦ again. Something was definitely brewing at Glamour Gator, and Vivienne had a sinking feeling it involved more than just a bad perm.
