The desert sun beat down on Elias Thorneâ€™s back, each ray a hammer blow against the already frayed edges of his patience. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mocking him with their fleeting displays of moisture. He leaned against the weathered fence post, the rough-hewn wood digging into his calloused hands, and squinted at the shimmering horizon. The only sound was the mournful creak of the windmills, their desperate struggle against the relentless drought mirroring his own. This land, inherited from his grandfather, was a stubborn mistress, demanding everything and offering little in return. Elias swore he could taste the dust, feel it grinding between his teeth, a constant reminder of the Crawford County, Texas, drought that had been choking Thorne Ranch for the last three years. Today, Elias was hoping to receive a new water pump to replace the old broken one, but with the weather being so hot and dry, the mail truck might never arrive.
