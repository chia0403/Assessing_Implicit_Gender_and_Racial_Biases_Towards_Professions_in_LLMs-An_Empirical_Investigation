Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The relentless Alabama sun beat down on the small, unincorporated community of Possum Trot, population barely scraping 300. A patchwork of tired bungalows and double-wides huddled under the shade of ancient oak trees, their roofs mostly a mix of faded shingles and rusted metal. Possum Trot was a place where time moved slower than molasses, and the most exciting event of the week was the Friday night bingo game at the VFW hall.

**Story Opening:**

Sweat stung Jebediah Theodore Pruitt's eyes, blurring the already hazy view of Mrs. Henderson's overgrown rose bushes below. He wiped his forearm across his forehead, leaving a muddy streak on his tanned skin. Jebediah, or Jeb as everyone called him, even himself, gripped the edge of the aging asphalt shingle, his calloused fingers searching for purchase. It wasn't just the heat; it was the incline, the feeling of precariousness that always gnawed at him. He'd been roofing for fifteen years, ever since his daddy taught him the trade, but heights still made his stomach clench. He preferred the ground, tending his small garden, listening to the crickets chirp. But Mrs. Henderson’s roof, well, it was calling to him. She'd promised him a jar of her prize-winning fig preserves, and Jebediah, more than any amount of money, had a weakness for a good fig preserve. He just hoped this wasn't going to be the day he learned to fly, involuntarily. He took another shaky step and reached for the hammer. "Just one shingle at a time, Jeb," he muttered to himself, his breath coming in short, ragged bursts. “One shingle at a time.”
