The harsh fluorescent lights of Gentle Smiles Dental blasted away any lingering drowsiness as Elara May Harding, RDH, scrubbed in for another Thursday. The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of fluoride rinse and the sterile tang of disinfectant, a cocktail she'd become intimately familiar with over the last eight years. Gentle Smiles, nestled in the heart of Maple Creek, Wisconsin, was a study in small-town charm struggling against the relentless march of corporate dentistry. Dr. Peterson, the practice's owner and a man whose booming laughter could shake the very foundations of the building, was a stalwart believer in old-fashioned care, even as chain clinics with their fancy lasers and aggressive marketing campaigns encroached on their patient base. Today, Elara felt the weight of that encroachment particularly keenly. The schedule was light, too light, and the silence between patients was punctuated only by the hum of the autoclave and the rhythmic tapping of her own nervous foot. She glanced at the clock, 8:57 AM. Three more minutes until Mrs. Higgins, bless her soul, arrived for her usual cleaning and gossip session. Three more minutes to gather the cheerfulness she knew Mrs. Higgins, and, let's be honest, Dr. Peterson expected. Three more minutes to push aside the nagging fear that Gentle Smiles, and her job along with it, might soon be just a memory in the annals of Maple Creek's history.
