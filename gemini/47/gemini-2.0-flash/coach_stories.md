**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Hayes's cheeks as she slammed the trunk of her battered Volvo. The old girl groaned in protest, a familiar sound that mirrored the ache in Amelia's own joints. Another Chicago winter, another year of teenage dreams on ice, and another season she wasn't sure she was truly ready for. But she was, dammit. She had to be.

**Setting:**

The setting is the Windy City Ice Arena, a sprawling, industrial-looking building tucked into a forgotten corner of Chicago's Northwest Side. Inside, the air is thick with the metallic tang of frozen water and the persistent, echoing scrape of skates. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grime-streaked skylights, casting the rink in a perpetual twilight. Banners proclaiming past victories – most of them faded and slightly torn – hang haphazardly from the rafters. The aroma of stale coffee perpetually clings to the worn plastic benches and the chipped linoleum floor of the viewing area. It’s a place that reeks of dedication, grit, and the faint glimmer of hope that every skater carries with them onto the ice.
