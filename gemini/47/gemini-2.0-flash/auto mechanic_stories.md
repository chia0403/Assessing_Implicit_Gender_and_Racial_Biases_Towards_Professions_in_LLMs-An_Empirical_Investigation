## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The relentless Georgia sun beat down on the corrugated tin roof of "Dixie Diesel & Daughters," a small, cluttered auto repair shop just outside of Griffin, Georgia. Grease-stained concrete floor met walls lined with calendars featuring vintage pin-up girls and faded American flags. The air hung thick with the smell of motor oil, burnt rubber, and the faint sweetness of honeysuckle creeping in from the overgrown ditch outside. Wrenches, sockets, and a hundred other tools clung precariously to pegboards, threatening to avalanche at the slightest vibration. Hank Williams Jr. crooned about family tradition from a dusty radio perched atop a stack of tires.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Mae "Bea" Calhoun wiped a streak of grease across her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a smudged Rorschach test just above her left eyebrow. The groan coming from beneath the cherry-red '57 Chevy Bel Air was unsettling, even for her. She’d tackled worse, of course. Bent frames, blown gaskets, engines that sounded like a choir of dying cats – she’d seen it all in her twenty years turning wrenches at Dixie Diesel & Daughters, her daddy’s shop. But this... this felt different. This felt like a ghost.

“Okay, Betsy," she muttered to the stubborn classic, using the nickname she’d affectionately bestowed upon it, "let's see what you're hiding down there.” Bea adjusted her headlamp, the beam cutting through the gloom beneath the car, and braced herself for whatever mechanical nightmare awaited. She just hoped it wasn’t another weekend down the drain. Her date with Deputy Brody Henderson was riding on this, and damn it all if a busted transmission was going to keep her from a little two-steppin' and maybe, just maybe, a whole lot more.
