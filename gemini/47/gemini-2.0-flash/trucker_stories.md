Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and the full name of the main character, who is a trucker:

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind whipped at the canvas tarp covering Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley’s rig, the *Iron Horse*, a hulking Kenworth W900L that had seen better days. Bart squinted, pulling his collar tighter around his neck.  The thermometer nailed to the side mirror read a dismal 18 degrees Fahrenheit, a stark reminder of the brutal Wyoming winter he’d signed up for. This wasn't his usual California sunshine route, hauling oranges from Bakersfield to Phoenix. This was a meat run, a vital shipment of frozen beef from Cheyenne to a struggling reservation trading post up near the Wind River Range.  He breathed a plume of white into the pre-dawn darkness, the diesel engine a low rumble beneath him, a comforting heartbeat in the desolate landscape.  He checked his mirrors, adjusted his worn leather gloves, and muttered, "Alright, Iron Horse, let's earn our keep." He hadn't seen this kind of weather in years.  This was a job, and Bart McKinley always finished his job.

**Setting:**

*   **Time:** Early morning, around 5:00 AM, late January.
*   **Location:** Cheyenne, Wyoming, specifically at a meat processing plant loading dock. The area is sparsely populated, with snow-covered plains stretching out as far as the eye can see. The nearest visible features are the silhouette of the plant, a few scattered farmhouses in the distance, and a radio tower blinking a lonely red warning light against the dark horizon.
*   **Atmosphere:** Cold, bleak, and isolating. The wind howls relentlessly, and the sky is a pre-dawn grey. The overall mood is one of stark beauty mixed with a sense of vulnerability against the elements. The inside of the cab is slightly warmer, smelling of stale coffee and leather.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley
*   **Occupation:** Long-haul truck driver
*   **Brief Impression:** A seasoned trucker, possibly in his late 50s or early 60s. He's weathered and experienced, but not necessarily world-weary. There's a resilience and a quiet determination about him. You can imagine he has a story to tell, many, in fact.
