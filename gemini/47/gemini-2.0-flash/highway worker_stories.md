The biting wind whipped across I-80, stealing the heat right out of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' bones. He tucked his chin deeper into the collar of his orange work jacket, the reflective stripes gleaming like angry neon against the bruised-purple twilight sky. Dust, grit, and the ever-present smell of diesel clung to everything, a constant reminder of his life spent in the service of this ribbon of asphalt.

The setting was a construction zone twenty miles east of Evanston, Wyoming. The endless plains stretched out on either side, broken only by the occasional lonely wind turbine silhouetted against the fading light. The ground was a patchwork of churned earth, piles of gravel, and the cold, unforgiving gray of the highway itself. Tonight, Bart and his crew were replacing expansion joints, a thankless job that involved jackhammers screaming into the night and the constant threat of passing trucks barreling a little too close, a little too fast. A string of portable floodlights buzzed and crackled, casting harsh, unnatural shadows that danced and shifted with the wind, making the whole scene feel surreal and vaguely menacing. It was a landscape both beautiful and brutal, a place where Bart felt both utterly exposed and strangely at home.
