The biting wind, laced with the acrid smell of burning plastic, whipped at Elias Thorneâ€™s exposed face. He squinted against the swirling snow, the reflected glare from the roaring inferno in front of him making it almost impossible to see. The thermometer on the fire truck read a bone-chilling -15 degrees Celsius, but Elias barely registered it. The heat radiating off the collapsing warehouse was enough to sear the exposed skin around his mask.

Elias Thorne, a veteran firefighter with Station 3 in the sleepy, lakeside town of Havenwood, Minnesota, gripped the nozzle of the hose tighter. He could feel the vibration of the water surging through the reinforced rubber, a lifeline in this chaotic dance with death. Havenwood was known for its charming antique shops, picturesque hiking trails, and placid winters, not industrial fires that threatened to engulf the entire east end of town. But here they were, facing down a blaze that had started mysteriously just after midnight, and now, nearly four hours later, was showing no sign of slowing. The warehouse, owned by a local lumber company, was a tinderbox of dried wood and flammable chemicals, making the situation even more precarious. Elias could only pray they contained it before the entire structure crumbled, bringing down the power lines overhead and plunging Havenwood into darkness.
