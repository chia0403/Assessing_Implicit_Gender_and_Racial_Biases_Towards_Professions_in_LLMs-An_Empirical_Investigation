## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The salt spray stung Eleanor Vance’s face, mimicking the internal burning of her frustration. Another failed shot. Another wasted hour. The wind, a malevolent sculptor, whipped her dark hair across her eyes, momentarily blinding her to the very subject she’d been chasing for weeks: the elusive silver-throated gulls that nested on the craggy, unforgiving cliffs of Isle of Skye.  She cursed under her breath, the word swallowed by the roar of the Atlantic. This wasn’t some Instagram-friendly, posed perfection she was after. She wanted raw, untamed beauty, the kind that gnawed at your insides and left you breathless. But all she had were blurry blobs of white against a perpetually grey sky, mocking her artistic ambitions.

**Setting:**

The story is set primarily on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in late Autumn. The landscape is dominated by dramatic, rugged coastlines, characterized by jagged cliffs, windswept moors, and treacherous, slate-colored beaches. The weather is unpredictable, shifting rapidly between brief bursts of sunlight, bone-chilling rain, and thick, swirling fog. The small, remote village of Elgol, with its whitewashed cottages clinging to the steep hillsides, serves as a secondary location and Eleanor's temporary base. The atmosphere is one of isolation, a stark reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of human existence. The off-season tourist trade has dwindled, leaving the island to its long-time residents and the elements.
