## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering neon sign of "The Starlight Lounge" buzzed insistently, a garish beacon in the perpetual drizzle that plagued Rain City. Puddles mirrored its lurid glow, distorting the already unsettling atmosphere of the alley that housed it. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarette smoke, cheap perfume, and something vaguely metallic, like old blood.

**Story Opening:**

Arthur Reginald Blackwood, his trench coat soaked through and clinging uncomfortably, flicked the last inch of his cigarette into the grimy puddle. The water hissed in protest. He hated Rain City. He hated rain. He hated everything about this case, starting with the dame who'd hired him, all lacquered nails and tearful eyes. He’d already pegged her as trouble. 

He adjusted the fedora that shielded his face from the relentless drizzle and pushed open the back door of the Starlight Lounge, the brass handle sticky beneath his gloved hand. The discordant piano music and the clinking of glasses washed over him, a cheap symphony of despair. This was it. The place where a promising jazz singer named Luna Valentine had vanished without a trace a week ago. And Arthur Reginald Blackwood, private detective, was about to dive headfirst into the murky depths of Rain City’s underworld to find her. Whether she wanted to be found or not.
