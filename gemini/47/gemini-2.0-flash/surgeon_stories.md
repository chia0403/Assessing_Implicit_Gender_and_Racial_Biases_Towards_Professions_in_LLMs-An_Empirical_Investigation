## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of chlorhexidine clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance's surgical scrubs, a familiar comfort in the face of the looming storm. Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, whipping rain against the panoramic windows of the OR. It sounded like the keening of souls lost at sea, a sound all too appropriate for the kind of day it was turning out to be. She glanced at the clock: 3:17 PM. Nearly an hour past when the medevac helicopter was supposed to land. 

Her gloved hands, already prepped and waiting, felt clammy despite the controlled temperature of the room. She tapped a rhythmic tattoo on the sterile drape covering the unconscious patient on the operating table – a young fisherman named Marco Rodriguez, gored by the thrashing bill of a marlin and bleeding internally.

Eleanor had performed hundreds of operations, some more complex than others, but this one felt different. The storm, the delay, the young man’s desperate fight for life... it all coalesced into a knot of unease in her stomach. She’d called her mentor, Dr. Ramirez, for a second opinion – a rare admission of doubt for a surgeon known for her unwavering confidence. Ramirez’s cryptic advice, "Sometimes, Eleanor, the ocean gives, and sometimes, it takes," did little to soothe her nerves.

The red light above the OR door flickered on, and the automatic doors slid open with a hiss. Dr. Matthews, his face pale and streaked with rain, stumbled in, his eyes wide.

"Eleanor," he gasped, breathless, "the helicopter... it crashed."

## Setting:

The story opens within the Operating Room (OR) of **St. Jude's Hospital**, a mid-sized medical facility located in the remote coastal town of **Port Azure, Maine.**

Port Azure is a town defined by the unforgiving beauty and unpredictable nature of the North Atlantic. Its economy hinges on fishing and tourism, both industries deeply intertwined with the sea. The town itself is a patchwork of weather-beaten Victorian houses clinging to the rocky coastline, interspersed with modern buildings like St. Jude's, a testament to the town's stubborn resilience.

The OR in St. Jude's is modern and well-equipped, a pocket of clinical precision amidst the wildness of the surrounding environment. The large windows offer a sweeping view of the churning ocean, a constant reminder of the elemental forces at play beyond the hospital walls. On a calm day, the view is serene and inspiring. Today, however, it's a terrifying spectacle, a swirling canvas of gray and white that underscores the fragility of life.
