## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust, stale coffee, and desperation hung thicker than the velvet curtain in the wings of the Grand Majestic Theatre. A single, bare bulb illuminated the cavernous space, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the frantic movements of Ms. Genevieve Eleanor Hawthorne. Her usually immaculate auburn hair was a chaotic nest, strands clinging to her damp forehead as she paced, muttering lines and stage directions into the expectant silence. Her fingers, perpetually stained with charcoal from sketching costume designs, drummed a nervous tattoo against the thick script clutched in her hand.

"No, no, no! It's all wrong, completely wrong!" Genevieve exploded, the sound echoing through the empty auditorium. "He's not *selling* the grief, darling boy. He's *wearing* it like a poorly tailored suit!"

She stopped pacing and fixed her gaze on the young actor nervously waiting on stage, his face pale under the glare of the work light. "Arthur, my sweet, you're playing Hamlet, not a disgruntled shopkeeper. Where is the weight of the world? Where is the existential angst? Give me…give me despair so palpable I can taste it on my tongue!"

He wilted under her withering stare, his shoulders slumping further with each syllable. Genevieve sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. She loved these young actors, she truly did, but sometimes their lack of conviction threatened to drive her completely mad. Opening night was less than a week away, and Hamlet, as it stood, was closer to Humpty Dumpty – about to take a great fall.

## Setting:

**The Grand Majestic Theatre, London, 1928.**

The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of London's theatre scene, now showed the wear and tear of time and changing tastes. The once opulent decor – ornate plasterwork, faded gold leaf, and crimson velvet – was now marred by cracks, peeling paint, and threadbare patches. The air was perpetually damp and carried the faint aroma of mothballs and forgotten dreams. While the upper balconies were often sparsely populated, the orchestra stalls, with their plush, albeit worn, seats, still attracted a dedicated audience of theatre aficionados and the occasional curious tourist. The Grand Majestic, despite its fading glory, held a certain melancholic charm, a whispered promise of the magic it once held and, perhaps, might hold again under the right direction.
