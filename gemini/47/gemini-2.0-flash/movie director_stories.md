## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The air hung thick with the smell of cheap pizza and barely suppressed panic. Eleanor Vance, a director known for her meticulous preparation and ice-water composure, found herself staring at a monitor, the screen displaying a chaotic mess of green screen and flailing extras. She'd envisioned a majestic, sweeping shot of a Viking raid on a fortified coastal village. What she was getting looked more like a drunken LARP session gone horribly wrong.

Eleanor pressed her fingers to her temples, fighting back the rising tide of frustration. “Okay, people, hold it!” she barked into the headset, her voice sharper than usual. "Bjorn isn't tripping over a stray prop log! He's supposed to be hacking through enemy lines with the fury of Odin!"

A nervous cough crackled in her ear. "Uh, Eleanor? About that prop log..." It was Mark, her perpetually flustered assistant director. "Turns out that *wasn't* a prop log. It was actually…Dave. From catering. He, uh, was taking a nap."

Eleanor closed her eyes. This was shaping up to be *that* kind of day.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance's Viking epic, "The Serpent's Tooth," was being filmed on a sprawling, privately-owned ranch just outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The location had been chosen for its dramatic mesas, which, with a little CGI help, could convincingly double as the craggy coastline of early medieval Scandinavia. A full-scale Viking village, complete with longhouses, a blacksmith's forge, and a (hopefully) functional dock, had been painstakingly constructed.

The stark beauty of the desert landscape juxtaposed sharply with the constructed chaos of the film set. The vibrant hues of Viking shields and costumes clashed with the muted tones of the mesas, while the sounds of clashing steel and bellowing commands echoed across the otherwise silent landscape. Tents housing wardrobe, makeup, and catering stood like temporary oases in the dust, offering fleeting respite from the harsh New Mexico sun.

Despite the grandeur of the setting, a sense of precariousness hung in the air. The budget was tight, the schedule even tighter, and the weather – with its unpredictable dust storms and scorching heat – was an ever-present adversary. Eleanor knew that every single day was a battle, a constant struggle against the elements, against the clock, and against the ever-present potential for disaster, like a rogue catering employee deciding to take a nap in the middle of a Viking raid.
