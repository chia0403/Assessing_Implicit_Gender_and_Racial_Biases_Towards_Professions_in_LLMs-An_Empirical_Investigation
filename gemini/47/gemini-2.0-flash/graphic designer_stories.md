The hum of the fluorescent lights in the eleventh-floor office building was a constant, irritating drone that usually faded into the background for Amara Beatrice Rodriguez. But today, it felt like a personal assault. She stabbed viciously at her trackpad, willing the bezier curve to cooperate. It stubbornly refused, mocking her with its uneven swell.

Amara’s cubicle, affectionately dubbed "The Adobe Oasis" by her coworkers (though she suspected the affection was laced with pity), was a meticulously curated space. Prints of Saul Bass movie posters adorned one wall, a vibrant splash of mid-century modern amidst the beige monotony of the 'Innovate Solutions' marketing department. Her desk was littered with Pantone swatches, half-empty mugs of lukewarm Earl Grey tea, and sketches scribbled on the backs of invoices. A small, defiant cactus, aptly named "Prickles," stood guard in the corner, a silent testament to her enduring (if occasionally prickly) personality.

Outside, the Seattle skyline was a hazy watercolor of steel and glass, shrouded in a perpetual mist that felt both romantic and stifling. She could almost taste the salty tang of the Puget Sound, a stark contrast to the stale air conditioning that circulated endlessly within the building.

Innovate Solutions, a mid-sized tech company specializing in cloud-based solutions for the agricultural industry (a far cry from the edgy music posters and album art she’d dreamt of designing in college), was not where Amara had envisioned her life at twenty-seven. But rent was rent, and the health insurance was surprisingly good. Still, days like this, when she was battling a rogue bezier curve and contemplating the existential dread of designing yet another infographic about soil nutrient analysis, she couldn’t help but wonder if Prickles might be the more exciting lifeform.
