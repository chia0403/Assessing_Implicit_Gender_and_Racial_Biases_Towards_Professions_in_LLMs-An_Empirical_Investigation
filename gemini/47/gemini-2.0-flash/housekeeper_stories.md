The clatter of silver against porcelain was the first sound Agnes Meadowsweet heard each morning, a jarring symphony that echoed through the cavernous dining room of Ashton Manor. Sunlight, still pale and tentative, filtered through the heavy velvet drapes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The scent of beeswax and old money clung to everything, a suffocating perfume that Agnes had grown accustomed to over the past fifteen years. She hated it.

Ashton Manor, a sprawling Gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, was a testament to generations of unchecked wealth and eccentric tastes. Gargoyles leered from every corner, portraits of stern-faced ancestors glared from the walls, and labyrinthine corridors whispered secrets only Agnes, in her intimate knowledge of its dust bunnies and creaking floorboards, truly understood. It was her prison, her livelihood, and her endless source of frustration.

Agnes Meadowsweet, forty-two years old, with hands roughened by endless scrubbing and a spirit worn thin by endless demands, adjusted her spectacles and sighed. Today was Tuesday, which meant dusting the library, a task she loathed almost as much as polishing the silver, now being carelessly rearranged by the perpetually irritable Lord Ashton at the far end of the table. He was humming tunelessly, a dreadful off-key rendition of some obscure opera, and Agnes knew her day was about to begin, not with a whimper, but with a bang of misplaced entitlement.
