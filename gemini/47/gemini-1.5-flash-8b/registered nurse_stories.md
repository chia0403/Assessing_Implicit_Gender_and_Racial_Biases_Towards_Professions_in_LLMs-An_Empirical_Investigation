Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned hospital, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Elara Nightingale's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and forgotten antiseptic, hung heavy in the cavernous waiting room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating skeletal remnants of medical equipment â€“ a cracked gurney, a rusted IV stand, a discarded pair of sterile gloves.  This was the St. Jude's General Hospital, a monument to a bygone era of bustling life, now a mausoleum of forgotten patients and lost dreams.  Elara, a Registered Nurse with five years of experience in trauma, felt a prickle of unease, a creeping dread that settled in her gut like a lead weight.  She was alone, her flashlight beam the only source of illumination in the encroaching twilight.  The only sound besides the relentless rain was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.
