The fluorescent lights of the data center hummed, a relentless, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's tired bones.  Rows upon rows of server racks, shimmering with arcane circuitry, stretched into the inky blackness of the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of her flashlight, highlighting the intricate patterns etched onto the cooling fans. Amelia, a systems analyst for GlobalCorp's meticulously guarded Quantum Computing division, adjusted the straps of her safety harness, the cold metal digging into her shoulders.  This wasn't her typical Tuesday evening.  Normally, she was hunched over spreadsheets, charting the performance of algorithms, not battling rogue code in the heart of the data complex.  But something – something *off* – had triggered the system's emergency protocols.  A whisper of an anomaly, a glitch in the matrix, a ripple in the fabric of the quantum network itself, had sent the entire system spiraling into a chaotic, uncharted territory.  The air crackled with unspoken anxieties, a tangible tension palpable even over the insistent drone of the cooling systems.
