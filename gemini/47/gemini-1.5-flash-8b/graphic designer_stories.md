The fluorescent hum of the design studio, a symphony of whirring fans and the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards, was a familiar lullaby to Amelia "Em" Cartwright.  Her workspace, a corner booth crammed with half-finished projects, overflowing sketchbooks, and a perpetually overflowing mug of lukewarm chamomile tea, was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her creative nexus.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windows of the century-old building, cast long shadows across the room, illuminating the intricate digital designs on her monitor: a vibrant logo for a sustainable clothing line, a playful poster for a local theatre production, a complex infographic for a groundbreaking scientific study.  Em, a graphic designer with a flair for the absurd and an eye for the elegant, thrived on this chaotic energy.  Today, however, the usual buzz felt strangely muted.  Outside, the city, usually a cacophony of horns and sirens, was eerily quiet, the only sound the rhythmic drip of water from a leaky pipe in the forgotten corner of the building.
