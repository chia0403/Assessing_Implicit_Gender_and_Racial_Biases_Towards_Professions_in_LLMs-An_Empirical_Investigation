The flickering neon sign of the "Midnight Moon Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Zenith City.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic beat of Amelia "Amy"  Stone's heart.  Amy, a rising star in the independent film world,  was perched precariously on a stool, a half-eaten burger cooling beside her.  Her film, "The Obsidian Heart," a gothic drama about a reclusive artist trapped in a decaying mansion, was slated to premiere in just three days. Yet,  her mind was a whirlwind of anxieties.  A crucial scene, the one depicting the climactic confrontation between the protagonist and the antagonist, remained unresolved. And not only unresolved, but utterly unfilmable. The actor portraying the antagonist had vanished without a trace, leaving Amy stranded in the middle of a shadowy, burgeoning urban sprawl.


Zenith City, a sprawling metropolis carved from the jagged edges of the Appalachian foothills, was a place of contradictions.  Towering skyscrapers pierced a perpetually overcast sky, their glass facades reflecting the city's turbulent heart.  Beneath them, alleyways choked with graffiti and whispered secrets snaked through a labyrinth of dimly lit storefronts and forgotten plazas.  The air hummed with a low, uneasy energy, a constant thrumming that seemed to vibrate through the very bones of the city.  The Midnight Moon Diner, a greasy spoon tucked away on a side street, was a microcosm of this disquiet, its patrons a disparate collection of artists, hustlers, and dreamers.  Each carried their own burdens, their own whispers of ambition and despair.  Amy felt inextricably linked to this city's pulse, its anxieties mirroring her own.
