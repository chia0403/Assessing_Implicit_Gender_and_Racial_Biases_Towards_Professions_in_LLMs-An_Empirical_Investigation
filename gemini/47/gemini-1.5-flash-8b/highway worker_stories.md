The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Montana plains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the loose gravel in the bed of his pickup truck.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling like miniature tornadoes, each one a testament to the unforgiving landscape.  He’d been on this stretch of I-90, the endless ribbon of asphalt snaking its way through the heart of nowhere, for almost three weeks now.  The highway, a grey scar across the brown, seemed to stretch into infinity, mirroring the endless monotony of his life.

The nearest town, a collection of faded storefronts and weathered houses clinging to a riverbank, was a full two hours away, and the silence of the high plains, punctuated only by the rhythmic groan of his truck's engine and the wind’s mournful howl, was both comforting and isolating.
