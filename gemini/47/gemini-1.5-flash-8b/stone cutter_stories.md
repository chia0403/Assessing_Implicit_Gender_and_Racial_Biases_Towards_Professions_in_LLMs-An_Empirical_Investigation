The biting wind whipped across the exposed hillside, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks as she surveyed the quarry.  Granite, a coarse, grey-veined beast, clawed at the sky, its sharp edges mirroring the jagged lines etched across her face.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, barely pierced the swirling mist, illuminating only the intricate carvings already chipped from the mountain's flankâ€”the swirling patterns of dragons, the defiant posture of a forgotten king.  Elara, her calloused hands gripping the worn shaft of her pickaxe, felt the familiar tremor of anticipation, a low thrumming in her chest like the rumble of distant thunder.  This quarry, nestled high in the desolate peaks of the Obsidian Mountains, was more than just a place of work; it was a testament to generations of stone-carvers, a whispered history etched into the very heart of the mountain itself.  Her family, her lineage, were woven into this stone, a legacy she carried within her calloused hands. Today, a new commission awaited.  A commission for a new statue, one that promised both challenge and a profound measure of responsibility.  The ancient stone whispered secrets in the wind, secrets she felt she was meant to understand.
