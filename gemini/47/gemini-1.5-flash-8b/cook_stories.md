The chipped enamel of the sink, a pale, sickly yellow, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia Josephine "Amy" Butterfield's head.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light, illuminating the swirling vortex of flour, pepper, and the faintest hint of rosemary that clung to the air in the cramped kitchen.  The scent, usually comforting, tonight felt oppressive, like a suffocating shroud.  Outside, the biting wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, a mournful symphony echoing the disquiet in Amy's heart.
