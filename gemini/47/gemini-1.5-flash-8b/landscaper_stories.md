The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the garden.  The once vibrant roses, now tattered and frost-bitten, resembled a graveyard's macabre floral tributes.  Frost clung to the sculpted topiary, transforming the meticulously manicured hedges into icy, alien forms.  This was the aftermath of a particularly brutal winter, and Em, owner and sole operator of Hawthorne's Green Thumbs, was facing a daunting task: resurrecting the spring.  Her weathered hands, calloused from years of tending to the most exquisite and the most unruly of gardens, tightened around the chipped handle of her trowel.

The setting was the quaint, yet unforgiving, village of Alderbrook nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains.  Alderbrook, a place where the seasons manifested with brutal intensity, was famous for its breathtaking mountain views in summer, but also for the relentless winters that bit deep into the landscape.  The village itself, with its cobbled streets and steeply pitched roofs, clung to the mountainside like a stubborn vine.  Homes, with gardens carefully tucked into every available space, were a testament to the struggle against the unforgiving elements, and the village's inhabitants, hard-working and resourceful, were accustomed to the unpredictable and dramatic changes of their environment.
