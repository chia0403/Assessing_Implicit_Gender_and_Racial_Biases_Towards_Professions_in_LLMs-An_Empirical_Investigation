The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarlet coat around her legs as she surveyed the desolate expanse of the Whispering Woods.  A thin layer of frost coated the ancient, gnarled oaks, mirroring the icy grip tightening around her heart.  It was the middle of winter, the worst time of year for the animals at the Sanctuary of the Wild, and Amelia, Keeper of the Creatures, felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on her like the snowdrifts piling high against the stone walls of the enclosure.  This year, the winter had arrived with a ferocity unlike any she'd witnessed before.  The rhythmic crunch of her boots on the frozen ground was the only sound besides the mournful howl of a lone wolf echoing from the far side of the forest.  

The Sanctuary of the Wild, nestled deep within the Whispering Woods, was a sprawling complex of stone buildings and meticulously maintained enclosures.  Each enclosure, designed to replicate the natural habitats of the various creatures, held its own unique beauty, but today, even the vibrant colours of the hummingbird aviary seemed muted by the grey landscape.  Amelia knew the animals were suffering. The dwindling supplies of berries and nuts, the dwindling sunlight, the increasingly bitter air â€“ all contributed to a profound melancholy that permeated the air.  She carried a heavy thermos of spiced herbal tea, a concoction she'd concocted to help bolster the weakened creatures, and a small basket containing a few choice morsels of high-energy food that she had carefully rationed.  This was not just a job; it was a life, a commitment to the fragile balance of nature, a responsibility she took on with grim determination.
