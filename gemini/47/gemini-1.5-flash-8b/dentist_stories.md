The fluorescent hum of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, a symphony of sterile white and muted grey, was strangely soothing.  It always was, this quiet hum that punctuated the rhythmic click-clack of her dental tools.  Today, however, the hum felt amplified, a constant, low thrumming beneath the surface of the otherwise predictable afternoon.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy cityscape outside the tenth-floor window of the  "Apex Dental" building, cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the gleaming surfaces of her pristine examination room.  This was a routine checkup, nothing out of the ordinary.  Except for the patient.  

Eleanorâ€™s patient was a nervous man, a Mr. Arthur Finch, a retired accountant with eyes that held a lifetime of meticulously kept ledgers and secrets.  His face, usually composed and slightly stern, was a mask of apprehension, etched with lines that spoke not just of age but of something deeper, something hidden within the quiet formality of his meticulous life.
