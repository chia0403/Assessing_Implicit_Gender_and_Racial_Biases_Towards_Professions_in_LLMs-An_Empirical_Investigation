The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy pellets.  The clinic, nestled precariously on the side of Mount Aethelred, clung to the mountain like a desperate vine.  Its weathered wood siding, once a rich mahogany, was now a mottled grey, perpetually dusted with the fine ash that drifted down from the ancient, gnarled pines surrounding it.  Rusty iron hinges groaned in protest as Amelia pushed open the heavy oak door, the metallic clang echoing eerily in the cavernous waiting room.  Inside, a single lamp cast long shadows over the worn, leather-covered benches, each occupied by a patient – or, more accurately, by a patient’s anxious owner.  A scruffy terrier whimpered from a corner, its fur matted and ragged. A sleek, black cat, eyes narrowed in suspicion, stalked a particularly plump, and obviously stressed, guinea pig. The air was thick with the familiar scents of antiseptic, fear, and the almost cloying sweetness of hay.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Blackwood, veterinarian, inhaled deeply, bracing herself for another long day of mending broken bones, treating infected wounds, and, most frequently, soothing the fears of worried humans and their equally worried animal companions.
