The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful dirge, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Sparky"  Kingston's boots on the cracked concrete floor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light slicing through the gloom, illuminating the tangled mess of wires and rusted machinery that was the heart of the place.

This wasn't Sparky's first foray into the abandoned structures of the city, not by a long shot.  These forgotten corners held their own peculiar charmâ€”a silent promise of hidden secrets, waiting to be unearthed by the right hand, and the right tools. Tonight, though, felt different. A sense of unease, a prickling at the back of her neck, clung to her like the caked-on soot. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her boots had a heavier, more anxious beat.
