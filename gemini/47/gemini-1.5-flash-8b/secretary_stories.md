The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone accounting firm hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Paper, in shades of beige and off-white, piled like miniature mountains on her desk.  Filing cabinets, groaning under the weight of years of financial records, lined the walls, their metal surfaces reflecting the sterile, almost clinical, atmosphere of the office.  It was a Tuesday, a day like any other, except that a particularly thick envelope, addressed in elegant script to Ms. Blackwood, lay atop the chaos on her desk.  Inside, nestled amongst crisp parchment and embossed letterheads, was a single, handwritten note, its elegant calligraphy a stark contrast to the impersonal beige.  It read simply: "The Gardener awaits."
