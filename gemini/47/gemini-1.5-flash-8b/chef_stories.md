The biting wind whipped across the cobblestone streets of Paris, rattling the windows of Le Petit Bouchon, a tiny bistro tucked away on a narrow alley off the Rue Mouffetard.  Rain, cold and relentless, hammered against the corrugated iron awning, mirroring the storm brewing within young chef Antoine Dubois.

Antoine, a man of twenty-seven with perpetually tired eyes and hands calloused from years of knife work, was already late, as was his habit.  Not only was his sous-chef, a boisterous young man named Jean-Luc, missing, but the evening rush was upon themâ€”and a particularly demanding table of six had booked, precisely at 7:00 p.m.  Tonight, he had to be perfect.
