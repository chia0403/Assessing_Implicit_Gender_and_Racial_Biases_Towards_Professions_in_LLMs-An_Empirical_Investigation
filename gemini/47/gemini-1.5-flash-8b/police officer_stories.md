Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct station, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of Sergeant Amelia "Amy" Carter's own heart.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the grimy counter, highlighting the smudged fingerprints and the half-eaten takeout containers scattered across the surface.  The air, thick with the smells of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy and damp.  This was the sleepy, backwater town of Havenwood, a place where the only excitement usually came from the annual pumpkin festival and the predictable squabbles between the town's two feuding families. But tonight, Havenwood was holding its breath, a palpable tension hanging in the humid air like a shroud.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the storm brewing in Amy's gut.  She traced the faded name tag on her uniform â€“ a stark contrast to the chaos around her.  Her name, simple and unassuming, stood stark against the backdrop of a night that promised anything but quiet.
