The acrid smell of burnt plastic and ozone clung to Captain Amelia "Amy"  Rivera like a shroud.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the steel-reinforced roof of the abandoned warehouse, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The flickering emergency lights painted grotesque shadows on the jagged edges of the broken windows, highlighting the swirling debris of what had once been a bustling fabric workshop.  Amy, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the heavy thermal gear, the weight familiar but never truly comforting.  Thirteen firefighters, their faces grim, lined the perimeter of the collapsing structure.  They were the remnants of a valiant effort, an echo of a fire that roared, not just through the building, but through the quiet, grey New England town of Havenwood.  This wasn't just another fire. This was personal.
