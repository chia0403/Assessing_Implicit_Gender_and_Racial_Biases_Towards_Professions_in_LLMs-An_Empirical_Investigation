The flickering fluorescent lights of "Rusty Wrench Repair" cast long, oily shadows across the cluttered workshop.  Grease, grime, and the faint, metallic tang of exhaust hung heavy in the air.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, a petite woman with calloused hands and a determined glint in her eye, wrestled with a stubborn engine block, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Thick, dark hair, usually pulled back in a braid, was now escaping its confines, strands clinging to sweat-slicked skin.  The rhythmic whir of the air compressor and the occasional clang of a dropped wrench were the only sounds besides the frustrated grumbling that escaped Amy's lips. Outside, the relentless midday sun beat down on the dusty, sun-baked asphalt of the small, forgotten corner of the city, a stark contrast to the cool, oily interior of the shop.  The shop itself was a testament to years of accumulated work, parts, and tools, a testament to a life dedicated to metal and mechanics.  Boxes of assorted nuts and bolts, stacks of manuals, and discarded engine parts littered the workshop, a chaotic symphony of metal and grease.
