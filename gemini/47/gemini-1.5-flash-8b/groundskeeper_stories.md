The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the chipped paint of the caretaker's shed.  A lone figure,  Elias Thorne,  hunched against the chill, his weathered hands gloved in thick leather, meticulously pruned the last of the frost-bitten ivy clinging to the crumbling stone wall surrounding the Whispering Woods.  Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight, painting fleeting patterns on the already-muted autumnal colours.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar perfume to Elias, a symphony of the season's end.

Elias worked for Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate steeped in history, its overgrown gardens a testament to years of neglect, now his sanctuary.  He was the groundskeeper, the silent guardian of this place, his days a careful dance between the decaying grandeur of the house and the untamed wildness of the woods.  His small, detached cottage nestled close to the back of the manor, its paint peeling like the forgotten frescoes within the house.  A network of winding, overgrown paths snaked through the property, leading to hidden grottoes and ancient, moss-covered stone benches. The sheer scale of the place, once a vibrant display of horticultural prowess, had been slowly swallowed by the forest, its overgrown beauty now a fragile, almost ethereal landscape.  Elias knew every nook and cranny, every whispering breeze that rustled through the ancient trees, every secret the overgrown gardens held.  His days were measured by the changing light and the murmur of the wind, but this particular November day held an unsettling silence.
