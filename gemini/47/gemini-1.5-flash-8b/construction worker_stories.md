The biting November wind whipped across the exposed steel skeleton of the skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's face and rattling the scaffolding around him.  Twenty stories up, the city sprawled below, a chaotic tapestry of lights and shadows.  A thick layer of smog hung over the industrial district, obscuring the distant skyline and giving the scene a perpetual twilight gloom. Elias, a seasoned construction worker with calloused hands and eyes that held the weary wisdom of countless nights under the unforgiving sky, surveyed the scene.  He was the lead rigger for the new "Apex Tower," a project slated for completion just as the first snowflakes of winter were expected.  His foreman, a gruff man named Gus, had been harping all morning about meeting the deadline. The deadline that felt more like a looming threat than a target.  Beneath the skeletal frame, the city's symphony of sirens and distant car horns blended with the rhythmic clang of metal against metal as the remaining crews worked in the fading light.  Elias knew this deadline was going to test him in a way no other project had before. This project had a history, whispers of it carried on the wind.
