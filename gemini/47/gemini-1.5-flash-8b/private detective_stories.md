Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated garage, a relentless drumming that mirrored the insistent pounding in Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's temples.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and stale beer, clung to her like a second skin.  The small, cluttered office, crammed with half-eaten takeout containers, overflowing files, and chipped furniture, was her sanctuaryâ€”and her prison.  Her crumpled trench coat, a familiar battlefield souvenir, lay draped over a stool.  Ash, all sharp angles and shadowed eyes, traced a finger along a faded photograph tucked under a stack of case files. It was a picture of a young woman, her smile radiating warmth, a stark contrast to the chilling emptiness Ash now felt.  

**Setting:**  The gritty underbelly of the industrial district of Alderwood, a sprawling, neglected area on the outskirts of a sprawling, neglected metropolis.  Rust-eaten factories choked the sky with smoky plumes, while abandoned warehouses whispered tales of forgotten dreams.  A ceaseless symphony of sirens and the rumble of heavy machinery punctuated the ceaseless downpour.   Alderwood, a place where shadows stretched long and secrets festered in the humid air, was Ash's personal battlefield, and tonight, the rain was her ally.
