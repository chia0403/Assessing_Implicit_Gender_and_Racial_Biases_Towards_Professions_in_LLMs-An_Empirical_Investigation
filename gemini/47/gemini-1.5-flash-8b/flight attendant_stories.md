The humid air hung thick and heavy in the cabin, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Hernandez like a second skin.  Outside, the sun beat down on the tarmac of the São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, a shimmering, almost blinding, expanse of concrete.  Amy, her uniform a crisp, navy blue, meticulously pressed and yet already feeling the strain of the heat, surveyed the rows of packed passengers.  Their faces, a kaleidoscope of expressions – weary businessmen, giggling children, families on holiday, the perpetually stressed.  Her job was to navigate this chaotic human cargo, keeping them safe and comfortable from take-off to landing, a fragile bridge between the confined space of the metal bird and the diverse cultures and destinations it traversed.  Today's flight, a direct route to New York City, felt particularly charged, not just from the sweltering heat but from a palpable tension in the air that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of the plane itself.  A nagging feeling of unease settled in her gut, a feeling as persistent and suffocating as the humidity itself.
