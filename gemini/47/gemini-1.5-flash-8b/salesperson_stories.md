The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Everything You Want" mega-store hummed, a constant, irritating drone that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's life.  She was a salesperson, a cog in the vast machine of consumerism, and today, like every other Tuesday, she was stationed in the "Home Organization" aisle.  Dust motes danced in the artificial sunlight, illuminating rows of brightly coloured storage bins, organizers, and decorative boxes.  Behind the pristine, slightly sterile display, Amy felt a familiar thrum of anxiety.  The quiet hum of the store, normally a comforting soundtrack to her routine, felt like a pressure cooker today.  It was the day of the quarterly sales competition, and Amy's numbers were, frankly, abysmal.

The setting:  A sprawling, cavernous retail megastore in the suburbs of Oakhaven, a city renowned for its manicured lawns and meticulously planned lives.  The "Everything You Need, Everything You Want" store, a behemoth of fluorescent lights and polished surfaces, was the epicentre of this consumerist utopia. It was a place where hopes and dreams were packaged in cardboard boxes and aspirations were neatly sorted into designated aisles.  Amy, small and perpetually hunched against the weight of her responsibilities, felt like a misplaced item in this precisely ordered world.
