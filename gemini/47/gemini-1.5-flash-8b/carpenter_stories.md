The biting November wind whipped at the eaves of Elias Thornewood's workshop, rattling the weathered, oak-framed windows.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating swirling patterns of sawdust on the floor and highlighting the intricate grain of the half-finished chest resting against a workbench overflowing with tools.  Elias, a carpenter of considerable renown in the small, isolated village of Oakhaven, hunched over the wood, his calloused fingers tracing the delicate curve of a carved floral design.  His brow, furrowed with concentration, mirrored the intricate patterns he was shaping.  Oakhaven, nestled deep within the whispering pines and ancient, moss-draped forests, was a place where time seemed to slow, where the rhythm of the seasons dictated the pace of life, and where the quiet hum of the forest often held a conversation more captivating than any human voice.  This was Elias's sanctuary, his domain, his workshop a small, slightly crooked cottage nestled amongst the broader structures of the village, where the scent of pine and sawdust often mingled with the sweet tang of apples ripening in the orchard beyond.
