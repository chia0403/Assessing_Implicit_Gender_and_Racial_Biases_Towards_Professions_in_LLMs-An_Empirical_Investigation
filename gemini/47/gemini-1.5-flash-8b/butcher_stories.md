The biting wind whipped through the cobbled alleyways of Old Oak, stinging Elara Blackwood's cheeks.  Sleet hammered against the corrugated iron roof of her father's butcher shop, a rhythmic tattoo that punctuated the clank of steel on steel and the low growl of a sputtering gas lamp.  The scent of blood, always present in the shop, seemed somehow amplified in the icy air, a pungent mixture of iron and damp earth.  Elara, clad in a thick wool apron that offered little protection from the chill, hunched over the gleaming steel cutting board, her breath misting in the frigid air.  Her father, a wiry man with calloused hands and a hawk-like gaze, stood at the counter, a stack of freshly butchered hams resting on a crimson-stained wooden plank, silently assessing the quality of his latest harvest. The shop, a relic of a bygone era, was crammed with the raw materials of life â€“ the glistening red of beef, the pale ivory of pork, the rich mahogany of venison.  A lone flickering candle on the counter cast long shadows across the room, highlighting the rows of gleaming knives, each one a testament to the precise craft of generations of Blackwoods.  This was not just a shop, it was a testament to Elara's family's legacy.
