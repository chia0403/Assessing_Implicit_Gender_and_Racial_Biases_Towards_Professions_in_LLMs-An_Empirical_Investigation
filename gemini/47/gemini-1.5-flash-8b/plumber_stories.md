The flickering neon sign of "Mr. Fix-It Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alleyway.  Water, a constant companion in this part of the city, dripped from the eaves, mirroring the steady drip-drip-drip of a leaky pipe somewhere within the dilapidated brick building opposite.  Inside,  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with a perpetually surprised expression and a mop of unruly brown hair, knelt beside a particularly stubborn clog.  He surveyed the plumbing nightmare before him: a tangled mess of rusted pipes, overflowing traps, and the disconcerting smell of something vaguely floral and distinctly unpleasant.  Barty, whose years of experience had taught him to appreciate the subtle artistry of plumbing, sighed.  This wasn't just a clogged drain; it was a symphony of plumbing woes, an intricate dance of decay.


Setting: The rain-soaked, dimly lit alleyways and backstreets of the sprawling industrial district of Newhaven.  The juxtaposition of the decaying brick buildings and the occasional gleaming skyscraper hinted at the city's contradictory nature, a place where poverty and prosperity existed cheek-by-jowl.
