The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the ornate lobby of the Grand Imperial Hotel.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering bulb above the mahogany desk, swirled in the still air.  Rain hammered against the leaded-glass windows, a relentless percussion echoing the frantic thumping of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield’s heart.  Barty, a bellhop at the Grand Imperial for the past three years, was undeniably nervous. Tonight, a most important guest, Lord Ashworth, was scheduled to arrive.  Lord Ashworth, reputedly the wealthiest man in the Midlands, and rumored to be accompanied by a dazzling array of jewels and even more dazzling social connections.

Barty, a small man with a surprisingly large pair of hands, adjusted the brass cufflinks on his starched white shirt.  He had polished the mahogany floor, dusted the ornate bronze sconces, and even meticulously straightened the velvet ribbons on the potted palms, several times over.  The task, it seemed, was never done. The sheer weight of expectation pressed down on him like the heavy velvet drapes drawn across the grand windows.

The Grand Imperial was a labyrinth of opulent rooms and echoing hallways, a testament to a bygone era of grandeur.  From the gleaming marble foyer to the sprawling gardens hidden behind the hotel, the air crackled with the promise of untold stories, whispered secrets, and of course, the potential for utter disaster. The scent of old leather, aged wood, and exotic spices hung in the heavy night air.  Barty knew that the most important task of all was to ensure that Lord Ashworth’s stay was perfect, or at least, as perfect as the Grand Imperial could manage.
