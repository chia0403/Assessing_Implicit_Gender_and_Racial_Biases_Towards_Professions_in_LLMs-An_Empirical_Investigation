The chipped paint of the chalkboard, a faded robin's egg blue, reflected the fluorescent hum of the classroom.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpane.  Amelia Katherine Blackwood, history teacher at the perpetually-underfunded Northwood High, sighed, running a hand through her already-messy auburn hair.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of fifteen pairs of restless feet echoed against the cracked linoleum floor, a soundtrack to the impending chaos.  Today's lesson: the French Revolution.  A topic Amelia found deeply fascinating, yet inexplicably struggled to translate into anything approaching student engagement.  The room, usually a battlefield of whispered arguments and aggressive doodling, was surprisingly quiet now, a hush before the storm.  And Amelia, despite the years of experience, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just another day at Northwood.  Today, something felt different, heavy in the air like the scent of impending rain.
