Her client, the reclusive Lord Ashworth, insisted the whispers emanating from the estate's derelict ruins were more than mere folklore.  Amelia, determined to prove otherwise, pressed on, her footsteps echoing eerily in the silent lane, her breath clouding in the frigid air.  The crumbling stonework of the estate loomed ahead, a brooding silhouette against the bruised sky.
