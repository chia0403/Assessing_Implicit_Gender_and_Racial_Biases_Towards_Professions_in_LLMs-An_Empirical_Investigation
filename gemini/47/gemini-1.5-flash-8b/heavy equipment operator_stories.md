The wind, a relentless, howling banshee, whipped across the desolate expanse of the Arizona desert.  Dust devils danced like spectral imps, swirling around the rusted hulks of abandoned mining equipment.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised sky, beat down on Amelia "Dusty"  Dustbowl, a heavy equipment operator with arms like forged iron and eyes that held the unforgiving gaze of the desert itself.  She hunched over the joystick, her calloused hands gripping it like a lifeline.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and burnt metal, tasted gritty in her mouth.  Around her, the landscape stretched out for miles, a sea of ochre and shadow, broken only by the jagged silhouettes of mountains. This was the abandoned Copper Canyon, a forgotten relic of a bygone era, a place where time itself seemed to have lost its rhythm.  The only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the Caterpillar 990G's hydraulics, a counterpoint to the symphony of desolation.  Her mission: to clear a path through the treacherous debris field.
