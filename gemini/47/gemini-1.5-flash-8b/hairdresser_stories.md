The chipped Formica counter gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of "Scissors & Smiles," a salon more accustomed to the scent of cheap hairspray than the perfume of expensive clientele.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faint rainbow pattern on the chipped paint.  This was the domain of  Anya Petrova, a young hairdresser with eyes the colour of burnt umber and a heart full of quiet dreams.  The rhythmic snip-snip of shears mingled with the muted chatter of clients, a symphony of everyday life that Anya had come to both love and endure. Today, the chatter was particularly low-key.  The salon's usual Thursday afternoon bustle was absent, replaced by a palpable stillness, a strange calm before the storm.
