The flickering neon sign of "Zenith Spa" cast a lurid, emerald glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderwood Lane.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic thrum of Amelia Nightingale's hands as she kneaded the tense muscles of a client.

Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of sandalwood and jasmine, a stark contrast to the grey gloom of the alleyway just beyond the front door.  Tonight's client, a nervous man in a tailored suit with a face etched with lines of worry, fidgeted under her touch.  Amelia, her focus razor sharp, sensed the knot of anxiety that coiled in his upper back, a familiar adversary in her profession. The faint metallic tang of fear mingled with the sweet aroma of lavender and rose in the air.
