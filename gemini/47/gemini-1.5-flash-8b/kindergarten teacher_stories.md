The chipped paint of the "Imagination Station" kindergarten classroom, a faded, lavender hue, seemed to whisper secrets to Elara Nightingale.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a scene of chaos-controlled chaos.  Crayon shavings carpeted the floor, a testament to the creativity unleashed by twenty-four little hands.  Elara, a kindergarten teacher with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that could melt glaciers, surveyed her charges.  Liam, with his meticulously constructed castle of blocks; Maya, lost in a world of painted rainbows;  and Samuel, attempting to negotiate a truce between a stuffed giraffe and a plastic dinosaur.  It was a symphony of noise and colour, a cacophony of learning.  This particular Tuesday afternoon, however, held an undercurrent of something more than the usual exuberance.
