The grey Manchester sky, perpetually shrouded in a damp mist, mirrored the mood of  Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield.  Rain, a relentless, insistent percussion against the corrugated iron of the terraced houses, hammered a rhythm that echoed the rhythmic creak of Barty's weary bones.  He perched precariously on a narrow rooftop, the biting wind tugging at his worn leather jacket and the greasy rainwater sliding down his arms, numb and cold against his skin.  Below, the cobbled streets of the Hulme district, slick with the relentless downpour, stretched out like a patchwork quilt in a muted sepia tone.  Barty, a roofer of twenty-five years, had seen his fair share of Manchester's storms, but this one felt different. This one felt heavy, not just with water, but with a sense of impending somethingâ€¦ something he couldn't quite name, yet felt in the very marrow of his bones.
