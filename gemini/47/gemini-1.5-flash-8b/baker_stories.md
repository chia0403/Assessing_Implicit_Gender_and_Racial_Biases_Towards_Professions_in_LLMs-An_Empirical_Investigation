The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the bakery's facade like a second skin.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heartbeat.  Amelia Blackwood, proprietress of "The Crusty Crumb," a tiny bakery nestled between a dilapidated bookstore and a perpetually-crowded hardware store, knew this was going to be a bad day.  Not just a bad day for sales, a bad day for her temper, or a bad day for the dwindling supply of her prized rye flour, but a *really* bad day.  The persistent drip, drip, drip of the leaky gutter above the back counter was a constant reminder of the mounting pressure.  The old bakery, a relic of a bygone era, was, in Amelia's opinion, about to crumble right along with her spirits.

The setting was the small, rain-soaked town of Oakhaven, a place where time seemed to have paused a century ago.  Victorian-era architecture, worn but still proud, lined the narrow cobblestone streets.  The only hint of modern life was the occasional flash of a cell phone screen reflecting off a shop window, swallowed whole by the gloom of a perpetually overcast sky.  The bakery itself was a testament to the town's history.  Its high, arched windows, now streaked with rain, framed an interior filled with the familiar scent of yeast and warm flour, a stark contrast to the dampness outside.  Inside, the counter glistened with moisture, mirroring the melancholy settling over Amelia.
