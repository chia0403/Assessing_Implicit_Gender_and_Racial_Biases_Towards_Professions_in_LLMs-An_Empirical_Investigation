The fluorescent lights of the brokerage hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic thrumming that accompanied Elias Thorne's every breath.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the cavernous trading floor.  Rows upon rows of traders, their faces etched with the anxieties of the market, hunched over their terminals.  Elias, however, felt a disconcerting calm.  He stared at the rapidly shifting numbers on his screen, his fingers poised over the keyboard, ready to pounce on any fleeting opportunity.  He was a stockbroker, a seasoned wolf in this den of sharks, but tonight, the whispers in the air felt different.  They weren't just the usual anxieties of a volatile market; they were... foreboding.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of sirens and car horns, but inside the trading floor, a hushed anticipation, almost palpable, hung in the air.  Tonight, something was about to change.  The year was 2024.
