Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Dr. Anya Petrova's thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp earth, hung heavy in the small, cluttered examination room.  Anya, a registered dietician with a passion for restoring health, stared at the chart in her hand.  Amelia Hernandez, a 22-year-old with eyes the color of stormy seas and a frame ravaged by years of disordered eating, sat hunched in a worn vinyl chair, her face pale and drawn.  This wasn't just about weight; this was about a battle raging within, a war Anya had witnessed too many times in this cramped, low-ceilinged clinic in the heart of the impoverished South Bronx.  The city's relentless pulse hammered outside, a constant reminder of the struggle for survival that often masked the deeper battles fought within.  The peeling paint of the walls seemed to mirror Amelia's own fragility, a reflection of the relentless societal pressures she grappled with.  Anya felt the familiar knot of responsibility tighten in her stomach.  This was more than just food; it was about hope.
