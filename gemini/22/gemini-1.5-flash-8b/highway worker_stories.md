The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt, turning Silas Blackwoodâ€™s hard hat into a miniature furnace.  Dust, kicked up by the passing semi-trucks, coated everything in a fine, gritty film.  He squinted at the mile-long stretch of highway, the familiar ribbon of black and yellow now marred by a fresh, ugly gash, a gaping chasm where a section of the road had buckled under the relentless summer heat.  Silas, a seasoned highway maintenance worker with calloused hands and eyes that saw the secrets hidden beneath the surface of the asphalt, knew this was going to be a long day.

The setting was the desolate expanse of the Arizona desert.  Mile after mile of scrub brush and cacti stretched out as far as the eye could see.  The only sounds besides the rhythmic clang of Silas's tools were the distant rumble of passing vehicles and the incessant buzzing of the desert insects.  The highway itself, Interstate 8, was a crucial artery snaking its way through the parched landscape.  Small, dust-choked towns with weathered gas stations and tired-looking motels dotted the horizon, offering little respite from the vastness of the desert.  Silas's small crew was stationed in a dilapidated, shade-less shed, their only companions the relentless desert sun and the relentless hum of mechanical repairs.
