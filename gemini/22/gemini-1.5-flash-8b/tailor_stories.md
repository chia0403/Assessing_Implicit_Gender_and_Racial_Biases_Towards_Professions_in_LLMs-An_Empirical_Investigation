The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thorne, Tailor of the Winding Way.  His workshop, tucked between a cobbled alley and the whispering eaves of the Greystone Towers, was a sanctuary of precise measurements and hushed whispers.

Dust motes, illuminated by the filtered light, floated like miniature specters in the quiet.
