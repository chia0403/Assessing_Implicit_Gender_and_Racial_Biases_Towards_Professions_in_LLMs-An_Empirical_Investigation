The fluorescent lights of the trading floor hummed a monotonous, almost aggressive, soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  High-pitched beeps punctuated the air, the rhythmic staccato of screens flashing with numbers that danced and swirled like a frenzied ballet.

His office, nestled in a corner of the cavernous trading room at the firm of Sterling & Thorne, was a testament to both his success and his isolation.  A small, worn leather chair, his only personal touch in the sterile environment, creaked softly beneath him.  Today, the Dow was plummeting.
