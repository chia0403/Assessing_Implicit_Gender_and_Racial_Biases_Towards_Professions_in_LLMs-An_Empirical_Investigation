The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's face as she wiped down the mahogany bar.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the chipped paint and faded floral wallpaper of the backroom.  The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation, hung heavy in the small, dimly lit tavern.  It was a Tuesday night, a night when the regulars tended to be the mostâ€¦interesting.  The Rusty Mug, tucked away on a side street in the forgotten heart of the city, was a sanctuary for the lost, the broken, and the desperately seeking. Sparrow, with her perpetually tired eyes and a weariness etched into the lines around her mouth, knew their stories intimately.  Tonight, however, held a particular quiet tension, a palpable stillness that even the usual drunken brawls seemed to have avoided.  The only sound was the rhythmic clink of ice against glass and the faint hum of the old refrigerator in the back.
