The biting wind, a constant, icy whisper through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, whipped at Elias Thorne's worn leather jacket.  He hunched lower against it, the scent of pine needles and damp earth clinging to his flannel shirt.  The sun, a pale, indifferent disc, cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-covered clearing.  This was the heart of the Boreal Forest, a place where the trees whispered secrets only the wind could hear, and where Elias, a seasoned logger known throughout the timber country as "Thorne the Steadfast," was king of his domain.  It was a domain shrinking, bit by agonizing, icy bit, with every felled tree, every acre claimed for lumber.

The clearing, once a vibrant tapestry of moss and wildflowers, now lay bare, a stark, white canvas punctuated by the ragged, jagged edges of freshly cut timber.  Logs, massive and raw, lay piled high like a mountain of fallen giants, awaiting the arrival of the sleds that would carry them to the mill.  The air, thick with the smell of pine sap and the metallic tang of freshly-hewn wood, carried the faint, chilling echo of the chainsaws, the relentless pulse of the forest's demise.  The surrounding woods, a sea of dark green and grey, pressed in on him, a silent, watchful presence.  A thin layer of ice coated the frozen creek that wound its way through the clearing, a ribbon of brittle, shimmering glass.  The only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic, steady chop of Elias's axe, a counterpoint to the forest's mournful sighs.
