The fluorescent hum of the emergency room vibrated through Amelia Hayes's bones, a constant, insistent thrumming that mirrored the erratic beat of the heart monitor she was watching.  The sterile, clinical white of the room felt suffocating, a stark contrast to the raw, chaotic energy swirling around her.  Outside, the relentless rain hammered against the hospital windows, a mournful counterpoint to the insistent beeping and hushed whispers of the medical staff. Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Jude’s General, felt the weight of the night settle upon her shoulders. Tonight, the city's pain was concentrated in this small, crowded space.

The setting was the bustling emergency room of St. Jude's General Hospital in the rain-slicked city of Alderwood.  The year was 2024.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.  Rows of beds filled with patients of all ages, their faces reflecting a spectrum of distress – from the pale, anxious fear of a young woman clutching a small child's hand, to the grim resignation etched on the face of an older man hooked up to machines.  The clatter of gurneys, the hushed voices of doctors conferring, the low thrum of the equipment; all contributed to a symphony of urgency that echoed Amelia's own racing pulse.
