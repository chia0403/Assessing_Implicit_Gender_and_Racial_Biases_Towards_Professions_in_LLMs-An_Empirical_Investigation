The city, a tapestry woven from towering skyscrapers that scraped the perpetual grey sky, and labyrinthine alleys like this one, pulsed with a hidden energy, a chaotic symphony of machinery and desperation.  Aethelgard was a place where fortunes were made and lost in the blink of a forgotten spark.  This particular night, the fate of a crucial radio transmission, and perhaps a life, hung precariously in the balance.
