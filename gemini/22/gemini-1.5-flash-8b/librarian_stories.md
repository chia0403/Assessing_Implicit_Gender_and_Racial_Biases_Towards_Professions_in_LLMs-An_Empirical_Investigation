The flickering fluorescent lights of the Ashton Library cast long, skeletal shadows across the towering bookshelves, each spine a silent testament to countless stories.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the worn leather of Amelia Blackwood's favourite armchair.  Amelia Blackwood, head librarian of the Ashton Library for the past twenty years, was a woman sculpted from quiet contemplation and the scent of old paper.  Her meticulous fingers, stained a faded sepia from years of handling antique manuscripts, traced the faded inscription on a weathered wooden desk calendar.  Today, the calendar read, 28th October, 1937.  A date that felt both impossibly distant and unnervingly close.  The library, a sanctuary of hushed whispers and whispered secrets, felt strangelyâ€¦heavy.
