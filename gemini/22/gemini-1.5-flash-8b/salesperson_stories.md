The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" retail emporium hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the relentless rhythm of Amelia Butterfield's day.  Empty coffee cups, chipped and stained, lined the edge of her desk, silent witnesses to countless sales pitches and frustrated sighs.  Amelia, a third-year salesperson in the Gadgets & Gizmos department, stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen, a miniature volcano of untapped potential threatening to erupt.  Today, another promising lead had fizzled, leaving her with the familiar pang of disappointment.  The department was a cacophony of beeping alarms, the clang of falling boxes, and the impatient shuffling of feet; a chaotic ballet where a perfect pitch often felt impossible to achieve.

The setting was the bustling, slightly overwhelming interior of Everything Under the Sun.  A vast warehouse-like space, crammed with shelves overflowing with gadgets and gizmos of every imaginable shape and size, dominated by a perpetual haze of dust motes dancing in the fluorescent light.  The air, thick with the scent of synthetic materials and discarded plastic, buzzed with the hum of unseen machinery.  Rows of identical, beige-walled aisles stretched into the distance, disappearing into the labyrinthine depths of the store.  The only color was provided by the vivid displays of the latest technology, flashing and whirring with a feverish energy, and the occasional splash of brightly colored packaging.  Each display was an elaborate, slightly manic performance of the product's potential, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation felt by Amelia behind her desk.
