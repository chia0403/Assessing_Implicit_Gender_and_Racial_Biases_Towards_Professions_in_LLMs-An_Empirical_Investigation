The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School guidance office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Sterling's daily anxieties.  Her meticulously organized, if slightly cluttered, desk reflected the chaos brewing just beyond the closed door of her office.  Posters advertising upcoming anti-bullying workshops, motivational quotes ripped from inspirational magazines, and a half-eaten bag of trail mix testified to a relentless schedule.

Almost time for the rush of students, parents, and teachers who all seemed to converge on her office at once, each with their own unique crises.  Northwood High, nestled amidst the sprawling suburbs of Oakhaven, was notorious for its seemingly disparate mix of privileged students and those grappling with issues few outsiders even suspected.  Today, however, the air in the office felt particularly thick.  A low, almost tangible tension hung in the air, a premonition of the storm that always seemed to gather force just before the final bell.
