The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s long, auburn hair across her face as she squinted through the lens of her battered Leica.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the Jornada del Muerto, a landscape so stark and desolate it seemed to swallow the sun whole.  The year was 1937.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sky and a spirit as fierce as the desert itself, was alone, miles from the nearest town, pursuing a fleeting moment of light and shadow that would capture the very soul of this forgotten place.  Her name, whispered on the wind, held a certain resonance, a hint of rebellion against the stifling conventions of a world determined to keep women in their place.  She was a photographer, an outsider, a seeker, and her camera was her confidante, her ally, her only companion in this vast, unforgiving wilderness.

The setting: The Jornada del Muerto, New Mexico, 1937.  A sun-baked expanse of ochre and grey, sculpted by relentless winds into bizarre rock formations.  Scattered mesquite trees, skeletal and barren, clawed at the sky.  A palpable silence hung heavy in the air, broken only by the whisper of the wind and the rhythmic clatter of Amelia’s camera gears.  The remoteness of the area was both a blessing and a curse; a sanctuary for her artistic vision but also a trap if things went wrong.  Near a crumbling adobe wall, the remnants of a forgotten homestead, lay the discarded remains of a life lost to the unforgiving desert.  These forgotten vestiges of human presence would become an integral part of Amelia's photographic narrative.
