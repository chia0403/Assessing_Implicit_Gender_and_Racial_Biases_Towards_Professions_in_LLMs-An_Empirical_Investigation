The biting wind whipped Amelia Greystone's auburn hair across her face as she adjusted the strap of her backpack.  The grey, perpetually overcast sky mirrored the muted colours of the abandoned fishing village nestled along the craggy coast.  Cobblestone streets, once bustling with the rhythmic clatter of fishing boats, were now choked with weeds and the skeletal remains of long-forgotten buildings.  Amelia, Physical Therapist extraordinaire, scanned the scene. This remote, wind-swept hamlet, known as Seabreeze, was far from the vibrant metropolis sheâ€™d left behind.  Yet, a persistent hum of possibility resonated in the silence.

The town's clinic, a single-storey building with a sign that sagged under the relentless onslaught of the elements, bore the faded name 'Seabreeze Wellness Centre.'  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of salt and something akin to despair.  Dusty examination tables lay abandoned in their recessed corners.  Only a small, flickering lamp over a cluttered desk hinted at any lingering life. Amelia, however, saw potential in the ruins. This was her mission: to bring back the vibrant pulse of Seabreeze, starting with its neglected inhabitants.
