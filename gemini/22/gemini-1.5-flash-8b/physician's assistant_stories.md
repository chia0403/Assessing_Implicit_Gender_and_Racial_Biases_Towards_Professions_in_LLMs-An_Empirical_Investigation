The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's lab coat around her as she hurried down the narrow, cobbled street.  The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows, highlighting the grime clinging to the buildings lining the narrow alleyways of Spitalfields, London, 1888.  A sickly sweet smell, a potent mixture of antiseptic and decaying fruit, hung heavy in the air.  Rain, a constant companion these past weeks, plastered the streets with a film of mud. This was not the pristine, well-lit district of the wealthy, but the shadowed heart of the city, a place where sickness festered and whispers of the unexplained spread like wildfire.  Amy, physician's assistant to Dr. Alistair Finch, pressed on, her boots crunching on refuse.  Tonight's call was particularly urgent. A series of strange, debilitating fevers were plaguing the residents of the tenements in the backstreets, and Dr. Finch, already stretched thin with a cholera outbreak in the East End, had asked Amy to assist with the initial assessments.  The silence of the night, broken only by the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the rain and the occasional groan of a nearby cart, felt almost oppressive. Amy gripped the heavy satchel slung over her shoulder, its contents—stethoscopes, thermometers, and vials of various potent concoctions—feeling oddly comforting in the face of the unknown.  The fate of these ailing souls rested, in part, on her young shoulders.
