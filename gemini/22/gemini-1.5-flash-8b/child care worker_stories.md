The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's workday.  Dust motes danced in the hazy afternoon light filtering through the grimy windows of the cramped, multi-colored playroom.  Crayon shavings littered the floor, a testament to the boundless creativity of the three- and four-year-olds currently engaged in a spirited (and slightly chaotic) construction project using cardboard boxes and pillows.  Amelia, a twenty-three-year-old with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that tried valiantly to be encouraging, surveyed the scene, her fingers tracing the faded pattern on the worn floral fabric of her apron.  Today felt especially fraught.  A persistent cough, accompanied by a low-grade fever, had plagued five-year-old Leo since the beginning of the week, and his mother's worried calls were echoing in Amelia's mind, alongside the incessant squeals of the children and the gentle, yet increasingly frantic, whispers of her colleagues.  The chipped paint of the daycare building, faded like the memories of past projects, seemed to mirror the fading hope in Amelia's heart.
