Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Ironclad Fitness" studio, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliamâ€™s chest.  The aroma of sweat-soaked workout gear and chlorine mingled with the scent of brewing storm, filling the small, cavernous space.  Sparky, a whirlwind of a woman with a perpetually wind-blown bob and eyes that glittered with an almost manic energy, was mid-demonstration of a burpee variation.  Her muscles rippled beneath the faded, athletic tank top as she propelled herself into the air, a spray of water arcing around her in the sudden downpour.

The setting was a small, unassuming fitness studio tucked away in the back alleys of a bustling, industrial city.  The building, once a forgotten warehouse, had been painstakingly transformed by Sparky's tireless energy into a haven of exercise equipment, posters of motivational quotes ripped from magazines, and mismatched mirrors that reflected a kaleidoscope of sweat-drenched determination.  Empty water bottles lay scattered like fallen soldiers amongst the makeshift workout stations; a testament to the countless hours poured into gruelling sessions and the echoes of shouts reverberating through the walls.  Outside, the city roared on, indifferent to the storm raging both inside and out.
