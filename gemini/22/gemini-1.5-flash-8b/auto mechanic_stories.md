The rhythmic clang of hammers against metal, the acrid smell of burnt oil, and the low rumble of engines â€“ it was the soundtrack to Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's life.  Jax Blackwood, proprietor of Blackwood's Automotive, a tiny, grease-stained workshop nestled between a dilapidated diner and a sprawling, overgrown junkyard, was a man of routine.  Sunrise found him wrestling with stubborn cylinder heads, midday with the incessant whine of a malfunctioning alternator, and sunset with the comforting sigh of a well-repaired engine.  Today, though, the routine was about to be shattered.

The setting was the forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a town clinging to its fading glory on the edge of the rust belt.  Brick buildings, once adorned with vibrant storefronts, now wore chipped paint and boarded-up windows.  A constant, biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the trees, carrying with it the whispers of the past and the scent of impending winter.  Oakhaven felt like a forgotten breath held captive between the burgeoning metropolis and the unforgiving wilderness. Blackwood's Automotive, tucked away on a street so quiet it seemed to hold its breath, was the heart of a quiet, mechanical rhythm in this otherwise forgotten part of the world.
