The rain hammered against the copper-leafed awning of the Grand Wyndham, a symphony of relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Eloise "Ellie" Nightingale's chest.  Ellie, concierge at the renowned luxury hotel perched atop the cliffs overlooking the churning grey Atlantic, stared out at the storm-lashed waves.  Each cresting wave seemed to mirror the tumultuous emotions churning within her. Tonight, a storm unlike any other was brewing. Not just a meteorological one, but one that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed fa√ßade of perfect tranquility the hotel so meticulously maintained.

The Grand Wyndham, a testament to gilded opulence, was a world apart.  High-ceilinged lobbies echoed with hushed whispers and the clinking of fine crystal.  Exquisitely manicured gardens, normally vibrant with colour, were now shrouded in a suffocating gloom.  The scent of salt and storm hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint perfume of lilies and the subtle, yet pervasive, aroma of aged mahogany.  The hotel, typically a sanctuary of polished sophistication, felt unexpectedly fragile under the relentless assault of the elements. Tonight, even the immaculate marble floors seemed to vibrate with the unspoken anxieties that coiled beneath the veneer of luxury.
