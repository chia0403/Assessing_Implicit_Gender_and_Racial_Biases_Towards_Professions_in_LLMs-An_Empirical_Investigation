The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow-brown in places, reflected the fluorescent hum of the office above.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of the Receptionist's Nook, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hawthorne's heart.  Amelia, 27, with perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually tangled braid, stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen.  Another rejection email.  Another client who'd decided to go with a "more established" firm.  Another dent in the already fragile optimism that had sustained her for the past six months since she'd joined "Innovative Solutions, Inc." (ISI).

ISI, nestled in a nondescript office building on the edge of the city's industrial district, was a beacon of promise in Amelia's eyes, a beacon unfortunately obscured by the concrete jungle of unpaid bills and mounting anxieties.  The air in the reception area was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  A half-eaten sandwich, abandoned on a chipped mug, was a silent testament to the erratic rhythm of the office day. Outside, a rusted fire escape, speckled with graffiti, offered a grim reminder of the city's darker corners.
