The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the ragged breaths escaping Amelia Hayes's lungs.

The fracture lines, stark and cruel, spoke volumes about the severity of the accident.  A young man, no older than twenty, lay unconscious on the gurney, his face pale as bone beneath the harsh fluorescent glare.  He was a victim of the city’s relentless, nightmarish rhythm – a rhythm that pounded through the concrete canyons of New Gotham, a city that never truly slept.

The sterile, clinical environment of the emergency room, normally a haven of calculated efficiency, felt suffocating tonight. The air, thick with the antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the metallic tang of blood, clung to her like a second skin.  Outside, the city roared; the relentless drone of traffic, the distant wail of sirens, the distant, throbbing pulse of the metropolis.  Every sound amplified the weight of the responsibility she carried. Amelia knew this case would stay with her long after the adrenaline faded.  And this young man’s life, in her hands for the moment, was teetering on a precipice.
