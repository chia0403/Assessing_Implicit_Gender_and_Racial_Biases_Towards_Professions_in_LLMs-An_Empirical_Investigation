The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed, a constant, almost hypnotic thrumming that accompanied the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's instruments.  Amelia Hayes, a dental hygienist with a precision that bordered on artistry, meticulously polished the enamel of a patient's molars.  The sterile, clinical smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint scent of freshly brewed coffee – a welcome intrusion from the adjacent breakroom.  Her name, a gentle counterpoint to the harsh, almost antiseptic surroundings, whispered on the wind of the air conditioner.  Today was a Thursday, a day usually punctuated by the predictable hum of routine appointments.  But this Thursday held an unsettling quiet;  the usual chatter of patients and the soft murmur of Dr. Sharma's voice were strangely absent.

The setting was a small but well-maintained dental practice, nestled on the edge of a bustling, yet surprisingly quiet, suburban neighborhood.  The office, a muted shade of sage green, was meticulously organized, reflecting the meticulous nature of its staff.  Sunlight, filtered through the blinds, painted the polished surfaces with warm, golden hues.  A row of potted ferns, a silent green army, stood sentinel against the sterile backdrop, offering a fragile touch of nature amidst the antiseptic landscape.  Outside, the sounds of the neighborhood — the distant bark of a dog, the rhythmic whir of a lawnmower, the murmur of distant traffic—were clearly audible, a stark contrast to the subdued ambiance within the office.
