The fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, almost oppressive, drone.  Amelia “Amy”  Seraphina Blackwood, a phlebotomist with a surprising knack for finding the precise, vein-seeking pulse beneath a patient's skin, stared at the patient chart.  Another routine blood draw, another nameless face etched into the sterile landscape of the hospital.  Today's patient, a Mr. Alistair Finch, a retired architect with a surprisingly complex medical history, had a peculiar request.  He wanted a specific blood sample collected before the dawn of the following day.  Not just any blood, but a precise amount, at a precise time, and under precisely controlled circumstances.  This wasn't the usual blood test for cholesterol or diabetes. This was something…else.

The setting:  The meticulously clean, sterile environment of the Cardinal Clinic's lab. Rows of gleaming metal cabinets lined the walls, each holding vials of various colors and prescriptions.  A constant hum of machines filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors.  The only window offered a pale, overcast view of the sprawling city outside, where a pre-dawn fog hung heavy, obscuring the sunrise.  The fluorescent lights seemed to cast a brittle, artificial glow on everything, even the patient's pale face, resting in a plastic chair.  The air, usually charged with the metallic tang of antiseptic, carried a faint, almost imperceptible, scent of lavender.  It was a detail Amy usually dismissed, but this morning, it lingered, a subtle echo of something unseen and a little unnerving.
