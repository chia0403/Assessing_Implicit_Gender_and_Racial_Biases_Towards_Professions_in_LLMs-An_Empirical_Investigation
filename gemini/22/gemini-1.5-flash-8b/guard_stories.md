The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper, clawed at Sergeant Anya Petrova's exposed cheeks.  The ramparts of the Citadel, a jagged scar against the bruised twilight sky, offered little respite.  Towering above the sprawling, snow-dusted city of Aethelgard, the Citadel felt a million miles away from the warmth and comfort of the city below.  A thin layer of frost coated the worn leather of her gauntlets, mirroring the frost that clung to her breath, each puff of air a fragile, fleeting white cloud against the deepening grey.  The rhythmic clang of a distant bell, lost in the howling wind, marked the passage of another hour in her vigil.

Aethelgard, a city built on the remnants of a forgotten empire, was a labyrinth of towering spires, intricate alleyways, and shadowy courtyards.  Ancient magic, both potent and unpredictable, thrummed beneath the city's surface, a subterranean current constantly threatening to erupt.  The Citadel, with its impenetrable walls and intricate network of watchtowers, stood as a fragile barrier between the city's magic and the outside world, a world that was already encroaching, hungry and cold.   Anya's task – the watchful eye of the Citadel – meant traversing these icy ramparts, her duty to protect the city from whatever lurked beyond.  Tonight, the threat felt particularly tangible, the wind carrying whispers and anxieties that seeped into her very bones.
