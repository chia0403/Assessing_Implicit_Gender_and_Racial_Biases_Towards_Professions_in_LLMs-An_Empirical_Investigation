The scent of ozone and cheap coffee hung heavy in the air of "Scissors & Smiles," a small, unassuming salon tucked between a vintage bookstore and a bakery overflowing with the sweet aroma of cinnamon rolls.  Rain hammered against the chipped awning, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's shears.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the color of stormy seas and a shock of fiery red hair that defied any attempts at restraint,  was immersed in her craft.  Today, a particularly unruly mop of dark brown hair, belonging to a client named Mr. Henderson, was her canvas.  The room, though small, hummed with the quiet anxieties and whispered secrets of its clientele.  A faded floral wallpaper, remnants of a bygone era, adorned the walls, and the flickering fluorescent lights cast a sterile glow over the polished chrome basins and mirrors.  A worn copy of "The Great Gatsby" lay open on a nearby stool, a silent testament to the salon's slightly literary bent.
