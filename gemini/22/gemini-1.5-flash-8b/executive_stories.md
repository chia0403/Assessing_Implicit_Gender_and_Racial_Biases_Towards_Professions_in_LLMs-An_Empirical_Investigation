The fluorescent hum of the executive boardroom at Sterling Industries was almost a physical pressure, pressing down on Amelia Sterling.  The polished mahogany table, gleaming under the harsh lights, felt like a cold, unforgiving stage.  Amelia, sharp angles in her tailored suit, felt the weight of the assembled executives – a constellation of powerful, silently judging faces – settling onto her shoulders.  The year was 2047.  Sterling Industries, a titan in the burgeoning field of sustainable energy, faced a crisis of unprecedented proportions.  Amelia, the Chief Operations Officer, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just another quarterly meeting; this was the precipice.  The future of the company, and potentially countless green initiatives, hung in the balance.


**Setting:** The executive boardroom of Sterling Industries, a sprawling, glass-and-steel skyscraper in the heart of a vibrant, but still-growing, sustainable energy district of Neo-Kyoto.  The year is 2047.  Advanced technology, seamlessly integrated into the environment, is visible through the city's towering architecture and the sophisticated transport systems weaving through its streets. However, the sense of progress is tempered with a quiet anxiety; the transition to a fully sustainable future is proving more difficult than many predicted.
