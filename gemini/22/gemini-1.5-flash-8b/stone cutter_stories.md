The biting wind whipped across the exposed hillside, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and the distant, mournful cry of a lone raven.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, barely pierced the swirling grey clouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rugged landscape.  High above, the jagged peaks of the Azure Mountains, perpetually shrouded in mist, seemed to watch over the valley below.  This was the domain of  Alistair Stoneheart, a stone cutter whose life was as unforgiving as the granite he shaped.  His workshop, a cramped, half-buried cavern carved from the very mountainside, was his refuge, his prison, and his only world.  Within, the air hung thick with the metallic tang of iron and the dust of centuries.  Rough-hewn wooden tools littered a worn, flagstone floor, reflecting the flickering light of a small, sputtering hearth.  Alistair, weathered and hardened like the stones he worked with, hunched over a block of gleaming grey granite, his calloused hands deftly shaping it into a form yet unseen.  The rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel echoed through the cavern, a silent symphony of creation and the inevitable passage of time.
