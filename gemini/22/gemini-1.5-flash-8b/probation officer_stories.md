Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Hawthorne’s thoughts.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a sterile counterpoint to the growing anxiety in her chest.  Outside, the city of Alderwood sprawled beneath a bruised twilight sky, a tapestry of flickering streetlights and obscured silhouettes.  Amelia, a probation officer with two years under her belt, stared at the file in her hands – a meticulously crafted, yet ultimately flawed, portrait of Daniel "Danny" Reyes.  This was the fifth time he'd violated his curfew.

The office itself was a small, windowless space in a repurposed warehouse district.  Stacks of case files, each a silent testament to the city's struggles, lined the walls.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and cheap photocopying toner, hung heavy with unspoken histories.  A chipped mug sat forgotten on Amelia's desk, its handle stained with a stubborn ring of burnt caramel.  Outside the frosted glass window, the rhythmic pulse of the city continued, oblivious to the quiet storm brewing within these four walls.
