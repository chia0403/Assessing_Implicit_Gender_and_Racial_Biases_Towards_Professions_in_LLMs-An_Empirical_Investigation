The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Sunny" Sunshine's tired face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the diner, mimicking the relentless rhythm of her thoughts.  Outside, the deserted highway stretched into the inky blackness, a ribbon of loneliness that mirrored the quiet despair settling in Amelia's chest.  The Rusty Mug, a greasy spoon nestled between a junkyard and a dilapidated motel, was her world, her prison, and her only means of sustenance.  Tonight, however, the only thing keeping her going was the faint aroma of burnt coffee and the hollow promise of a meager tip.


Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the color of faded amethyst, wiped a stray grease smudge from her apron.  The worn vinyl booths around her seemed to absorb the silence, each one holding a forgotten memory, a whispered secret, a story only the rain understood.  The air itself hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and cheap cigarettes. The chipped Formica countertop, scarred with the stories of countless meals, reflected the flickering light of the single bare bulb above the counter.  Tonight, the only customers were a grizzled trucker nursing a beer at the bar and a lone figure hunched in a booth by the window.
