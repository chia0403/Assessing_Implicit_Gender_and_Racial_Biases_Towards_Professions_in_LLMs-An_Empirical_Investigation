The biting wind whipped across the exposed topsoil of the neglected garden, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and something vaguely metallic, like rusting iron.  Rain-slicked gravel crunched under the soles of Elias Thorne's worn work boots as he surveyed the chaotic landscape.  His name, Elias Thorne, a name that felt both ancient and stubbornly modern, resonated with the raw, untamed beauty of this place.  

Setting:  The sprawling estate, “Oakhaven Manor,” sprawled out across a plateau overlooking the misty valley.  Its grandeur was overshadowed by a creeping, decades-long neglect.  Once, vibrant rose gardens had been a tapestry of color; now, choked by overgrown ivy, they whispered secrets of a faded glory.  Weathered stone walls, adorned with intricate carvings that hinted at a bygone era, now wept with moss.  This was the legacy Elias Thorne, a meticulous landscaper, had been tasked with restoring, a testament not only to his skill but also to the resilience of nature itself, a constant companion against the ever-present chill of the mountain air.
