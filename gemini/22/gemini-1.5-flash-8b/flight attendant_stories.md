The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, a smell that always clung to the terminals of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  Amelia  Seraphina  Fitzwilliam, her name a symphony of syllables barely audible over the ceaseless roar of the departing planes, adjusted the crisp white uniform that felt, despite the tropical heat, like a second skin.  Her emerald eyes, usually bright with the kind of spark that lit up a crowded cabin, were clouded with a weary, almost melancholic, light.  Today was different.  This flight – a scheduled cargo run to Singapore – felt different.  It was the one carrying the cryptic package that the crew knew only as 'Project Chimera'.

The sprawling airport, a concrete jungle sculpted from the heart of the Malaysian rainforest, buzzed with unseen energy.  A cacophony of languages – Malay, Mandarin, English – mingled in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of baggage handlers and the low thrum of machinery.  Towering glass and steel structures, impossibly high against the emerald canopy, reflected the setting sun in kaleidoscopic bursts.  Security checkpoints snaked through the terminals like silent rivers, their lights glinting menacingly.  Amelia felt a shiver run down her spine, not from the humidity, but from a premonition that this trip would be unlike any other she’d experienced, that this ordinary cargo run was destined for something extraordinary, and perhaps, something dangerous.
