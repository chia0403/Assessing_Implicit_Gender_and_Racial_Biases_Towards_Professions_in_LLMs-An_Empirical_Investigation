The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Springs Massage" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alleyway.  A single, exposed light bulb above the door hummed with a mournful, buzzing sound, mirroring the low thrum of the city outside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, creating a relentless, rhythmic counterpoint to the sigh of Amelia Nightingale, her fingers tracing the tense lines on the back of a client's neck.  Amelia, a massage therapist with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a touch as light as a feather, felt the familiar knot of tension tighten in her own shoulders. Another long day. Another full house.  This particular client, a nervous young woman named Clara, was unusually quiet, her breaths shallow and rapid, a stark contrast to the usual soft murmurs of conversation.  Amelia knew that, beneath the veneer of her quiet demeanor, Clara was hiding a storm of her own.  And Amelia, despite her own quiet nature, was adept at calming those storms. The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, a fragile shield against the harsh realities of the city outside, a promise of respite within the small, cramped space.
