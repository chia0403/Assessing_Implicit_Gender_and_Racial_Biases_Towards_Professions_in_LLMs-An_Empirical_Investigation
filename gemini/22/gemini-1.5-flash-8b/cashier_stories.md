The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Grace Butterfield's life.  Every Tuesday was the same: the sickly sweet smell of expired bread wafting from the back cooler, the rhythmic clinking of coins in the overflowing register, the endless parade of faces, all vaguely familiar in their hurried routines.  Amelia, a cashier at the corner mart for the past three years, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach. Another Tuesday.  Another day swallowed by the mundane.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the overcast mood within her.  The chipped Formica counter, stained with the residue of countless coffees and spilled sodas, reflected the weariness in her eyes.  The chipped paint on the faded green walls seemed to mock her. The air in the store felt thick with the unspoken anxieties of the small-town residents who frequented it â€“ the anxieties she herself held captive, patiently counting change and ignoring them.
