The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Time Express" hummed a monotonous, if slightly irritating, tune, their pale glow reflecting off the polished surfaces of Amelia Butterfield's meticulously organized desk.  Empty coffee cups, each a slightly different shade of beige, were scattered like fallen autumn leaves around the pristine piles of tax forms.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, cramped office, a testament to the relentless onslaught of tax season. Amelia, a woman with a permanent frown etched into her forehead, and eyes that looked like they'd been staring at spreadsheets for too long, sighed.  Another Monday. Another mountain of paperwork.  Another wave of anxious clients.

Amelia Butterfield, Certified Public Accountant and income tax preparer extraordinaire (or so she told herself), hated tax season more than anything.  Her small office, tucked away on a side street of a suburb overflowing with meticulously maintained lawns and cookie-cutter houses, was a tiny fortress against the chaos.  The beige walls, the muted carpeting, the rows of organized tax files; it was a carefully constructed bubble of order in a world that seemed to constantly unravel.  Outside, the muted sounds of suburban life – children's laughter, barking dogs, the rhythmic hum of lawnmowers – provided a soundtrack to the relentless clicking of her keyboard.  Today, however, the usually comforting sounds were just a soundtrack to the pending disaster of a client with seven rental properties and a questionable business.
