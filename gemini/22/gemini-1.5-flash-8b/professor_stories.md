Dampness clung to the air, a palpable weight pressing against the gothic arches of the university buildings, mirroring the heavy thoughts swirling within her.  The year was 1938.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the overflowing shelves of her study, crammed with volumes on ancient Mesopotamian cosmology, Sumerian clay tablets, and the obscure rituals of forgotten cults.  A persistent, almost tangible unease hung in the air, like the scent of impending storm.  Each rhythmic patter of rain against the windowpane echoed the drumming of a premonition in her heart.
