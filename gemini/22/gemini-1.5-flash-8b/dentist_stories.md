The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Petrova's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faint layer of cobwebs clinging to the peeling paint.  Amelia, a woman whose steely grey eyes often seemed to pierce the very enamel of her patients' teeth, leaned over the chair, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Across the examination room, the chipped porcelain of a chipped teacup rested on a discarded, stained magazine.  A single, wilted daisy lay beside it, a stark memento of a forgotten visit.  The air hung thick with the familiar scent of antiseptic and something indefinably sour, like a forgotten lemon.  This particular office, tucked away on a forgotten side street in the heart of the city's decaying downtown district, was less a place of gleaming hygiene and more a repository of whispered anxieties and unspoken fears.  Today, however, a different kind of unease hung in the air, one that burrowed into Amelia's very bones.
