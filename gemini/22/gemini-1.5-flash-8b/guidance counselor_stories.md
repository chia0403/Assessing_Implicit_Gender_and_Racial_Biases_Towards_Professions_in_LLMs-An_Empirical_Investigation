The fluorescent lights of the high school cafeteria hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the clatter of trays and the low murmur of teenage voices.  Amelia Gray, Guidance Counselor Extraordinaire, or AGCE as some students jokingly called her,  sipped her lukewarm coffee, meticulously arranging a stack of student schedules on the worn Formica table.  The aroma of stale pizza and desperation hung thick in the air, a familiar scent that somehow always managed to find its way into the quiet corner sheâ€™d claimed as her own.  Outside, the crisp autumn air bit at the edges of the building, a stark contrast to the humid, simmering tension within the cafeteria.  

Amelia, a woman in her late thirties with perpetually tired eyes and a comforting aura that managed to mask the anxiety simmering just below the surface, had a particular sense of dread as she looked at the schedules.  It was the week of senior year electives, and every year, this week felt like a pressure cooker about to explode.  She knew the agonizing choices facing her students - choosing a college path, deciding on their future careers, and the sheer weight of responsibility and anticipation hung heavy in the air.
