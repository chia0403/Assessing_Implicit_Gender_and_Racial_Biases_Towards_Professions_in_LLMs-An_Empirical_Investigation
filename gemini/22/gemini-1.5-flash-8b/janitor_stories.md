The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library cast long, skeletal shadows across Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's path.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, highlighting the swirling patterns of cobwebs draped like macabre tapestries across the towering bookshelves.  Barty, a janitor with a surprisingly encyclopedic knowledge of the library's hidden nooks and crannies, sighed. Another Tuesday.  Another day spent wrestling with the ghosts of forgotten stories and the persistent aroma of old paper and mildew.  The Grand Zenith, a bastion of intellectual pursuit for over a century, now felt more like a tomb to Barty, a graveyard of whispered secrets and unread volumes.

**Setting:**

The Grand Zenith Library, a sprawling, gothic-revival structure built in the late Victorian era.  Years of neglect, coupled with a recent funding crisis, had allowed the grandeur to decay.  Dust lay thick on every surface, and the air, heavy with the scent of aged paper and decaying wood, hung heavy with the echoes of forgotten footsteps and the whispers of turning pages.  Hidden passages and forgotten rooms lay buried beneath layers of grime and disrepair, waiting for someone to uncover their secrets.  Despite the decay, the libraryâ€™s monumental scale still exerted a powerful presence, a testament to the aspirations and ambitions of a bygone era.  The main reading room, once filled with the murmur of students and scholars, was now eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic scraping of Barty's broom and the occasional groan of creaking floorboards.
