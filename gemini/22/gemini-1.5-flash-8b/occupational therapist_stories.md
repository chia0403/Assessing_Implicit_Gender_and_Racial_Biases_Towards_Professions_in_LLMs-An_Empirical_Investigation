The chipped Formica countertop of the kitchenette gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the Gracewood Rehabilitation Center.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  She, Amelia Blackwood, Occupational Therapist, stared at the half-eaten bowl of oatmeal, the lukewarm milk curdling in the bottom, a perfect metaphor for the frustration swirling inside her.  Another patient, another setback.  This was day 17, and the progress charts for  Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter with a penchant for meticulous birdhouses, were stubbornly blank.  The scent of antiseptic and mildew hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the delicate balance between healing and despair.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the muted colours of her own spirit.

**Setting:** Gracewood Rehabilitation Center, a large, institutional building nestled in the outskirts of a perpetually overcast city. The setting is late autumn, the weather mirroring the subdued, often melancholic mood of the patients and staff.
