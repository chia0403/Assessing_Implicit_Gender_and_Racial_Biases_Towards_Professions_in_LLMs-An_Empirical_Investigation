The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Speedy Plumbers" storefront cast long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked alleyway.  A biting wind, carrying the scent of damp earth and something vaguely chemical, whipped around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as he wrestled a stubborn drainpipe loose from the greasy brickwork.  Barty, a seasoned plumber with calloused hands and a perpetually furrowed brow, swore under his breath, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the downpour.  He was late.  Again.

This particular alley, a forgotten labyrinth of overflowing bins and rusted fire escapes, was his personal purgatory.  It was here, nestled between the towering, brick-faced apartment buildings of the Lower East Side, that Barty often found himself trapped in a maelstrom of leaky pipes, clogged drains, and frustrated tenants. Today, however, the problem wasn't just plumbing.  There was a feeling of unease, a palpable tension in the air, that went beyond the usual grumbling of a Tuesday morning.  The metallic tang of something else, something unfamiliar, clung to the damp air, a scent that prickled the back of his neck and made him want to retreat into the sterile confines of his beat-up truck.
