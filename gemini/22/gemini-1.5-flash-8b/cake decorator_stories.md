The flickering neon sign of "Sugar Rush" cast a sickly sweet glow on Amelia Rose Butterfield's face as she meticulously piped a delicate rose onto a miniature wedding cake.  The air in the tiny bakery hung thick with the intoxicating scent of vanilla, almond, and a hint of something subtly floral.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of late afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the intricate lace doilies carefully draped over the pastries.  Amelia, her fingers stained a faded, almost imperceptible peach, concentrated on the delicate curve of the petal, lost in the precise rhythm of her work.  Sugar Rush, tucked away on a side street in the heart of the perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard, was her sanctuary.  Each perfectly sculpted fondant flower, each precisely placed gumdrop, was a whisper of a dream, a fleeting moment of pure joy she bottled up in sugary masterpieces.
