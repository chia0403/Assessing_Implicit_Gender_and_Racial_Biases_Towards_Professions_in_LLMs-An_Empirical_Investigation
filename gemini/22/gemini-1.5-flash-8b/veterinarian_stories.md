The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the rutted lane leading to the Blackwood Veterinary Clinic.  The faded, emerald green sign, almost swallowed by the encroaching winter woods, seemed to mock her with its promise of warmth and comfort.  The clinic, a small, one-story stone building huddled against the rising slope, was perpetually shrouded in a muted twilight, even during the day.  A thick layer of frost coated the windows, hinting at the icy grip settling over the valley.  This wasn't just a typical winter; this was a winter that clung, refusing to yield.

Amelia, her name a whisper in the biting wind, was a veterinarian of unparalleled dedication, though the dedication often seemed strained against the grim realities of the valleyâ€™s harsh environment.  The Blackwood family had practiced veterinary medicine here, in this isolated corner of the Scottish Highlands, for generations, their reputation built on a quiet understanding of the creatures, large and small, who called these mountains home.  Their patients ranged from the majestic Highland cattle, burdened by the relentless highland climate, to the inquisitive, nimble red squirrels that clung to the trees like tiny acrobats.
