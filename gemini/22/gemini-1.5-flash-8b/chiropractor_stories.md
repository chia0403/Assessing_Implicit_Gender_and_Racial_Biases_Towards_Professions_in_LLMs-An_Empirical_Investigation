The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hayes's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of her heels on the linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated window of her cramped, second-floor clinic in the heart of the city's perpetually rain-soaked underbelly.  Amelia, a chiropractor with a reputation as sharp as her wit and a spine as straight as her unwavering belief in the power of proper alignment, adjusted the last vertebra of a slumped, middle-aged man, the man's pained sigh a familiar, almost comforting sound.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the constant, quiet struggle of the city itself.  This wasn't the gleaming, modern practice Amelia had envisioned.  This was her reality, a practice tucked away in the back alleys of a struggling neighborhood, a place where the echoes of forgotten dreams mingled with the persistent crackle of life trying to survive.
