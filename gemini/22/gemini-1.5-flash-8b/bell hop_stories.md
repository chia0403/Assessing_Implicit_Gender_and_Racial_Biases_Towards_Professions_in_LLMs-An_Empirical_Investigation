The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained with the faded hues of countless spilled coffee cups and forgotten morning tea, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the Grand Magnolia Hotel's baggage room.  The room, a repository of discarded luggage tags and the faint scent of mothballs, felt as suffocatingly still as the ancient, ornate clock ticking softly on the wall.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of day where the only movement seemed to be the slow, rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet, mirroring the slow, agonizing drip of Barty's own hopes. He was a bell hop, a cog in the gilded machine of the Grand Magnolia, a machine that seemed to grind relentlessly toward an end he couldn't quite define.  The Grand Magnolia, with its faded grandeur and echoing corridors, was a monument to a time when elegance was measured in layers of lace and the clinking of champagne flutes, a time that seemed distant and irretrievably lost.  This Tuesday, however, held a particular stillness, a hush that threatened to swallow him whole.
