The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige from years of lukewarm coffee and forgotten teacups, reflected Amelia Blackwood's weary face.  Rain hammered against the attic window, a relentless percussion that mirrored the drumming in her temples.  Amelia, a claims adjuster for the prestigious Sterling & Finch Insurance, stared at the meticulously organized stack of documents before her:  a detailed inventory of a burned-down Victorian mansion, meticulously cataloguing priceless antiques reduced to ash.  The scent of smoke, acrid and persistent, clung to the air, a tangible reminder of the devastation.  This was her third claim this week involving properties along the winding, treacherous roads of the isolated Blackwood Valley.  And something about this one felt...wrong.  

The Blackwood Valley itself was a tapestry woven from mist and ancient stone.  Grey, jagged peaks clawed at a perpetually overcast sky, their summits perpetually shrouded in a veil of chilling fog.  Twisting, cobbled roads snaked through the valley, their dark surfaces reflecting the eerie light filtering from the clouds.  Scattered along these roads were clusters of stone buildings, each one seemingly clinging to the mountainside as if afraid of falling.  The air itself seemed to hold a palpable tension, a whisper of forgotten secrets that clung to the damp earth.  Amelia, a newcomer to the region, felt a constant chill, not just from the pervasive dampness, but from the unspoken history that seemed to permeate every crevice. The silence of the valley was punctuated only by the constant drip of water from unseen springs and the mournful cry of unseen birds.  Today, though, that silence felt oddly heavy.
