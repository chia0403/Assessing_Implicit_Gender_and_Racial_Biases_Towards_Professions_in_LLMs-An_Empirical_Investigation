The scent of lavender and something faintly metallic – perhaps old pennies and ozone – hung heavy in the air of "Scissors & Sighs," a tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the city.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already hazy view of the ancient brick buildings across the narrow alley.  Inside, Amelia "Em"  Abernathy, a woman with a cascade of fiery red hair pulled back into a precise bun, meticulously snipped the ends of a thick, dark braid.  Her hands, calloused from years of wielding scissors and curling irons, moved with practiced grace.  Across the room, a low hum of conversation, interspersed with the rhythmic whir of a hair dryer, filled the small space.  Em, though, was lost in a different kind of conversation – one swirling within her mind, a whisper of secrets and suspicions.
