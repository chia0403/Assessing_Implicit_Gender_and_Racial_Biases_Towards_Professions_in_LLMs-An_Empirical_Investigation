## Story Opening:

The old radio crackled to life, spitting static and a snatch of a forgotten big band tune. Henrietta "Hank" McKinley, a grease smudge clinging stubbornly to her left cheek, swore under her breath and tightened her grip on the stubborn screw. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating her grimace of concentration. This wiring, she thought, was a rat's nest of the worst kind, and she'd dealt with some real doozies in her time.

## Setting:

The air in the abandoned Grand Majestic Theater hung thick and heavy, saturated with the scent of decay. Plaster crumbled like stale cake, and the once-opulent velvet curtains sagged from their rusted rods, draped like mournful shrouds. The stage was a wasteland of splintered wood and forgotten props, swallowed by shadows that seemed to breathe. Above, the ornate ceiling, a faded tapestry of cherubs and gilded lilies, threatened to collapse at any moment. The silence was almost palpable, broken only by the scratching of unseen creatures and the rhythmic drip... drip... drip... of a leaky pipe somewhere deep within the bowels of the old building. This wasn't just old; it was haunted by the ghosts of vaudeville dreams and the echoes of thunderous applause, all waiting to be resurrected - if Hank could just get the damn power back on.
