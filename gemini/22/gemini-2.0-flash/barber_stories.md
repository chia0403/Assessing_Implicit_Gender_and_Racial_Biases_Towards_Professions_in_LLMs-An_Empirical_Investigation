The late afternoon sun, already dipped low behind the squat brick buildings of Oakhaven, painted the window of “Shear Elegance” in hues of apricot and rose. Inside, Arthur Percival Finch meticulously swept a pile of salt-and-pepper hair from the tiled floor, the bristles of his worn brush whispering against the ceramic. Arthur, all sixty-two years of him, sighed. Another Saturday done. Another day of listening to the townsfolk’s woes and triumphs, trimming their sideburns, and maintaining the fading art of the perfectly sculpted mustache. He glanced at the clock above the antique cash register: 6:03 PM. Right on schedule. He was nothing if not punctual.

The setting was quintessential small-town America. Oakhaven, nestled deep in the rolling hills of Pennsylvania, felt permanently stuck in the 1950s. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, where Friday night football reigned supreme, and where Arthur’s barber shop, with its red-and-white striped pole spinning lazily outside, served as a community hub. Inside, the walls were lined with framed photographs of local sports teams and faded advertisements for hair tonic and shaving cream. Two worn leather chairs sat in front of large, mirrored stations, reflecting the worn, but clean, interior. The air always held a comforting aroma of bay rum and talcum powder, a scent that had been Arthur's constant companion for the last forty years.
