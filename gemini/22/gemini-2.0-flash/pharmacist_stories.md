## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like Spanish moss. It was late July in Savannah, and the air conditioning in "Old Town Apothecary," nestled on a cobblestone street just off River Street, was struggling mightily. The interior, usually a haven of cool, herbal scents and polished mahogany, felt slightly oppressive. Sunlight filtered through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows that danced with the rhythmic clatter of the antique pill counter.

**Story Opening:**

A fly, fat and lazy from feasting on dropped peach pits somewhere outside, buzzed persistently against the windowpane, mirroring the relentless hum in the back of **Dr. Eleanor Josephine "Ellie Jo" Devereux's** skull. She leaned over the counter, the worn wood cool against her forehead, and blew a stray strand of her salt-and-pepper hair from her face. Her fingers, usually nimble and precise, fumbled slightly as she counted out the last few amoxicillin capsules into a small amber bottle. 

"Heat's a killer today, ain't it, Ellie Jo?" a voice rasped from the doorway.

Ellie Jo looked up, her hazel eyes, usually bright and observant, weary behind her half-moon spectacles. "Worse than usual, Mr. Henderson," she replied, her voice a little rough around the edges. "And you know that means something, coming from Savannah." She capped the bottle, affixed a label with shaking hands, and pushed it towards the older man. "One capsule, three times a day, after meals. And for heaven's sake, stay hydrated."

Mr. Henderson, a wiry man with a sun-weathered face and eyes that held the wisdom of a hundred years spent fishing the Savannah River, chuckled. "Always lookin' out for me, aren't you, Ellie Jo? You're a good woman, a real pillar of this community." He paused, his gaze sharpening. "But you look like you've seen a ghost. Anything wrong, darlin'?"
