Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a singer:

**Setting:** The Blue Moon Lounge, a dimly lit jazz club nestled in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans. The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, spilled whiskey, and the lingering ghosts of a thousand heartbreak songs. Red velvet booths lined the walls, their plush seats worn soft from decades of late-night conversations and furtive rendezvous. A haze of blue cigarette smoke curled towards the low, tin-pressed ceiling, catching the fractured light of the single spotlight illuminating the small, slightly elevated stage. The room hummed with a low, expectant energy, a mixture of tourists seeking a glimpse of authentic New Orleans nightlife and locals nursing their sorrows or celebrating small victories.

**Story Opening:**

The muted chatter of the crowd died down as the house lights dimmed, a hush falling over the Blue Moon Lounge like a velvet curtain. A lone trumpet, its brass gleaming dully in the semi-darkness, began to wail a mournful introduction. It was a sound that seeped into the very bones of the city, a lament as old as the Mississippi River itself.

Then, she walked onto the stage.

**Seraphina Isabelle Dubois**, her name a whispered prayer on the lips of some in the audience, moved with a grace that belied the weariness in her eyes. She wore a simple, shimmering gown the color of midnight, its fabric catching the stray beams of light and turning them into fleeting stars. Her raven hair, usually piled high in an elaborate updo, was loose tonight, cascading down her back in soft waves. She clutched the microphone stand, her knuckles white, and closed her eyes, letting the music wash over her.

Seraphina inhaled deeply, the scent of jasmine and regret filling her lungs. Tonight, she wasn’t just a singer. She was a conduit, a vessel for the stories that had been brewing in the city’s heart for generations. Tonight, she was going to sing the blues until they bled.
