Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the main character's full name and profession:

**Opening:**

The rain, of course, chose that specific Tuesday. Not the drizzly, romantic kind of rain that Monet might have painted, but the relentless, hammering deluge that turned cobblestone streets into treacherous rivers and threatened to wash away any semblance of tourist cheer. Inside, huddled under the leaky awning of 'Le Petit Bistro,' Eleanor Rose Finch glared at the grey sky. It was bad enough having to herd a flock of soggy tourists through Montmartre, but having to do it on *her* birthday? It felt particularly cruel.

Eleanor sighed, pulling her bright yellow scarf tighter around her neck. This was Paris, damn it! City of lights, of love, of effortless chic. It was not supposed to be perpetually damp, smelled faintly of exhaust fumes and disappointed dreams. This was, unfortunately, her reality as Eleanor Rose Finch, officially licensed tour guide and unofficially, a woman very much contemplating a career change.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the **Montmartre neighborhood of Paris, France**. It's a historical district known for its artistic heritage, including being home to artists like Monet, Picasso, and Van Gogh. Key visual details include:

*   **Cobblestone Streets:** Steep and narrow, adding to the charm (and challenge) of navigating.
*   **Le Petit Bistro:** A small, typical French bistro with red-and-white checked tablecloths, outdoor seating (mostly unusable in the rain), and the scent of strong coffee and Gauloises cigarettes.
*   **Sacre-Coeur Basilica:** Visible in the distance, the white-domed basilica looms over the neighborhood, offering a stunning view (when not obscured by rain clouds).
*   **Place du Tertre:** A square filled with artists selling their work, currently a soggy, less vibrant version of its usual self.
*   **Windmills:** The iconic Moulin Rouge and other, smaller windmills dot the landscape, remnants of Montmartre's past as a rural hilltop.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Eleanor Rose Finch
*   **Profession:** Officially licensed tour guide in Paris.
*   **Brief Character Sketch:** Eleanor is intelligent, witty, and knowledgeable about Parisian history and culture. However, she's starting to feel disillusioned with her job and the city. She has a dry sense of humor and a tendency to be sarcastic, especially when dealing with clueless tourists. She also has a hidden romantic side that she tries to suppress. She is mid-thirties.

I hope this is a helpful start for your story! Good luck!
