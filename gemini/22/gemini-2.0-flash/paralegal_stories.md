**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of the shredder was soothing, oddly enough, given the nature of its contents. Clara Beatrice Finch, paralegal extraordinaire at the prestigious (and perpetually stressed) law firm of Hawthorne, Beckwith & Stern, found a morbid satisfaction in watching documents crumble into confetti. These particular documents, marked "Confidential - Eyes Only," detailed the intricate and damning financial dealings of her current nemesis, and quite possibly, the key to saving her sanity.

Just one more swipe. One more layer of incriminating evidence turned to dust. Clara reached for another stack, her fingers itching with the urge to expose the rot that festered beneath the polished veneer of the firm.

**Setting:**

Hawthorne, Beckwith & Stern occupied the top three floors of the imposing Zenith Tower in downtown Chicago. Its panoramic views of Lake Michigan and the city skyline were meant to inspire awe in clients and instill a sense of success in its employees. However, Clara found the floor-to-ceiling windows more isolating than inspirational, like being trapped in a gilded cage.

Clara's particular corner of the firm was tucked away on the 37th floor, a warren of cubicles surrounding the partners' lavish corner offices. Hers was a modest space, crammed with legal tomes, overflowing filing cabinets, and a disturbingly high number of empty coffee cups. The air was perpetually thick with the scent of expensive cologne (presumably from Mr. Beckwith himself), printer ink, and the low-grade anxiety that permeated the firm like a persistent cough. It was a far cry from the romanticized notions of the legal world she'd envisioned during her paralegal studies. This was where the real work happened â€“ the research, the drafting, the agonizing over minute details that could make or break a case. And, increasingly, where Clara felt she was drowning in a sea of ethical ambiguity.
