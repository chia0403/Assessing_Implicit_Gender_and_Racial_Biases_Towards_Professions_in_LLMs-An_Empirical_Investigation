## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of the "Peak Performance Rehabilitation Center" hummed a monotonous tune, bouncing off the gleaming, sterilized surfaces of the weight room. This particular Monday morning in late October in suburban Denver, Colorado, felt colder than usual, even inside. The sky outside was a bruised purple, promising snow before the day was out.

**Opening:**

Margaret Elizabeth Olsen straightened her navy blue polo shirt, the Peak Performance logo a crisp mountain range embroidered over her left breast. She winced slightly, the familiar twinge in her lower back a constant reminder of her own overuse injuries. It was 6:55 AM, and she was early, as always. Margaret liked the quiet of the pre-dawn hours, before the patients shuffled in, burdened by chronic pain and the weight of their broken bodies. Before the whir of the exercise bikes and the grunts of exertion filled the air. Today, however, a gnawing unease pricked at her. It wasn't just the impending snow, or the knowledge of the overflowing appointment book. It was the message on her phone, a cryptic text from her estranged brother, demanding she call him "ASAP."
