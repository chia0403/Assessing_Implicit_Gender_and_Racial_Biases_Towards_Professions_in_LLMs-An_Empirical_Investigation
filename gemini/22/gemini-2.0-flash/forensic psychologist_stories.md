## Story Opening:

The stale scent of disinfectant and cheap coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a stubborn ghost. Another morning, another fluorescent-lit hallway, another interview room. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, the red-rimmed sting a constant reminder of the cases that haunted her dreams. Today, she was meeting with Caleb Thorne, a man accused of brutally murdering his estranged wife. The file on her lap was a damning tapestry of blood spatter, conflicting testimonies, and a chilling lack of remorse.

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, the metal frame cold against her skin. This wasn't her first rodeo. She'd stared into the abyss countless times, trying to understand the twisted logic that propelled people to commit unimaginable acts. But something about Thorne's case felt different, colder, more calculating. A knot tightened in her stomach. She just hoped she could unravel the truth before it ensnared her too.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set within the **Eastern State Correctional Facility**, a high-security prison located in rural Pennsylvania. The prison itself is a concrete monolith, its grey walls scarred with graffiti and stained with the grime of years. Inside, the corridors are a maze of locked gates, observation windows, and the constant hum of electronic surveillance.

**Specifically, Dr. Vance's primary workspace within the prison is the Forensic Psychology Wing**, a relatively sterile and controlled environment compared to the rest of the facility. This wing contains:

*   **Interview Rooms:** Small, soundproof rooms with a table, two chairs, and a one-way mirror for observation.
*   **Her Office:** A cramped but organized space filled with case files, psychology textbooks, and personal touches like a framed photo of her daughter and a small, ceramic owl.
*   **A Small Library:** A collection of forensic psychology journals and relevant books.
*   **A Conference Room:** Used for meetings with the prison staff, lawyers, and other professionals involved in her cases.

The contrast between the sterile, intellectual environment of the Forensic Psychology Wing and the harsh, volatile atmosphere of the rest of the prison is a key element of the setting, highlighting the constant tension and danger that Dr. Vance faces in her work.
