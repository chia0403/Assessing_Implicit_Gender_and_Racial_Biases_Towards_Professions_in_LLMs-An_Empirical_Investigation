Okay, here's a story opening and setting, centered around a coach:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of stale chlorine and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor Vance’s sweat-soaked t-shirt like a persistent mosquito. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, her eyes stinging from the constant glare of the fluorescent lights reflecting off the shimmering water. “Alright, team! Let’s go again! Faster breakouts! I want to see some hustle!” Her voice, normally a warm contralto, was strained, hoarse from hours of yelling encouragement and instructions. She could feel a tension headache tightening its grip behind her eyes. This wasn't just another practice; this was the last chance. The Regional Championships were two weeks away, and Eleanor needed to whip the Northwood High Narwhals into something resembling a cohesive, competitive unit. Right now, they looked more like a flailing school of guppies.
**Setting:**

The Northwood High School Natatorium, located in the affluent suburb of Northwood, Massachusetts. The natatorium itself is a somewhat dated structure, a stark contrast to the gleaming new science wing that had recently been added to the school. The building is rectangular and utilitarian, constructed primarily of cinder block painted a faded, institutional blue. Large, rectangular windows line the upper walls, letting in (when clean enough) natural light that competes with the harsh fluorescent overheads.

Inside, the echoing space is dominated by the Olympic-sized swimming pool, its eight lanes separated by brightly colored lane markers. The pool deck, made of worn, non-slip concrete, is dotted with kickboards, pull buoys, and various training equipment. A small, slightly dilapidated scoreboard hangs at one end of the pool, perpetually displaying a garbled message.

Along one side of the pool, a row of bleachers provides seating for spectators, usually sparsely populated except during meets. A cramped, windowless office, overflowing with paperwork, stopwatches, and discarded swim caps, is located near the entrance, serving as Eleanor's domain. The air is perpetually humid, the smell of chlorine inescapable. Despite its shortcomings, Eleanor has come to consider this place her second home.
