## Story Opening:

The scent of disinfectant and stale coffee clung to the air, a familiar perfume that did little to soothe the tremor in Amelia Grace Davies’ hands. Outside, the pre-dawn sky bled from inky black to a bruised, unsettling purple, promising another long shift. She gripped the lukewarm mug, willing the caffeine to kick in. This wasn't just any Monday. This was the Monday after the blackout. The emergency generators had shuddered to life after a terrifying hour of complete darkness, but the chaos unleashed – the frantic calls, the malfunctioning equipment, the surge of worried relatives – had left an indelible mark on St. Jude's Hospital, and on her. Amelia knew, with a certainty that settled like lead in her stomach, that the fallout was far from over.

## Setting:

St. Jude's Hospital, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a seemingly idyllic town in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Usually, the hospital was a haven of quiet efficiency, a place where the low hum of medical equipment blended with the gentle murmur of nurses and the hushed whispers of concerned families. However, the recent blackout had stripped away this veneer of serenity, exposing the raw, fragile underbelly of a system pushed to its limits. The paint on the walls seemed to chip more aggressively, the linoleum floors looked perpetually dirtier, and the faces of her colleagues were etched with a fatigue that went beyond the usual demands of their profession. The air itself felt heavy with unspoken anxieties, a feeling that something more than just the electricity was about to give way. The flickering fluorescent lights of the East Wing, where Amelia worked, added to the feeling of unease, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with her own apprehension.
