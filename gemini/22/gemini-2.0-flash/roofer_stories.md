The August sun beat down on Daniel Michael Riley's back like a vengeful god. He squinted, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime on his forehead. The air, thick with humidity and the scent of tar and roasting asphalt, hung heavy over the small town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, your business, and probably your dental records. A place where front porches were still inhabited after supper, where the Fourth of July parade was a major social event, and where gossip spread faster than wildfire.

Daniel perched precariously on the steep pitch of Mrs. Higginsâ€™ roof, his boots digging into the worn shingles. Below him, the manicured lawn of 14 Maple Street stretched out like a verdant carpet, ending in a neatly painted white picket fence. A lone robin hopped hopefully across the grass, seemingly oblivious to the danger just above it. This roof was his sixth this month, a good haul for August, but the sweltering heat was starting to get to him. He needed to finish this section before the afternoon storm clouds rolled in, threatening to turn the whole town into a humid, slippery disaster. He gripped his hammer tighter, took a deep breath, and got back to work. Today was just another day in Harmony Creek, another roof to fix, another story to tell. Little did he know, today's story would be anything but ordinary.
