**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' Monday morning dread. He stared at his reflection in the darkened screen of his laptop, a weary face framed by thinning brown hair. He'd spent the entire weekend, even sacrificing his beloved televised lawn bowling, crafting the perfect pitch for Acme Widgets' new Quantum Sprocket 3000. A sprockets so revolutionary, so utterly *essential*, that he was convinced it would break sales records. At least, that's what he told himself as he chugged the last of his lukewarm coffee, the grounds clinging stubbornly to the bottom of his mug. Today was the day. Today, Bart Higgins would prove that he wasn't just another cog in the corporate machine, but a master of persuasion, a champion of commerce, a...well, a really good widget salesman.

**Setting:**

Bart Higgins' world revolved around the sprawling, impersonal office of "Solutions Unlimited," a mid-sized sales firm nestled in the heart of Schaumburg, Illinois. The office itself was a testament to beige, a sea of cubicles separated by low partitions covered in acoustic fabric that vaguely resembled burlap. Each cubicle was adorned with generic motivational posters ("Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!") and crammed with stacks of product brochures, phone headsets, and half-eaten granola bars. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, desperation, and the faint, lingering aroma of microwave popcorn from Friday's "team-building" exercise (movie night featuring *Glengarry Glen Ross*, ironically). Outside, the endless sprawl of suburban strip malls and parking lots offered little in the way of inspiration, but served as a constant reminder of the endless potential customer base just waiting to be tapped. His little cubicle, B-47, was his domain, his battleground, his slightly depressing kingdom of phone calls and powerpoint presentations.
