The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Chen’s skin like a damp shroud. It was the kind of oppressive August afternoon that made you sweat just thinking about leaving the air-conditioned sanctuary of her apartment. Outside, New York City throbbed, a cacophony of honking taxis and chattering tourists simmering in the afternoon sun.

Amelia, however, was oblivious. Her eyes, magnified by thick-rimmed glasses, were glued to the glowing screen of her iMac. The rhythmic click of her mouse punctuated the silence of her workspace, a small, meticulously organized corner carved out of her otherwise chaotic Brooklyn studio apartment. Books on typography, color theory, and Bauhaus architecture lined the shelves, interspersed with quirky ceramic figurines and framed prints of her own earlier work. A half-eaten container of takeout noodles sat precariously balanced on the edge of her desk, testament to the fact that deadlines waited for no one, not even hunger.

Today, Amelia was wrestling with the logo for "The Wandering Wombat," a new Australian-themed coffee shop opening in the East Village. The client, a jovial expat named Bruce, had provided a vague brief involving boomerangs, eucalyptus leaves, and “a touch of outback magic.” Amelia, a graphic designer who usually specialized in sleek, minimalist branding for tech startups, was finding the whole project excruciatingly…kitsch.
