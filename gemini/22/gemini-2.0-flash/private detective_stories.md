The chipped ceramic mug, stained eternally with the ghost of week-old coffee, radiated a pathetic warmth against Abigail "Abby" Sterling's frozen fingers. Rain hammered against the grimy window of her office on the third floor of the Delancey Building, a building that smelled perpetually of stale cigarettes and broken dreams. Outside, the neon glow of Times Square bled into the inky New York night, a garish painting over a canvas of despair.

Abby, her name a cruel irony given her luck these past few months, was staring at the blinking cursor on her antiquated desktop, a blank document mocking her with its pristine emptiness. Business was slow, slower than the city's sluggish traffic at 3 AM. She hadn't had a decent case since the missing poodle caper back in August, and that hardly covered the rent. 

The Delancey Building, a monument to pre-war architecture slowly succumbing to urban decay, was the perfect setting for a private investigator scraping by. The peeling paint in the hallways mirrored the unraveling lives she often encountered. The creaking floorboards echoed the secrets she hunted down. And the constant hum of the city outside was a relentless reminder that she was just another small cog in a vast, indifferent machine. Tonight, however, the city seemed to be holding its breath, waiting, just like Abby, for something to break the suffocating silence.
