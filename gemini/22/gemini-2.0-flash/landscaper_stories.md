The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, a tangible thing that clung to Amelia "Amy" Josephine Bell like a second skin. Sweat beaded on her brow as she wrestled the recalcitrant starter cord of the gas-powered edger. The sun, a merciless eye in the sky, beat down on the manicured lawns of the Azalea Estates retirement community, baking the already scorching pavement. Amy, clad in her usual uniform of faded denim shorts, a ripped-sleeve Rolling Stones t-shirt, and perpetually grass-stained work boots, cursed under her breath. This was shaping up to be one of *those* days.

Azalea Estates was Amy's bread and butter. The carefully curated flowerbeds, the meticulously trimmed hedges, the perfectly striped lawns - they all paid the bills for Bell & Bloom Landscaping, Amy's one-woman operation. But the retirees, with their sharp eyes and even sharper tongues, could be a demanding bunch. Mrs. Higgins was particularly fond of pointing out stray blades of grass, while Mr. Abernathy had once complained that her truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Beast," was an affront to the delicate sensibilities of the landscaping. 

Amy finally coaxed the edger to life with a violent yank. "Right then," she muttered, pushing her stray auburn curls behind her ear. "Let's get this show on the road." Today, she was tasked with edging the enormous rose garden surrounding the community's gazebo. The roses, a riot of colors from pale pink to deep crimson, were in full bloom. They were beautiful, Amy had to admit, even as she braced herself for a long, hot afternoon spent battling thorns and the judgmental gazes of the residents perched on their wrought-iron benches.
