## The Setting:

The air in "Back in Balance Chiropractic" hung thick with the scent of eucalyptus and simmering tension.  Sunlight, fractured by the Venetian blinds, striped across the worn Persian rug in the waiting room.  A grandfather clock, a gift from a grateful (and particularly geriatric) patient, ticked with the rhythmic cadence of a metronome, each swing a reminder of the relentless march of time.  Outside, the relentless buzz of the Chicago Loop throbbed, a constant, underlying hum of city life that Dr. Eleanor Vance had long ago learned to tune out.  Today, however, even that background noise felt amplified, mirroring the nervous energy vibrating within her.  The weather was classic Chicago – a bone-chilling November wind that sliced through even the thickest coats, promising snow by nightfall.

## The Opening:

Eleanor Vance stared at the crumpled sticky note in her hand, the messy scrawl barely legible. "Mr. Silas Blackwood - 2:00 pm.  Headaches.  'Important'."  She crumpled it tighter, the paper resisting her grip. Important. Everyone thought their pain was important. And it *was*. She believed that with every fiber of her being. But there was something about the name, the curt, almost demanding tone of the phone call earlier that morning, that set her teeth on edge. Silas Blackwood.  It sounded like a villain in a gothic novel, not a prospective patient seeking relief from tension headaches. She glanced at the grandfather clock. 1:57 pm. He would be here soon. And Eleanor, despite her years of practice, felt a prickle of apprehension she couldn’t quite explain. This wasn't just another pinched nerve. This felt...different.
