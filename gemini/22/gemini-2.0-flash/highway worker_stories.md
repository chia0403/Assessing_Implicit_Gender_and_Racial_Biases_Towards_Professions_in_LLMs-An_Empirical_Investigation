Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Delmar Ray Johnson:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of hot asphalt and diesel clung to Delmar Ray Johnson like a second skin. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a grime-streaked bandanna, squinting at the endless ribbon of shimmering blacktop that stretched before him. The heat coming off the highway was almost tangible, a physical force that pushed against him, daring him to wilt. Another semi-truck roared past, its horn a fleeting salute that barely pierced the relentless hum of the machinery and the rhythmic thwack of his shovel against the hardened road surface. Delmar sighed. Another long day on the black snake, another foot closer to somewhere, and another foot further from...well, from anything resembling a life.

**Setting:**

The story is set on a remote stretch of Interstate 40 in the arid landscape of western Oklahoma. Think endless vistas of sun-baked earth, scrubby mesquite trees clinging to life along the shoulder, and the shimmering illusion of water dancing on the horizon. The road itself is a constant presence, a heavy, dark scar etched across the landscape. The sun beats down mercilessly, turning the air thick and heavy. The nearest town, a speck on the map called "Dust Devil," is a good hour's drive away. The highway work crewâ€™s vehicles, orange and yellow behemoths, stand like mechanical sentinels against the harsh backdrop. The overall feeling is one of isolation, heat, and the relentless, monotonous grind of labor. The sky is often vast and blue, but it offers no solace, only a reminder of the endless, unforgiving landscape.
