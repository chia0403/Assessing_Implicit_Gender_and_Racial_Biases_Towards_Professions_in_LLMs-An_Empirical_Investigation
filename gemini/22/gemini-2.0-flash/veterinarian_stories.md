The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to the air in the exam room, a familiar, almost comforting aroma to Dr. Evelyn Grace Albright. Outside, a relentless drizzle hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Albright Veterinary Clinic, a soundtrack Evelyn had grown accustomed to during her years in the small, windswept town of Port Blossom, Oregon. The town, nestled between the churning Pacific and the dense, emerald forests of the coast range, was perpetually damp and perpetually demanding of its inhabitants.

The clinic itself was a converted fisherman's cottage, painted a cheerful but faded yellow that was perpetually peeling from the salt air. The interior was equally charming and equally worn. The waiting room, currently unoccupied, held a mismatched collection of wicker chairs and a coffee table overflowing with dog-eared copies of National Geographic and cat-themed cross-stitch projects. The exam room was spartan, dominated by a stainless steel table, shelves crammed with medications and instruments, and a whiteboard covered in appointment reminders and hastily scrawled medical notes.

Evelyn ran a gloved hand over the smooth, cold surface of the table, a sigh escaping her lips. She was used to the quiet, to the isolation of Port Blossom, but days like this, when the storm raged outside and the solitude felt particularly heavy, she couldn't help but wonder if she'd made the right choice all those years ago. She was a good veterinarian, a truly excellent one, but sometimes, the weight of caring for every creature, big and small, in this isolated corner of the world felt crushing. And today, a new case, a mystery with fur and teeth and a rapidly deteriorating condition, was about to walk through that door.
