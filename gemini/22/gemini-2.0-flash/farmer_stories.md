The first hint of dawn was a pale, bruised purple bleeding across the eastern horizon when Silas McKinley, his back already aching from the day before, stepped out of his ramshackle farmhouse. A rooster, puffed up with self-importance, crowed a jarring alarm, echoing Silasâ€™s own internal grumbling. He pulled the brim of his worn, straw hat lower against the nascent light and surveyed his domain: McKinley Farm, a patchwork quilt of struggling fields nestled in the valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The air was thick with the damp smell of the earth, promising another humid July day. Mist clung to the lower fields, obscuring the rows of corn Silas had painstakingly planted back in April. It was a deceptive beauty, that mist, hiding the reality of the parched soil underneath, craving a good soaking rain that seemed to have abandoned this corner of Virginia.

Silas took a long swig from the tin canteen hanging from his belt. He knew what today held: another battle against the encroaching weeds, another desperate plea to the sky for rain, another day of wondering if he'd be able to hold onto this land, the land that had been in his family for generations. The land that was slowly, relentlessly, slipping away.
