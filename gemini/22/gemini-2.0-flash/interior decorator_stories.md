## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting Chicago wind howled a discordant tune against the floor-to-ceiling windows of the unfinished penthouse apartment. Dust motes danced in the pale afternoon light, illuminated by the bare bulb dangling precariously from a loose wire in the exposed concrete ceiling. The view, however, was breathtaking. Lake Michigan stretched out, a steely grey canvas reflecting the bruised winter sky. To the west, the city skyline glittered, a jagged testament to ambition and innovation.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Grace Hawthorne shivered, pulling her cashmere scarf tighter around her neck. Even the exorbitant price tag on this unfinished space couldn't seem to ward off the pervasive chill. She tapped a manicured fingernail against the rolled-up blueprint clutched in her gloved hand, a sigh escaping her lips in a frosty puff. This was it. The biggest commission of her career. The one that would either catapult Hawthorne Interiors to the top tier of Chicago's design elite, or leave her buried under a mountain of debt and shattered expectations. The client, a reclusive tech billionaire named Julian Thorne (no relation, thankfully), had given her carte blanche – with a budget that made her palms sweat – to transform this skeletal structure into a minimalist masterpiece. But as she gazed out at the swirling grey expanse of Lake Michigan, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that she was dealing with more than just concrete and steel. This penthouse felt… empty. Not just unfinished, but devoid of any life, any warmth, any soul. And that, she knew, was going to be her biggest challenge yet.
