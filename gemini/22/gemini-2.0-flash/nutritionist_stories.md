The aroma of roasted dandelion root and something vaguely fungal hung heavy in the air, clinging to the meticulously organized shelves lined with obscure powders and tinctures. This was Tuesday morning, and Tuesday mornings always smelled of desperate hope, earthy bitterness, and the quiet desperation of people who'd tried everything else. Eleanor Vivian Thorne, registered nutritionist and self-proclaimed 'Wellness Weaver,' inhaled deeply, a small, almost involuntary tic. She secretly hated the smell. It reminded her too much of the graveyard of failed remedies she’d witnessed over her fifteen years in the business.

Eleanor’s office, nestled on the second floor of a Victorian-era building in the gentrified, but stubbornly crunchy, neighborhood of Silver Lake, Los Angeles, was designed to project calm. Soft lighting, provided by salt lamps and strategically placed succulents, bathed the room in a warm, pseudo-spiritual glow. The walls were painted a soothing sage green, and framed diplomas from accredited universities (and a slightly less credible 'Holistic Healing Institute' in Bali, which she conveniently left vague) hung alongside inspirational quotes hand-lettered in elegant calligraphy. A bubbling fountain, filled with polished river stones and the faint scent of eucalyptus oil, provided a constant, calming soundtrack, effectively masking the traffic noise from the bustling street below. Despite the best efforts of her interior decorator (a vegan acupuncturist named Sage), Eleanor felt a persistent, low-grade anxiety gnawing at her. She had bills to pay, and the Goji Berry cleanse craze had peaked months ago.
