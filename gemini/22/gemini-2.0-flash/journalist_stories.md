The salt spray bit at Amelia Bellweather’s face, mirroring the biting anxiety that had been churning in her stomach for the past seventy-two hours. She tightened her grip on the railing of the battered fishing trawler, the rusted metal cold against her gloved hand. The "Sea Serpent," as the vessel was optimistically named, bucked violently, protesting the choppy waters of the Northumberland Strait. Dawn was a bruised violet smear on the horizon, a weak promise of light struggling to pierce the thick, clinging fog that had swallowed everything beyond the bow.

Amelia, a journalist for the prestigious "National Geographic Traveler," wasn’t usually found battling sea sickness and existential dread before breakfast. Her assignments typically involved photographing pastel-painted villas in Tuscany, or charting the best hiking trails through the Swiss Alps. This, however, was different. This was a favor, a very, very large one, to a friend she'd known since childhood.

They were headed to Sable Island, a remote, crescent-shaped sandbar located some 175 miles offshore from Halifax, Nova Scotia. A place known for its unpredictable weather, its wild horses, and its countless shipwrecks. A place, according to her friend, where something… unusual… was happening. Amelia just hoped she wouldn't end up becoming another footnote in Sable Island's long and tragic history.
