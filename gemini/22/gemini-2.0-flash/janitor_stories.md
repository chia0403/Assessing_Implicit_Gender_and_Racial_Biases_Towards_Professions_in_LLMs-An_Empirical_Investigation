The fluorescent lights of the Andromeda Corporation, 37th floor, hummed a monotonous tune as Leo Maxwell mopped the hallway. It was 3:17 AM, according to the perpetually malfunctioning clock on the water cooler, and the only other sign of life was the faint flicker of a security camera in the corner. Outside, the city of Neo-Kyoto sprawled like a glittering circuit board, its neon glow a stark contrast to the sterile, almost clinical, environment inside.

Leo, a man whose perpetually hunched shoulders and tired eyes belied his just-shy-of-forty years, pushed the mop methodically. He wasn't thinking about the complex algorithms being developed behind the closed doors, nor the fortunes being amassed by the executives whose shiny shoes tracked grime across this very floor during the day. He was thinking about Mrs. Yamamoto's plum tree, specifically if he could maybe, just maybe, convince her to let him have a few plums this year. His daughter, Hana, loved them.

The smell of disinfectant clung to the air, a sterile blanket against the phantom scents of stale coffee and ambition that lingered even at this hour. Leo sighed, the sound swallowed by the vastness of the empty office space. He was just a janitor, a silent observer in a world that moved far too fast for him. But tonight, even the usual hum of the building felt different, charged with an almost palpable energy. And Leo, despite his weariness, couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something was about to change.
