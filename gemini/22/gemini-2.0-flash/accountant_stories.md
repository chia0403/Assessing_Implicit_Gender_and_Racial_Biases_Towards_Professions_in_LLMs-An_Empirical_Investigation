The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's life. It was a tune she knew intimately, having spent the better part of a decade immersed in the beige-toned purgatory that was the accounting department of "Starkweather & Sons, Purveyors of Fine Leather Goods." Her cubicle, a warren of files and tax forms, felt more like a mausoleum dedicated to the dead than a workspace. The only splashes of color came from a wilting peace lily she'd inherited from her predecessor (who'd retired... or escaped, Amelia couldn't quite decide) and a framed photograph of her grandmother, a woman who'd lived a life filled with adventure, a life that Amelia felt increasingly slipping away.

Outside, a late autumn drizzle coated the grimy windows of the Starkweather building. The air hung heavy with the scent of dying leaves and the faint, underlying odor of leather tanning from the factory across the street. Located in the industrial heart of Oakhaven, a town clinging to the edge of the Appalachian Mountains, Starkweather & Sons was a landmark, a testament to a bygone era of American manufacturing. But Oakhaven, much like Amelia, felt trapped, caught between the romanticized past and an uncertain future. And within those walls, Amelia Hawthorne, Certified Public Accountant, found herself facing not only a mountain of unfiled deductions, but also a growing discontent that threatened to bury her alive.
