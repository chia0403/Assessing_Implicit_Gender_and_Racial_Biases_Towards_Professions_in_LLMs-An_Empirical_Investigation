The biting wind, laced with the metallic tang of jet fuel, whipped around Amelia Iris Thorne as she tightened the straps of her helmet. Above her, the bruised purple sky threatened rain, a familiar omen in the stark, windswept landscape of the Mojave Desert. The sun, a weak and watery disc, cast long, skeletal shadows from the hangars and abandoned vehicles that dotted the perimeter of Edwards Air Force Base. Amelia, a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy, wasn’t technically stationed at Edwards, but its sprawling, sparsely populated grounds were perfect for what she needed: solitude, secrecy, and a runway long enough to tame the beast she was about to unleash.

The "beast" in question was the experimental XF-99 Peregrine, a sleek, black delta-wing aircraft that hummed with barely contained power. It was a flying enigma, a technological marvel cloaked in layers of classified documents and whispered rumors of bleeding-edge AI co-pilots and near-impossible maneuvers. Amelia, chosen for her unmatched skill and unnerving calm under pressure, was its test pilot, its translator between human intuition and cold, calculating code. And today, she was pushing it – and herself – further than anyone had dared before.
