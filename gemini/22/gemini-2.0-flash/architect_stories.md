## Story Opening:

The biting wind, laced with the acrid tang of salt spray, whipped at Eliza Corvus's face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant clasp of her leather sketchbook. The damned thing had been refusing to stay closed ever since she'd crammed it full of charcoal sketches detailing the skeletal remains of the old lighthouse. She finally managed to snap it shut, a sigh escaping her chapped lips.

"Bloody typical," she muttered, more to the gulls wheeling overhead than to anyone else. The sun, a pale disc struggling to pierce the thick, pewter-grey clouds, offered scant warmth against the North Sea chill.

Eliza adjusted the thick, hand-knitted scarf around her neck, its wool prickly but comforting. Above her, the skeletal metal frame of the scaffolding creaked and groaned in protest against the relentless wind, a mournful symphony that echoed the decay she was trying to capture in her drawings. 

## Setting:

The year is 2042. The location is a small, wind-ravaged island called Grim's Isle, a lonely sentinel perched precariously on the edge of the North Sea, off the coast of Scotland. Grim's Isle is largely uninhabited, save for a small research outpost studying the effects of rising sea levels and a handful of hardy, independent souls who have clung to the rugged landscape for generations. The dominant feature of the island is a crumbling, abandoned lighthouse, its once proud beacon silenced decades ago by coastal erosion and neglect. The surrounding landscape is a stark tapestry of windswept moors, jagged cliffs, and churning, unforgiving sea. The air is thick with the smell of brine and damp earth, a constant reminder of the island's precarious existence in the face of the encroaching ocean.
