## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped across the parapets of Blackwood Keep, stinging Sergeant Alistair Humphrey’s cheeks and pulling at the heavy wool cloak draped over his shoulders. He pulled the cloak tighter, the coarse fabric scratching against his throat, a familiar discomfort he barely registered anymore. He was used to discomfort. He was a guard, and discomfort was the currency of his profession.

Alistair stared out across the snow-laden plains, his breath misting in the frigid air. The pale light of the dying sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the twisted, leafless trees that clung precariously to the hillside below. He'd been standing watch for three hours, a silent sentinel against a threat he wasn't even sure existed. Three hours spent watching nothing but swirling snow and the ever-encroaching darkness. He knew, logically, that most attacks came under the cover of night. But a man could only stare at endless white nothing for so long before his mind started playing tricks, conjuring shadows where none existed, hearing whispers on the wind.

He shifted his weight, the worn leather of his boots squeaking against the cold stone. Another hour until the changing of the guard. Another hour until he could retreat to the relative warmth of the barracks and the lukewarm broth that would pass for supper. Just another night at Blackwood Keep.

## Setting:

**Blackwood Keep:** A formidable stone fortress perched atop a craggy peak in the northernmost reaches of the Kingdom of Aeridor. Centuries old, Blackwood Keep was originally built to defend against barbarian incursions from the Frostfang Mountains to the north. Now, with those tribes largely pacified (or scattered), the Keep mainly served as a buffer against the wild, untamed lands beyond the kingdom’s borders, and a watchful eye over the often-rebellious northern provinces.

The Keep itself is a sprawling complex, a chaotic jumble of towers, walls, and courtyards built and rebuilt over generations. The stone is a dark, almost black, grey, giving the Keep a brooding, imposing presence. The harsh climate has taken its toll; cracks spiderweb across the walls, and patches of moss cling stubbornly to every surface.

Inside, the atmosphere is one of damp cold and weary routine. The barracks are spartan and drafty, the mess hall is perpetually filled with the aroma of boiled cabbage, and the armory smells of oiled steel and sweat. Life in Blackwood Keep is a constant cycle of duty, training, and monotonous meals, a far cry from the bustling cities and fertile farmlands of southern Aeridor. It's a place where hope goes to die, and where men, like Alistair Humphrey, spend their days guarding against a darkness they may never truly understand.
