## Story Opening:

The scent of lily and desperation clung to the air like a humid summer day. Genevieve Eleanor Moreau smoothed a nonexistent crease from her immaculate navy blazer, a sigh barely disturbing the serene mask she wore. Across the polished marble of the Hotel Lumière's lobby, Mrs. Van Derlyn was once again holding court, her voice, amplified by diamonds and years of entitlement, ricocheting off the soaring, art-deco ceiling.

"Honestly, Genevieve, darling," Mrs. Van Derlyn trilled, her eyes glinting with the thrill of a captured audience. "To think, they actually *closed* Pierre Gagnaire's namesake restaurant for a private party! Can you imagine? And the audacity of not even sending me an invitation!"

Genevieve, ever the consummate concierge, managed a sympathetic incline of her head. "I can certainly understand your disappointment, Mrs. Van Derlyn. It is a highly sought-after venue."

Inside, Genevieve's carefully curated calm was cracking. She had spent the past three weeks fielding outlandish demands, placating eccentric billionaires, and navigating the treacherous waters of Parisian high society. All while wrestling with a problem far more pressing than Mrs. Van Derlyn's social snubs: the creeping suspicion that the hotel, her sanctuary and livelihood, was harboring a secret, a darkness that whispered in the grand corridors and flickered in the antique chandeliers.

## Setting:

The Hotel Lumière, located on a quiet, cobbled street just off the Champs-Élysées in Paris, is a bastion of old-world luxury. Its facade, crafted from pale limestone and adorned with wrought-iron balconies overflowing with geraniums, exudes an understated elegance. Inside, the lobby is a symphony of gleaming marble, plush velvet, and shimmering crystal. The air is thick with the aroma of expensive perfume, freshly cut flowers, and the faint, lingering scent of decades past. The hotel boasts a Michelin-starred restaurant, a discreet spa, and rooms that whisper tales of famous writers, celebrated artists, and exiled royalty. It is a place where privacy is paramount and discretion is an art form. Behind the veneer of opulence, however, lies a history as layered and complex as the city itself, a history that Genevieve is about to unearth.
