**Setting:** The story opens in the late hours of a humid August night in Charleston, South Carolina. The air hangs thick and heavy, laden with the scent of honeysuckle and salt marsh. Gas lamps cast a flickering, orange glow on the cobblestone streets, painting long, dancing shadows from the wrought-iron balconies that adorn the historic buildings. The distant chime of a clock tower, muffled by the humidity, marks the hour – three in the morning.

**Opening:**

The insistent ringing sliced through the quietude of Dr. Eleanor Vance's study like a scalpel. Eleanor, clad in a silk dressing gown the color of fading rose petals, sighed and reluctantly pulled herself from the leather armchair. The half-finished game of solitaire on the mahogany desk beside her would have to wait. She picked up the ivory telephone receiver, its cool surface a stark contrast to the clammy heat clinging to her skin.

"Vance residence," she answered, her voice still thick with sleep.

A frantic, breathless voice crackled on the other end. "Doctor Vance? It's Silas, from the docks. Please, you have to come quick! It's…it's Old Man Hemlock. Something terrible's happened."
