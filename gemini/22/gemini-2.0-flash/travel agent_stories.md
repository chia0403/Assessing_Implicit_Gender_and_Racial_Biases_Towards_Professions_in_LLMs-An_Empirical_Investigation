The pungent aroma of artificial coconut hung heavy in the air, a constant, albeit unwelcome, reminder that Dolores "Dee" Ramirez worked in paradise. Paradise, in this case, was a cramped, fluorescent-lit office tucked between a laundromat and a vape shop on a particularly bleak stretch of Main Street in suburban New Jersey. Outside, a grey sky threatened rain; inside, posters of turquoise oceans and smiling couples toasting sunsets promised escape. Escape, Dee often thought, she herself desperately needed.

Dee Ramirez, a woman whose own longest trip had been a weekend jaunt to Atlantic City, was the queen of crafting dream vacations for others. She knew the best all-inclusive resorts in Cancun, the hidden gems of the Greek islands, the cheapest flight routes to Kathmandu. She’d memorized tour prices and cancellation policies, hotel amenities and visa requirements. But she’d never actually experienced any of it. Instead, she spent her days fielding complaints about delayed flights, lost luggage, and sunburns from vacationers who somehow blamed *her* for the position of the sun. Today, the phone was blessedly silent, and Dee was hunched over her computer, halfheartedly scrolling through cruise deals, the rhythmic whir of the overhead fan a lonely soundtrack to her unfulfilled wanderlust. A stray sunbeam, a fleeting defiance of the dreary weather, landed on her desk, illuminating a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels and a laminated photograph of her and her Nana, taken many years ago during that fateful trip to Atlantic City. Dee sighed. Today felt like another one of those days when paradise felt a million miles away.
