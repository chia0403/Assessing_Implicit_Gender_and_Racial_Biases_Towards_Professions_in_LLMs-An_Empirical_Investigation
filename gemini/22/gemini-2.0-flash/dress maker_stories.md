## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, thick and syrupy, poured through the grimy window of Agnes Willowby's workshop, bathing the room in a golden, dust-mote-filled haze. Agnes, her silver hair escaping its haphazard bun in rebellious wisps, squinted at the shimmering taffeta draped across her antique mannequin. She was so close to finishing the bodice, the last delicate tendril of embroidered forget-me-nots winding its way towards the neckline. A sigh escaped her lips, a sound like the rustling of silk itself. It was a beautiful creation, perhaps the most beautiful she'd ever made. Yet, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. This wasn't for a bride, glowing with anticipation. This wasn't for a debutante, eager to make her mark. This was for a shroud.

## Setting:

Agnes Willowby's workshop occupied the top floor of a creaking, three-story building in the heart of Grimsborough, a town perpetually cloaked in a melancholic fog and whispered secrets. The building itself, aptly named "The Threadbare Tower," leaned precariously, a testament to the town's slow decay and a reflection of its inhabitants' weary acceptance of their fate. Within the workshop, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and beeswax, a fragrant shield against the pervasive smell of coal smoke that clung to everything in Grimsborough. Shelves crammed with bolts of fabric in every imaginable texture and hue lined the walls, a vibrant explosion of color against the muted tones of the crumbling plaster. Spools of thread, like tiny jewels, glittered on cluttered worktables alongside antique buttons, tarnished thimbles, and Agnes's most prized possession: a cast-iron sewing machine, its ornate details worn smooth with decades of use. This room, filled with the ghosts of countless stitches and dreams woven into cloth, was Agnes's sanctuary, a place where beauty could still be coaxed from the gloom.
