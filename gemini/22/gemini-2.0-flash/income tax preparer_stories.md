**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the laminated wood-grain desks and the perpetually-sticky surface of the shared coffee maker. It was mid-March, the peak of tax season at "H&H Tax Solutions" in the strip mall off Highway 37. The air was thick with the scent of burnt coffee, cheap paper, and barely-suppressed desperation. Outside, the relentless Indiana wind whipped a flurry of discarded receipts and tumbleweeds of unfulfilled dreams across the parking lot. Inside, it felt like a pressure cooker, counting down the days until April 15th.

**Story Opening:**

Mildred Abigail Featherstone, her name as fanciful as her life was mundane, stared out the window, watching the aforementioned debris dance in the parking lot. She sighed, a small, almost imperceptible sound lost in the cacophony of keyboard clicks and phone rings. Mildred had been preparing taxes at H&H for thirteen years, a fact that seemed less an accomplishment and more a sentence. Thirteen years of deciphering W-2s, itemized deductions, and the haunted looks in the eyes of people facing the IRS. Thirteen years of the same beige walls, the same lukewarm coffee, the same stifled dreams. Today, however, felt different. Today, the hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to be vibrating with a peculiar energy, a subtle tremor in the fabric of the ordinary that sent a shiver down her spine. Today, Mildred Abigail Featherstone felt a spark ofâ€¦ something. What that "something" was, she couldn't quite say. But as the bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her first client of the day, Mildred knew her perfectly predictable life was about to take a very unpredictable turn.
