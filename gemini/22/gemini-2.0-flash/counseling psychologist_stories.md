Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, thick with the dust of a long Arizona summer, bled through the slatted blinds of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's office. The room was deliberately calming: soft sage-green walls, framed prints of Georgia O'Keeffe desert blooms, and the gentle murmur of a small, recirculating fountain. Ellie had painstakingly curated the space to foster a sense of safety and trust. Even the overstuffed, floral-patterned armchair, which had seen better days, was chosen for its welcoming embrace. Outside, the sounds of Scottsdale traffic were muffled, leaving only the hum of the air conditioner and the quiet ticking of a grandfather clock in the waiting room.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth steepled her fingers, her gaze unwavering as she observed the young man across from her. "So, Mr. Davies, you're saying the dreams have become…more vivid?" she prompted gently, her voice a low, soothing balm against the palpable tension radiating from him. He shifted uncomfortably in the floral chair, his knuckles white as he gripped the armrests. The air conditioning whirred a monotonous rhythm, a counterpoint to the frantic pulse Ellie could practically feel emanating from him. She’d seen this posture before, the tightly coiled spring of anxiety ready to unleash. She just needed the right question, the gentle nudge, to help him release it safely.
