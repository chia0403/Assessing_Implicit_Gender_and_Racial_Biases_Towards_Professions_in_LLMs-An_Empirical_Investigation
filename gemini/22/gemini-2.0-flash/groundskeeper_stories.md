**Opening:**

The rasp of metal against stone was the first thing that stirred Silas Maxwell Hawthorne from his slumber. Not the gentle chirping of birds, nor the rustling leaves whispering secrets to the dawn, but the insistent, grating scrape of someone’s ill-maintained gardening trowel against the weathered headstone of Agnes Periwinkle. Silas groaned, pulling the threadbare patchwork quilt tighter around his shoulders. 5:00 AM. Too damn early for even the departed to be demanding attention.

He squinted through the single, dust-streaked windowpane of his cottage, confirming his suspicion. A figure, silhouetted against the pearlescent sky, was indeed hacking away at the base of a crumbling monument, seemingly oblivious to the sacrilege of their actions. Silas knew he had to intervene. Agnes had been a particular favorite of his. He remembered planting forget-me-nots at her grave every spring, their delicate blue mirroring the shade of her faded photograph he’d seen tucked into her granddaughter’s palm after the funeral, what felt like centuries ago.

**Setting:**

Silas’s cottage, a small, ivy-choked structure with a perpetually leaning chimney, sat nestled in the far corner of the Oakhaven Cemetery. Oakhaven was an ancient burial ground, sprawling across a gentle hillside overlooking the quaint, sleepy town of Hollow Creek. The headstones, some dating back to the 17th century, were a tapestry of lichen-covered granite and moss-draped marble, each a silent testament to lives lived and lost. Gnarled oak trees, the cemetery's namesake, stood sentinel, their branches intertwining to create a canopy that filtered the sunlight into dappled patterns on the graves below. Wrought-iron gates, adorned with intricate skeletal designs, marked the main entrance, a stark reminder of the finality that awaited all who passed through them. Silence reigned supreme here, broken only by the occasional caw of a crow or the mournful whistle of the wind whispering through the towering pines. Silas Maxwell Hawthorne was its keeper, its guardian, and its most permanent resident, aside from the inhabitants beneath the soil. He was, in every sense of the word, Oakhaven's groundskeeper.
