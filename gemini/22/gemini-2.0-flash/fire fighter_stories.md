## Story Opening:

The acrid tang of burning plastic clawed at Lieutenant Elias Thorne's nostrils, even through the thick filter of his mask. He coughed, a dry, rattling sound that was swallowed by the roar of the inferno licking at the windows of the abandoned warehouse.  He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, leaving a smear of soot across his skin.  The heat pressed in, a suffocating blanket, making him feel like he was trapped inside a furnace.

"Thorne, report!" a voice crackled in his ear. It was Captain Ramirez, his voice tight with controlled urgency.

Elias took a deep breath, trying to ignore the frantic hammering of his heart. "Lieutenant Thorne here, Captain. We're through the loading dock.  Heavy smoke and zero visibility.  Suspect the fire's focused on the southeast quadrant."

"Confirmed.  Reports of a possible homeless encampment in that area, Thorne. Prioritize search and rescue.  Go, go, go!"

He tightened his grip on his axe, its steel head gleaming dully in the flickering orange light.  "Copy that, Captain. Let's move, team!" he yelled, his voice amplified by the comms.

He plunged into the black, acrid heart of the burning building, the screams of the fire his only guide.

## Setting:

The story begins on a cold, blustery November night in **Havenwood, Oregon**.  Havenwood is a small, forgotten town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, a place once booming with the timber industry, now struggling to stay afloat. The abandoned warehouse, a relic of Havenwood's prosperous past, stands on the edge of the industrial district, its broken windows staring blankly out at the dark expanse of the surrounding forest.  The air is thick with the scent of pine and rain, a constant reminder of the town's natural surroundings, now overshadowed by the choking fumes of the warehouse fire.  The town's volunteer fire department, undermanned and underfunded, is the only thing standing between the blaze and the rest of Havenwood.
