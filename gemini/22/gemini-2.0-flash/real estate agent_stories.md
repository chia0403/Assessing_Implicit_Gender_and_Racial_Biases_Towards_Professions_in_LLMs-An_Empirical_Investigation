Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a real estate agent:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The relentless Virginia summer clung to the air like a damp shroud, heavy and unforgiving. Perspiration beaded on the brow of Eleanor “Ellie” Ainsworth as she wrestled with the unruly "For Sale" sign, the metal hot enough to brand. Her floral sundress, usually a cheerful beacon in the sea of beige and gray that constituted suburban Ashburn, Virginia, felt sticky and oppressive.

"Just a little further, you obstinate piece of..." she muttered, giving the sign one final shove into the parched earth. It wobbled precariously. "There. Perfect."

Ellie Ainsworth, Realtor Extraordinaire (according to her business cards, at least), stepped back to admire her handiwork. The house at 44 Bluebell Lane was a classic example of early 2000s McMansion: faux brick, oversized windows, and enough square footage to comfortably house a family of ten, even if the current owners were only a retired couple who rattled around inside like marbles in a shoebox. It wasn't her favorite listing, but in this seller's market, even the most aesthetically challenged properties were flying off the shelves faster than a batch of fresh-baked cookies at a PTA bake sale.

Her phone buzzed, interrupting her appraisal. It was Mrs. Higgins, her client. Ellie braced herself. Mrs. Higgins had a penchant for early-morning calls and a mile-long list of demands. It was going to be one of *those* days. "Ainsworth Realty, Eleanor speaking," she chirped, injecting a level of enthusiasm she certainly didn't feel. "How can I help you, Mrs. Higgins?"

The answer, Ellie suspected, wouldn't be pleasant. This property already had 12 offers in hand, but nothing was ever enough for Mrs. Higgins.
