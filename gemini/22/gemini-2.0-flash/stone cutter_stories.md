## Story Opening:

The first sliver of dawn, a bruised purple barely discernible against the still-inky sky, found Silas Thistlewick already at his work. He coughed, the sound a rasp that echoed off the cold, gray stone surrounding him. The granite dust, a constant companion, clung to his throat like a stubborn vine. He spat onto the uneven ground, the sound barely louder than the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against the chisel. Before him, a colossal block of Carrara marble, scarred and marked with his previous attempts, waited patiently. This one, the Town Council had decreed, would be the centerpiece of the new fountain in the town square – a benevolent nymph, eternally offering water to the parched lips of the weary traveler.

Silas wasn't so sure about benevolent nymphs. He preferred gargoyles, with their grotesque faces and silent, watchful eyes. They understood the world, the weight of the stone, the bite of the wind. Nymphs, well, they just seemed…fragile. But contracts were contracts, and a man had to eat.
## Setting:

The quarry clung to the side of Mount Cinderheart like a tenacious tick. It was a desolate place, perpetually shrouded in a fine, gray dust that dulled the vibrant greens of the surrounding flora and coated everything in a film of gritty silence. The air was always cool, even in the height of summer, and carried the faint, metallic scent of iron and shattered rock.

The quarry itself was a jagged scar on the landscape. Raw faces of granite and marble rose hundreds of feet, laced with veins of quartz that shimmered in the rare bursts of sunlight. Scattered around the base were haphazard piles of discarded stone, rejected for flaws or imperfections. Small wooden sheds, housing tools and rudimentary living spaces for the stone cutters, dotted the perimeter, clinging precariously to the uneven ground. The entire place felt ancient and unforgiving, a testament to the enduring power of the mountains and the relentless labor of those who dared to carve them.

The nearest town, Oakhaven, lay nestled in the valley below, a collection of thatched roofs and winding cobblestone streets. It relied on the quarry for its livelihood, but maintained a respectful distance, as if wary of disturbing the mountain’s slumber.
