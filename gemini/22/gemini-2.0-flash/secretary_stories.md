The clack of Dorothy Ainsworth's typewriter was the only sound that dared to disrupt the suffocating stillness of the 14th floor. Outside, the rain hammered against the panoramic windows of the Sterling Industries Building, blurring the cityscape into a watercolour mess of grey and steel. Inside, the air, recycled and filtered into near-oblivion, hung heavy with the phantom scent of Mr. Sterling's ever-present pipe tobacco and the lingering anxieties of the perpetually stressed executives who resided in their glass-walled offices.

Dorothy, perched on her ergonomic (yet still uncomfortable) chair, was a splash of colour in this monochrome world. Her floral patterned dress, a valiant attempt to inject some cheer into a Thursday afternoon that felt like a Monday morning, was a silent rebellion against the corporate drone code. She diligently typed, the rhythmic beat a small act of defiance against the monotonous routine that had become the soundtrack to her life for the past seven years. Seven years she had been the faithful secretary, first to Mr. Finch, now to the increasingly volatile Mr. Thompson, both equally convinced that their empire was on the brink of collapse and Dorothy held the keys to averting disaster in the precise arrangement of their paperclips.
