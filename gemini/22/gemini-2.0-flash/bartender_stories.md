## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The dimly lit interior of "The Gilded Lily," a speakeasy hidden in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. The year is 1928, and the air hangs thick with cigarette smoke, the scent of illicit gin, and the murmur of hushed conversations. Jazz music spills from a hidden gramophone, barely audible above the clinking glasses and boisterous laughter that erupts periodically from the crowded tables. Crimson velvet drapes adorn the walls, reflecting the flickering candlelight and lending the space a decadent, almost theatrical, feel.

**Story Opening:**

The sweat beaded on Rosaline "Rose" Dubois' brow as she expertly muddled mint and sugar in a frosted glass. Another Mint Julep for Mr. Hawthorne, the self-proclaimed King of Cotton. He'd been nursing the same drink for the past hour, his eyes bloodshot and his voice growing progressively louder. Rose sighed internally. It was going to be one of those nights. 

"Rose, darlin'," a voice crooned from the end of the bar, a drawl thick enough to spread on toast. Rose glanced up, her lips forming a practiced smile. "Give the gentleman here a proper Sazerac, would you? He looks like he could use it."

Rose recognized the speaker immediately: Mr. Beaumont, the owner of The Gilded Lily and a man who always seemed to know exactly what everyone in the room needed, and sometimes, what they were thinking. She nodded, her fingers already moving to grab the rye whiskey, bitters, and absinthe needed to craft the New Orleans classic. Rose had learned the art of distraction well, and tonight, with the atmosphere growing increasingly restless, she suspected she'd need every trick in her arsenal. The whispers about federal agents sniffing around had been growing louder all week. Rose knew, with a sickening certainty, that The Gilded Lily, and everyone inside it, was walking on borrowed time.
