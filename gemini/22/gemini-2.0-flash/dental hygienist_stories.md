Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you:

**Setting:**

The air in Dr. Sterling's "Smile Studio" in the upscale Seattle neighborhood of Queen Anne was a peculiar blend of minty fluoride, sterile antiseptic, and faint, lingering anxiety. Sunlight streamed through the large picture window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the gleaming, almost aggressively cheerful, dental equipment. Soothing jazz music, specifically chosen to be as unobtrusive as possible, played softly in the background, a futile attempt to mask the whirring of the drills that occasionally punctuated the peace.

**Opening:**

"Alright, Mr. Henderson, just relax those shoulders for me. We're almost done with the polishing."  Genevieve Elise Thorne, wearing her standard-issue teal scrubs and a determined smile that masked a deep-seated yearning for anything other than teeth, guided the suction tool with practiced precision. Mr. Henderson, a venture capitalist with a penchant for expensive watches and a deep-seated fear of plaque, mumbled something unintelligible from behind the plastic bib. Genevieve had seen it all before: the clenched fists, the sweaty brows, the averted gaze. After seven years as a dental hygienist, she could practically diagnose anxiety from across the room. But today, her mind wasn't on the state of Mr. Henderson's gums. It was on the email sheâ€™d received that morning - an email that threatened to shatter the predictable, albeit somewhat soul-crushing, routine she had carefully constructed.
