Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a butcher as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of sawdust and rosemary clung to the air inside "The Cleaver's Croft," a comforting aroma that, for Bartholomew "Bart" Croft, was as essential as breath itself. He hummed a tuneless melody, one his grandfather had whistled while sharpening his own knives decades ago, as he meticulously trimmed the fat from a plump shoulder of lamb. The early morning light, pale and watery, filtered through the frosted windows, painting dust motes in shimmering gold. Bart paused, wiping a stray drop of condensation from his brow with the back of his hand. Today was different. Today, the familiar comfort of routine was laced with a prickling unease. Old Mrs. Higgins hadn't collected her usual Tuesday order, and her house stood silent behind drawn curtains, an unsettling contrast to her normally bustling garden. But that wasn't it, not really. The unease was deeper, older, and it resonated somewhere beneath the bone-deep understanding Bart held for the meat in his hands, something primal and unsettling.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional village of Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling hills of rural England. The village is quaint and seemingly idyllic, the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and gossip travels faster than the River Wyvern that meanders through the valley.

**Specific Setting: The Cleaver's Croft**

"The Cleaver's Croft," Bart's butcher shop, is a cornerstone of Oakhaven. The building is a sturdy, two-story structure with a stone facade and a slate roof, dating back to the 18th century. Inside, the shop is divided into two main sections. The front section, open to the public, features a long, gleaming marble counter behind which Bart and his two assistants (his younger sister, Elara, and a jovial man named Thomas) serve customers. Racks of sausages, smoked hams, and various cuts of meat are displayed in glass-fronted refrigerated cases. Above, hooks dangle rows of cured meats and salamis, a testament to Bart's traditional curing methods. The air is thick with the smell of meat, herbs, and woodsmoke.

Behind the counter is a heavy oak door that leads to the back of the shop. This is where the real work happens: the butchering, the curing, and the preparation. Here, the atmosphere is more utilitarian. Stainless steel tables gleam under harsh fluorescent lights, and a walk-in chiller hums constantly. A collection of well-worn butcher knives hangs on a magnetic strip, each one meticulously sharpened and cared for. The back room also contains a smoking oven and various tools and equipment necessary for the craft.
