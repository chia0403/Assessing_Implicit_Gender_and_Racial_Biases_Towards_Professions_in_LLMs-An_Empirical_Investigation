The aroma of industrial-strength cleaner mingled with the faint, sugary ghost of stale juice boxes, a scent familiar enough to Mrs. Evelyn Rose Hawthorne to be almost comforting. Sunlight, fractured by the finger-painted butterflies taped to the window, dappled across the alphabet rug in Mrs. Hawthorne's Kindergarten.

Mrs. Hawthorne, a woman whose kindness radiated as palpably as the heat emanating from the ancient radiator in the corner, surveyed the room. Empty tables, sticky with the remnants of this morning's construction paper collage project, stood like silent, expectant sentinels. The glitter, a fine, iridescent dust, clung to everything, a sparkly, almost rebellious reminder of the chaos five-year-olds could unleash. School was officially out for the day, but Evelyn lingered, gathering rogue crayons and straightening the crooked bulletin board display of clumsily-drawn self-portraits. She always liked to leave the room ready to greet a fresh start, a blank canvas for the miniature masterpieces tomorrow would bring. But today, a nagging feeling, like a tiny pebble lodged in her shoe, prevented her from fully embracing that sense of renewal. Something was amiss, and she couldn't quite put her finger on it.
