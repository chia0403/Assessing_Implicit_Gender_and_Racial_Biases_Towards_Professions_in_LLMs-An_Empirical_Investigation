The scent of aged paper and lemon polish clung to the air in the Grand Reading Room, a comforting aroma that was as familiar to Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth as her own reflection. The light, filtered through towering stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classical literature, cast elongated rainbows across the polished mahogany floors. Towering shelves, filled with leather-bound tomes and meticulously organized paperbacks, stretched towards the vaulted ceiling, a testament to the endless pursuit of knowledge. This was the heart of the Blackwell Library in the sleepy Cotswolds village of Ashton-Under-Hill, and for the past twenty years, it had been Eleanor's sanctuary.

Not by boisterous schoolchildren on a field trip, nor by the low hum of whispered research, but by the lingering echo of a slamming door and the unsettling feeling that Eleanor was being watched. She glanced up from the delicate task of repairing a first edition of "Pride and Prejudice," her silver spectacles perched precariously on her nose, and frowned. The only other person currently in the Grand Reading Room was Mr. Hawthorne, perpetually asleep in his favorite armchair, snoring softly behind a copy of "War and Peace" that he had been “reading” for the better part of a decade.

A shiver prickled her skin, and Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, chief librarian and guardian of countless stories, felt a new and unwelcome one beginning to unfold around her.
