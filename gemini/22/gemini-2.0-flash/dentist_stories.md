## Story Opening:

The overhead light, a malevolent sun in the sterile sky of his examination room, glinted off Dr. Alistair Finch's meticulous collection of dental tools. He adjusted his magnifying glasses, the magnification blurring the world outside his small circle of focus, and leaned in closer to the patient slumped in his chair. Mr. Henderson, a retired accountant with a penchant for Werther's Originals, had been complaining of sensitivity to cold. Alistair, however, suspected something far more sinister lurking beneath the enamel.

He probed gently with his explorer, the sharp metal whispering against the tooth. He felt a familiar, unpleasant tingling in his own jaw, a phantom ache that always accompanied the anticipation of bad news. This wasn’t just a simple cavity. This was…deeper. He pulled back, his hand trembling, just a fraction, imperceptible to anyone but himself. 

Alistair cleared his throat, the sound strangely loud in the quiet room. "Mr. Henderson," he said, his voice carefully neutral, "I think we need to take some X-rays."

## Setting:

Dr. Alistair Finch's practice, "Finch Family Dentistry," occupied a converted Victorian house on Elm Street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Havenwood, a picture postcard of New England charm, boasted a town square dominated by a towering oak tree, a weekly farmer's market bursting with organic produce, and a crippling lack of excitement. The practice itself was a reflection of Alistair: impeccably clean, meticulously organized, and radiating an air of quiet, almost oppressive, professionalism.

The waiting room, painted a soothing shade of sage green, featured comfortable armchairs upholstered in a floral pattern, well-worn copies of National Geographic, and a fish tank populated by lethargic goldfish. Upstairs, the examination rooms were equipped with the latest dental technology, a testament to Alistair's unwavering commitment to providing the best possible care. However, despite the modern equipment and the calming decor, there was an underlying feeling of unease within the walls, a sense that something hidden was lurking beneath the surface of Havenwood's idyllic facade, mirroring the secrets buried deep within Alistair himself.
