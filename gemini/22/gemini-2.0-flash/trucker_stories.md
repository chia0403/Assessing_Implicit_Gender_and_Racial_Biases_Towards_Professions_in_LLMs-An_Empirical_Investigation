Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a trucker as the main character:

**Opening:**

The CB crackled to life, spitting static and a garbled voice that sounded suspiciously like Big Joe. "Breaker, breaker, this is the Ramblin' Man, anyone copy?"

Dust motes danced in the cab of the '78 Peterbilt, illuminating the worn, stitched-leather seams of the steering wheel under Evelyn Mae Johnson's calloused fingers. She sighed, a sound that mingled with the rumble of the diesel engine. Not today, Joe. She was trying to concentrate. The last thing Evelyn Mae needed was another one of Joe's tall tales about haunted rest stops or alien sightings over Area 51.

"Breaker's clear," she muttered, her voice raspy from the dry desert air and too many cigarettes. Outside, the sun beat down on the endless ribbon of Interstate 10, baking the asphalt to a shimmering mirage.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the cab of Evelyn Mae Johnson’s well-loved, if somewhat battered, 1978 Peterbilt 359. The interior is functional rather than fancy. Scratched vinyl seats are covered with a Navajo-patterned blanket. The dashboard is cluttered with maps, dog-eared paperback novels, and a half-empty bag of peanut M&Ms. A well-worn Bible sits tucked between the seat and the console. A dream catcher hangs from the rearview mirror.

Evelyn Mae is currently hauling a load of produce from Yuma, Arizona to Houston, Texas. The landscape outside is quintessential West Texas: flat, arid, and punctuated by the occasional Joshua tree or wind-battered gas station. The sun is relentless, and the heat rising off the road makes the horizon seem to ripple. This leg of the I-10 is notorious for its long stretches of nothingness, broken only by the occasional armadillo or the rare sight of another long-hauler. The air is thick with the smell of hot asphalt and diesel fumes. She’s been on the road for 14 hours straight and, despite the caffeine coursing through her veins, the monotony is starting to weigh on her.
