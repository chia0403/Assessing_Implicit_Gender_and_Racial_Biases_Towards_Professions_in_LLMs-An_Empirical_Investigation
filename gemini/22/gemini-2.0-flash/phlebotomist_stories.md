Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist:

**Story Opening:**

The faint hum of the fluorescent lights was a constant, maddening companion to Alistair Finch as he prepped his tray. He knew, without looking at the schedule, that Mrs. Henderson in Room 312 would be requesting extra ice water, Mr. Davies in 308 would be complaining about the needle gauge (again), and young Timmy Miller down the hall would likely burst into tears the moment Alistair approached with his tourniquet. It was a Tuesday, which, in Alistair's experience, was precisely as awful as any other day in a hospital setting. He sighed, the sound swallowed by the sterile air. He smoothed a wrinkle from his pristine white coat and picked up the first requisition form. Alistair loved the medical science behind his job, the intricate dance of veins and valves, the silent language of blood. He *did not* love the patients.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **St. Jude's General Hospital**, a mid-sized hospital located in the fictional town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. St. Jude's is a relatively modern facility, all clean lines, muted colors, and vaguely soothing abstract art in the hallways. It's a busy place, serving a mix of rural and suburban patients. The specific location within the hospital is the **3rd floor medical-surgical unit**, a bustling ward with a mix of patients recovering from surgeries, dealing with chronic illnesses, and receiving acute care. It is a microcosm of the hospital itself, filled with a rotating cast of doctors, nurses, aides, and of course, phlebotomists like Alistair, all navigating the delicate balance between healing and bureaucratic red tape.
