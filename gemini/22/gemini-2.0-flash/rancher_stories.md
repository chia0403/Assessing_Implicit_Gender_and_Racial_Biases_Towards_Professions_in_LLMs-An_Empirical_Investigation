The relentless Arizona sun beat down on the parched earth, baking it to a dull, dusty red. Dust devils, tiny swirling demons of sand and regret, danced across the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in Isabella Rose Navarro's gut. Sweat plastered her dark hair to her forehead as she leaned against the weathered fence post, the rough-hewn wood scratching against her calloused hand. Rancho del Cielo, her family's legacy, sprawled before her â€“ or at least, what was left of it. The once-lush pastures were now brittle and brown, the skeletal remains of what a year ago had been a vibrant sea of green. The creek, usually a babbling brook, was now just a ribbon of cracked mud, a painful reminder of the dwindling water supply.

Isabella Rose Navarro sighed, the dry desert air rasping in her throat. Her grandfather, Esteban, God rest his soul, would be turning in his grave. He had built Rancho del Cielo from nothing, carving a life out of this unforgiving landscape. Now, the bank was threatening foreclosure, the cattle were thin and thirsty, and the hope she'd clung to so fiercely was starting to crumble like the ancient adobe walls of the ranch house. She had one last chance, a long shot that felt more like a prayer whispered into the unforgiving wind.
