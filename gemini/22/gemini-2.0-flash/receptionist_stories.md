Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a receptionist named Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne:

**Setting:**

The lobby of Hawthorne & Croft, a venerable law firm specializing in trusts and estates, located on the 27th floor of the Commerce Building in downtown Chicago. The building itself, a steel and glass leviathan built in the 1980s, was all sharp angles and mirrored surfaces. Inside Hawthorne & Croft, however, a more sedate atmosphere reigned. Rich mahogany paneling lined the walls, interspersed with tasteful abstract art that Beatrice had always suspected were just tax write-offs for the partners. A plush, Persian rug muted the sounds of hurried footsteps, and the air was perpetually scented with the faint aroma of beeswax polish and expensive leather from the nearby library. Light filtered in through expansive windows offering panoramic views of Lake Michigan, usually obscured by a perpetual layer of city haze.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne hated Mondays. Correction, she hated *most* Mondays. This Monday, however, was vying for a special place in the pantheon of terrible Mondays, right up there with the one where a pigeon had flown into the lobby and taken residence on the bust of Judge Hawthorne (no relation, as Beatrice was quick to point out). This Monday, the elevator had chosen to malfunction right as she arrived, forcing her to trudge up twenty-seven flights of stairs in her sensible, but decidedly un-climbing-friendly, pumps. By the time she'd reached her desk, her feet were screaming, her lipstick was smeared, and her perfectly coiffed bun had loosened to a sad, droopy chignon. And then, as if sensing her weakened state, Mr. Croft, his face the color of overripe plum and his tie askew, had marched directly from the elevator (which was suddenly, inexplicably, working) and demanded she find him “that goddamn probate file from the Abernathy case” immediately, preferably before he lost his entire mind. Beatrice, still gasping for breath, managed a tight, professional smile and said, "Of course, Mr. Croft. Just let me grab a glass of water first."
