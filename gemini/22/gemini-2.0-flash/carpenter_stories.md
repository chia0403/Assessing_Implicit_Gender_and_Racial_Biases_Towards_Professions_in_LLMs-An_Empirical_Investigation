The crisp autumn air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, nipped at Josiah Blackwood's exposed cheeks. He’d spent the last hour bracing the flimsy scaffolding that clung precariously to the side of Mrs. Hathaway’s Victorian monstrosity, and his hands, already roughened by years of shaping wood, ached in protest. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the bare branches of the ancient oak tree that dominated the overgrown lawn, painting the faded turquoise paint of the house in fleeting shades of orange and violet.

Josiah Blackwood sighed, the sound lost to the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He wasn't fond of heights, not one bit. And Mrs. Hathaway’s house, with its crumbling gingerbread trim and sagging porch, felt more like a haunted relic than a home in need of repair. He shifted his weight, the planks of the scaffolding groaning ominously beneath him. The job itself was simple enough - replace the rotted window frames on the second story - but the house... the house gave him the creeps.
