The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Reyes, plastering strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She pulled her wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her cheek as she surveyed the skeletal frame of the building rising against the slate-grey Edinburgh sky.  Scaffolding clung to the concrete bones like a metal parasite, and the clang of hammers and the whine of drills echoed off the surrounding Georgian townhouses.  This was the Chalmers Institute, Amelia’s most ambitious project yet: a modern art museum nestled in the heart of Edinburgh’s historic New Town.  A shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down her spine.  This building was her gamble, her reputation poured into concrete and steel. And right now, looking at the exposed framework against that unforgiving sky, she felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach.  Would it be a masterpiece or a monstrosity?  Only time, and a lot more work, would tell.
