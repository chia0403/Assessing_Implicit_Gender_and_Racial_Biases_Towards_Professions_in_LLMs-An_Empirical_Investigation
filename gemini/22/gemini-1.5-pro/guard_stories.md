The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aerilon, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  His breath plumed out in frosty puffs, momentarily obscuring the view of the obsidian Citadel that dominated the landscape.  Built from volcanic rock and reinforced with spells older than the kingdom itself, the Citadel of Whispers served as both Elias's prison and his purpose.  He was a Whisper Guard, sworn to protect the secrets held within its walls, secrets that could shatter the fragile peace holding the warring nations of Aerilon together.  Tonight, however, the only whispers Elias heard were those of the wind, an unsettling prelude to the storm brewing on the horizon â€“ both literal and metaphorical.  The sky, normally a canvas of swirling purples and blues, had darkened to an ominous bruise-coloured grey. And something else was different. A prickling sensation danced on the back of Elias's neck, the familiar warning of encroaching magic.  He gripped the hilt of his enchanted blade, the cold steel a reassuring presence against his palm.  Tonight, the Citadel would need more than its walls. Tonight, it would need him.
