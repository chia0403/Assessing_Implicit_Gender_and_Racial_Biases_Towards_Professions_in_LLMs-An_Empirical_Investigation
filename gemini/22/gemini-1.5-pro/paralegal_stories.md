Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the K&B Legal offices, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Hayes.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of files threatening to topple from her desk.  Amelia, her full name Amelia Grace Hayes, chewed on the end of her pen, the bitter taste of ink doing little to soothe the knot in her stomach.  It was 7:48 pm on a Friday, the rest of the paralegals had long since fled for the weekend, and she was drowning in paperwork for the Peterson case, a particularly nasty divorce involving a disputed yacht and a surprisingly large collection of antique porcelain dolls.  The air in the small office, usually stuffy with the scent of stale coffee and ambition, was thick with the ozone smell of the approaching storm.  Downtown Charleston, usually vibrant even this late, was eerily quiet, the only sounds the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the distant rumble of thunder. Something about the stillness, coupled with the weight of the Peterson case, made Amelia feel uneasy.  She had the distinct impression she wasnâ€™t alone.
