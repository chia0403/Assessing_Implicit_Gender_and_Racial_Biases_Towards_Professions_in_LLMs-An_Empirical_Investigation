The rhythmic clatter of the Singer sewing machine, a counterpoint to the mournful foghorn echoing through the San Francisco fog, was the soundtrack of Eliza June Templeton's life. Her atelier, "Seams Like a Dream," nestled between a bustling fish market and a dusty antique shop on Pier 45, was a haven of shimmering silks, intricate lace, and the faint, sweet scent of lavender sachets tucked amongst bolts of fabric.  Sunlight, filtered through the salt-streaked windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the intricate beadwork on a half-finished gown draped over a dress form. Outside, the year was 1948, and the city, still recovering from the war, buzzed with a nervous energy. Inside, Eliza, with her auburn hair pinned back in a practical knot and her nimble fingers guiding a needle through layers of ivory satin, existed in a world of timeless elegance and quiet concentration.  But the serenity wouldn't last. A sharp rap at the door, followed by the jangle of the bell above it, heralded an interruption â€“ and a change in the carefully stitched fabric of Eliza's life.
