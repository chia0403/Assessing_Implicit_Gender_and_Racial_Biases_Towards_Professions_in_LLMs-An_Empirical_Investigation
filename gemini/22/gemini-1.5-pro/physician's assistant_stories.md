The insistent chirping of cicadas, a soundtrack as familiar to Elara Reyes as her own heartbeat, vibrated through the humid Georgia air. Spanish moss, heavy with the day's gathering moisture, draped from the live oaks surrounding the small, clapboard clinic like a spectral embrace.  The late afternoon sun, already beginning its descent, painted the sky in bruised shades of orange and purple.  Inside, the air conditioning battled the oppressive heat, humming a monotonous counterpoint to the cicadas. Elara, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white coat, tapped a gloved finger against a stainless steel exam table, the metallic ping echoing in the otherwise silent examination room.  Pine Ridge Clinic, the only medical facility for miles in rural Echols County, held a stillness that felt both peaceful and pregnant with the potential for sudden, urgent activity. It was the kind of quiet that whispered of secrets held close, of lives lived in the shadows of towering pines and the slow, relentless crawl of time.
