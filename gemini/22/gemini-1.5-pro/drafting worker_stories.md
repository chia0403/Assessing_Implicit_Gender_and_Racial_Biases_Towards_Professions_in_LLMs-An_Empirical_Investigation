The flickering fluorescent lights of Darrow & Sons Architectural Design hummed a monotonous B-flat above Amelia Grace Holloway's head. The air, thick with the scent of blueprint ink and stale coffee, clung to her like a second skin. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune against the skyscraper windows, a stark contrast to the sterile silence within the drafting room. Amelia, hunched over a sprawling blueprint of the proposed McCormick Place expansion, meticulously rendered a cross-section of the building's foundation with her 0.5mm mechanical pencil.  The lead whispered across the vellum, a sound only she seemed to notice in the cavernous room, where the only other occupants were a snoring Mr. Henderson, slumped over his drafting table in the corner, and the rhythmic click-clack of the ancient blueprint machine spitting out copies in the adjacent room.  It was 7:17 pm on a Friday, and Amelia, despite the gnawing emptiness in her stomach, was determined to perfect this detail before heading home to her tiny apartment in Wicker Park. This particular section, a complex web of steel and concrete pilings designed to anchor the building against the unpredictable whims of Lake Michigan, had been plaguing her all week.
