The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, whistling a mournful tune around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled with a tangled mess of extension cords.  Frost crunched under her steel-toed boots, the icy air nipping at any exposed skin. Eleanor, her breath puffing out in white clouds, squinted up at the two-story Victorian house looming before her.

The porch light flickered erratically, a strobe light against the gathering dusk, the source of her current frustration.  This was the oldest house on the block, in the oldest part of Alderâ€™s Bend, and its wiring was, to put it mildly, a fire hazard waiting to happen.
