The rusty aroma of brake fluid and exhaust fumes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez.  Her garage, "Bea's Bolts and Bearings," was nestled between a laundromat perpetually exuding the scent of dryer sheets and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the sleepy, sun-baked town of Harmony Creek, Arizona.  The only things that moved faster than the tumbleweeds rolling down Main Street were Bea's hands as she tightened the bolts on a '67 Mustang's carburetor. The late afternoon sun, a molten orange disc, dipped below the jagged peaks of the Superstition Mountains, casting long shadows across the cracked concrete floor.  A battered radio in the corner sputtered out a static-laced blues tune, the only sound competing with the rhythmic clink of Bea's tools.  This Thursday, however, was about to become anything but typical.  A sleek, black car, the kind Bea had only seen in magazines, purred to a stop outside the garage, its tinted windows obscuring the driver.
