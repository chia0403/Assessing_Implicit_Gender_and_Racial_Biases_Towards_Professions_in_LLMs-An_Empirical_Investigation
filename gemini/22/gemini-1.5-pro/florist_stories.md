The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder’s shears.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, shimmered under a late April sun, still weak but promising warmth. Salt air, tinged with the sweet perfume of hyacinths escaping Eliza’s shop, drifted on the breeze. Inside, nestled amongst buckets overflowing with vibrant blooms and trailing greenery, Eliza crafted a cascade bouquet of blush pink peonies and ivory roses, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Port Blossom, despite its charming name, wasn't always a haven of tranquility, and a storm was brewing, one far more tempestuous than the usual coastal squalls.  It had arrived in the form of a single, extravagant order for a wedding, a wedding that threatened to upend the delicate ecosystem of Eliza's carefully cultivated life.
