The clatter of pots and pans was Evelyn Rose Hawthorne’s morning symphony.  The pre-dawn light, a bruised purple hue, filtered through the grimy windows of the Seafoam Diner, illuminating swirling motes of flour dust that danced in the perpetually greasy air. Evelyn, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, hummed along to the rhythm of her work, the scent of frying bacon already permeating the small, salt-laced space.  The Seafoam, perched on a crumbling bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic in the tiny, forgotten town of Port Blossom, Maine, wasn't much to look at.  Its faded turquoise paint peeled in strips, and the neon sign out front flickered erratically, sometimes spelling “Saefo Diner” or just “Diner.” But for Evelyn, it was home, a refuge, and her canvas. Each plate she sent out, whether a stack of blueberry pancakes or a perfectly grilled haddock sandwich, was a testament to her quiet artistry.  Today, however, the air crackled with a different energy, a nervous anticipation that had nothing to do with the usual breakfast rush.  Something was brewing in Port Blossom, something beyond the usual fog and fishermen's tales.
