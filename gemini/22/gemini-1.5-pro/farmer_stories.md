The biting wind whipped across the frost-covered fields of Abernathy Farm, stinging Elias Thatcher's cheeks as he surveyed his land.  Dawn was barely a whisper of pale grey in the east, the only illumination coming from the single lantern Elias carried.  His breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the stark, skeletal branches of the apple orchard that dominated the near horizon.  Abernathy Farm, nestled in the heart of the Vermont valley, had been in Elias' family for five generations, each passing year etching deeper lines into the weathered farmhouse and the hands that worked the soil.  This year, however, the frost seemed to have arrived earlier than usual, a brittle, icy finger reaching out to grasp the heart of the coming harvest.
