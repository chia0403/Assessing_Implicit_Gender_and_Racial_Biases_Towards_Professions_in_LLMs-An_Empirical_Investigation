The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast stripes across Elias Thorne's worn leather massage table.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, hung heavy and still in the small, single-room studio. Located above Mrs. Higgins' perpetually dusty antique shop on the sleepy main street of Harmony Creek, Oregon, Serenity Now wasn't exactly a bustling hub of activity.  But for Elias, it was a sanctuary, a place where knotted muscles and weary souls found solace under his skilled hands. The rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the shop below punctuated the silence, a metronome for the quiet anxieties of the small town he'd reluctantly called home for the past five years.  Today, however, the usual tranquility felt different, charged with a subtle, unsettling energy that Elias couldn't quite place.
