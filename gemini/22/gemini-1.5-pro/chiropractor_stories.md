The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the oversized windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, each drop a tiny, icy fist against the glass. The rhythmic drumming was a counterpoint to the low thrum of the electric muscle stimulator attached to Mrs. Henderson's lower back.  The "Thorne Chiropractic and Wellness Center," nestled between a laundromat and a struggling Vietnamese noodle house in the sleepy town of Astoria, wasn't exactly glamorous.  Sea air, tinged with the faint scent of fish and pine, perpetually clung to the worn, navy blue carpet. Elias, his dark hair plastered to his forehead by the humidity, adjusted the intensity of the stimulator, his fingers lingering for a moment on the fragile bones of Mrs. Henderson's spine.  He'd been feeling a strange tingling in his own hands lately, a persistent hum beneath the skin that he couldn't quite explain.  He dismissed it as fatigue, the result of long hours and the constant damp chill that seemed to settle deep in his bones. Outside, the foghorn from the nearby lighthouse moaned low and mournful, a sound that mirrored the unease growing in Elias's gut.  Something feltâ€¦ off.
