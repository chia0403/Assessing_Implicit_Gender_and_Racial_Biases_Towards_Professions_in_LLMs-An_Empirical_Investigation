The Sanctuary for Forgotten Creatures nestled in the heart of the Redwood National and State Parks, a hidden haven for animals deemed too old, too sick, or too "troublesome" for other facilities.  Mia, head caretaker and practically raised within these very walls, inhaled the crisp air tinged with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a scent she considered more home than any roof ever could be.  Her boots crunched on a thin layer of ice that had formed overnight on the path leading to the aviary, its wire mesh glinting faintly in the burgeoning light.  A symphony of rustling feathers and chirps greeted her, a familiar welcome chorus that always started her day. Today, however, a distinct uneasiness prickled beneath her skin, a feeling as sharp and cold as the wind itself.
