The flickering gaslights of the Moulin Noir cast an eerie glow on the cobbled alleyway, painting the falling snow a sickly yellow.  A lone figure, wrapped in a threadbare shawl despite the chill, hurried through the swirling flakes, her breath clouding the air before her.  This was Montmartre, Paris, 1888. A place of artists and poets, of dreamers and degenerates, and tonight, it was a cage for Céleste Moreau.  Her voice, usually a weapon of captivating power, was tonight a fragile whisper, a prayer against the biting wind as she clutched a crumpled letter in her gloved hand.  The ink, blurred by melting snow, spoke of a cancelled engagement, a missed opportunity, and a dwindling hope.  The Moulin Rouge, its iconic red windmill a beacon of warmth and revelry, stood mockingly across the boulevard, a stark reminder of the life Céleste was so desperately clinging to.
