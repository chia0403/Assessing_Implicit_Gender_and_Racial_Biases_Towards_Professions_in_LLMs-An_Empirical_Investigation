The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually lulled Elara Jane Holloway into a meditative state while she polished glasses. Tonight, however, it only amplified the gnawing unease in her gut.  The Rusty Mug, nestled in the forgotten corner of Port Blossom, Maine, was usually a haven of warmth and salty sea air, the kind of place where fishermen untangled their nets of stories alongside their fishing lines.  But tonight, the air was thick with something else, a tension that clung to the damp wood and the flickering gas lamps like cobwebs.  Elara, her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped down the mahogany bar with a practiced hand, her emerald green eyes scanning the deserted room.  It was past midnight, well past the usual trickle of late-night stragglers.  Even Old Man Hemlock, who usually nursed a single beer until closing time, had vanished without a trace.  The only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a hammer blow against the silence.
