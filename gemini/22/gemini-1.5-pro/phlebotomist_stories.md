The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the sterile white walls of the phlebotomy lab.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxious thrum in Amelia Reyes's chest.  It was 5:47 AM, the pre-dawn gloom clinging to the edges of the room like a reluctant ghost. Amelia, bundled in a navy scrub top over a lime green t-shirt – her tiny act of rebellion against the mandated dress code – adjusted the tourniquet on her own arm, practicing her venipuncture technique.  She needed to be sharp; today was the day Dr. Moreau's groundbreaking clinical trial officially started, and Amelia, the head phlebotomist, was responsible for drawing the first samples.  The weight of the moment, the potential this trial held, pressed upon her like the heavy, ozone-tinged air before a summer storm.  She exhaled slowly, a puff of breath fogging the cold stainless steel of the counter, and murmured to herself, "Steady hand, Reyes. Steady hand."
