Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Grace Holloway's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The cityscape of Chicago glittered below, a million pinpricks of light reflecting in the slick, dark streets.  Her office, perched high on the forty-second floor of the prestigious Wainwright Tower, usually offered a breathtaking panorama, a comforting reminder of her hard-won success. But tonight, the view only amplified her isolation.  The mahogany desk was strewn with documents pertaining to the Peterson case – a messy divorce involving a prominent CEO and accusations of embezzlement.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and Amelia's own mounting anxiety.  She rubbed her temples, the faint throb of a headache beginning to build behind her eyes.  At 32, Amelia was one of the youngest partners at the firm, her reputation built on meticulous preparation and an unwavering commitment to her clients.  But this case…this case was different.  It felt less like law and more like navigating a minefield blindfolded.  Something felt wrong, deeply wrong, and tonight, with the storm raging outside, that feeling had solidified into a chilling certainty.
