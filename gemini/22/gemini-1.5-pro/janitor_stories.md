The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished linoleum floor. Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket across the deserted lab, the squeaky wheels a lonely counterpoint to the hum.  It was well past midnight, the air thick with the sterile scent of bleach and the faint, metallic tang Elias had come to associate with the cutting edge of genetic research. Outside, a late summer storm raged, lashing rain against the panoramic windows overlooking the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Alexandria.  Tonight, however, Elias wasn’t focused on the storm or the city lights.  His attention was fixed on a small, blinking red light emanating from beneath a locked laboratory door marked “Project Chimera – Authorized Personnel Only."
