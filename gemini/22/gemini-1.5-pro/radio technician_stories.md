The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Mojave Desert, whistling through the rusted guy-wires of the colossal radio telescope.  Amelia Reyes, her full name ringing in her own ears as much from the echoing silence as from the wind's howl, adjusted the thick knit cap pulled low over her brows.  Above her, the dish, a colossal metal ear pointed towards the inky black sprinkled with a million diamonds, hummed with low, almost inaudible energy.  The Barstow Radio Observatory, once a bustling hub of scientific discovery, was now Amelia's lonely domain, a kingdom of static and fading signals where she reigned as the sole technician, keeper of the dying embers of a forgotten science. The nearest town, a dusty speck on the horizon, was fifty miles away, a distance measured not in kilometers but in the wavering strength of the AM radio signal she sometimes managed to catch in her battered pickup truck. Tonight, however, even the familiar crackle of static was absent. An unnerving silence had fallen over the desert, a silence that seemed to press in on Amelia, a palpable presence as thick and heavy as the desert air before a sandstorm.
