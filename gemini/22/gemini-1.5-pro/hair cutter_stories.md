The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  The Thorne Family Barbershop, nestled between Mrs. O’Malley’s perpetually fragrant bakery and Mr. Henderson’s dusty antique store, had been a fixture on Sycamore Street for three generations.  Elias, the latest in the Thorne line of scissor-wielding artisans, stood bathed in the warm glow of the late afternoon sun that streamed through the large front window. Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the rows of gleaming tonics, the worn leather strop hanging from the wall, and the faded photographs of his grandfather and father, both proudly holding their shears. Outside, the drowsy hum of a summer afternoon in Havenwood, Indiana, drifted in, punctuated by the occasional chirp of a robin and the distant rumble of a passing tractor. This Wednesday, however, held a different kind of stillness, a heavy quiet that Elias couldn’t quite place.  It was the kind of quiet that preceded a storm, not one of rain and thunder, but something else entirely.
