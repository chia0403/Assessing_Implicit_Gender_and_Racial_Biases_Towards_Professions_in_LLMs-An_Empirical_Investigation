Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Kestrel Corporation headquarters, blurring the already fading cityscape of Seattle into a watery impressionist painting. Inside, the air crackled with the low hum of servers and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of keyboards.  Eleanor Vance, a systems analyst with a penchant for oversized cardigans and an even greater one for solving complex technical puzzles, stared intently at her monitor.  Lines of code scrolled past, a digital waterfall cascading down the screen.  It was 3:17 AM, well past quitting time for most sane individuals, but Eleanor wasn't most individuals.  A rogue process, dubbed "The Ghost" by her exasperated colleagues, had been plaguing Kestrel's internal network for weeks, intermittently disrupting communications and corrupting minor data files.  Tonight, Eleanor was determined to exorcise it.  The air in her small, cluttered office, usually filled with the comforting aroma of Earl Grey tea, was thick with the metallic tang of burnt coffee and the electric scent of ozone from her overworked laptop.  Tonight, there would be no sleep until The Ghost was laid to rest.
