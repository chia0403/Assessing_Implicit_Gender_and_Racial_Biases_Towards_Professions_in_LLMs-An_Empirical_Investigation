The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered, a kaleidoscope of polished marble, crystal chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of affluent guests.  Rain lashed against the tall arched windows, mirroring the restless energy thrumming beneath Genevieve Beaumont’s impeccably tailored jacket.  Genevieve, the hotel’s Chief Concierge, a woman whose name was synonymous with discretion and efficiency, tapped a manicured nail against her mahogany desk.  It was the Thursday before Christmas, a notoriously chaotic time even within the rarefied world of the Magnifique, perched high above the bustling streets of Geneva.  The scent of pine from the towering Christmas tree in the center of the lobby mingled with the subtler aroma of expensive perfume and the faint, metallic tang of impending snow.  Genevieve’s phone buzzed, a discreet vibration against the polished wood.  A request, no doubt, another demand on her seemingly limitless resources.  She took a deep breath, composing her features into a serene mask, the very picture of calm amidst the storm.  This, after all, was her element. This was where Genevieve Beaumont thrived.
