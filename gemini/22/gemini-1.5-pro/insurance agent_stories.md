Rain lashed against the window of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the persistent ache in her temples.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of claim forms and brochures for "Hawthorne's Haven Insurance" littering her otherwise meticulously organized desk. Amy, her full name Amelia Constance Hawthorne, rubbed her tired eyes, the faint scent of stale coffee clinging to her fingertips. Her small office, tucked away on the second floor of a faded brick building on Elm Street in the perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, usually offered a sense of calm, a predictable haven in a world of unexpected calamities. But tonight, even the familiar chipped mug bearing the slogan “I <3 Insurance” couldn't dispel the creeping unease settling in her stomach. The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly towards 7 pm, an hour past her usual closing time, and the storm outside showed no sign of abating.  Hollow Creek was known for its unpredictable weather, but this felt different, more ominous, like the quiet before something… unsettling… happened.
