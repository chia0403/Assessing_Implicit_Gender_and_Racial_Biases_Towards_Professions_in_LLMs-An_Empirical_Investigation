The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Creek, baking the town like a forgotten casserole in a hot oven. Inside Harmony Creek Pharmacy, the air conditioning hummed a soothing counterpoint to the dry desert wind whistling outside. Eleanor Vance, meticulously organized in her crisp white coat, sorted through a new shipment of prescription medications, the clinking of pill bottles a familiar rhythm in the otherwise quiet store. Her name tag, pinned neatly above her left breast pocket, read "Eleanor Vance, RPh" â€“ a badge of honor reflecting years of dedicated study and a commitment to the well-being of her community.  Harmony Creek might have been a small, sun-baked speck on the map, but for Eleanor, it was home, and its inhabitants were her responsibility. Little did she know, the stillness of that sweltering Tuesday afternoon was about to be shattered.
