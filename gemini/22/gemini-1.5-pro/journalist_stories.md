The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she stared up at the imposing edifice of Blackwood Manor.  Gargoyles, eroded smooth by centuries of rain and wind, leered down from the eaves, their stony gazes seemingly fixed on her.

Amelia, a seasoned journalist for the London Chronicle, normally thrived in the bustling energy of the city, but this assignment, investigating the disappearance of renowned historian, Professor Alistair Finch, had drawn her to this desolate corner of England.  The professor had vanished without a trace a month prior, last seen entering Blackwood Manor for research purposes.  Now, with local police baffled, Amelia was the only one left willing to pry open the doors of this ominous place and uncover the truth, whatever it might be. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a whisper of something ancient and unsettling that made the fine hairs on Amelia's arms stand on end.  This wasn't just a missing person case; Amelia could feel it in her bones.  This was something far more sinister.
