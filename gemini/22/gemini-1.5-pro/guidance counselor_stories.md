The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack that had become as familiar to her as the worn floral pattern on the armchair opposite her desk.  Northwood High, a sprawling brick behemoth perched on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Alder Creek, Oregon, was settling into its usual Friday afternoon torpor. Outside, the October rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the relentless drizzle of anxieties and teenage dramas that Eleanor navigated daily.  The air was thick with the scent of damp leaves and the faint, lingering aroma of pepperoni pizza from the cafeteria, a sensory cocktail that always evoked a strange mix of comfort and melancholy in her. This particular Friday, however, felt different. A preternatural stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock on her wall, a gift from her grandmother, its pendulum swinging like a silent metronome counting down toâ€¦ something.  Eleanor couldn't quite put her finger on it, but a prickle of unease ran down her spine, a feeling she hadn't experienced since the mysterious disappearance of student Sarah Jenkins three years prior, a case that remained unsolved and continued to cast a long shadow over Alder Creek.
