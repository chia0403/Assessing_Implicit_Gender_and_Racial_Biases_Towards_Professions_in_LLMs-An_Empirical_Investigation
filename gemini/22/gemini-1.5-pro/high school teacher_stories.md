Outside, the October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied dances across the parking lot, their rustle a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the janitor’s mop in the hallway. Elias, perched on the edge of his desk, cradled a steaming mug of black coffee, its bitter aroma a familiar comfort against the chill seeping in through the drafty windowpanes. His classroom, a vibrant chaos of Shakespearean posters, student artwork, and overflowing bookshelves, felt like a sanctuary amidst the looming dread of another Monday morning. Northwood, nestled in the heart of Vermont’s Green Mountains, was a town where change came slowly, like the creeping frost that was gradually painting the landscape in hues of crimson and gold. But this year, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a tension Elias couldn’t quite put his finger on, hung heavy, like the woodsmoke that clung to the valley in the evenings.
