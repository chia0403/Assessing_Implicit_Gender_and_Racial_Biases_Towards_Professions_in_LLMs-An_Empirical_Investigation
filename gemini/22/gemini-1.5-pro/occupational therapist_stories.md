The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia Hayes' cheeks as she navigated the winding driveway of Eventide Manor.  Built of grey stone and shadowed by ancient oaks, the manor seemed to hunch deeper into itself with each gust of wind, its many windows like dark, watchful eyes.  Amelia, bundled in a thick wool coat, adjusted the strap of her oversized bag, its weight a familiar comfort filled with the tools of her trade: adaptive cutlery, textured grips, and a rainbow assortment of therapeutic putty.  Today marked her first day as the live-in occupational therapist for Eventideâ€™s residents, a collection of individuals with varying degrees of physical and cognitive impairments.  Amelia, despite a decade of experience, felt a flutter of nerves beneath her professional calm.  Eventide had a reputation.  Some called it eccentric, others, more bluntly, whispered of it being haunted.  Amelia, a pragmatist at heart, dismissed such rumors, yet the manor's imposing presence, combined with the unsettling quiet, made it hard to shake a subtle feeling of unease.
