The neon green glow of the Big Texan Steak Ranch sign buzzed against the pre-dawn purple sky, casting an alien light across the dusty Texas panhandle.  Amarillo was still mostly asleep, but Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez was already rolling, her eighteen-wheeler, a cherry-red Kenworth W900 she affectionately called "Cherry Bomb," rumbling to life.  Bea, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted the brim of her "Trucker Tough" cap and took a long sip of lukewarm coffee.  The smell of diesel and impending rain hung heavy in the air as she prepped for her longest haul yet â€“ a cross-country run from Amarillo to Portland, Oregon, with a cargo of antique furniture strapped tight in the fifty-three-foot trailer.  This wasn't just another job for Bea; this was a chance to prove to herself, and maybe to her skeptical father back in El Paso, that she could handle anything the open road threw at her.  The radio crackled to life with a weather report predicting heavy storms over the Rockies, but Bea just grinned.  A little weather wasn't going to stop her. Not this time.
