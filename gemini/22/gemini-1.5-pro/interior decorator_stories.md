The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering strands of her auburn hair against her crimson lipstick. She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, the buttery soft wool a stark contrast to the rough brick of the Grimshaw Manor.  Built in 1888, the manor sat perched atop Widow's Hill overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Atlantic, a lonely sentinel against the brooding sky. Its once-grand facade now bore the scars of neglect: peeling paint, boarded windows, and a wraparound porch that sagged like a weary sigh.  Eleanor, however, saw not decay but potential. Hired by the reclusive new owner, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, to restore the manor to its former glory, she felt a thrill of anticipation course through her. This wasn't just another interior decorating job; it was a resurrection.
