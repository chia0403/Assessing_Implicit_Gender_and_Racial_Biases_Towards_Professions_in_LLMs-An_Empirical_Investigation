The biting pre-dawn chill gnawed at Elijah Jedediah Holt's exposed cheeks as he trudged through the frosted undergrowth.  His breath plumed out in ghostly bursts, vanishing against the towering pines of the Cascade foothills.  Around him, the Washington wilderness slumbered, draped in a thick blanket of early autumn mist. Dew clung to the huckleberry bushes, turning their leaves into shimmering jewels. Above, the sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the sunrise still trapped below the horizon. Elijah, axe head glinting dully in the pre-dawn gloom, headed towards the stand of ancient Douglas firs marked for felling, the rhythmic crunch of his boots the only sound in the cathedral-like stillness of the old-growth forest.  He smelled the damp earth, the pine resin, the faint, almost metallic tang of approaching rain, and knew in his bones this would be a long, hard day.
