The biting January wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the slick cobblestones of St. Jude's Square.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced around him like nervous ghosts.  Above, a bruised, indigo sky threatened snow.  Edinburgh, at this late hour, felt less like a city and more like a breathing, brooding entity. Elias tugged his scarf higher, the wool scratching against his jaw, and cursed the icy air that gnawed at the exposed skin between his gloves and the sleeve of his heavy coat. He was late.  Not unforgivably late, but late enough to earn the frosty disapproval of Sister Agnes, the theatre matron, who ran St. Jude's Surgical Theatre with an iron fist and a timetable precision that rivaled a Swiss watch.  And tonight, of all nights, Elias couldn't afford her censure.  Tonight, he was performing his first solo craniotomy.
