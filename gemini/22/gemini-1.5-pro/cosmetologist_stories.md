The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked streets of Harmony, Indiana. Inside, amidst the swirling scent of hairspray and the hum of dryers,  Amelia Josephine "Amy" Dubois swept up clipped ends of auburn hair, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Harmony, a town where the gossip traveled faster than the old pickup trucks that rattled down Main Street, was Amy's domain. She knew everyone's secrets, whispered confessions blending with the whir of the curling iron.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz was replaced by a palpable tension.  The salon was empty save for Amy and Mrs. Henderson, whose weekly perm was taking longer than usual due to a power surge that had sent the dryer into a sputtering frenzy.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the unease churning in Amy's gut. Something was different tonight, and it wasn't just the weather.
