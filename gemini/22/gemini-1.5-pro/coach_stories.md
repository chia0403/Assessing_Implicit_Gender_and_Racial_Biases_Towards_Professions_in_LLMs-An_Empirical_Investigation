His breath plumed before him in the frigid November air as he surveyed the empty field, the scene mirroring the hollowness he felt in his gut.  The season was over, a dismal 0-10 record etched in the annals of St. Jude's history. Elias, hands shoved deep in his pockets, kicked at a loose divot, the thud a small, insignificant sound in the vast emptiness of the failing evening.  This wasn't how he'd envisioned his return to coaching, not after a five-year hiatus. This wasn't the triumphant comeback he’d craved.  This was…a wasteland.  And he was the lone figure standing in the middle of it.
