The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine.  Salt spray hung in the air, clinging to her wool coat and the crimson leaves still stubbornly clinging to the ancient oaks lining the harbor.  The late afternoon sun, a pale disc through the scudding clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows from the crooked, weather-beaten buildings. Port Blossom was picturesque, undoubtedly, but Eleanor always felt a touch of melancholy settle in her bones with the coming of winter.  It wasn't just the shortening days or the icy wind; it was the quiet. The tourists had long since retreated, leaving behind a hushed stillness that amplified the creaks and groans of the old town, and the secrets it held within its clapboard walls.  Today, however, Eleanor's disquiet stemmed from something more specific than the seasonal shift. It was the message waiting for her at the clinic, the one simply stating, "He's back."
