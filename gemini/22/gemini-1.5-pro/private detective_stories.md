Rain lashed against the grimy window of Silas Finch’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Neon light from the Hong Kong noodle bar across the alley painted streaks of greasy crimson and jade across the worn parquet floor.  Silas, full name Silas Rayfield Finch III, a name that whispered of old money and a pedigree he’d long since pawned, sat hunched over his desk, the cheap whiskey in his glass trembling in time with the flickering fluorescent overhead.  His office, sandwiched between a fortune teller and a purveyor of questionable “antiques” in the seedier part of Kowloon, wasn't much, but it was all he could afford.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, instant noodles, and a faint, persistent aroma of jasmine that drifted in from the flower market a few blocks away.  He swirled the whiskey, the ice clinking a lonely rhythm in the otherwise silent room. It was 5:17 am, the hour when the city held its breath before the chaos of the day began, and Silas, as he often did, found himself contemplating the precarious nature of his existence.  Tonight, however, the contemplation was particularly sharp, edged with a premonition of trouble, a feeling like a cold hand gripping his gut.
