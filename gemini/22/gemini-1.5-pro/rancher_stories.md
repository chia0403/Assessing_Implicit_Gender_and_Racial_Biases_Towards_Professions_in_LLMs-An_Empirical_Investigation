The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the high plains of Montana, biting at Amelia Grace Blackwoodâ€™s exposed cheeks.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, mirrored the vast, rolling landscape of the Blackwood Ranch, stretching as far as the eye could see.  Amelia, bundled in a thick sheepskin coat and worn leather chaps, surveyed her land from atop her favourite palomino, Comet.  The setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows from the skeletal branches of the cottonwood trees lining the creek bed, painting the scene in hues of orange and deep violet.  Winter was coming fast to the Bitterroot Valley, and with it, the annual struggle against the unforgiving elements that tested the mettle of both rancher and beast. This year, Amelia sensed, it would be a harder fight than most.  A rustle in the dry grass beyond the creek, followed by a low, guttural growl, confirmed her unease.  It wasn't just the weather Amelia had to worry about.
