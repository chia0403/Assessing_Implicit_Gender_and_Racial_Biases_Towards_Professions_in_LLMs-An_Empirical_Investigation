The salt spray stung Amelia Reyes's face, a familiar welcome.  The wind whipped around her, tugging at the edges of her worn canvas jacket and threatening to snatch the wide-brimmed hat from her head. Below her, the cliffs of the tiny Irish island of Inis Mór plunged dramatically into the churning turquoise waters of the Atlantic.  Scattered across the emerald-green plateau above, the ancient stone walls crisscrossed like the veins of some forgotten giant, dividing the windswept fields. Amelia inhaled deeply, the scent of brine and damp earth filling her lungs. This was it. The place she’d been dreaming of capturing for years.  Her fingers, calloused from years behind a lens, tightened around the strap of her weathered Leica M6, anticipation thrumming through her veins. This assignment, photographing the wild beauty of the Aran Islands for National Geographic, was her biggest break yet, and she wouldn't waste a single frame.
