The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Hot Pizza" sign outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, day-old hot dogs, and a faint, lingering hint of bleach – Amelia’s attempt from earlier to combat the sticky residue left by a spilled Big Gulp. The Quick Stop, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down video rental store on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, wasn't glamorous.  It wasn't even particularly clean. But it was Amelia's domain, five days a week, from 2 PM to 10 PM.  Today, however, felt different.  A stillness had settled over the normally bustling little store, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Amelia’s mop and the incessant drumming of the rain.  It was the kind of stillness that prickled the skin, the kind that whispered of something about to happen.
