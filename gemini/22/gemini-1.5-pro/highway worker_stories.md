The biting wind whipped across the vast expanse of the Mojave Desert, stinging Amelia “Millie” Reyes’s cheeks despite the layers she wore under her fluorescent orange vest.  The sun, a molten disc in the pale morning sky, hadn’t yet managed to thaw the frost clinging to the creosote bushes that dotted the desolate landscape.  Millie, her breath puffing out in white clouds, tightened the grip on her thermos of lukewarm coffee.  Route 66, normally a shimmering ribbon of asphalt baking under the desert sun, this morning resembled a steely grey serpent winding through the frosty plains.  She stood on the shoulder, the rhythmic whoosh of the infrequent traffic a low hum against the backdrop of the desert's vast silence.  A sign a few feet away, dusted with a fine layer of frost, warned drivers: ROAD WORK AHEAD.  Today's job was patching a particularly nasty pothole that threatened to swallow small vehicles whole, a common occurrence on this stretch of highway ravaged by sun, wind, and the relentless pounding of eighteen-wheelers.
