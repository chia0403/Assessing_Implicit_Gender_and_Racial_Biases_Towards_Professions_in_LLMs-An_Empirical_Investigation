The salt spray kissed Amelia Rosalind Hawthorne's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a sturdy but slightly battered fishing trawler repurposed for tourist excursions. The sky above the churning Irish Sea was the colour of a bruised plum, promising rain later, but for now, a sliver of sunlight illuminated the jagged cliffs of Skellig Michael, a UNESCO World Heritage site rising dramatically from the depths some eight miles off the coast of County Kerry.  The wind whipped Ameliaâ€™s auburn braid across her face, and she tucked it behind her ear, her green eyes scanning the faces of her twelve passengers, a motley crew ranging from giddy American teenagers to a stoic elderly couple from Japan.  A nervous energy thrummed in the air, a mixture of seasickness and anticipation for the island's monastic ruins and its famous puffin colony.  Amelia, however, felt the familiar calm settle over her; she was in her element, on the edge of the world, ready to share the stories and secrets whispered on these windswept rocks for centuries.
