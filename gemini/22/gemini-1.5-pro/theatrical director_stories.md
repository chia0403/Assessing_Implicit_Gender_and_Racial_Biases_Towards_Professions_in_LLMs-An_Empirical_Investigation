The biting November wind whipped around Anastasia "Stasia" Petrova as she perched precariously on a stack of plywood flats, her breath puffing out in white clouds. Below, in the cavernous, dimly lit space of the dilapidated Rialto Theatre, chaos reigned.  Carpenters hammered erratically, electricians wrestled with tangled cables that snaked across the dusty floor like luminous pythons, and a gaggle of actors, clad in mismatched rehearsal clothes, argued loudly about the merits of various interpretations of Chekhov's "The Seagull."  Dust motes danced in the single working spotlight, illuminating a chipped, plaster cherub clinging precariously to the proscenium arch. The Rialto, once the jewel of New Hope, Pennsylvania, had fallen on hard times, its faded grandeur now a testament to decades of neglect.  But for Stasia, it was a blank canvas, a space brimming with the potential for magic, a place where she hoped, against all odds, to resurrect both a forgotten playhouse and her own flagging career.
