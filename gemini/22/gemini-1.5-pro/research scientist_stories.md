The biting wind whipped around Dr. Aris Thorne, stinging his cheeks and tearing at the edges of his thick parka.  He pulled his hood tighter, the coarse fabric scratching against his beard, and surveyed the desolate landscape. Jagged peaks, dusted with a fresh layer of snow, clawed at the bruised, twilight sky.  Below, the research outpost, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging precariously to the mountainside, glowed like a dropped handful of fireflies.  This was the Juneau Icefield Research Program's Camp 17, perched at 7,000 feet above sea level in the Alaskan wilderness, and for the last six months, it had been Aris's isolated kingdom.  He was alone now, save for the ghosts of departed researchers and the low hum of the generators battling the relentless cold, and tonight, that isolation felt heavier than usual.  Something was different.  Something in the air, beyond the biting wind and the promise of snow.
