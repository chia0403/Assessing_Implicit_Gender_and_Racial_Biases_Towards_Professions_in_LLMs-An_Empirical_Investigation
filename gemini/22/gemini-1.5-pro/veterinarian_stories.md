The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the warped window panes of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s veterinary clinic. The sign above the door, "Wind River Animal Care," creaked in protest, its faded paint barely visible against the steely grey sky.  Snow, fine and sharp as powdered glass, began to fall, obscuring the already sparse landscape. Inside, the small waiting room was empty save for a shivering pot-bellied stove and Eleanor herself, who, at thirty-two, already possessed the weary lines of someone twice her age. She sat hunched over a chipped enamel mug of lukewarm coffee, the scent of antiseptic and animal fur thick in the air. The radio crackled with a static-laced weather report predicting a blizzard, and Eleanor sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. This was shaping up to be a long, cold night.
