The biting November wind whipped through the cobbled alleyways of Aethelburg, tugging at the hem of Elias Finch’s long, charcoal coat.  Gas lamps flickered, casting a sickly yellow glow on the grimy brick walls, revealing faded advertisements for tonics and teas. Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, hurried towards his shop, the sign above it creaking rhythmically: *Finch & Sons, Fine Tailoring & Haberdashery*.  The "Sons" part had been optimistic on his father’s part.  Elias was alone, his father long gone, and the shop, though respectable, was barely holding its own against the influx of cheaper, ready-made garments flooding the market.  Tonight, however, a commission awaited him, a commission that could change everything.  Inside the shop, the air was thick with the scent of wool, beeswax, and the faint, metallic tang of pins.  A single candle illuminated the worktable where a length of rich, midnight-blue velvet lay unfurled, shimmering like trapped starlight.  This wasn’t just any commission; this was for the Countess of Aethelburg, and Elias, his heart beating a nervous tattoo against his ribs, knew he had to get it perfect.
