The wail of the siren cut through the thick, humid Charleston night, bouncing off the antebellum mansions and cobblestone streets.  Rain lashed against the windshield of Medic 17, blurring the already hazy glow of the streetlights.  Inside, Amelia "Amy"  Rodriguez, EMT-Paramedic, braced herself against the dashboard as her partner, Marcus, navigated the slick corners. Amy tightened her grip on her tablet, the dispatch information still flashing on the screen: possible cardiac arrest, 14 Rainbow Row.  The address itself sent a shiver down her spine.  Rainbow Row, with its brightly painted historic houses, was usually a postcard-perfect scene, but tonight, it felt ominous, draped in shadows and soaked in the unrelenting downpour.  The air crackled with anticipation, the kind that always preceded a difficult call, and Amy could feel the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  This wouldn't be a tourist snapping a photo in the wrong place. This was something else.
