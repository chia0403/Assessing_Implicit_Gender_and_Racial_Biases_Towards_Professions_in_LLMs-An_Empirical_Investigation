The aroma of scorched hair and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a not entirely unpleasant perfume that had permeated every brick of the "Curl Up & Dye" salon for the past twenty-three years.  Rain lashed against the large, single-paned window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the reflection of the shop's sole occupant, Seraphina Rose Hawthorne. She sighed, a strand of periwinkle blue hair falling across her brow as she surveyed the damage. Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose hair had more colours than a chameleon's wardrobe, had evidently decided that "platinum blonde" was achievable at home, with a box dye and a fervent prayer.  Now, Seraphina, armed with a deep conditioning treatment and the patience of a saint, was attempting to coax Mrs. Higgins’ frazzled orange and yellow tresses back to some semblance of normalcy. Outside, the grey cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon, shimmered with the downpour, the fishing boats bobbing restlessly in the harbour. The rhythmic clang of the buoy bell, usually a comforting sound, seemed to echo the frantic thumping in Seraphina’s chest. This wasn't just another botched home dye job; this felt like a harbinger, a sign that the calm waters of Port Blossom were about to be disturbed.
