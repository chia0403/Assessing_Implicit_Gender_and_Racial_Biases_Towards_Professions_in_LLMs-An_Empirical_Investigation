The biting November wind whipped around Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz, stinging her cheeks and turning her breath into fleeting white clouds.  Fluorescent streetlights cast a sickly yellow glow over the scene, painting the cracked asphalt and overflowing bins of St. Jude's Alley in a grimy, theatrical light. Rain, a constant drizzle for the past three days, had turned the alley into a slick, reflective surface. The air reeked of stale beer, rotting garbage, and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, that Izzy recognized instantly: blood. Her partner, Detective Marcus Bell, stood beside her, his shoulders hunched against the cold, a grim expression etched on his usually jovial face.  This was their third call-out in as many hours, and the shift had barely begun.  Tonight, the city of New Birmingham held its breath, waiting for the storm to break, both meteorological and otherwise.
