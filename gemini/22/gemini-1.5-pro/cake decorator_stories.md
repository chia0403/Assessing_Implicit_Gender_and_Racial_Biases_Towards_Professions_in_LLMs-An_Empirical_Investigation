The whirring of the stand mixer was Amelia "Milly" Holloway's morning meditation.  Sunrise painted the bakery kitchen in shades of apricot and rose, catching the swirling clouds of powdered sugar that danced around her like miniature, sweet ghosts. Milly's Bakery, nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a town perpetually smelling of cinnamon and woodsmoke, was her sanctuary, a place where flour-dusted countertops and the scent of vanilla bean held more comfort than any plush armchair ever could. Today, however, a nervous energy thrummed beneath the usual calm. Today was the annual Oakhaven Apple Blossom Festival, and Milly had been commissioned to create the centerpiece cake – a five-tiered masterpiece celebrating the town’s history.  The pressure was on, not just because the Mayor himself would be judging the entries, but because nestled amongst the expected apple blossoms and buttercream swirls, Milly planned to hide a secret, a sugar-spun confession that could change everything.
