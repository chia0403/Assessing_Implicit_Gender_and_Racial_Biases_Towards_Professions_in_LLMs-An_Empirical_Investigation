Her small cottage, perched precariously on the cliff edge of the tiny Orkney island of Eday, groaned and creaked in sympathy with the gale. Inside, a peat fire struggled to hold its own against the draught whistling through the ill-fitting window frames, casting flickering shadows that danced across the stacks of notebooks and overflowing bookshelves lining the walls.
