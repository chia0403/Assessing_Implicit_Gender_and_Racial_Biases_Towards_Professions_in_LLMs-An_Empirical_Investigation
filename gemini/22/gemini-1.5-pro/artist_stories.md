The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the loose panes of glass in Elias Thorne's studio.  Elias, bundled in a threadbare wool coat over his paint-splattered overalls, ignored the protesting squeak of the window and stared out at the churning grey water.  His studio, a converted boathouse perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling wharf in Port Townsend, Washington, offered breathtaking views, but little in the way of comfort.  The scent of salt and mildew hung heavy in the air, mingling with the turpentine and linseed oil that permeated every inch of the weathered wood walls.  A single bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light across the cluttered space, illuminating half-finished canvases leaning against peeling paint, and a chaotic jumble of brushes, palettes, and tubes of paint scattered across a worn wooden workbench.  Today, however, Elias found himself unable to draw inspiration from the dramatic seascape unfolding before him.  A crumpled rejection letter from the Seattle Art Gallery lay on the workbench, a stark white rectangle against the vibrant chaos, its crisp edges mocking his turbulent inner world.
