The wind whipped off the Tyrrhenian Sea, carrying the scent of salt and brine across the sun-baked hills of Carrara. Dust devils danced through the skeletal remains of olive groves, swirling around Elias Thorne, his calloused hands gripping the smooth handle of his hammer.  Elias, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and strain, surveyed the marble quarry before him.  Towering white cliffs, scarred by centuries of excavation, rose like the bleached bones of giants against the azure sky. Here, in the heart of Tuscany, where Michelangelo himself once sourced his stone, Elias Thorne, a man as hard and unyielding as the marble he shaped, carved his living. The air thrummed with the distant drone of pneumatic drills, a discordant symphony against the natural silence of the Apuan Alps. This morning, however, a different sound pricked his ears - a low, guttural rumble that emanated not from the machinery, but from deep within the mountain itself.
