The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Holloway's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped her auburn braid across her cheek, momentarily obscuring her view of the crumbling whitewashed village of Avani nestled against the hillside below.  Her easel, battered and paint-splattered, stood steadfast against the gale, its three legs dug deep into the rocky terrain.
