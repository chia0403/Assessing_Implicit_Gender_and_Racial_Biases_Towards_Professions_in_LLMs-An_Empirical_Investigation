The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she climbed the cracked concrete steps of 42B Sycamore Street.  Decaying leaves clung to the wrought-iron railing, mirroring the sense of neglect that permeated the entire building.  A faint smell of stale beer and fried food hung heavy in the air, clinging to the crumbling brick facade. Amy tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, adjusting her worn leather satchel. This was the last client visit of the day, and frankly, she was ready for a hot bath and a glass of anything stronger than herbal tea.  The sky above the dilapidated row houses of Southbridge, Philadelphia, was already fading to a bruised purple, promising an early nightfall and possibly another freezing rain shower.  She pulled out her pepper spray, a habitual gesture in this part of town, and knocked firmly on the peeling paint of the door.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the faded number 42B. Inside, a muffled dog barked, followed by the scrape of a chair leg across the floor.  Amy checked her watch.  Curtis "Razor" Washington was already five minutes late.
