The biting wind whipped across Lake Erie, clawing at the exposed brick of the abandoned warehouse and sending shivers down Captain Elias Thorne’s spine.  Flakes of snow, thick and wet, swirled under the sodium-vapor streetlights, painting the scene in a sickly yellow glow.  It was 2:17 am, a truly ungodly hour to be battling a four-alarm blaze in Cleveland, Ohio, especially in December. Elias adjusted the thermal liner of his helmet, the acrid smell of burning rubber and chemicals stinging his nostrils.  Ice crunched under his heavy boots as he surveyed the inferno.  Tongues of orange and red licked at the night sky, illuminating the frantic activity of his crew – Engine 19, the best damn fire company in the city.  The warehouse, a skeletal remnant of Cleveland’s industrial past, roared like a wounded beast, threatening to collapse in on itself.  Elias knew, with a grim certainty, this wasn’t going to be an easy night.
