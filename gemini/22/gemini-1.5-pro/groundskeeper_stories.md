The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick, grey cardigan, sending the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves swirling around him.  He pulled his worn tweed cap lower, the peak a shield against the spitting rain that threatened to turn to sleet.  Beneath the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive, the gravel crunched under his heavy work boots.  Elias, head groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past thirty-two years, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye.  The sprawling gardens, usually vibrant with colour, now lay dormant, a muted tapestry of browns and greys.  Only the stubborn crimson berries of the holly bushes offered a splash of defiance against the encroaching winter.  Blackwood Manor itself, a brooding Victorian edifice of dark stone and leaded glass windows, loomed against the iron-grey sky, its many chimneys puffing out plumes of white smoke, a silent testament to the fires burning within. This morning, however, something felt different.  A peculiar stillness hung in the air, a silence deeper than the usual quiet of a winter's day.
