The stale air of the probation office hung heavy with the scent of cheap coffee and simmering resentment.  Sunlight, weak and hesitant even at midday, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows of the building, leaving Amelia Grace Hawthorne feeling as trapped as the clients she oversaw.  Amelia, a probation officer with five years and a mountain of paperwork under her belt, sighed, the sound swallowed by the hum of the fluorescent lights above.  Her desk, a testament to bureaucratic chaos, was piled high with case files, each one a potential disaster waiting to unfold.  The chipped mug in front of her, bearing the faded slogan "Keep Calm and Carry On," felt particularly ironic today.  Outside, the city of San Francisco hummed with its usual frenetic energy, a stark contrast to the suffocating stillness within the walls of the probation department on Eddy Street.  Today, however, the quiet was about to be broken.  A new case file, thick and ominous, sat on top of the pile, its stark white cover mocking the grim reality it concealed.  Amelia picked it up, her fingers tracing the embossed lettering:  "Case #4723:  Elias Thorne."
