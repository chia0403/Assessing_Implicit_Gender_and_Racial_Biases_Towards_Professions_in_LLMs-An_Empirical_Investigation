The greasy overalls clung to Elias Thorne's wiry frame like a second skin, the scent of burnt oil and motor grease a permanent aura.  Elias, a man whose knuckles were perpetually stained black and whose eyes held the knowing glint of someone who’d wrestled more than their fair share of stubborn engines back to life, stood amidst the chaotic symphony of his workshop.  Thorne’s Auto Repair, nestled in a forgotten corner of the rust-belt town of Havenwood, wasn't much to look at – a squat, brick building choked by climbing ivy and overshadowed by a looming, skeletal water tower.  Inside, however, was a universe of discarded parts, half-finished projects, and the comforting rumble of a lone, aging air compressor, a constant companion to the rhythmic clang of Elias’s wrench against metal.  The air hung thick with the smell of gasoline, anti-freeze, and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of something sweeter – the honeysuckle blooming stubbornly outside, a splash of defiance against the industrial grime.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos was absent, replaced by an unnerving stillness.  The only sound was the erratic ticking of a clock on the wall, each second a hammer blow against the expectant silence.
