The salt spray stung Elara Vance’s face, a familiar sting she’d grown accustomed to during her daily walks along the craggy cliffs of Cornwall.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped her auburn hair across her eyes as she navigated the uneven path, the sound of the crashing Atlantic a constant, rhythmic backdrop.  Elara, a highly-regarded occupational therapist with a penchant for challenging cases, wasn't here for leisure.  Today's walk was a reconnaissance mission.  The dramatic landscape, beautiful in its raw power, mirrored the challenges facing her latest patient:  a young man named Finnigan O'Malley, confined to a wheelchair after a devastating climbing accident, whose recovery was as precarious and unpredictable as the Cornish coastline itself.  His isolated farmhouse, perched precariously on the cliff edge, was visible now – a stark, white beacon against the stormy grey of the ocean.  The journey to it, both physically and metaphorically, promised to be arduous.
