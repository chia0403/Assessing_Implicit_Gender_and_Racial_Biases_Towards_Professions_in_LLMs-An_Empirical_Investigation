The acrid bite of smoke filled Captain Elias Thorne's nostrils, a familiar companion he'd known intimately for twenty-three years of fighting blazes in the sprawling, grimy metropolis of Veridia.  Veridia, a city built on ambition and layered with the ghosts of forgotten industries, clung precariously to the cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea.  Tonight, that ambition – manifested as a five-alarm inferno devouring the old Zenith Shipping Yards – was threatening to consume a significant chunk of the city's waterfront.  The flames, a malevolent orange heart beating against the inky sky, licked at the rusted steel skeletons of abandoned cranes, their skeletal limbs clawing at the swirling smoke like desperate, dying things.  The air throbbed with the rhythmic roar of fire engines, the clang of metal on metal, and the desperate cries of trapped souls swallowed by the inferno.  Elias, his face smudged with soot, his helmet reflecting the chaotic dance of firelight, felt the familiar adrenaline surge – a cold, sharp stab cutting through the suffocating heat.  This wasn't just another fire; this was personal.
