The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face as he squinted at the churning grey sea.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged cliffs of the Isle of Skye was a constant, familiar soundtrack to his life, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of his hammer.  Elias, a carpenter of renown throughout the Hebrides, stood on the windswept promontory overlooking his small, ramshackle workshop, its slate roof bowed under the weight of years and relentless storms.  The air smelled of brine, peat smoke, and the ever-present scent of pine, the wood that formed the very backbone of his existence.  Below him, the village of Portree huddled, a scattering of stone cottages clinging to the hillside like barnacles to a ship's hull, their chimneys puffing out thin trails of smoke against the turbulent sky.  This was his home, this unforgiving yet beautiful island, and today, the storm brewing both within and without promised to be a significant one.
