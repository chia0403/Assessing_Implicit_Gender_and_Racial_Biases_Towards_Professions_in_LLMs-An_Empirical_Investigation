The chipped paint of the school’s fire escape flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sensible brown shoes as she perched precariously on the rusty metal. Below, the manicured lawns of Ashwood Elementary hummed with the muted chaos of recess: a symphony of shrieks, giggles, and the rhythmic thud of a basketball.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the autumn sky, cast long shadows across the playground, painting the scene in a melancholic gold.  Eleanor sighed, the crisp October air doing little to dispel the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. This wasn't the picturesque postcard view she’d envisioned when she'd accepted the position at Ashwood just six months ago;  it was more a bleak, if strangely beautiful, reflection of the turmoil brewing within the school's walls.  The case of eight-year-old Thomas Ashton was proving far more intractable than any textbook could have prepared her for.
