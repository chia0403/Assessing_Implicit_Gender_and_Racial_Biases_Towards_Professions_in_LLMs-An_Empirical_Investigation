The chipped paint of the "Serenity Now" sign hanging above Ms. Eleanor Vance's door was a fitting metaphor for her current state.  It was 3:07 PM on a Tuesday, officially past the point of reasonable hope for a quiet end to the week, and the aroma of stale coffee and adolescent despair hung heavy in the air of Northwood High's guidance counseling office. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the perpetually muddy football field, mirroring the tempest brewing in Eleanor's inbox – a tempest largely comprised of frantic emails from parents about college applications, questionable disciplinary actions, and, inexplicably, a petition to rename the school mascot from the perpetually-defeated Wolverines to the more optimistic…Sunflowers.  The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain, a soundtrack to Eleanor’s mounting headache.  Her desk, a battlefield of half-finished paperwork and abandoned energy drink cans, was a testament to a day spent navigating the emotional minefield of teenage angst.
