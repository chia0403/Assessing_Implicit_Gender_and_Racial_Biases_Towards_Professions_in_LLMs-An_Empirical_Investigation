The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, but tonight it felt cloying, almost suffocating.  Elias, a man whose hands were more comfortable kneading dough than holding a sword, stood amidst the flour-dusted chaos of his bakery, "Thorne's Temptations," a charmingly ramshackle building nestled on the cobbled lane of Whispering Elms.

The only sound louder than the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner was the insistent drumming of rain against the bakery's leaded windows.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of the rain was punctuated by something far more sinister â€“ a low, guttural growl that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest itself.
