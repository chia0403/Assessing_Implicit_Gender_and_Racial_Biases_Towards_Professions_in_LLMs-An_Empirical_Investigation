The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Elias Thorne's pencil on mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the pale light above his head.

Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad against the glass windows, a stark contrast to the serene, carefully constructed worlds he built on paper. Tonight, however, even the familiar hum of the room felt off-key; a sense of unease prickled at the edges of his concentration, a feeling far more unsettling than the usual pressure of a looming deadline.
