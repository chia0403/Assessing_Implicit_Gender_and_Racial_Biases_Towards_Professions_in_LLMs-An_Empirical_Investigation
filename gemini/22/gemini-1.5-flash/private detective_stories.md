The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton’s office, a relentless percussion accompanying the even more relentless drip, drip, drip from a leak somewhere near the ceiling.  The leak, like most things in Jack Stratton’s life, was a persistent annoyance rather than a catastrophic event.  He swirled the lukewarm coffee in his chipped mug, the dregs a murky testament to another sleepless night spent chasing shadows and half-truths in the grimy underbelly of San Francisco’s Chinatown.  The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine tea, damp wool, and something faintly acrid – perhaps the lingering ghost of last week’s burnt offering, or maybe just the city itself.  Outside, the neon signs of Grant Avenue flickered intermittently, painting fleeting strokes of garish color across the slick, rain-washed streets.  Tonight, however, the vibrant pulse of Chinatown felt muted, subdued even, a reflection of the knot of unease that had settled in Jack's gut since the cryptic phone call earlier that evening.
