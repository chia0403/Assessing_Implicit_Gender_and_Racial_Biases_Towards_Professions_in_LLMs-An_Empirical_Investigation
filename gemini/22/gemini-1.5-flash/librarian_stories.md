The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grandchester Public Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the quiet stillness.  Elias Thorne, a man whose life was as meticulously ordered as the Dewey Decimal System itself, adjusted his spectacles, the faint click echoing in the hushed space.  He ran a calloused thumb over the spine of a first edition Dickens, its embossed lettering worn smooth by the countless hands that had cradled it over the centuries. Elias, with his neatly trimmed beard, tweed jacket, and a perpetually furrowed brow that suggested a lifetime spent deciphering cryptic cataloging systems, was as much a fixture of the Grandchester Library as the oak paneling itself. Tonight, however, the familiar tranquility was shattered by a frantic knock that echoed through the hallowed halls, a sound utterly out of place in this sanctuary of silence.
