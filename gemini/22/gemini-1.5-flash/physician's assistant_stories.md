The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the snow-dusted street of Anchorage, Alaska.  The late afternoon sun, a weak, watery orb sinking behind the Chugach Mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows from the towering spruce trees lining the road.  Amelia, a physician’s assistant at Providence Alaska Medical Center, tugged her parka tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped cheeks.  The scent of woodsmoke and thawing snow hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but familiar perfume of the Alaskan winter.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs, each exhale a small, desperate rebellion against the encroaching cold.  Tonight, however, the chill wasn’t just meteorological; a deeper, more unsettling frost seemed to have settled over the city.  The emergency call had been vague, unsettlingly so – a single, panicked sentence relayed through dispatch: "…needs immediate medical attention…possible…exposure…"  Amelia’s gut clenched.  Exposure in this weather meant one thing, and one thing only: a fight against the unforgiving Alaskan wilderness, and the very real possibility of losing that fight.
