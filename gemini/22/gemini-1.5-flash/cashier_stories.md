The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Jean Blackwood's Tuesday night.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon sign of the liquor store across the street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled coffee. Elara, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, absently tapped her fingernails on the scanner, the rhythmic *click-click-click* a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain.  The only other occupants of the Quick Stop were a dusty, half-deflated Snoopy balloon bobbing precariously near the entrance and a single, flickering  bug light buzzing impatiently above the overflowing candy aisle.  It was the kind of night that promised nothing but lukewarm coffee and the quiet desperation of a slow shift.
