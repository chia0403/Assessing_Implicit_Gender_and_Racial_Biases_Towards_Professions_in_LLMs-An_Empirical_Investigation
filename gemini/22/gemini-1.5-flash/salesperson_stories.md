The stale air of the showroom hung thick with the scent of new leather and desperation.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the silent space between rows of gleaming, impossibly expensive sedans.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a woman whose smile could charm a rattlesnake into donating its venom for a good cause, adjusted the crisp, navy blue blazer of her power suit.  Her reflection in the polished hood of a midnight-blue convertible showed a flicker of weariness beneath the professionally applied makeup, a weariness only partially masked by her practiced optimism.  This was her last chance.  Three months of dwindling sales, three months of increasingly pointed glares from her increasingly impatient manager, culminated in this: a weekend showcasing the new Apex model, a car so ridiculously opulent it felt more like a space capsule than a vehicle for the common man.  The fate of Ameliaâ€™s job, and perhaps her career, rested on the shoulders of the next prospective buyer.
