The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood and iron, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Prime Cuts.  Barty, a man whose hands were as rough as bark and whose apron was perpetually stained a deep, crimson hue, stood behind the counter of his shop, the cold marble a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from the hanging carcasses.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of his small, butchery in the cobbled alleyway of Grimsborough, a relentless downpour mirroring the storm brewing within his own heart. The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the rows of sausages, the glistening cuts of beef, and the surprisingly cheerful display of brightly coloured vegetables – a stark, yet oddly comforting, juxtaposition to the grim reality of his trade.  Grimsborough itself was a city perpetually cloaked in a grey, melancholic mist, a fitting backdrop to the secrets Barty carried, secrets heavier than any side of beef he’d ever handled.
