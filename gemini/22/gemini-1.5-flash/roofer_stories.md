The biting November wind howled a mournful tune across the slate rooftops of Edinburgh, whipping Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw.  He gripped the worn leather of his toolbox, its weight a familiar comfort against the swaying of the scaffold. Below him, the city sprawled, a tapestry of gaslit streets and huddled closes, each chimney puffing out a plume of grey smoke into the darkening sky.  The scent of coal smoke mingled with the sharp, salty tang of the North Sea, a familiar perfume to Elias, a man who spent his life perched precariously between the earth and the heavens.  Tonight, his perch was the steeply pitched roof of a Georgian townhouse on Ramsay Lane, its ornate gables silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight.  The job was simple – a few loose slates, a bit of repointing – but the view, as always, was breathtaking.
