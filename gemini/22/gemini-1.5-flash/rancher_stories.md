The wind, a rasping, gritty hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed his ranch.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the parched earth of the Painted Desert, their swirling skirts mimicking the chaotic state of his heart.  Thorne Ranch, once a verdant tapestry woven with the rich hues of alfalfa and the deep green of grazing cattle, was now a brittle, cracked canvas, reflecting the relentless, unforgiving sun of the Arizona summer. The ancient saguaro cacti, normally stoic sentinels, seemed to droop under the oppressive heat, their arms reaching towards a sky the color of bleached bone.  The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of dry earth and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a scent that Elias knew all too well.  This wasn’t the drought that threatened his livelihood; this was something far more sinister.
