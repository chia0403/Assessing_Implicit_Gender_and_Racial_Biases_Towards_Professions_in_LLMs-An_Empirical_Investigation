The sterile scent of antiseptic and the low hum of the suction machine were the soundtrack to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Albright's upscale dental practice, blurring the view of the Seattle Space Needle into a hazy, grey obelisk.

Outside, the city was a tempestuous grey; inside, the office hummed with a controlled, efficient calm, a stark contrast to the anxieties swirling within the mouth of her current patient, a perpetually flustered Mr. Henderson, whose teeth, Sera noted with professional detachment, were a testament to his fondness for red wine and neglecting floss.
