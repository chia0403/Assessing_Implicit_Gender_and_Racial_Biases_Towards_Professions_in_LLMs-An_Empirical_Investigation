The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, a small comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of Blackwood & Sons.  Rain lashed against the panes, blurring the already-dim cityscape of Victorian London into a hazy watercolour.  The gaslight sputtering above her desk cast long, dancing shadows across the mountains of paperwork that threatened to engulf her – invoices, correspondence, legal documents all scrawled in a spidery hand that only Amelia, with years of practice, could decipher with any speed.  The air hung thick with the scent of coal smoke and old paper, a familiar, if somewhat melancholic, aroma that permeated the entire office, a scent as much a part of Amelia’s life as the rhythmic clack of her typewriter.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of the office was absent, replaced by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the lonely tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall.  Even the usually boisterous Mr. Blackwood was unusually quiet.  Amelia suspected something was amiss, and her usually unflappable demeanor began to crack.
