The biting wind howled a mournful song across the desolate expanse of the Nebraska plains, a symphony of icy grit against the battered metal of Earl "Dusty" Rhodes's eighteen-wheeler.  Dusty, his full name a testament to a long-forgotten family tradition and a present-day irony given his perpetually dust-caked appearance, gripped the steering wheel of his rig, the "Lone Star Wanderer," its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  The tires hummed a low, steady drone against the black asphalt, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the diesel engine, a sound as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.  The only other sounds were the occasional shriek of a distant coyote and the rasp of his own breathing, thick with the scent of stale coffee and diesel fumes.  He was halfway between Omaha and Cheyenne, miles from anywhere, and utterly alone â€“ a solitude that, for Dusty, felt more like a comfort than a curse.
