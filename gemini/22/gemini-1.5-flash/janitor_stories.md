The stale scent of disinfectant clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He pushed his mop across the polished marble floor of the Grand Regency Hotel, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the muffled sounds of revelry drifting from the ballroom beyond.  It was 3:17 AM, the hour when the champagne flutes were empty, the laughter hoarse, and the remnants of a thousand fleeting celebrations lay scattered like fallen confetti â€“ a glittering testament to a night Elias had only witnessed through the shadowed corners and forgotten alcoves of the opulent hotel. The Grand Regency stood proud and stoic against the bruised pre-dawn sky, a monolithic testament to wealth and excess, a monument Elias cleaned with quiet, efficient diligence.  He was a phantom in its gilded halls, a silent observer of the lives that unfolded within its walls, his own life a stark contrast to the flamboyant displays he witnessed each night.
