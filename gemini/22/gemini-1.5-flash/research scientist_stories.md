The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Grace Holloway, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of thermal gear.  Ice crystals, sharp as needles, danced in the swirling blizzard, obscuring the already bleak landscape.  The research station, a squat, metallic behemoth clinging precariously to the ice shelf, was barely visible through the white fury.  Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of generators battling the relentless cold, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crunch of the ice groaning under the immense pressure of the glacier.  Evelyn shivered, not entirely from the cold.  A deeper, more unsettling tremor ran through her, a premonition sparked by the anomalous readings emanating from the ice core samples she'd retrieved just hours ago.  This wasn't just the usual geological data; something profoundly unexpected, something potentiallyâ€¦ terrifying, lay buried beneath the frozen wastes of Antarctica.
