The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher into the back of the ambulance.  Sirens wailed a mournful counterpoint to the frantic clatter of the city – a symphony of urban distress only too familiar to her.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin, the smell of exhaust fumes and wet asphalt clinging to her like a second layer.  The scene was a chaotic ballet of flashing lights and shouting paramedics, set against the backdrop of a rain-slicked street in the heart of Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood – a vibrant, gritty landscape that Amy knew intimately, both its beauty and its brutal underbelly.  Tonight, it offered only the latter.  The victim, a young man crumpled on the pavement, lay still beneath a fractured streetlight, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering emergency lights.
