The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital blood draw station hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez's Tuesday morning.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of antiseptic and the faint, sickly sweet scent of fear, clung to the linoleum floor like a second skin.  Esme, her name embroidered in neat cursive on the breast pocket of her crisp white coat, adjusted the rubber band on her wrist, a familiar gesture born from years of repetitive motion.  Outside, the pre-dawn Los Angeles sky was still a bruised purple, but within the sterile confines of the lab, the day had already begun its relentless march. The first patient, a nervous-looking elderly woman clutching a crumpled tissue, was already shuffling towards the counter, her eyes wide and questioning.  Esme offered a reassuring smile, a practiced mask of calm over the quiet anxiety that always accompanied the first draw of the day.
