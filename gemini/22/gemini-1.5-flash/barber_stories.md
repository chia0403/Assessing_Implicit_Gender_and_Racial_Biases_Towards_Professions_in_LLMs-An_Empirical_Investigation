The rusty barber's pole outside Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shop creaked a mournful tune in the stiff November wind.  Rain, a relentless, sideways drizzle, plastered Barty's thinning, ginger hair to his scalp.  He peered out from behind the dusty window of "Barty's Blades," a tiny, almost forgotten oasis nestled on the wrong side of the tracks in the perpetually gloomy town of Oakhaven.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of bay rum, stale coffee, and a faint, underlying aroma of regret, a perfume Barty had come to know intimately over his fifty-odd years spent wielding shears and straight razors.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner, a constant reminder of time's relentless march, a march Barty was increasingly finding hard to keep up with.
