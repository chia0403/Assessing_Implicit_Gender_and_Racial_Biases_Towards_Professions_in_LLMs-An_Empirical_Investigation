The chipped porcelain teacup rattled in Amelia Worthington's hand, the tremor barely perceptible against the insistent drumming of rain against the leaded-glass windows of her office.  Amelia, a woman whose life was meticulously organized down to the alphabetized binder of client files on her mahogany desk, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  It wasn't the storm, though the wind howled like a banshee outside, rattling the ancient oak of her Victorian-era office in the quiet, rain-slicked town of Oakhaven.  No, this unease stemmed from the letter clutched in her other hand, its crisp, official seal bearing the crest of Blackwood Manor, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a place where shadows seemed to cling to the very stone.  The letter, addressed to her personally, spoke of a claimâ€¦ a claim so bizarre, so utterly outlandish, that it threatened to unravel the carefully constructed fabric of Amelia Worthington's perfectly ordered world.
