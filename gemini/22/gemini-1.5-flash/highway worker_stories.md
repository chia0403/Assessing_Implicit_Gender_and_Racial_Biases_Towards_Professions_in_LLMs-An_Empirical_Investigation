The sun beat down on Elias Thorneâ€™s neck, already slick with sweat despite the early hour.  The asphalt shimmered like a mirage, the heat rising in waves from the freshly laid blacktop.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel fumes and hot tar, hung heavy and still, broken only by the rhythmic drone of the paving machine further down the highway.  Elias, his face grimy and tanned the colour of well-worn leather, adjusted the brim of his hard hat, the sweat stinging his eyes.  He was halfway through his morning coffee, the lukewarm liquid doing little to quench his thirst, as he surveyed the endless ribbon of Interstate 40 stretching before him, a seemingly endless expanse of cracked concrete and shimmering asphalt under the unforgiving Arizona sun.  This stretch, just outside Flagstaff, was notorious; brutal summers, freezing winters, and a constant barrage of impatient drivers weaving through the orange barrels like angry wasps.  Another day, another battle against the elements and the tyranny of deadlines.
