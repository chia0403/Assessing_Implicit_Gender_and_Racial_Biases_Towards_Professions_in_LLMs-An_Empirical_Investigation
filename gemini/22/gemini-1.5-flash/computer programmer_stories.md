The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Cat" noodle bar cast a lurid green glow across Elias Thorne's rain-slicked trench coat.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the alleyway, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his fingers on his battered laptop.  Steam rose from a half-empty bowl of ramen, the broth long cold, mirroring the chill that had settled deep in Elias's bones.  He wasn't cold from the weather, though; the icy dread gripping him was far more profound.  The code scrolled endlessly on his screen, a chaotic river of ones and zeros, each character a potential clue in a digital mystery that threatened to unravel far more than just his own carefully constructed world.  He was a computer programmer, yes, but tonight, Elias Thorne felt less like a master of the digital realm and more like a pawn in a game far bigger than himself, a game played in the shadows of Neo-Kyoto's sprawling, rain-drenched underbelly.
