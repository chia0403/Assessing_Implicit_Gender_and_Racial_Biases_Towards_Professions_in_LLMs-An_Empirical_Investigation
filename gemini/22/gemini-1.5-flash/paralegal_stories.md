The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the pre-dawn chill that clung to the air in the cramped, windowless office.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, their pale glow reflecting off the stacks of legal documents that threatened to topple from their precarious perch on every available surface.  Outside, the city of Chicago was just beginning to stir, a muted symphony of distant sirens and rumbling garbage trucks a stark contrast to the suffocating quiet of the Hernandez & Associates law offices – a quiet that Amelia found increasingly unnerving at 5:30 AM.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a scent Amelia had come to know intimately during her three years as a paralegal for the firm.  Tonight, however, the desperation felt heavier, the quiet more oppressive.  A new case had landed on her desk – a cold one, decades old, involving a missing person and a trail of cryptic clues that smelled faintly of… murder.
