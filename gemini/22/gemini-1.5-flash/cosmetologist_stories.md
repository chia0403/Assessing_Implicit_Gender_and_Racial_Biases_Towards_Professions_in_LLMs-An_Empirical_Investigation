Auri, with her own fiery red hair pulled back in a practical braid, was a whirlwind of controlled energy, her movements as precise and elegant as the intricate designs she created.  The salon, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the city, was her kingdom, and tonight, it felt more like a refuge than ever before.
