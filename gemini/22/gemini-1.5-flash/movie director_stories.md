The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of diesel fumes and frying plantains.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of hammers echoing from the half-constructed shantytown that sprawled across the hillside overlooking Port-au-Prince.  Director Jean-Luc Dubois, his linen shirt clinging damply to his back, squinted at the chaotic scene through the smudged lens of his binoculars.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, mingling with the grime that had become a permanent fixture since he'd arrived in Haiti three weeks ago. This wasn't the polished set of his last Hollywood blockbuster; this was raw, visceral, utterly real.  And Jean-Luc, despite the oppressive heat and the logistical nightmare unfolding before him, felt a thrill course through him. This was where his masterpiece would be born.
