The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch’s hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in the sprawling, overgrown sanctuary that was Blackwood Wildlife Refuge.  Ancient oaks, their branches gnarled like arthritic fingers, clawed at the bruised twilight sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the uneven, rutted paths.  Amelia, bundled in layers of fleece and waterproofs, ignored the cold that seeped into her bones.  She had a menagerie to feed, and a deadline – a very grumpy badger named Barnaby was expecting his evening porridge, and Barnaby, Amelia had learned over the years, did not suffer fools gladly.  The refuge, a patchwork of repurposed farmland and neglected woodland, hummed with the quiet, nocturnal rustlings of its inhabitants; a symphony of snuffles, chirps, and the occasional indignant squawk that only added to the already captivating, if slightly chaotic, atmosphere.
