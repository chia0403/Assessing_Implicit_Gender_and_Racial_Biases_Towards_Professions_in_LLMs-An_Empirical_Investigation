The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but oddly comforting perfume unique to “Shear Bliss,” Amelia Jean Worthington’s tiny salon nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually twilight city of Porthaven.  Rain, a constant companion in this coastal town, hammered against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the street outside.  Amelia Jean, her fingers nimble and precise as she snipped a stray strand from a client’s auburn bob, barely registered the storm.

Tonight, however, even her usual equanimity was beginning to fray.  The rhythmic snip-snip of her shears was punctuated by a low thrumming that seemed to vibrate from the very foundations of the building, a sound far too deep and resonant to be merely the wind.
