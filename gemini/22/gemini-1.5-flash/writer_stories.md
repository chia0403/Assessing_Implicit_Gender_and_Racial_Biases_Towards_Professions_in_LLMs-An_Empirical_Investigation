The garret itself, tucked away in the eaves of a crumbling Victorian house perched precariously on the edge of the Cornish cliffs, was a testament to Amelia’s chaotic creativity – a whirlwind of inspiration and neglect, mirroring the tempestuous novel she was struggling to complete.  The wind howled outside, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her typewriter keys, a sound swallowed by the immensity of the Atlantic Ocean crashing against the rocks far below.
