The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of her clinic, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Rain, a fine, icy drizzle, had begun to fall, blurring the already fading light into a watercolour wash of greys and purples.  Her small, brick building, tucked away on the edge of Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the vast, brooding Blackwood Forest, looked especially vulnerable tonight.  The only illumination came from the single, flickering light in her waiting room, a lonely beacon in the encroaching darkness.  Inside, the faint scent of antiseptic and pine needles, Eleanor's favourite diffuser blend, barely competed with the damp chill that seemed to seep from the very foundations of the building.  This was her sanctuary, her haven, and tonight, it felt more like a besieged fortress.
