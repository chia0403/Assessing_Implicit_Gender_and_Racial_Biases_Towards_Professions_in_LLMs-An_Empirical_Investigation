The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of vanilla, buttercream, and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of almond extract.  Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lavender from a particularly vibrant batch of frosting, hummed a jaunty tune as she meticulously piped rosettes onto a three-tiered wedding cake.  The kitchen of "Sweet Surrender," her small but beloved bakery nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town, was a kaleidoscope of colour and confectionery chaos.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating motes of flour dancing in the golden rays and catching the glitter dusting the fondant of a nearby gingerbread castle.  Outside, the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages punctuated the gentle murmur of tourists exploring the historic square, a world away from the intense concentration Izzy poured into her artistry.  The wedding cake, a masterpiece of cascading white roses and delicate sugar lace, demanded her full attention; a single misplaced swirl could ruin the whole effect.  Tonight, it wasn't just a cake; it was a promise, a symbol of a love story waiting to unfold.
