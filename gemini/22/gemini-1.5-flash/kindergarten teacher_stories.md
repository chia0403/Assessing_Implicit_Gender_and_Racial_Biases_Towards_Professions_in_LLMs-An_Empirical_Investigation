The chipped paint of the miniature firetruck, clinging precariously to the side of Ms. Eleanor Vance's desk, vibrated with the low hum of impending chaos.  Sunlight, fractured by the dusty windowpanes of Room 104 at Sunny Meadows Elementary, painted dancing motes in the air, each one a tiny, shimmering promise of sugary snacks and impending meltdowns.  Crayon shavings littered the floor like fallen confetti after a particularly enthusiastic art project, a vibrant testament to the whirlwind of five-year-old creativity that Eleanor Vance, a woman whose patience rivaled that of a saint (or perhaps a very, very tired superhero), navigated daily.  The air hung thick with the scent of glue, slightly burnt toast (courtesy of Timmyâ€™s perpetually late breakfast), and the indefinable, slightly sweet aroma unique to a room full of small children.
