The biting wind howled a mournful tune around the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, rattling the single-paned windows of Dr. Alistair Finch’s surprisingly modern dental surgery.  Nestled improbably in the tiny village of Glencoe, tucked between a rushing burn and the brooding shadow of Buachaille Etive Mòr, the building was a stark contrast to its surroundings – a sleek, glass-fronted structure that looked as if it had been beamed down from a spaceship. Inside, the scent of ozone and antiseptic struggled to overcome the pervasive smell of peat smoke clinging to the thick tweed coats left by the day’s earlier patients.  Alistair Finch, a man whose hands were as steady as the mountain itself despite their daily wrestling with drills and forceps, surveyed his impeccably clean workspace.  The rhythmic whir of the sterilization unit was the only sound louder than the wind's insistent wail outside.  He sighed, a puff of frosty air escaping his lips, and picked up his patient file – a worn, dog-eared folder bearing the name of his next appointment:  Hamish MacIntyre.
