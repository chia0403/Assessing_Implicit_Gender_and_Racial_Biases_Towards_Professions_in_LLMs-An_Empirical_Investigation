The scent of sandalwood and bergamot hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless Seattle drizzle lashing against the windowpanes of Serenity Spa.  Raindrops, fat and insistent, traced erratic paths down the glass, mirroring the anxious flutter in Elara Vance’s stomach.  Elara, a massage therapist with hands as sure and steady as the ancient cedars lining the Olympic Peninsula, usually thrived on the calming rhythm of her work.  But tonight, the usual tranquility felt fractured, replaced by a gnawing unease that even the most potent aromatherapy couldn't quite dispel. The soft glow of the Himalayan salt lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the plush, jade-green massage table, its comforting warmth doing little to alleviate the chill that had settled deep in her bones.  A new client, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was scheduled for a ninety-minute deep tissue massage, and something about his booking – a last-minute reservation made anonymously – felt…off.
