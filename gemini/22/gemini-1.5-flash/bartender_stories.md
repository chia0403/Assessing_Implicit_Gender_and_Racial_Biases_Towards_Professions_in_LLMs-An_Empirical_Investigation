The chipped Formica bar top felt slick under Elara Vance's fingertips as she polished a already gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, bleeding crimson.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap bourbon, and the lingering ghost of a spilled margarita â€“ a familiar, comforting perfume to Elara.  The only other occupant of the establishment besides herself was a half-empty bottle of rye whiskey, brooding silently on a shelf behind the bar, its amber liquid reflecting the flickering fluorescent lights like a trapped sunset.  Outside, the city of Veridia groaned under the weight of the storm, a low, rhythmic rumble that mirrored the unease settling in Elara's gut.  Tonight felt different.  Even for The Rusty Mug.
