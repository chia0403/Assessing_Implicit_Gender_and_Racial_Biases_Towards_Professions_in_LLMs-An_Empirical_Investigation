The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn “Evie” Reed’s battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the tiny cockpit windows.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, shrouded in a swirling, ethereal mist, clawed at the bruised purple sky.  The sun, a weak, watery orb struggling to break through the oppressive cloud cover, cast long, skeletal shadows across the jagged peaks, making the already treacherous landscape seem even more menacing.  Evie shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The radio crackled with static, a frustrating counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the wind against the fuselage.  Her flight plan – a routine mail run to the remote village of Iliamna – was already behind schedule, and a growing unease gnawed at the edges of her professional calm. This wasn't just the usual challenging Alaskan weather; something felt…off.
