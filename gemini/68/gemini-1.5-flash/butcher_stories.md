The chill wind, sharp as a cleaver, sliced through Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's thick wool coat as he unlocked the back door of Butterfield's Best, his family butcher shop.  The pre-dawn gloom of Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the vast, whispering moorlands, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the cobblestones like the scent of woodsmoke and brine from the nearby fishing village.  Inside, the shop was a haven of warmth, the air thick with the comforting aroma of freshly-ground pepper, iron, and something indefinably… primal.  The scent of blood, Barty thought, a familiar and oddly comforting companion to the solitude of these early hours.  He’d been opening Butterfield’s Best since he was a boy, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him, and the rhythmic clang of his cleaver against the steel chopping block was as ingrained in his soul as the town’s own creaking, centuries-old timber frame houses.
