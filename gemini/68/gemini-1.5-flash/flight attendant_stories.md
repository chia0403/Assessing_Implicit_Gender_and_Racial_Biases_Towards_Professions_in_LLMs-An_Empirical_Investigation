The recycled air hung thick and cloying, a miasma of cheap perfume, stale coffee, and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Amelia “Amy” Hernandez, a veteran flight attendant with Southwest Airlines, felt the familiar knot of pre-flight anxiety tighten in her stomach. Not from turbulence, not from unruly passengers – though she’d seen her share of both – but from the unsettling quiet that had settled over Gate 42 at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.  The usual pre-departure cacophony – the chatter of families, the hurried footsteps of connecting passengers, the insistent drone of the boarding announcements – was replaced by a heavy, expectant silence, broken only by the rhythmic hum of the air conditioning and the distant, almost mournful wail of a desert wind howling outside the terminal’s towering glass windows.  Amy straightened her crisp, red uniform, the tiny Southwest heart embroidered on her collar a stark contrast to the ominous stillness. Tonight, she had a feeling, this flight to Denver was going to be anything but ordinary.
