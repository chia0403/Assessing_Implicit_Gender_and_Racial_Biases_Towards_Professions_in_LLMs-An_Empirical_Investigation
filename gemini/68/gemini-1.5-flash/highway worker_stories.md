The rasping shriek of metal on metal sliced through the pre-dawn quiet, a sound Dale “Mac” McAlister was intimately familiar with.  Mac adjusted the worn, orange safety vest clinging to his broad shoulders, the fabric already damp with the lingering chill of a November morning in the high desert of Nevada.  The sun, a pale apricot smear on the horizon, hadn’t yet begun to burn off the frost clinging to the cracked asphalt of US Route 93.  Miles of desolate scrubland stretched to either side, punctuated only by the occasional scraggly Joshua tree, their skeletal arms reaching towards a sky the color of faded denim.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of sagebrush and diesel fuel, a perfume uniquely Nevada.  Today’s task: patching potholes the size of small cars, a Sisyphean struggle against the relentless wear and tear of endless eighteen-wheelers rumbling through this forgotten corner of the world.
