The biting November wind howled a mournful song across the desolate plains of Montana, whipping snow into frenzied swirls that obscured the already fading light.  Visibility was down to near zero, the only illumination coming from the weak, yellow glow of Earl "Dusty" Rhodes's headlights, cutting through the blizzard like a hesitant knife.  Dusty, his full name embroidered in faded, cracked lettering on the worn leather of his trucker's cap –  Earlington "Dusty" Rhodes – gripped the wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, a veteran of countless miles etched into his weathered face and the deep lines surrounding his tired, blue eyes.  The semi, a rumbling behemoth affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," groaned under the strain of the unforgiving weather, her tires struggling for purchase on the treacherous, ice-slicked highway.  The radio crackled with static, punctuated by the occasional, garbled transmission, a lonely soundtrack to Dusty's solitary journey across the unforgiving landscape.  He was hours from his scheduled delivery in Billings, and the storm showed no signs of letting up.
