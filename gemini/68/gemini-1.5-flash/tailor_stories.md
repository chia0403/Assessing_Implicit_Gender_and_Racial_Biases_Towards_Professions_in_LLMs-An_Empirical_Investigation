The biting November wind whipped through the cobbled alleyways of Prague, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and roasted chestnuts.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had begun at dawn, plastered Amelia Petrova's dark hair to her forehead as she hurried along, her hands tucked deep into the pockets of her worn wool coat.  Amelia, a tailor of renowned skill but modest means,  lived above her tiny shop, "Petrova's Stitches," nestled between a butcher's and a dimly lit apothecary.  The shop's single gas lamp cast a feeble glow on the hand-painted sign, barely visible through the downpour.  Inside, the air was a comforting contrast to the chill outside â€“ warm, fragrant with the scent of beeswax and fine fabrics, the hum of her sewing machine a quiet counterpoint to the city's boisterous rhythm. Tonight, however, even the comforting whir of the machine couldn't drown out the unsettling tremor in Amelia's heart. A new client, a mysterious woman shrouded in secrets, awaited her, and Amelia had a feeling this commission would be anything but ordinary.
