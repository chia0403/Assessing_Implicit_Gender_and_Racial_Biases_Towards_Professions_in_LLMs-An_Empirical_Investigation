The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade!" sign flaked onto the dusty windowsill, mirroring the slow decay settling over Eleanor Vance's own spirit.  It wasn't the peeling paint itself, nor the slightly musty smell of old textbooks and dried glue that weighed her down, but the oppressive July heat clinging to the air like a shroud.  Oakhaven Elementary School, nestled in a forgotten corner of the sprawling Californian valley, was usually a vibrant place, bursting with the chaotic energy of a hundred children.  But summer vacation had transformed it into a silent, almost ghostly place, the echoing emptiness amplified by the incessant drone of cicadas outside.  Only the occasional squeak of a rusty swing set offered a break in the stillness.  Even the usually boisterous oak tree that shaded the playground seemed to wilt under the relentless sun.  Eleanor, however, remained stubbornly planted in her classroom, surrounded by stacks of unread papers and the faint, lingering scent of crayons and impending doom.  She had a feeling this summer would be anything but a vacation.
