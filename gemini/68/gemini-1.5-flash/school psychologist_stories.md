The stale scent of old textbooks and floor polish clung to the air in the hallway of Northwood High, a perfume only Dr. Eleanor Vance truly appreciated.  It was the comforting aroma of contained chaos, a familiar blanket against the anxieties that often swirled around her.  Eleanor, or Ellie as most students called her – a privilege she granted only to those who demonstrated a modicum of self-awareness – adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the weight of confidential files a familiar presence against her side.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the meticulously manicured lawns, each drop mirroring the individual anxieties she'd be facing today.  Northwood High, a picture of privilege on the outside, concealed a tapestry of adolescent turmoil woven with threads of pressure, heartbreak, and the simmering resentment that only teenage angst could truly conjure.  It was a Tuesday, and for Dr. Eleanor Vance, another day of navigating the labyrinthine corridors of the teenage mind had begun.
