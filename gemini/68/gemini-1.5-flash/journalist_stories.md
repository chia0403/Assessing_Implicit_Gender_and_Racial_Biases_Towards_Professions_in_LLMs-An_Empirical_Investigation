The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s trench coat around her legs as she hunched deeper into the shadows of the crumbling Victorian mansion.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her forehead, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow spilling from a single, cracked window.  Ivy, thick as a man’s arm, clawed at the decaying brickwork, its tendrils whispering secrets only the wind could understand.  This wasn't the picturesque Cotswolds countryside Amelia usually covered; this was Blackwood Manor, notorious throughout the village of Ashworth for its unsettling history and even more unsettling current resident – the recluse, Lord Ashworth himself.  The stench of damp earth and decaying leaves mingled with a sharper, almost metallic scent that prickled Amelia’s nostrils, a scent that promised something far more sinister than just a neglected estate.
