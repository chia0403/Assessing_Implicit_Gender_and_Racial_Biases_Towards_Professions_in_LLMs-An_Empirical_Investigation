The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elara "Ellie" Vance's fingertips as she meticulously polished a glass, the rhythmic swirl a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation in "The Rusty Mug."  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the dimly lit tavern, blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor Store" sign across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, damp wool, and something vaguely floral – probably the cheap potpourri Mrs. Gable, the landlady, insisted on placing in a chipped ceramic bowl near the cash register.  Ellie glanced at the clock – 11:57 PM.  Another slow night at The Rusty Mug, which, in Ellie's experience, usually meant a night pregnant with unexpected trouble.
