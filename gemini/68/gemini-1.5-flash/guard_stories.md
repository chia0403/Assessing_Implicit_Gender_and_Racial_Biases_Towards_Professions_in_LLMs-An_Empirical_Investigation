The biting wind whipped at Sergeant Valerius Thorne's cloak, a ragged thing of once-fine wool now stiffened with rime and smelling faintly of woodsmoke and desperation.  He tugged it tighter around his shoulders, the thin fabric offering little protection against the icy breath of the Black Mire.  Before him stretched the desolate expanse of the Whisperwind Marshes, a vast, grey wasteland under a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Reeds, skeletal and brittle, clawed at the muddy banks of the sluggish, black water, their whispers swallowed by the mournful howl of the wind.  Valerius, his breath misting in the frigid air, shifted the weight of his halberd, its polished steel glinting dully in the weak light.  He was the last guard at the crumbling watchtower of Oakhaven, the last line of defence against whatever horrors lurked beyond the marshes, and tonight, the silence felt heavier than any storm.
