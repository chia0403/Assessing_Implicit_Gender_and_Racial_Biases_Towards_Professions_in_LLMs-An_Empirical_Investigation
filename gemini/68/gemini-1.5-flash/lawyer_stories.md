The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s crisp white suit, a tiny, ironic shower of decay against the backdrop of the gleaming Manhattan skyline.  From her perch on the third floor of a crumbling brownstone in the East Village, the city roared – a symphony of car horns, sirens, and the distant, almost ethereal hum of the subway.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of roasting coffee and something vaguely floral, a surprising juxtaposition against the gritty urban grit clinging to everything, including Mia herself.  She hadn't slept properly in three days, fuelled by stale coffee and the burning pressure of a case that threatened to consume her entirely.  The flickering neon sign of "Sal's Pizzeria" cast a lurid glow on the overflowing trash cans below, illuminating the crumpled takeout containers that littered the alleyway like fallen soldiers.  This was her battlefield, and tonight, the war was far from over.
