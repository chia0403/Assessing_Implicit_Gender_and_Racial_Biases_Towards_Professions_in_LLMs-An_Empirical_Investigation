The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of roasting garlic, simmering tomatoes, and something indefinably…French.  Chef Antoinette Evangeline Dubois, her dark braid escaping its neat bun to tickle the nape of her neck, surveyed her domain with a critical eye.  The kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a tiny, jewel-box of a bistro nestled in the cobbled alleyways of Montmartre, Paris, hummed with a pre-service energy that was both exhilarating and terrifying.  Stainless steel gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the frantic but precise movements of her sous chefs.  The rhythmic clang of pans, the whispered instructions in rapid-fire French, and the low thrum of the industrial oven formed a symphony of culinary chaos – a familiar and comforting soundtrack to Antoinette’s life.  Tonight, however, the usual thrill was edged with a tremor of apprehension.  This wasn't just another Tuesday night at Le Papillon Bleu; tonight, the legendary food critic, Monsieur Jean-Pierre Lefevre, was dining in.
