The biting November wind howled a mournful song around Elias Thorne’s ears, whipping stray strands of his greying hair across his face as he wrestled with a recalcitrant junction box.  Rain, icy and relentless, plastered his thick work jacket to his back, making the already-difficult task of replacing the faulty wiring in Mrs. Gable’s ancient Victorian even more challenging.  The house itself, a sprawling Gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, seemed to groan under the weight of the storm, each gust of wind a skeletal finger rapping against its aged timbers.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, muttered a string of curses under his breath, the taste of salt spray clinging to his lips.  Inside, the flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows, illuminating the peeling wallpaper and the dust motes swirling in the gloom like tiny, malevolent spirits.  This was no ordinary electrical job; it felt more like an exorcism.
