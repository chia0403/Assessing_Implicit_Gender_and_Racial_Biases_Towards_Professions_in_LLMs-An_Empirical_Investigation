The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Lieutenant Elias Thorne's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The orange glow painting the inky sky was less familiar, however.  This wasn't the controlled burn of a prescribed wildfire; this was something far more sinister, a malevolent orange maw consuming the ancient redwood forest surrounding the small, coastal town of Seabrook, California.  The air, usually thick with the scent of salt and pine, now choked with the suffocating stench of burning timber and something elseâ€¦ something metallic, sharp, like fear itself. Elias adjusted his helmet, the weight of it a comforting pressure against the chaos blooming around him. The roar of the flames was a deafening symphony of destruction, punctuated by the crackle of snapping branches and the terrified cries of wildlife fleeing the inferno.  Seabrook, usually a picture of peaceful tranquility nestled between the ocean and the towering redwoods, was under siege.
