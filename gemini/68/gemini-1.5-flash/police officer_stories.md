The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Sharma's face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate stretch of beach.  Grey, churning waves clawed at the shingle, spitting froth and seaweed onto the sand.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something else – something acrid and unsettling – clung to the back of her throat.  The single, flickering sodium lamp of the nearby lifeguard hut cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the restless tide, making the already grim scene even more unnerving.  Before her lay the body, partially submerged in the receding water, a stark, lifeless form silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  This was not the picturesque Cornish coastline advertised in the brochures; this was a canvas painted in shades of death and despair.
