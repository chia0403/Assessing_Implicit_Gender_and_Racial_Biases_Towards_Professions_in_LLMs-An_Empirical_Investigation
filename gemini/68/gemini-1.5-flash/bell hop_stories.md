The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, a stark contrast to the grime clinging to the edges of the ornate Persian rug.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigars, cheap perfume, and something vaguely floral that failed to mask the underlying odour of damp velvet and forgotten dreams.  This was the Grand Majestic's nightly symphony, a cacophony only occasionally interrupted by the rhythmic clang of the elevator doors or the hushed whispers of clandestine meetings.  For Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bellhop with shoulders permanently bowed under the weight of countless suitcases and even heavier expectations, this was home.  Tonight, however, the familiar hum of the hotel felt different, charged with a nervous energy that vibrated through the polished marble floor and up into the very soles of his worn leather shoes.  The storm brewing outside mirrored the one he sensed gathering within the Grand Majestic's opulent, yet decaying, walls.
