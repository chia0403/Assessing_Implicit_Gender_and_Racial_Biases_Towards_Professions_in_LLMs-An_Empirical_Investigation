The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Blackwood’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She squinted, her eyes, the same stormy grey as the churning sea before her, fixed on the churning canvas propped precariously on the wind-battered easel.  The lighthouse, a stoic sentinel against the bruised purple and bruised orange sunset, clawed its way onto the canvas in messy, furious strokes of oil paint.  Amelia, her thick auburn braid whipping wildly in the gale, didn’t bother to shield her palette from the relentless wind; the splatters of colour, mirroring the chaotic sky, were as much a part of the painting as the lighthouse itself.  She stood on the jagged rocks of Penberth Cove, Cornwall, the wind howling a mournful dirge around her, a fitting soundtrack to the tempestuous emotions swirling within her.  The smell of brine and seaweed hung heavy in the air, mingling with the pungent odour of turpentine and linseed oil.  This was her sanctuary, her battleground, her canvas.
