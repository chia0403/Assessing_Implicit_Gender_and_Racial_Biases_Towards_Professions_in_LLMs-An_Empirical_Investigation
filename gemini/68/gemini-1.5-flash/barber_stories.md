The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, its faded lettering barely legible:  "Armand's Cuts & Shaves."  Inside, the aroma of Bay Rum aftershave battled with the cloying sweetness of decaying magnolia blossoms drifting in through the single, dusty window.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that sliced through the gloom of Armand Thibodeaux's barbershop, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the worn leather of the barber chair, its springs groaning a silent protest with every shift of weight.  Armand himself, a man sculpted by years of wielding shears and straight razors, sat hunched over a worn copy of *True Detective* magazine, his fingers stained a permanent ochre from years of handling hair dye.  The only sound besides the creaking sign was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, each second a slow, deliberate hammer blow against the suffocating stillness of the afternoon.
