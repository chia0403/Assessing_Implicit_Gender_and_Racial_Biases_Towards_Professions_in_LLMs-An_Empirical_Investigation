The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her trench coat to her skin, mirroring the chill that had settled deep in her bones.  Before her lay Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Its skeletal branches, gnarled and twisted like the limbs of some ancient beast, clawed at the stormy sky, mirroring the unsettling feeling that clenched at Eleanor’s gut.  The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and something else… something acrid and metallic, the faint, lingering whisper of death.  This wasn't her first gruesome crime scene, but something about Blackwood Manor – its isolated grandeur, its palpable air of decay and secrets – felt profoundly different.  This was more than just a murder; this was a descent into the heart of darkness.
