Flour dusted every surface, from the chipped countertop to the overflowing shelves crammed with jars of sprinkles, extracts, and oddly-shaped cookie cutters.  Outside, the relentless London rain hammered against the warped windowpanes, a counterpoint to the quiet hum of the refrigerator and the rhythmic squeak of Amy's piping bag.
