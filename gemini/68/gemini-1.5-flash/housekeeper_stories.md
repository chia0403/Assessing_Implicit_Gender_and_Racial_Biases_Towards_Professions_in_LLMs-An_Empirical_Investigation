The chipped porcelain sink wept a steady stream of lukewarm water, mirroring the relentless drip, drip, drip of Elara Vance's anxieties.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun slanting through the grimy window of the kitchen, danced in the air like tiny, malevolent spirits.  Elara, her hands raw and red from scrubbing at ingrained grease, sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous, echoing silence of Blackwood Manor.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp stone, aging wood, and a faint, underlying perfume â€“ something floral and cloying, like a forgotten bouquet pressed between the pages of a dusty tome.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea, was both Elara's workplace and her prison.  The sea's constant roar was a mournful counterpoint to the unsettling quiet within the mansion's crumbling walls.
