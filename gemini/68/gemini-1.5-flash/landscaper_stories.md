The dawn broke over Willow Creek, painting the dew-kissed grass a shimmering emerald.  A thin mist, clinging stubbornly to the valley, veiled the distant peaks of the Cascade Mountains in a mystical haze.  Elias Thorne, his breath puffing out in small, white clouds, adjusted the worn leather straps of his backpack, the scent of damp earth and pine already filling his lungs.

Elias, owner of Thorne's Landscaping, surveyed his first job of the day â€“ a sprawling Victorian estate, its gingerbread trim barely visible through the clinging fog, a testament to the wealth and history hidden behind its overgrown hedges.
