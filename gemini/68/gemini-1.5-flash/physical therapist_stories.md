The salt spray kissed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she navigated the rickety wooden pier, the scent of brine and decaying seaweed clinging to the damp air.  Seagulls, their cries sharp against the rhythmic crash of waves against the pilings, wheeled overhead.  The grey sky threatened rain, mirroring the stormy mood of the small, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled precariously between the churning Atlantic and a range of brooding, mist-shrouded cliffs.
