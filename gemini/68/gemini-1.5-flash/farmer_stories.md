The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that choked the valley.  Each gust howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that guarded Elias Thorne's farm, Thorne's End.

The farmhouse itself, a sturdy stone structure that had weathered countless storms, looked small and vulnerable beneath the oppressive weight of the snow.
