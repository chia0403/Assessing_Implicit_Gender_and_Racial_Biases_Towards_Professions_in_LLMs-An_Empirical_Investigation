The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Hayes, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick thermal layers beneath her parka.  The air, thin and frigid, tasted of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of seawater.  Before her, the endless expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf stretched towards the horizon, a breathtaking, desolate landscape sculpted by millennia of ice and wind.  Evelyn, her breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the heavy-duty binoculars hanging from her neck, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering blue ice of an immense crevasse â€“ the site of her latest, and perhaps most crucial, research project.  The remote research station, a collection of prefabricated modules huddled against the brutal elements like frightened penguins, lay a kilometer behind her, a tiny beacon of warmth and civilization in this frozen wilderness.
