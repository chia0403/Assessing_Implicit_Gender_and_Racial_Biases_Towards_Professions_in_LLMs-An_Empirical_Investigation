Professor Augustine "Gus" Finch adjusted his tweed jacket, the worn fabric whispering against the crisp autumn air that bit at his exposed neck.  October in the Scottish Highlands had a bite to it, a bracing chill that seeped into the very bones.  He stood on the windswept precipice overlooking Loch Ness, the legendary waters a shimmering, inky expanse under the bruised purple sky.  The ancient stones of Urquhart Castle, crumbling testament to centuries past, clawed at the darkening horizon like skeletal fingers.  Gus, however, wasn't here to admire the scenery, despite its undeniable majesty.  He was here because a cryptic, centuries-old manuscript – a manuscript he’d dedicated the last decade of his life to deciphering – had finally led him here, to this desolate, windswept corner of the world, to a truth far stranger than any Nessie legend.
