The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the outboard motor into life.  The grey, churning waters of the North Sea mirrored the turbulent sky above, threatening rain at any moment.  She gripped the wheel of her small fishing boat, the *Osprey*, its hull groaning under the weight of the tide and the heavy crate secured precariously in the stern. Inside, nestled amongst straw and burlap, lay her latest patient: a colossal, injured grey seal, its mournful cries barely audible above the roar of the engine. The air smelled of brine, fish guts, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a familiar perfume to Eleanor, one that clung to her clothes and her soul like a second skin, a testament to her life spent tending to the wild creatures of the harsh, beautiful Orkney Islands.
