The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's fingertips on her pristine, white desk.  Penelope, or Penny as only her closest friends (and none of her colleagues) dared to call her, adjusted the perfectly positioned orchid in its minimalist ceramic pot.  The scent, a delicate blend of vanilla and something subtly citrusy, was a small rebellion against the suffocating air of legal formality that permeated the opulent, if slightly dated, reception area.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful song against the towering skyscraper windows, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost reverent silence maintained within Sterling & Steele's hallowed halls.  This silence, however, was about to be shattered.
