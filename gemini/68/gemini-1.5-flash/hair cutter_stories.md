The scent of ozone and burnt hair hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Reli” Blackwood.  Rain lashed against the mismatched panes of glass that made up the front of her shop, "Snip & Stitch," blurring the neon glow of the "OPEN" sign into a hazy, shimmering rectangle.  Inside, the only illumination came from a single, flickering bulb dangling precariously above her worn wooden worktable, casting long, dancing shadows across the cracked linoleum floor.  Reli, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of dye colors – remnants of a particularly flamboyant ombre earlier that afternoon – meticulously cleaned her shears, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the storm outside.  The shop itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually rain-soaked city of Oakhaven, was as much a reflection of its owner as it was a haven for the city's misfits and eccentrics.
