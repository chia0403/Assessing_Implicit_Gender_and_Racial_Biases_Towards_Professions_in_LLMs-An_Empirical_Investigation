The scent of acetone and lilac hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clung to the plush velvet chairs and the chipped porcelain sinks of "Nails by Nicole," a salon tucked away on a quiet side street in Astoria, Queens.  The afternoon sun, slanting through the gauzy curtains, cast long shadows across the meticulously organized nail polish racks, each bottle a tiny jewel reflecting the fading light.  Nicole DeLuca, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of vibrant hues, carefully filed the edge of a client's perfectly oval nail, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the cacophony of the city – the honking taxis, the distant sirens, the murmur of a thousand conversations – faded into a muted hum, swallowed by the quiet sanctuary of her little salon.
