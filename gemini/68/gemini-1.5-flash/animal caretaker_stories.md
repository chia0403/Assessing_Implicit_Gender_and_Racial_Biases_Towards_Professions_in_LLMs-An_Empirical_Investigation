The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez's dark hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  Frozen ground crunched under her worn boots, the sound a stark counterpoint to the frantic chirping of sparrows huddled against the weathered brick walls of the Blackwood Animal Sanctuary.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within a valley carved by the capricious Blackwood River, was a patchwork of ramshackle barns, repurposed sheds, and surprisingly vibrant gardens that somehow flourished despite the encroaching chill.  This year, the first snow was predicted for tomorrow, and Amelia, head caretaker of the sanctuary for the past five years, felt the familiar pressure of winter's impending siege tightening in her chest.  The scent of damp earth and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the less pleasant aroma of something decidedly fox-like emanating from near the weasel enclosure.  Another day, another challenge in the seemingly endless task of keeping Blackwoodâ€™s furry, feathered, and scaled residents safe and warm.
