The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor like a gentle, colourful snow.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak autumnal sunlight slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air, a silent ballet performed for an empty classroom.  Crayon shavings, the remnants of a thousand masterpieces, littered the edges of the small, brightly coloured desks.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient window frames of Maplewood Elementary, a sound that usually sent the kindergarteners scrambling for comfort, but today, only silence answered.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines spoke of years spent coaxing giggles from tiny humans, sat at her desk, a single, half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee cooling beside a mountain of paperwork that seemed to grow taller by the minute.  The silence, heavy and expectant, was far more unsettling than the usual kindergarten cacophony.
