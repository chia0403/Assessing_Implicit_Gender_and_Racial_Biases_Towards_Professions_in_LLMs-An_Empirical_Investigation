The siren's wail was a banshee scream swallowed by the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of the ambulance.  Water cascaded down the windshield, blurring the already chaotic street scene into a swirling, grey smear.  Inside, the harsh fluorescent lights reflected off the slick, polished floor, highlighting the tension etched onto the face of Dr. Evelyn Grace Ainsworth.  Evelyn, a seasoned paramedic with the City of Oakhaven Emergency Medical Services, gripped the worn leather steering wheel, her knuckles bone-white.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the cardiac monitor in the back competed with the storm raging outside, a counterpoint to the frantic bursts of radio chatter crackling through the speaker.  Tonight, Oakhaven, usually a sleepy coastal town, felt like the eye of a hurricane, its quiet streets transformed into a treacherous, rain-soaked labyrinth.  The emergency call had been vague – multiple casualties, a suspected industrial accident at the old Peterson Canning Factory – a place locals called "The Cannery," a derelict monument to a bygone era, now shrouded in darkness and the whispers of urban legends.
