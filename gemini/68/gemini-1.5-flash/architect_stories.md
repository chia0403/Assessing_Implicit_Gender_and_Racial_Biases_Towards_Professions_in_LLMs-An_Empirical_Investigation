The biting November wind whipped Amelia Stone's charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she surveyed the skeletal frame of the Blackwood Manor restoration project.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for three days, plastered her dark hair to her forehead, clinging to the collar of her worn leather jacket.  Below, the sprawling, gothic estate clung precariously to the cliff face overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air was thick with the smell of brine and the damp earth of the crumbling cliffs, a stark contrast to the scent of old oak and linseed oil that permeated the interior â€“ a battle between the relentless sea and Amelia's meticulous efforts to bring Blackwood Manor back to life.  The manor itself, a testament to Victorian grandeur and decaying elegance, was a symphony of broken gables, shattered windows, and ivy-choked stonework, a puzzle she was determined to solve, one meticulously-placed brick at a time.
