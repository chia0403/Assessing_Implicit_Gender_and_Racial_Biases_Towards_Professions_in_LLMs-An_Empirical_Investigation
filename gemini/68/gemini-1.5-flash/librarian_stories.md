The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that seeped through the tall, arched windows of the Blackwood Public Library.  Rain lashed against the panes, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's heart.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred,  usually found solace in the hushed stacks, surrounded by the silent stories held within countless volumes.  But tonight, the quiet hum of the library felt different, charged with an almost palpable tension. The usual comforting predictability of her world, meticulously catalogued and shelved, feltâ€¦unsettled.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the oak floor, making the already imposing Gothic architecture seem even more foreboding.  The only sound, besides the storm, was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each second a heavy, measured beat against the mounting dread in her gut.
