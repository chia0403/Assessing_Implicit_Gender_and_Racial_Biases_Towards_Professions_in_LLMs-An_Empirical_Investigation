The pre-dawn chill bit at Aurelia “Auri” Blackwood’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors, the iron groaning a familiar protest against the weight of the night.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging above the entrance, danced in the shafts of pale light slicing through the grimy windows.  The air hung thick with the sweet, yeasty scent of sourdough starter – Auri’s pride and joy, bubbling away contentedly in its ceramic crock on the counter – a promise of the warm, comforting bread to come.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven were still draped in the inky shadows of early morning, the only sounds the distant rumble of a milk float and the occasional caw of a crow perched atop the crooked chimney of the old apothecary next door.  The bakery, Blackwood's Bakehouse, nestled between the apothecary and a perpetually-empty tailor’s shop, had seen better days, but Auri’s unwavering determination, like her sourdough starter, was resilient and persistent.
