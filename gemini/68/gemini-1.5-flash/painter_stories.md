The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's face as she wrestled the easel into position, the wind threatening to topple it onto the jagged rocks below.  The sky above the Breton coast was a bruised purple, bleeding into a fiery orange where the sun dipped towards the Atlantic.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls.  Sera, bundled in a thick wool coat despite the late August warmth, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Her fingers, stiff and clumsy from the chill, fumbled with her palette, the vibrant colours – cerulean, cadmium yellow, vermillion – a stark contrast to the melancholic landscape before her. This remote cove, hidden amongst the towering cliffs near Ploumanac'h, was her sanctuary, a place where the relentless churn of her inner world found a mirrored chaos in the untamed beauty of the sea.
