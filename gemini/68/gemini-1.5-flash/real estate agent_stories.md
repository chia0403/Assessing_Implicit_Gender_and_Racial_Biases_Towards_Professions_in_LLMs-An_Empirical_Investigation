The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s shoulders as she wrestled the stubborn lock on the wrought-iron gate.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the glistening dew clinging to the overgrown bougainvillea that clawed at the ancient stucco walls of the property.  This wasn't your typical beachfront condo; this was Casa de las Flores, a crumbling Spanish Revival mansion perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  Salt-laced air, thick with the scent of hibiscus and impending rain, hung heavy in the humid air.  Amelia, a real estate agent with a reputation for handling the most challenging properties in Sarasota, adjusted her crisp white linen shirt, a stark contrast to the overgrown jungle surrounding her.  She'd been warned about this one – a legacy property steeped in local legend and, it seemed, a healthy dose of neglect.  Today, she intended to uncover the truth behind the whispers surrounding Casa de las Flores, and hopefully, its market value.
