The wind, a rasping chisel against the granite cliffs of Cairngorm, whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s grey hair across his face.  He brushed it away, the movement stiff and slow, a testament to years spent hunched over his work.  The air tasted of pine and damp earth, a familiar scent that clung to the rugged highlands of Scotland like a second skin.  Elias, his calloused hands cradling a worn hammer, surveyed his latest creation: a rough-hewn angel, its wings still imprisoned within the stubborn heart of the grey stone, waiting for his patient touch to release them.  The sun, a pale disc behind a curtain of swirling mist, cast long, skeletal shadows across the quarry, highlighting the countless chips and fragments scattered like fallen stars across the uneven ground.  This was his life, a life carved from stone, as unforgiving and beautiful as the landscape itself.
