The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch-scratch-scratch of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s pencil on mylar.  Dust motes, disturbed by her careful hand, danced in the pale yellow glow, illuminated like constellations in a miniature, architectural universe.  Amelia, perched on a worn stool, its vinyl seat cracked and yielding beneath her, meticulously shaded the rendering of a proposed skyscraper – a glass behemoth that promised to pierce the already crowded skyline of Chicago.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faintly sweet aroma of the drafting pencils themselves, held a stillness punctuated only by the occasional sigh from a nearby coworker and the distant rumble of the city outside, a city Amelia both loved and felt perpetually at arm's length from within these four walls.
