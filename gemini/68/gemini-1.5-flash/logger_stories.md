The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne’s beard across his frost-chapped cheeks, stinging like a thousand tiny needles.  He hunched deeper into his worn sheepskin coat, the collar pulled high to shield his face from the relentless onslaught of snow.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the low groan of the ancient Douglas firs that towered around him, their skeletal branches clawing at the bruised, grey sky.  This wasn't the gentle, whispering forest of spring; this was the brutal, unforgiving heart of winter in the Cascade Mountains, where the only sounds louder than the wind were the crackle of ice and the rhythmic thud of Elias's axe biting into frozen wood.  His breath plumed out in white puffs, disappearing instantly into the swirling blizzard.  He was miles from the nearest logging camp, deeper into the wilderness than any sane man should venture in weather like this, but Elias Thorne,  a man hardened by years of wrestling with the raw power of nature, wasn't known for his sanity. He was known for his strength, his skill, and his stubborn refusal to back down from a challenge – even one as formidable as this unforgiving mountain.
