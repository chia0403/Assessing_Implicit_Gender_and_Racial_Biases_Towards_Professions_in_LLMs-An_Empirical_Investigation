The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's Tuesday afternoon.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and slightly-off potato chips, hung heavy and still, broken only by the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner and the occasional frustrated sigh from a customer wrestling with a jammed vending machine. Amelia, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, meticulously arranged a stack of lottery tickets, her movements as precise and predictable as the ticking clock above the doorway.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway outside.  The only other soul in the store was Mr. Henderson, the night watchman, snoring softly in his usual corner by the overflowing bin of returned magazines.  It was, to put it mildly, a slow day.  A very, very slow day.  And Amelia, with her perfectly manicured fingernails and a sigh that echoed the hum of the fluorescent lights, was ready for it to end.
