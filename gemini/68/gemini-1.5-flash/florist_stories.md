The scent of lilies, heady and almost cloying, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the crisp autumn chill biting at the exposed brickwork of "Petal Pushers," Amelia Grace Hawthorne's flower shop.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes, blurring the already fading light of a late October afternoon. Inside, Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate amethyst from handling late-blooming hydrangeas, hummed a melancholic tune, the melody lost amongst the gentle drip, drip, drip of water escaping a leaky gutter onto the awning outside.  The shop itself was a riot of colour and texture, a chaotic symphony of blooms battling the encroaching gloom: vibrant sunflowers jostled with delicate orchids, deep crimson roses mingled with cheerful daisies, their fragrance a potent cocktail that both invigorated and calmed.  But Amelia noticed none of it; her gaze was fixed on a single, perfect white calla lily, its elegant simplicity a stark counterpoint to the storm raging outside.
