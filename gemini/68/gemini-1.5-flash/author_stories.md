The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed as a bracing counterpoint to the stifling humidity clinging to the air like a second skin.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred, hunched deeper into her worn fisherman's sweater, the coarse wool scratching against her already chapped cheeks.  The rickety wooden deck of the *Sea Serpent*, a fishing trawler more charming than seaworthy, groaned beneath her weight as it pitched and rolled on the choppy waters of the Irish Sea.  Around her, the dramatic cliffs of County Clare rose like jagged teeth against a bruised, twilight sky, their silhouettes softened by the mist swirling around their peaks.  The air was thick with the scent of brine, seaweed, and a faint, underlying sweetness – the lingering perfume of the wild heather blooming on the clifftops.  This was her sanctuary, her escape from the suffocating expectations of London literary society, and the looming deadline for her next novel, a historical fiction set – ironically – in the sun-drenched Mediterranean.  But inspiration, Amy knew, often bloomed in the unlikeliest of places.
