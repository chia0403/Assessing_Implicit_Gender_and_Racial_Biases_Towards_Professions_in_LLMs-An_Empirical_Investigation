The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the "Sea Serpent."  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered wood.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and diesel, carried a sharper, underlying aroma – seaweed, yes, but something else, something subtly… metallic.  Eleanor, a nutritionist specializing in the dietary habits of coastal communities, squinted at the haul.  This wasn't a typical fishing trip; this was a fact-finding mission, one that had brought her far from her comfortable Boston office and deep into the heart of a remote island community clinging precariously to the edge of the world.  The metallic tang in the air, coupled with the unusually subdued chatter from the seasoned fishermen, hinted that her research might unearth something far more unsettling than simply unusual eating habits.
