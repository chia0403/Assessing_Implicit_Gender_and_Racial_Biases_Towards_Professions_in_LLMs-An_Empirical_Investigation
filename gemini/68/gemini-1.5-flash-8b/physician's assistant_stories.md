The humid air hung heavy, thick with the smell of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, clinging to the cobbled alleyways of Vieux-Québec.  Rain, a relentless, driving downpour, hammered against the slate rooftops, mirroring the frantic rhythm of Elara Vance's heart.  Elara, Physician's Assistant at the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the dampness seeping into her linen blouse.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her urgency.  Tonight, the call had come from the dilapidated hospice on Rue Saint-Jean.  Another case of the fever, they’d whispered, a fever that seemed to prey on the city's marginalized.  Elara knew, with a chilling certainty, that this one might be different.


**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the historic heart of Vieux-Québec, a picturesque but also gritty section of the city in 1888.  Cobblestone streets, overflowing with the aroma of woodsmoke and brewing coffee, are juxtaposed with decaying buildings, where the remnants of a bustling past mingle with the poverty of the present.  The palpable tension of the era, with its uneasy mixture of progress and societal divisions, is felt throughout the narrative. The Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, a grand but aging hospital, is the anchor of medical care in the area.  The claustrophobic, damp atmosphere of the hospice on Rue Saint-Jean, where many impoverished patients reside, is a stark contrast to the city's grandeur.
