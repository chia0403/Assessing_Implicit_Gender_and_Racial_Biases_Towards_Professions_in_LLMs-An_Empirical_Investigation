The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, whipped across the exposed steel skeleton of the skyscraper under construction.  Rain, the consistency of gritty gravel, hammered against the scaffolding, echoing the frantic rhythm of Silas Blackwood's hammering.  Silas, a thirty-five-year-old construction worker with calloused hands and eyes that held the perpetual twilight of the city, swore under his breath. Another bolt had slipped.  He wasn't sure if it was the faulty metal, the unforgiving weather, or simply his own mounting frustration.  Above him, the unfinished fa√ßade of the "Apex Tower," a gleaming testament to ambition, seemed to mock his struggles.  Below, the city throbbed with a frantic life he felt increasingly detached from.  He was lost in the concrete jungle, another brick in a monument to progress.

The year was 2042.  New York City, once a sprawling metropolis of towering skyscrapers, had been reshaped and refashioned into a series of interlocking, vertically-integrated complexes.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and industrial solvents, was a constant reminder of the constant construction.   The Apex Tower, situated on the nexus of the rebuilt financial district, was the latest, largest, and most ambitious project.  Every piece of this colossal edifice, every beam and brick, held the weight of a city's expectations, and Silas, buried deep within its scaffolding, carried a weight of his own.
