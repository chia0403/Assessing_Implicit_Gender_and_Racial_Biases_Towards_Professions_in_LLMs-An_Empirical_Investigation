The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's tenth-grade English classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of pencils on notebooks.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grimy windowpane, illuminating a scattering of crumpled papers and half-eaten granola bars on the otherwise pristine surface of the teacher's desk.  Outside, the concrete canyons of downtown Portland, Oregon, roared with the familiar symphony of rush hour traffic.  This was Eleanor's sanctuary, her battleground, her predictable purgatory.

Eleanor Vance, a woman whose auburn hair, usually meticulously pulled back in a severe bun, was today escaping its confines in a haphazard, slightly frantic arrangement, leaned against the worn wooden desk.  The faint scent of stale coffee and despair hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion to her late-afternoon grading sessions.  A stack of student essays, each bearing the tell-tale signs of procrastination and existential angst, formed a monument to the tireless work of a teacher resigned to the relentless ebb and flow of teenage sentimentality.  The year was 2024.
