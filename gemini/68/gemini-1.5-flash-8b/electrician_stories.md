The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electric Repairs" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Market Street.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion that drowned out the muted cries of gulls circling the harbour.  Inside, amidst the tangle of wires and half-finished circuits, stood  Elias Thorne, a young electrician with a mop of unruly brown hair plastered to his forehead.  His calloused hands, stained a deep, electric blue from recent solder work, tightened around the insulated wires of a faulty ceiling fan.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt plastic, a familiar symphony to Elias's ears.  This particular job, however, was different.  It wasn't just a faulty light fixture or a tripped circuit; it feltâ€¦wrong.
