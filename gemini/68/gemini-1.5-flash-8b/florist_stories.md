The scent of jasmine, almost overwhelming, clung to the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of honeysuckle that spilled from the overflowing window boxes lining the cobbled alleyway.  Rain slicked the grey stone walls, reflecting the gaslight's flickering yellow glow in puddles that mirrored the intricate floral arrangements displayed in the shop windows.  This was the heart of the Flower District, a labyrinth of narrow streets and hidden courtyards, a place where whispers of secrets and the vibrant colours of blossoms danced in a silent waltz.  It was here, amongst the fragrant chaos, that Amelia Blackwood, a florist with hands as delicate as porcelain and eyes as sharp as a well-honed blade, worked her magic.
