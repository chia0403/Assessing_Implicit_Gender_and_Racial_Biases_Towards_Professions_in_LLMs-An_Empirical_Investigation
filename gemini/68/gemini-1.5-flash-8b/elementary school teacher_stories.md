It was the strange, almost unsettlingly calm quiet, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the hallway, far outside the room's confines.  The air itself seemed thick, almost holding its breath.  And, of course, there were the whispers.  Whispers that seemed to follow her, like a chilling echo, every time she looked into the empty space where Mrs. Gable's desk had stood.
