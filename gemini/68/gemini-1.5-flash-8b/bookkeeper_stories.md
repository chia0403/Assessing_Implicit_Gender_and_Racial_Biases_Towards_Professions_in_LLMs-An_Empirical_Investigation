The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nonsense" accounting firm cast a pale, sickly yellow glow over Amelia Butterfield's meticulously organized desk.  Paper, in varying shades of beige and grey, piled precariously, a miniature mountain range stretching towards the ceiling.  Pencils, sharpened to razor sharpness, lay scattered like tiny, metallic daggers around a forgotten chessboard.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of unparalleled precision, was wrestling with a particularly thorny spreadsheet detailing the quarterly adjustments for the perpetually-troubled “Cosmic Candies” corporation.  Outside her window, the grey London sky reflected the muted gloom of the day, a perfect mirror to the frustrations swirling within her.  It was a Tuesday, and Amelia's Tuesday blues had an unusually tenacious grip.

The Numbers & Nonsense office, tucked away on a quiet side street just off Fleet Street, was a testament to its name.  Rows of filing cabinets, lined with meticulously labelled folders, stretched back into the dimly lit interior.  The air, thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, hummed with the rhythmic clicking of keyboards and the low murmur of hushed conversations.  Clients, all types of businesses from tiny artisanal bakeries to multinational conglomerates, flowed in and out of the firm, their anxieties and expectations swirling around Amelia in unseen currents.  Today, the pressure was especially intense, amplified by the looming deadline for the Cosmic Candies audit.
