The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Reliable Plumbing" storefront cast long, skeletal shadows across the rain-slicked pavement.  Grey clouds, thick and brooding, threatened to unleash another torrent onto the already sodden city.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with grease-stained hands and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand leaky faucets, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another unending cycle of clogged drains, broken pipes, and the insistent demands of irate homeowners.

Barty's tiny workshop, crammed with pipes of every conceivable size and shape, smelled faintly of copper and despair.  A chipped porcelain sink, abandoned in a corner, looked like a miniature, flooded city.  The rhythmic whirring of a rusty pump was the only music accompanying the incessant drip, drip, drip of a water leak that Barty had been chasing for three days.  He felt like a detective in a detective novel, except the evidence was always hiding in the walls.  The culprit, however, was always there, waiting to be coaxed out from under layers of grout and plaster.

The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "24-hour emergency plumbing," seemed mocking in the oppressive gloom.  Barty had a feeling this Tuesday was going to be a long one.
