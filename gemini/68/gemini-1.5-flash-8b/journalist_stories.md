The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's reporter's notebook against her chest, each gust a tiny, icy slap.  The cobbled streets of the old Marais district in Paris, usually a symphony of Parisian chatter and the clinking of bistro glasses, were eerily quiet.  A thick, unnatural stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of Amy's own frantic heartbeat.  It was the kind of stillness that preceded a storm, not just of rain, but of something far more sinister.

Amy, a seasoned investigative journalist for the *Parisian Chronicle*, crouched behind a crumbling, ivy-covered wall, her charcoal-grey wool coat pulled tight against the chill.  Around her, the meticulously restored buildings, with their ornate facades and whispering courtyards, seemed to hold their breath.  Even the pigeons, usually so bold and brazen, were unusually silent.  She was tracking a rumour, a whisper carried on the wind from the shadowy corners of the city â€“ a rumour of a hidden society, a secret order buried deep beneath the city's opulent surface, a society that dealt in artifacts of unimaginable power.  Tonight, she hoped to uncover more than just gossip.  Tonight, she hoped to find the truth.
