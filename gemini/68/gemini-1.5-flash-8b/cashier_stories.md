The fluorescent hum of the "Everything You Need, At Half the Price" supermarket buzzed, a relentless drone punctuated only by the rhythmic clatter of carts and the occasional exasperated sigh.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal awning, mimicking the relentless beat of Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s own pulse.  It was 2:17 AM, the graveyard shift, and the fluorescent lights seemed to mock her exhaustion.  Amy, a cashier with a perpetually smudged nametag reading “Amy Cartwright,” stared blankly at the barcode scanner, her fingers hovering over the plastic buttons.  The scanner beeped, a harsh, metallic sound that echoed in the cavernous space, highlighting the emptiness and the isolation.  Outside, the city slumbered, unaware of the quiet drama playing out within the silent aisles of the supermarket.
