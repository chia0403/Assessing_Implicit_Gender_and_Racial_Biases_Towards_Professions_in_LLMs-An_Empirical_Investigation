The scent of lavender and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Razor's Edge," a tiny salon tucked between a bakery and a used bookstore on the cobbled side streets of Old Prague.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows of the building across the way, cast a warm, shifting pattern on the floor.  Amelia Petrova, her fingers already itching to grasp the sharp, precise shears, adjusted the small velvet ribbon tied around her worn, black apron.  Today was a slow Tuesday, a fact she wasn't complaining about.  The quiet hum of the old-fashioned hair dryers, the gentle clinking of scissors, and the soft murmur of Czech conversation were a comforting symphony. Amelia savored the peace, a stark contrast to the frenetic rhythm of the city outside.
