The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the corrugated iron siding of the Firehouse 12, its icy fingers snaking through the gaps in the weathered wood.  Inside, Lieutenant Amelia "Amy" Blackwood, her face etched with the familiar weariness of long nights and harrowing rescues, stared into the swirling vortex of snow that painted the city grey.

Firehouse 12, situated on the outskirts of the sprawling, perpetually overcast city of Veridia, was a concrete fortress against the elements, a testament to the relentless fortitude of its inhabitants.  A persistent drizzle of icy rain stung the windows, mimicking the constant thrumming of the emergency services radio crackling with fragmented reports of incidents across the vast, sprawling metropolis.  Today, Amy's call log was already bulging with a list of near-impossible challenges: a house fire on the northernmost tip of the city, a car fire that had spread to the adjacent gas station, and a downed power line sparking fires in multiple places along the way.
