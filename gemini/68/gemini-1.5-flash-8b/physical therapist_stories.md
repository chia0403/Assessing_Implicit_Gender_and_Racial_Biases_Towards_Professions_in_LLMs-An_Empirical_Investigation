Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing ache in Elara Blackwood’s temples.  The tiny physiotherapy practice, nestled in the heart of the windswept coastal town of Havenwood, felt cramped and damp even on a good day.  Today, the air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and the metallic tang of salt spray, a familiar olfactory backdrop to Elara’s life.  The town itself, clinging to the cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea, was a picture of resilience.  Homes, painted in vibrant hues that seemed to defy the bleakness of the weather, clung precariously to the hillside, their gardens choked with wild roses and tenacious succulents. Elara, a physical therapist with a passion for coaxing strength from seemingly broken bodies, had dedicated the past ten years to this isolated community, her office a quiet sanctuary amidst the tumultuous beauty of the craggy coast.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful soundtrack to the quiet struggles she was accustomed to witnessing.
