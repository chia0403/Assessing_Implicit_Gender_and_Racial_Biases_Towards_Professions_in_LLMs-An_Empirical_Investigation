The flickering fluorescent lights of "The Rusty Mug" hummed a monotonous tune, mirroring the rhythmic clinking of mugs and the low murmur of conversation.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that punctuated the clinking and muffled the chatter.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, a server with hair the colour of midnight and eyes the shade of a stormy sea, wiped down a table with a practiced hand.  The scent of stale coffee, burnt toast, and simmering stew hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this small, forgotten town of Oakhaven.  Outside, the wind howled, tugging at the tattered awnings, and Amelia shivered, not just from the chill, but from a sense of something unseen, something lurking just beyond the flickering lights of the diner.  The rain-slicked street outside was a canvas of blurred motion, and the only other sound besides the rain and the clatter was the low rumble of Amelia's stomach.
