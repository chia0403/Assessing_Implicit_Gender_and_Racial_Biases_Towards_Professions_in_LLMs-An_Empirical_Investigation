The rasping whine of the hand-saw filled Elias Thornewood's workshop, a symphony of wood and steel that echoed through the cobbled alley.  Dust motes, like tiny, ethereal dancers, swirled in the pale afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpanes.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, wrestled with a stubborn piece of seasoned oak.  He was meticulous, almost reverent, in his craft.  Each cut, each chisel strike, was measured, precise, born not of necessity but of passion. His workshop, a cramped space barely larger than a small room, smelled of linseed oil, sawdust, and something faintly sweet, perhaps the lingering scent of varnish.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime, dappled the floor, highlighting the intricate carvings he'd painstakingly added to furniture that had already graced the homes of several esteemed families in the prosperous town of Alderwood.  He was a carpenter, not just a craftsman; he was a sculptor of wood, transforming rough lumber into works of art.
