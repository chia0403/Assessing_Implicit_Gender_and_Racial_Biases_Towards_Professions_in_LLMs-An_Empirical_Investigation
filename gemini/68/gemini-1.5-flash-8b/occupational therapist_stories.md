Rain hammered against the windows of the small, third-floor office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding headache thrumming in Amelia Petrova’s temples.

Setting: A small, third-floor occupational therapy clinic in a bustling, urban hospital complex.  The office itself felt cramped and sterile, a stark contrast to the vibrant city outside.  The rain, a constant backdrop to Amelia's day, emphasized the feeling of being trapped within the four walls of her professional life.
