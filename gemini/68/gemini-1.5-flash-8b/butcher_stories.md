The chill of the early morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty"  Buttersworth's bones, a familiar companion to him in the blood-red dawn.  He pulled the heavy wooden door of "Barty's Bloody Butcher Shop" inward, the rusty hinges groaning like a wounded beast.  The shop, tucked between a cobbled alley and a towering, soot-stained brick building, was already a symphony of clashing sounds: the rhythmic thud of a cleaver against bone, the guttural snorts of a boar being hung, the squawking of the city birds circling above the rooftop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light piercing the gloom, illuminating the gleaming stainless steel worktable, the array of knives reflecting the light like shards of ice.  Barty, a man whose face was framed by a thicket of unruly brown hair,  stepped into this familiar, albeit brutal, ballet of the day.
