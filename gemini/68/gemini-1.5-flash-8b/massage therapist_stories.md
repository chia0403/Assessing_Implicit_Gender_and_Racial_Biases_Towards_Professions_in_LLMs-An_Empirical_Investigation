The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Spa" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and something subtly metallic, a lingering aroma Amelia Petrova couldn't quite place.  It was a Monday night, usually a slow one, but tonight, a preternaturally quiet hush had settled over the dimly lit space.  Amelia, a massage therapist with hands that seemed to possess a life of their own, adjusted the position of the heated hand towels, her fingers brushing against the smooth, polished surface of the massage table.  Tonight's client, a man named Mr. Alistair Finch, was unusually tense.  His shoulders, usually the embodiment of quiet strength, were rigid knots of anxiety, and Amelia sensed a profound quiet within the silence, a feeling that spoke of secrets and buried emotions. The aroma of jasmine, heavier than usual, clung to the air.
