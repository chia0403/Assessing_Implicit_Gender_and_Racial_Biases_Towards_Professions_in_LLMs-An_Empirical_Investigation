The year was 2042.  The once-vibrant landscape, teeming with life, was now a faded echo of its former self.  The shimmering heat haze danced over the cracked pavement, distorting the horizon into an unnerving kaleidoscope.  Amelia knew that if she looked too long into the mirage, she might lose herself, disappear into the endless, thirsty nothingness.
