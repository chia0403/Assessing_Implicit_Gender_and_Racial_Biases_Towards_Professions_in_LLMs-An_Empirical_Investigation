The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floor of the Grand Imperial Hotel, illuminating dust motes swirling in the humid air.  Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows, a relentless percussion that echoed through the cavernous lobby.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop with a perpetually strained smile and eyes that held the weary wisdom of a man far older than his twenty-two years, meticulously polished a brass tray.  The scent of lilies and something subtly acrid, like burnt sugar and fear, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the ornate furniture and the polished shoes of the few guests still lingering.  He knew this smell.  It was the scent of secrets, whispered in hushed tones and concealed beneath layers of silk and powdered wigs.  Tonight, however, it feltâ€¦different.  A tangible, almost tangible dread permeated the stillness,  making the rhythmic dripping of the rain sound like a malevolent heartbeat. The Grand Imperial, usually bustling with the happy clatter of carriages and the polite murmurs of conversation, felt strangely quiet.
