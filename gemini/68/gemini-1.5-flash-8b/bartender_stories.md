The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam, illuminating the sweat beading on her brow.  The air hung thick and humid, a cocktail of stale beer, cheap perfume, and the ever-present scent of desperation that clung to the patrons like a second skin.  The Rusty Mug, nestled in the back alleys of a city perpetually shrouded in smog, was a haven for the forgotten and the downtrodden.  It was, in Amelia's opinion, a rather picturesque hell.

The setting was a dive bar, its worn wooden tables scarred with countless stories and whispered secrets.  Dusty, floral wallpaper, long past its prime, adorned the walls, clashing with the gritty, industrial floor.  A jukebox, its plastic buttons faded and chipped, wheezed out a mournful blues tune, its sound swallowed by the murmur of conversations and the clinking of glasses.  Outside, the city roared â€“ a relentless symphony of car horns and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation within the bar's confines.
