The flickering fluorescent lights of the sprawling drafting room hummed a monotonous lullaby, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of Elias Thorneâ€™s drafting pen against the pristine vellum.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the intricate, almost invisible lines that snaked across the blueprints.  The air, thick with the smell of aged paper and the faint metallic tang of the nearby machine shop, felt heavy.  Elias, a man whose face was etched with the lines of countless hours spent hunched over tables, focused on the task at hand: detailing the intricate support structure for a new generation of  atmospheric extraction towers.  His job, as a drafting worker in the sprawling industrial heart of the city, was a silent ballet of precision and patience, a careful dance between the lines on the paper and the structures they would one day embody.  Around him, other draftsmen, their faces lost in the intricacies of their own projects, worked in a hushed, almost reverent silence.  Outside, the city roared with life, oblivious to the quiet precision taking place within the steel and concrete fortress of the engineering firm.
