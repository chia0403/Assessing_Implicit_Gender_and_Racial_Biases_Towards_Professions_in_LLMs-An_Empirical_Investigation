The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's meticulously organized life.  Her desk, a fortress of meticulously color-coded folders and overflowing staplers, was a testament to her dedication.  Amelia, a certified public accountant with a reputation for precision and a penchant for spreadsheets, stared at the latest quarterly report, a sea of numbers threatening to swallow her whole.  The year-end audit was looming, a gargantuan beast demanding every ounce of her attention.  Outside her window, the grey London sky mirrored the gloom settling over the office.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own thoughts.


The office, nestled in a nondescript building on a quiet side street in the financial district, was a microcosm of the city itself.  The air thrummed with the low hum of computers and the occasional hushed whisper of colleagues.  Rows of identical beige cubicles stretched as far as the eye could see, each a tiny world of spreadsheets and whispered anxieties.  The aroma of instant coffee, perpetually brewing in the communal kitchen, clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the face of the looming deadline.  A subtle, almost imperceptible, scent of stale cigarette smoke, a lingering reminder of the building's past life, clung to the air, too.
