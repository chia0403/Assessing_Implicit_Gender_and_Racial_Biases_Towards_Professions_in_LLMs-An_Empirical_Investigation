The antiseptic tang of chlorhexidine hung heavy in the air, a familiar shroud clinging to Dr. Anya Petrova as she meticulously cleaned the last speck of debris from a patient's molar.  Outside, the relentless London rain hammered against the grimy, Victorian windows of her practice, a rhythmic counterpoint to the quiet hum of the dental drill.  Anya, her brow furrowed in concentration, felt a familiar prickle of anxiety.  Not the usual fear of a particularly stubborn cavity or a nervous patient, but something deeper, something that settled in her stomach like a lead weight.

**Setting:**

Anya's dental practice, nestled within the labyrinthine alleyways of Spitalfields, London, was a relic of a bygone era.  Antique dental tools, gleaming chrome contraptions, and chipped porcelain figurines lined the shelves.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows, cast long shadows across the examination rooms.  The air, usually thick with the metallic scent of dental instruments and the faint sweetness of antiseptic, carried a distinct undercurrent of decay â€“ not just the physical kind, but something more insidious, a creeping sense of unease that clung to the very bricks of the building.  Rainwater trickled down the walls, echoing the constant drip-drip-drip of anxieties bubbling within Anya.
