The urgent beeping of her notification alerts punctuated the cacophony.  Her polished, almost clinical, features were etched with worry lines, her normally controlled posture now mirroring the unrest within the system she was tasked with containing. Outside, the city roared with the storm, but inside Amelia’s world, a quiet, chilling terror was taking hold.
