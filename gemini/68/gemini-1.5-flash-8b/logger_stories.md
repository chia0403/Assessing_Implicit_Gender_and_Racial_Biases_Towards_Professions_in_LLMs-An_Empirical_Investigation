The biting wind, a relentless rasp against the exposed skin of Elias Thorne, howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines.  He gripped the axe handle, the worn wood surprisingly smooth beneath his calloused palms.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the dense canopy, casting long, dancing shadows across the vast, snow-dusted clearing.  Elias, a logger with eyes the colour of weathered oak and a frame built to withstand the rigours of the Alaskan wilderness, stood at the edge of the clearing, the silence punctuated only by the occasional snap of a frozen bough beneath his boots.  He was alone, as he always was when the first hard frost of winter tightened its icy grip on the land.  The air, thick with the smell of pine needles and the metallic tang of the forestâ€™s hidden veins, held the promise of both beauty and danger.

This particular clearing, known as Whisperwind Glade, had been a sacred hunting ground for generations of the Inupiat people, a fact Elias respected despite his relentless pursuit of timber. He knew the history of this land, whispered on the icy winds, and he carried a certain weight in his work, a responsibility to the forest he was carving, to the spirit of the place.  The towering, centuries-old trees, their gnarled branches reaching for the heavens like skeletal fingers, seemed to watch him, silent sentinels of a forest that had seen empires rise and fall.  The cold Alaskan air, crisp and clean, held a secret. And Elias, with his calloused hands and weary eyes, was about to discover it.
