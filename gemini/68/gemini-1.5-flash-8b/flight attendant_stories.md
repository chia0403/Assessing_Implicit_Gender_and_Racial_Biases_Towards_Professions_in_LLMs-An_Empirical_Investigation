The humid air hung thick and sweet, a perfume of jasmine and unfamiliar spices, clinging to Amelia Hayes’s uniform as she navigated the cramped, almost claustrophobic aisle of the “Starlight Express.”  The plane, a relic of a bygone era with more rivets than elegance, shuddered with a low, rhythmic groan.  Amelia, a flight attendant with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted the weight of a half-eaten papaya slice in her tray.

Amelia, whose name often faded into the background noise of the humming engines and excited chatter of passengers, was now acutely aware of a disconcerting stillness.  A strange hush had fallen over the predominantly Eastern European passengers, replaced by the quiet rustle of silk garments and the subtle clinking of silver cutlery. This particular sector of the route, a stretch of the Silk Road above the Himalayas, felt different, almost mystical.  The view, however, was breathtaking.  Giant peaks, painted in hues of rose and amethyst, kissed the sky, an impossible panorama of raw, untamed beauty.  But something else… something unsettling, was embedded in the heart of this breathtaking spectacle.

The Starlight Express, a meticulously preserved, yet surprisingly antiquated Boeing 747-SP, wasn’t supposed to be carrying this many valuables. And certainly not these particular valuables.  Tucked away in the cargo hold, were crates marked with ominous-looking, unknown symbols, a collection of priceless artifacts from a forgotten civilization.  Amelia had the uneasy feeling that she wasn't just transporting passengers; she was unknowingly carrying history itself.
