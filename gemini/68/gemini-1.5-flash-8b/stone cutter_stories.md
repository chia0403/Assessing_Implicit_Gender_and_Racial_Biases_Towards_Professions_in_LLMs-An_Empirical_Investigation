The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the jagged peaks of the Cairnwood mountains, rattling the single pane of glass in Elara Stonehand's tiny workshop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering lamplight, danced in the air like angry spirits.  Elara, her name a testament to the profession that defined her existence, hunched over a slab of grey granite.  Her calloused hands, stained with the earth-tones of the stone she sculpted, delicately chipped away at a delicate relief of a stag, its antlers catching the faint glow.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the sharp tang of glacial water, was her constant companion.  She was a stone cutter, a creature of the mountains, bound to their rhythms and secrets, her existence a quiet symphony of chisel and stone.  The Cairnwood valley, a tapestry of emerald valleys and towering, snow-capped peaks, held a silent promise of stories, etched into the very heart of the stone.   

Elara Stonehand, a woman weathered by the mountain winds and sharpened by the unforgiving precision of her craft, was alone, as she always was in her tiny, window-walled workshop, carved from a cliffside overlooking a hidden valley. The workshop, rough-hewn and practically a cave of stone, held only the bare necessities: a small worktable, a chipped wooden stool, and a single lamp that cast long, dancing shadows on the walls.  Outside, the jagged peaks scraped the bruised grey sky, mirroring the harshness of the life she led.  But within the confines of her stone prison, Elara found a certain peace, a solace in the rhythm of her craft. Today, though, a deeper tremor ran beneath the surface of the stone, promising a change, a story yet untold.
