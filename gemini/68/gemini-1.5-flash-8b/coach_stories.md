The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  Below, the frozen expanse of Lake Geneva stretched out, a mirror reflecting the bruised twilight sky.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending snow, vibrated with the low, guttural thrum of the ice-fishing shanties clustered along the shore.  Tonight, the annual "Frostbite" ice hockey tournament was kicking off. Amelia, Head Coach of the Lake Geneva Wolverines, paced the cramped, dimly lit locker room, her breath fogging in the frigid air.  Her team, a mix of seasoned veterans and eager rookies, stood huddled, their faces illuminated by the flickering fluorescent lights, their own anxieties mirroring the storm outside. This year, the pressure was immense.  Not only were they defending their championship title, but the Wolverines' recent slump had the entire town buzzing with whispers of mediocrity.  A few whispers had even reached the ears of the influential town Mayor, Mr. Grimshaw, who was known for his sharp tongue and even sharper expectations.  Tonight, Amelia knew, every puck drop would be a test of their resolve and her own coaching prowess.
