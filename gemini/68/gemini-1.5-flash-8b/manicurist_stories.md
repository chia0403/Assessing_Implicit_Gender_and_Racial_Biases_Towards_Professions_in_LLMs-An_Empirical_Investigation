The scent of lilies and lavender hung heavy in the air of "The Polished Nail," a tiny salon tucked away on a side street of the bustling, historic district.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty rose-colored curtains, illuminated the chipped paint of the walls and the meticulously organized nail polish displays.  Amelia Josephine Finch, a manicurist with a smile as bright as her crimson-lacquered nails, meticulously filed a client’s nail, her movements precise and practiced.  The rhythmic click of her electric file echoed in the small space, punctuated only by the soft murmur of conversation from another client in the corner, a woman engrossed in a floral print magazine. Outside, the city’s relentless hum – a constant symphony of sirens, honking cars, and distant street vendors – seemed to fade into the background. Amelia, however, was completely immersed in her work, her mind already charting a course through the day's appointments, her thoughts flitting from one client's personality to the next.  She knew the stories hidden in the gentle curves of their fingertips, the anxieties etched into the lines around their cuticles, the subtle secrets whispered in the soft light of the salon.  Today, she suspected, was going to be an interesting one.
