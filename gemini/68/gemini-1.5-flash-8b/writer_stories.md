The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten teaspoons, reflected the flickering gaslight above.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the attic, a relentless percussion that drowned out the rhythmic tapping of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s pen against the worn leather of her notebook.  Amelia Blackwood, writer of forgotten tales and half-finished novels, sat hunched over the makeshift desk, a tangle of unruly dark hair framing a face etched with both exhaustion and determination.

The attic itself was a forgotten realm, a repository of cobwebs, faded photographs, and the faint, musty aroma of old paper.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the gloom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Boxes overflowing with manuscripts, sketches, and scraps of discarded ideas lined the walls, silent witnesses to Amelia's countless hours of toil.  A faded tapestry depicting mythical creatures hung crookedly on a nail, its vibrant colours dulled by the years.  Outside, the sprawling Victorian city of Blackwood sprawled beneath a bruised sky, a concrete labyrinth of towering buildings and narrow, winding streets.  Amelia, however, existed in a quiet, claustrophobic bubble of her own creation, a world of words where dragons breathed ink and dreams danced on the page.
