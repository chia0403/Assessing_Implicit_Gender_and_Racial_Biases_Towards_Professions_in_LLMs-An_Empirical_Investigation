The biting wind whipped Amelia Graystone's camera bag tighter against her frame.  Dust devils, swirling eddies of ochre and grey, danced across the cracked earth of the Arizona desert.  Sun, merciless and unforgiving, beat down on the cracked asphalt of Route 66, turning the midday sky into a molten gold.  Amelia, a photographer with a penchant for the forgotten and the fractured,  stood perched atop a crumbling, faded roadside motel sign,  its faded "Welcome to Cactus Creek" lettering barely visible against the blinding light.  The remnants of a once-bustling highway town, now a ghost of its former self, stretched before her.  Rusty cars, skeletal frames clawing at the encroaching desert, were scattered like fallen soldiers along the highway's shoulder.  The air, thick with the scent of sagebrush and dust, hung heavy, a suffocating blanket. This, Amelia thought, was her kind of subject.  A symphony of decay, a testament to time's relentless march.
