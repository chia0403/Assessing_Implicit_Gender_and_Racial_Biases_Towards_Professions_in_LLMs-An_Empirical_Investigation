The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, low-level thrumming, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  Elias Thorne, twenty-seven, a junior programmer at the sprawling tech company, NovaCorp, lived a life meticulously structured around the rhythmic beep-bloop of code compiling.  His apartment, a cramped two-bedroom nestled in the shadow of the towering NovaCorp headquarters, was a testament to this:  rows of empty takeout containers marked with cryptic food-related labels (e.g., "Spaghetti_v1.0_Beta") lined the kitchen counter, a stack of half-read technical manuals towered in the corner, and the only decorative element was a framed poster of a particularly convoluted circuit board.


The setting was a sprawling, almost dystopian, urban sprawl of shimmering skyscrapers and neon-drenched alleyways, a city that pulsed with the relentless energy of a thousand interconnected machines.  NovaCorp dominated the skyline, its headquarters a glittering, glass monolith that seemed to swallow up the surrounding landscape.  The rest of the city felt like a secondary construct, a less polished version of the immaculate technological perfection housed within the impenetrable glass walls of the building where Elias worked.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of his apartment, mirroring the chaotic, often frustrating, torrent of data he navigated in his daily tasks.
