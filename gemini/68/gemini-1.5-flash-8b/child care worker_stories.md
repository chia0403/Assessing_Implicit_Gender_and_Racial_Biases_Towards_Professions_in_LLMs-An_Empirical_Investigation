The chipped paint on the door of the "Little Explorers" preschool, a faded shade of pistachio green, seemed to sigh with the humid morning air.  Seven-year-old Lily skipped through, her bright yellow raincoat shimmering under the weak morning sun, already buzzing with the day's potential chaos.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of crayons and spilled milk, a comforting aroma that was familiar, and sometimes, almost suffocating.  Lily, officially known as Lilyana Petrova, a dedicated and slightly overwhelmed child care worker, adjusted the strap of her navy tote bag, already filled with colourful activity sheets and a handful of pre-emptively-packed snacks.

The little explorers, a vibrant, chaotic mix of toddlers and preschoolers, were already in full swing.  Tiny hands clawed at the colourful alphabet blocks, tiny feet thumped on the polished wooden floor, and little voices, a kaleidoscope of languages and accents, echoed through the room.  Lilyana surveyed the scene, her brow furrowing slightly.  Today was a particularly tricky morning, with a new set of twins and a perpetually bewildered three-year-old named Leo, who appeared determined to dismantle every structure in sight.
