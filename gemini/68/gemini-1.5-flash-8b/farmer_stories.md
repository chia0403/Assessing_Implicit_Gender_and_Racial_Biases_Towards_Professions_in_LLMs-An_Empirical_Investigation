The homestead, nestled amongst the sparse scrub oak and withered grasses, was a testament to both the tenacious spirit of man and the unforgiving nature of the plains.  Elara, a woman whose face bore the weathered lines of relentless labor and a will as hard as the baked clay of the prairie soil, stared out at her diminishing crops.  The once vibrant corn stalks now bowed their heads, ghostly husks whispering tales of failure in the wind's mournful song.
