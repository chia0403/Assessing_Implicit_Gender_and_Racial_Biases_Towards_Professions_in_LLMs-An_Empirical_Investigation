Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Alistair Finch's clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the relentless thrumming in his temples.  The tiny, unassuming building, nestled between a bakery with a perpetually-full storefront and a dilapidated auto repair shop, felt more like a pressure point than a place of healing.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and ozone, a stark contrast to the earthy aroma of petrichor that clung to the outside.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows across the cluttered waiting room, highlighting dust motes dancing in the air.  A tattered copy of "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" lay open on a chipped wooden table, next to a half-eaten bag of trail mix and a meticulously organized stack of x-rays.  Alistair, a chiropractor with a perpetually furrowed brow and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world, hunched over a patient's chart, the pen scratching across the paper like a trapped bird.  Outside, the relentless drumming of the rain intensified, and a low growl of thunder echoed through the valley.
