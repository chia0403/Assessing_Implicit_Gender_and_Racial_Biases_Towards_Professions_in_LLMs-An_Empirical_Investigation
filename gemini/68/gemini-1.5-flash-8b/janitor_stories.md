The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Institute hummed, a monotonous lullaby to the rhythmic squeak of Amelia Peabody's cleaning cart.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sickly yellow glow, mimicking the swirling patterns of fear in her stomach.  It was the third Tuesday of the month, the day the Institute's renowned but notoriously secretive Dr. Alistair Finch disappeared.

The Zenith Institute, nestled deep within the emerald foothills of the Whispering Mountains, was a sprawling complex of gleaming white labs and towering, shadowy observation towers.  Air, thick with the scent of ozone and sterile disinfectant, perpetually hung heavy, pressing down on Amelia, a constant reminder of the secrets held within these walls.  Amelia, petite and perpetually shrouded in practical but drab attire, felt the weight of the place not just on her tired shoulders, but in the oppressive stillness that clung to the corridors.  Empty lab coats, untouched coffee mugs, and scattered research papers hinted at the chaos she'd unearthed in the morning. A profound silence, usually broken only by the hushed whispers of researchers, was now a suffocating vacuum.
