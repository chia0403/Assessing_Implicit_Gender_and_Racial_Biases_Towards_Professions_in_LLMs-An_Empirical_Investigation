Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with a practice tucked away on a quiet cobbled street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina, stared at the swirling patterns of the intricate lace doilies adorning her antique desk.  Rain hammered against the stained-glass window, painting the room in fractured rainbows and echoing the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  Across the cluttered mahogany surface, a half-eaten slice of lemon poppy seed cake sat abandoned, a testament to the patient she'd just seen.  The air, thick with the scent of aged books and damp earth, seemed to hold the weight of unspoken anxieties.  The city outside, usually a vibrant tapestry of activity, felt muted, swallowed by the relentless downpour.  Her patient, a young woman named Amelia, had described a terrifying dream of drowning in a sea of black ink, and Eleanor's mind still wrestled with the cryptic imagery. It felt...off.  Unusually so.  Not a typical symptom of anxiety, not a straightforward case of PTSD.  Something deeper, something lurking just beyond the surface, was stirring within the quiet walls of her practice.
