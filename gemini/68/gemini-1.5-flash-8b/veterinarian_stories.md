The biting wind whipped Dr. Amelia Nightingale's coat around her legs as she wrestled the stubborn, grey Clydesdale stallion, Hercules, into the makeshift stall.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the dusty, sun-baked prairie, swirling around the skeletal remains of a weathered barn.  Rust-colored wildflowers clung stubbornly to the parched soil, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the desolate landscape surrounding the ramshackle veterinary clinic.  Amelia, her face etched with the lines of countless sleepless nights and even more countless animal emergencies, hunched over Hercules's heaving flank, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the smell of hay, sweat, and the metallic tang of fear, hung heavy around them, a palpable tension that mirrored the turmoil in the stallion's eyes.  This wasn't the pristine, manicured countryside she'd envisioned when she'd first decided to open her practice in the heart of the Windswept Plains.  This was something far more raw, far more... unforgiving.
