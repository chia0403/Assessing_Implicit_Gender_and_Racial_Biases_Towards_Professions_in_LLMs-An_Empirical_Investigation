The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the chipped paint on the rusted shed where he kept his tools.  October leaves, a kaleidoscope of burnt orange and crimson, swirled like frantic dancers around his worn leather boots.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and looming turrets, loomed over him, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the churning tempest.  Elias, a groundskeeper for the sprawling estate, was a solitary figure against the brooding backdrop of the late autumnal landscape.  His weathered hands, calloused and scarred from years of wrestling with stubborn soil and unruly shrubs, tightened around the handle of his rake. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, held a palpable sense of foreboding, a chill that went deeper than the wind.  Today felt different.  Something about the way the clouds pressed against the sky, the unsettling stillness before the storm, gnawed at the edges of his usual calm.  He had a feeling Blackwood Manor wasn't just about to face a storm; it was about to be shaken to its very core.
