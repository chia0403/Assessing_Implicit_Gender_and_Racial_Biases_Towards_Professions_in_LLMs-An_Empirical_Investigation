The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual greyish-brown, reflected Elara Blackwood's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the sprawling, neglected manor.  The air, thick with the scent of decaying roses and damp earth, hung heavy in the vast, echoing hallway.  Elara, her fingers stained with the remnants of a day's cleaning, sighed, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence of Blackwood Manor.  Today, the 17th of October, had brought with it not only a particularly stubborn layer of grime but also a premonition, a shiver of unease that crawled up her spine and settled in the pit of her stomach.

The manor, a gothic behemoth perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the whispering valley, exuded an aura of forgotten grandeur.  Once a bustling hub of social gatherings and boisterous laughter, the estate was now a mausoleum of faded elegance.  Twisted ivy choked the foundations, peeling paint blistered on the imposing facade, and broken windowpanes stared blankly at the clouds.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass, a constant, mournful soundtrack to Elara's solitary existence within these decaying walls.  Every creak and groan of the ancient house seemed to whisper tales of the vanished Blackwood family, their secrets buried deep within the decaying timber and stone.  Elara, the sole caretaker, was the only witness to the house's slow, agonizing decline, a silent guardian of its decaying splendor.
