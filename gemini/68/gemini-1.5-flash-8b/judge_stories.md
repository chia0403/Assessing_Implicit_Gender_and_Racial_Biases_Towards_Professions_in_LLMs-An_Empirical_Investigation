The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of Alderbrook, stinging Amelia Blackwood, Judge of the Crown Court, in the face.  Grey clouds, thick and low, obscured the already fading light, casting long, skeletal shadows across the marketplace.  A chill deeper than the air permeated the very stones, seeping into her bones and reminding her of the icy dread that had clung to this case since the first testimony.  The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a pungent mix that seemed to amplify the sense of foreboding that had settled over Alderbrook since the disappearance of Lord Ashworth.

Amelia, a woman sculpted from the granite of the north, her frame lean and strong despite the unrelenting chill, adjusted the heavy velvet collar of her cloak. Her sharp eyes, the colour of storm clouds before the rain, scanned the deserted marketplace.  Empty stalls, their once-colourful wares now dust-coated and forgotten, lined the narrow thoroughfares, mirroring the stillness that had fallen over the town.  Only the occasional mournful cry of a raven broke the oppressive silence.  The case – the disappearance of the enigmatic Lord Ashworth, a man of wealth and influence whose motives were as shrouded in mystery as his whereabouts – had consumed her for weeks.  Each passing day brought new suspicions, new whispers, but no answers.  She had travelled far and wide, from the opulent halls of the manor to the grimy alleys of the port, following threads that seemed to lead nowhere.  Now, she stood at the foot of the ancient oak in the heart of the marketplace, the very oak under whose boughs Lord Ashworth had last been seen, the chill gripping her resolve tighter than the tightening noose of suspicion.
