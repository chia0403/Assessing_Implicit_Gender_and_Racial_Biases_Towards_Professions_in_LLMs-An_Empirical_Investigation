Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Victorian-era laboratory, blurring the already-dim interior light.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist, hunched over a meticulously organized desktop.  Stacks of case files, each one a microcosm of shattered lives, formed miniature mountains around her.  The scent of old paper and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this sterile sanctuary of the city's forensic division.  Outside, the city roared – a symphony of sirens and the desperate cries of the lost.  Eleanor's world, however, was a quieter, more measured place – a place of whispers and shadows, of piecing together the fragments of broken minds. Today's case was different, though.  It felt… wrong.


**Setting:** The forensic division of a large metropolitan police department, housed in a sprawling, historically significant Victorian building overlooking a bustling city. The laboratory itself was a vast, high-ceilinged room,  mostly in shadow, punctuated by shafts of unnatural light.  The atmosphere was a blend of scientific precision and oppressive gloom, echoing the weight of the cases within.
