The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Outer Territories, stinging Dr. Aris Thorne's cheeks.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his own heart.  He squinted at the skeletal remains of a once-proud homestead, the rusted metal of a broken windmill its only monument.  This wasn't the pristine, technologically advanced sector where he'd practiced medicine for years.  This was the frontier, the forgotten, the ravaged, where hope clung to the frayed edges of survival.  The year was 2247.  The air, thick with the smell of burnt fuel and something akin to ozone, hung heavy and suffocating.  A lone, battered truck, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, coughed weakly and sputtered to a halt nearby, its engine a ragged sigh against the symphony of the wind.  The faintest crackle of static echoed across the vast emptiness, a jarring counterpoint to the silence.  This was the call to his duty, to his grim, unwavering responsibility.
