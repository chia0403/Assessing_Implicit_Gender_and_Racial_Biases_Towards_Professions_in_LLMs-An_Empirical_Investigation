The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she hunched deeper into the doorway of the abandoned gas station.  Rain, relentless and cold, plastered her dark hair to her neck.  The flickering neon sign of the now-defunct "Lucky's Lubes" cast a sickly yellow glow on the desolate parking lot, a stark contrast to the swirling grey sky above.  This was her second stop on a seemingly endless night call, and the air thrummed with a premonition of more trouble.  Amelia, a paramedic with the Metro Emergency Response Team (MERT), had dedicated her life to the chaotic ballet of saving lives, but tonight, the dance felt more like a desperate scramble in the face of impending darkness.

The setting: The outskirts of the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Alexandria, a city where the hum of progress often masked the fragile underbelly of its sprawling suburbs.  These neglected zones, like the desolate gas station lot, were breeding grounds for the unseen, the accidents that seemed to happen only at night, under the watchful, indifferent gaze of the moon.  Tonight, that unseen threat was palpable, a thick, oppressive tension hanging in the air, heavier than the rain itself.
