The steam from the simmering pot of mussels, thick with garlic and white wine, curled around Amelia Josephine Dubois, clinging to the wisps of auburn hair escaping her chef's toque.  The aroma, a symphony of briny salt and fragrant herbs, filled the cramped kitchen of "Le Petit Cochon," a tiny bistro nestled between a bustling marketplace and a cobbled alleyway in the heart of Paris.  The air, thick with the anticipation of a Friday evening rush, vibrated with the rhythmic clang of metal on metal, the gentle hiss of sizzling fat, and the low murmur of French conversation.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously arranged the mussels, their pearly shells gleaming under the warm, flickering light of the overhead halogen lamps.  Tonight, the pressure was on.  Le Petit Cochon was celebrating its fifth anniversary, and a special dish, a seafood masterpiece Amelia had been developing for months, would grace the menu.  Would it deliver?
