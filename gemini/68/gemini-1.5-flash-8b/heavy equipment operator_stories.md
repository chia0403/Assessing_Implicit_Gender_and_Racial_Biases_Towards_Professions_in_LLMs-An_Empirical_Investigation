The sun, a bruised plum in the bruised sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate expanse of the Arizona desert.  Dust, fine and insidious, clung to everything â€“ the weathered, rust-colored Caterpillar 990H, the cracked asphalt of the abandoned highway, even the parched, thorn-studded Joshua trees that seemed to mock the relentless heat.  This was the domain of  Arthur "Art"  MacGregor, heavy equipment operator extraordinaire, or at least, that's what the faded signs on the back of his rig proclaimed.  Art, at thirty-eight, was more accustomed to the quiet hum of the diesel engine than the chatter of human voices.  Today, however, the stillness was broken.  Not by the rhythmic thump of the excavator's hydraulics, but by a sound that grated on his ears, a sound that had been haunting the edges of his waking thoughts for weeks.  A faint, but insistent, *tap-tap-tap*.
