The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Nightingale’s hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpanes of "Wanderlust & Whispers," sliced across the worn mahogany desk, illuminating a scattering of brochures depicting exotic locales – the shimmering turquoise waters of the Maldives, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu.
