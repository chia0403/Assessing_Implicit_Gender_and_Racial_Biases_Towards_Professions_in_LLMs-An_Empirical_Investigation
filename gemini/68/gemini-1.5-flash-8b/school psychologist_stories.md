The fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia "Amy"  Rosenthal's own thoughts.  She clutched a steaming mug of lukewarm coffee, the acrid scent battling the faint, sickly sweet perfume of disinfectant that clung to the air.  Amy, a school psychologist with seven years under her belt, was meticulously scanning the sea of teenage faces flitting past.  Each one a puzzle, each one a potential crisis waiting to be unraveled.  Today, the puzzle pieces felt particularly fractured.  

The setting was the sprawling, somewhat dilapidated, suburban high school of Oakhaven, a town nestled within the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  Autumn had painted the leaves of the surrounding woods in fiery hues of crimson and gold, a stark contrast to the muted grey of the school building itself.  The crisp air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke from neighboring homes, carried a subtle undercurrent of unease, a feeling Amy sensed more acutely than the other adults in the building.  It was a feeling woven into the fabric of Oakhaven, a town with a past she couldn't quite place, but felt deeply. The echoing silence of the hallways, punctuated only by the muffled cries of students and the occasional clatter of lockers, felt somehow heavy, laden with unspoken anxieties and simmering resentments.
