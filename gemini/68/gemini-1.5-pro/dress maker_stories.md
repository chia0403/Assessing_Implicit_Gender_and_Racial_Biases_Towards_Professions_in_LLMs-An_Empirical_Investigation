Seraphina, perched on a low stool, her needle flashing in the gaslight, barely registered the noise. Her attention was utterly consumed by the cascade of ivory duchess satin pooling around her.  The air in the small, cluttered room, tucked away on a cobbled side street just off the bustling Rue de Rivoli in 1888 Paris, was thick with the scent of beeswax, lavender, and the faint, metallic tang of pins.  Half-finished gowns draped over dressmaker's dummies loomed like elegant ghosts in the corners, their intricate beadwork shimmering in the warm light.  Outside, the city thrummed with the energy of a crisp autumn evening, but within these four walls, time seemed to slow, governed only by the steady progress of Seraphina's needle and the gentle sigh of the fabric as it took shape.  This was her sanctuary, her kingdom, ruled by the quiet magic of creation.  Tonight, however, a different kind of magic was about to knock on her door.
