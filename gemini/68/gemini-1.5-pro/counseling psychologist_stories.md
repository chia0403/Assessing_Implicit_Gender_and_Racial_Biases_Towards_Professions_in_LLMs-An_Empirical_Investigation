The rain hammered against the ornate, bay window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny percussionist in a symphony of grey.  His office, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house on Sycamore Street in the sleepy, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually exuded a calming atmosphere. The walls, painted a soft seafoam green, were adorned with framed botanical prints and soothing watercolor landscapes. A plump, ginger cat named Finnigan snoozed peacefully on a plush, velvet armchair, oblivious to the tempest raging outside. But today, even the usually comforting scent of lavender and chamomile from the diffuser couldn't quite dispel the heavy, almost oppressive air that hung in the room. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, tapped a pen against his leather-bound notebook, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain. He was reviewing his notes from his last session with a particularly troubled patient, a fisherman plagued by recurring nightmares of the sea, when a sharp knock at the door broke the silence.
