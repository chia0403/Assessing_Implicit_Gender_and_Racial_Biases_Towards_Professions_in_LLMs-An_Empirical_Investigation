The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street.  Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, her trench coat clinging to her like a second skin, shivered, not entirely from the October chill.  A biting wind whipped through Greenwich Village, carrying the scent of stale pizza and something else, something faintly metallic, that made the hairs on the back of her neck prickle.  It was 2:17 am, a time when the city that never sleeps usually dreamt fitfully.  Tonight, however, the air crackled with a nervous energy.  Two patrol cars, their lights flashing silently, bookended a narrow alleyway where a single, stark spotlight illuminated a scene Izzy had hoped she'd never see again.  A body lay sprawled amidst overflowing trash bins, a dark stain spreading across the damp concrete.  Izzy took a deep breath, the metallic scent stronger now, and stepped into the alley, her hand instinctively resting on the grip of her Glock.  This was going to be a long night.
