Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his patient, Mrs. Albright.  The room, perched high in a converted Victorian townhouse on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, usually exuded a calming atmosphere.  Persian rugs softened the polished oak floors, bookshelves lined with leather-bound volumes offered silent solace, and a crackling fireplace (electric, for safety reasons) added a touch of warmth. But tonight, even the gentle hum of the air purifier couldn't mask the tension hanging thick in the air. Mrs. Albright, normally a composed and articulate woman, was twisting a tissue in her hands, her knuckles white against the pale linen.  Elias, leaning back in his worn leather armchair, observed her with a quiet, professional concern, the flickering gaslight catching the silver threading through his dark hair. Outside, the November wind howled, a mournful soundtrack to the secrets about to be unveiled.
