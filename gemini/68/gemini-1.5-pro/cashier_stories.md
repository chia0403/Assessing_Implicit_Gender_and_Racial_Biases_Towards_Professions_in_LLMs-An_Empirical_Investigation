The flickering fluorescent lights of the Stop 'N' Shop buzzed in a rhythm only they seemed to appreciate.  Rain lashed against the large plate-glass windows, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside. Inside, it was a symphony of beeps â€“ the rhythmic scanning of groceries, the insistent chirping of the credit card reader, and the occasional, exasperated sigh from Elias Finch, the cashier on duty. Elias, a lanky young man with perpetually tired eyes and a nametag slightly askew, pushed a damp strand of dark hair from his forehead. It was 7:47 pm on a Tuesday, the slowest hour of the slowest day of the week, and the only other soul in the convenience store was a shivering dachshund tied to a bike rack outside.  The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and slightly-too-ripe bananas, a fragrance Elias had come to associate with existential dread.  He leaned heavily on the counter, the laminated wood cool against his forearms, and watched the rain transform the parking lot into a shimmering, oil-slicked lake.  Tonight, like most nights, Elias felt utterly and profoundly adrift.
