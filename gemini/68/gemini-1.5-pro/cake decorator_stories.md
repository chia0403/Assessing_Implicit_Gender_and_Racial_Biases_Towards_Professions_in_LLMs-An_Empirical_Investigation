The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bitter counterpoint to the usual vanilla-laced sweetness that permeated Buttercup Bake Shop.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her strawberry-blonde braid coming undone, stared in dismay at the tiered monstrosity before her.  It was supposed to be a masterpiece – a cascading confection of sugar roses and spun-sugar butterflies for the Mayor’s daughter’s wedding. Instead, one tier leaned precariously, the buttercream a shade of sickly green, and the delicate sugar butterflies drooped like wilted petals. Outside, the quaint, cobblestoned streets of Willow Creek glittered with a dusting of early November snow, painting the charming little bakery's windows with a frosty filigree.  Inside, however, the atmosphere was decidedly less festive.
