The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Reyes's dark hair across her face, stinging her cheeks as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of Blackwind Bluff.  Below, the churning slate-grey waters of the North Atlantic crashed against the jagged, volcanic rock formations of the Icelandic coast.  The air, thick with the scent of salt and something subtly metallic, vibrated with the raw power of the ocean. Mia, bundled in layers of fleece and down, ignored the cold, her focus entirely consumed by capturing the dramatic scene unfolding before her.  She wanted this photograph - the churning sea, the bruised sky, the lonely lighthouse perched precariously on the distant headland - to evoke the same primal awe she felt in its presence. This was her first solo expedition to Iceland, a pilgrimage of sorts, and she was determined to capture the very soul of this wild, untamed land.
