The pungent scent of peroxide and hairspray hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that Genevieve Dupres breathed in like a comforting mantra.  Her salon, "Curl Up & Dye," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed bakery on Bleecker Street in the West Village, was a riot of controlled chaos.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windows, glinted off the chrome and glass surfaces, highlighting the scattered strands of hair that clung to everything like metallic cobwebs.  Genevieve, her fiery red hair piled high in a precarious tower of curls and braids secured with a plethora of bobby pins, surveyed her domain with a critical eye. It was a Tuesday morning, typically slow, but today a nervous energy thrummed beneath the surface of the usual calm.  Mrs. Rosenblatt, a regular with a penchant for gossip and a perm that defied gravity, was due any minute, and Genevieve had a feeling this appointment would be anything but ordinary.
