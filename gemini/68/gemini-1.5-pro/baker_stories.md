The aroma of burnt sugar and cardamom hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume clinging to the brick walls of Buttercup Bakery.  Elodie Claire Beaumont, her auburn braid dusted with flour, sighed, peering into the oven. The kouign amann, usually her pride and joy, were stubbornly refusing to caramelize evenly.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, shimmered under a thin layer of frost, the November wind whistling a mournful tune through the brightly painted storefronts. The first flakes of snow began to drift lazily down, catching the light from the gas lamps that flickered to life as dusk settled over the small seaside town.  Elodie knew she should be thrilled. Snow meant tourists, tourists meant business, and business meant she could finally replace the bakeryâ€™s ancient, temperamental oven. But all she felt was a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. This year, the first snow also meant the return of the annual Port Blossom Christmas Festival, and with it, the return of memories she'd rather keep buried beneath the drifts.
