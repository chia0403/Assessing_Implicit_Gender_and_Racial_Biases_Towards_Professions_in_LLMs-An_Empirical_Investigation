The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a peculiar but not unpleasant scent that permeated every corner of "Curl Up & Dye," Amelia Rose Hawthorne's small salon. Situated on the cobbled, perpetually damp, side street of Thistlewick Lane in the perpetually grey town of Port Blossom, the salon was a riot of colour against the drab backdrop.  Fuchsia walls clashed joyfully with lime green chairs, and strings of twinkling fairy lights fought a losing battle against the gloom filtering in from the grimy windowpanes.  Rain lashed against the glass, a soundtrack that had become as familiar to Amelia as the rhythmic snip of her shears. This Tuesday morning, however, the usual lull before the mid-week rush was punctuated by an unsettling silence. Amelia, perched on a stool behind the counter, nervously tapped a chipped, scarlet nail against a stack of well-thumbed magazines, her brow furrowed beneath a cascade of fiery red curls that, ironically, sheâ€™d struggled to tame that morning.  Something felt different, something was in the air, thicker even than the coconut and burnt sugar.
