The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery window.  Grey light, the reluctant dawn of a December morning in the remote Shetland village of Hamnavoe, barely penetrated the swirling snow.  Inside, a peat fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the worn, leather-bound medical texts lining the shelves.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the earthy aroma of burning peat, creating a peculiar, comforting atmosphere. Elias, his dark hair already streaked with silver at the temples despite his relatively young age of thirty-five, rubbed his hands together, his breath clouding in the chill air. He glanced at the antiquated clock ticking steadily on the mantelpiece.  Five-thirty.  Another day in the life of the only doctor for fifty miles in any direction.
