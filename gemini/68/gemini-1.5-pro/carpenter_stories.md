The rasping shriek of metal against wood echoed through the cavernous workshop, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of Elias Thorne's hammer.  Sawdust, fine as cinnamon, danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the grimy windows, illuminating the organized chaos within.  Elias, his calloused fingers stained a rich ochre from years of handling oak and pine, squinted at the half-finished rocking horse clamped to his workbench. The air in the small, cluttered workshop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a silent, shuttered apothecary on the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, hung thick with the scent of cedar and sweat.  Autumn had arrived in the valley, painting the distant foothills in fiery hues of red and gold, but inside, Elias remained lost in the world of smooth curves and polished wood, oblivious to the changing season.  This rocking horse, destined for the mayor's daughter's fifth birthday, was his current obsession, and he wouldn't rest until every curve was perfect, every joint seamlessly fitted.
