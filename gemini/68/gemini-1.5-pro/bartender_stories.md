The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm Amelia “Milly” Hawthorne had come to find oddly comforting.  Nestled in the fog-wreathed foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the bar was a beacon of warm light and the smell of woodsmoke and cheap whiskey in an otherwise desolate stretch of highway.  Inside, the air hung thick with the murmur of conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the mournful twang of a country song emanating from the battered jukebox in the corner. Milly, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, wiped down the sticky mahogany bar with a practiced hand, her emerald eyes scanning the handful of patrons. It was a Tuesday night, so the crowd was sparse: a couple of truckers arguing about the best route to avoid a rockslide up near Black Ridge Pass, a solitary woman nursing a beer and staring out the window at the deluge, and old Silas, the town's self-proclaimed historian, perched on his usual stool, regaling anyone who’d listen with increasingly improbable tales of moonshine and mountain monsters. Milly knew them all, their stories, their sorrows, their secrets. The Rusty Mug wasn't just a bar; it was a confessional, a community center, and sometimes, a gateway to something far stranger than the Appalachian wilderness itself.
