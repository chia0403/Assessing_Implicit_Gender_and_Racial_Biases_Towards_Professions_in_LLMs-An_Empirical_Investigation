The frosted glass of Amelia Grace Holloway's office door declared, in elegant gold lettering, "A.G. Holloway, Bookkeeping & Accountancy."  The faint scent of woodsmoke clung to the crisp October air that drifted in whenever the door opened, a familiar autumnal perfume in the small town of Oakhaven, nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside.  Oakhaven was a place where everyone knew everyone, where the changing leaves were a celebrated spectacle, and where Amelia, despite her precise nature and love of order, found a peculiar kind of peace amongst the town's gentle chaos.  It was a Thursday, precisely 3:17 pm, and Amelia was meticulously reconciling the accounts of the Oakhaven General Store, her brow furrowed in concentration as a discrepancy of seventeen cents stubbornly refused to resolve itself. The rhythmic tapping of her fountain pen against the blotter was the only sound in the otherwise silent office, save for the occasional rustle of leaves against the windowpane and the distant, mournful cry of a train whistle.
