The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears.  Outside, the November wind howled down Sycamore Street, rattling the paned glass and scattering fallen leaves in swirling eddies. Inside, the tiny shop was a haven of warmth and fragrant chaos. Buckets overflowing with dahlias, roses, and chrysanthemums lined the walls, their vibrant colours a defiant splash against the grey afternoon.  Eliza Jane, her auburn braid dusted with pollen, hummed softly as she coaxed a wayward spray of ivy into submission, the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth clinging to her fingertips.  This little corner of Brooklyn, nestled between a bustling laundromat and a perpetually grumpy butcher, was her sanctuary, a place where thorns and stems transformed into expressions of joy, sorrow, and everything in between.  But this particular afternoon, the usual peace of Petal & Stem was about to be thoroughly uprooted.
