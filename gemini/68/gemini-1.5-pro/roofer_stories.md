The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the scent a pungent mix of pine and something vaguely chemical clinging to the air. Elias Thorne, balanced precariously on the peak of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian gingerbread house, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand.

Red brick buildings lined Main Street, interspersed with the white clapboard of older homes, all nestled in the crook of the Mishaum River. From his vantage point, Elias could see the glint of sunlight off the water and the slow, lazy drift of a canoe, its occupants hidden beneath a wide-brimmed straw hat.  He adjusted his own baseball cap, the brim stained dark with years of sweat and grime, and surveyed the shingles he'd just replaced.  A nagging feeling, like a loose nail scratching at the back of his mind, told him something wasn't quite right.
