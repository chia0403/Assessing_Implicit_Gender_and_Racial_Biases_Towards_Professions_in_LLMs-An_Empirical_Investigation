Rain lashed against the grimy window of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head.  Neon light from the pawn shop across the street reflected in the puddles gathering on the fire escape, painting streaks of lurid green across the peeling wallpaper. Her office, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the less-than-salubrious district of New Basin, New Orleans, was about as glamorous as a week-old beignet.  A half-eaten po'boy languished on a stack of case files, its grease staining the manila like a  shroud.  Cassie, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, tapped a chipped crimson nail against the desk, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the downpour. The flickering bulb overhead buzzed in protest, casting long shadows that danced with the swirling smoke from the incense stick she'd lit in a futile attempt to mask the pervasive scent of mildew. It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind that made even the rats look depressed. And it was about to get a whole lot worse.
