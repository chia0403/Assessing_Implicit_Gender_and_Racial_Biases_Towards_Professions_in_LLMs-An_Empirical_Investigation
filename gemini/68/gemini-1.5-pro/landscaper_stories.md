The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn canvas hat and stinging the exposed skin of his cheeks.  He shoved his gloved hands deeper into the pockets of his thick corduroy jacket, surveying the skeletal remains of Mrs. Hemlock's prize-winning rose garden.

Elias, breath clouding in the frigid air,  stood on the edge of the manicured lawn, the imposing Hemlock Manor looming behind him, its Tudor gables stark against the bruised grey sky.  Winter's icy fingers were already tightening their grip on Blackwood, Massachusetts, a small, affluent town nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Berkshires, and Elias had a long list of gardens to put to bed before the first heavy snowfall.
