Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Kestrel Corporation building, blurring the already fading twilight of a Seattle November. Inside, the air thrummed with a low, persistent hum, the sound of thousands of servers working tirelessly in the basement data center.  Elara Vance, a systems analyst with a perpetually furrowed brow and a talent for deciphering digital riddles, tapped a frantic rhythm on her ergonomic keyboard. Her desk, usually a model of organized chaos, was currently buried under printouts of code, hastily scribbled notes, and half-empty coffee cups.  The flickering glow of her dual monitors illuminated the worry etched on her face.  For the past 72 hours, Elara had been chasing a ghost in the machine â€“ a rogue process that was draining processing power and intermittently shutting down critical systems within Kestrel's vast network.  No one else seemed to see the pattern, dismissing the outages as routine glitches, but Elara knew better. Something was wrong, very wrong, and she had a sinking feeling that it was only going to get worse.
