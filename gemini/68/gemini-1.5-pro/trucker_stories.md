The neon glow of the Desert Rose Diner spilled out onto the rain-slicked asphalt, painting the puddles a lurid pink.  A diesel engine sighed and shuddered to a halt, the hiss of air brakes a mournful counterpoint to the crackling jukebox inside.  This was the edge of Nowhere, Nevada, population 42 (if you counted the coyotes), and tonight, it was hosting Elara Jane “Ellie” Blackwood and her eighteen-wheeler, "The Wanderer," a behemoth of chrome and steel adorned with a faded decal of a howling wolf. Ellie, her worn leather boots hitting the ground with a thud, adjusted the brim of her dusty Stetson and took a deep breath of the desert air, tinged with the scent of sagebrush and diesel. The wind whipped across the desolate landscape, whistling a lonely tune that echoed the emptiness in her heart.  She had a delivery to make in Reno by dawn, a load of pre-fab housing units destined for some new subdivision, another bite taken out of the wild. But tonight, she just needed a cup of coffee and a moment of quiet before facing the long, dark stretch of highway ahead.
