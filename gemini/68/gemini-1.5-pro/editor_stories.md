Rain lashed against the attic window of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's Edinburgh flat, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Loose papers, half-edited manuscripts, and overflowing ashtrays littered every surface of the cramped space, a testament to the deadline looming over her head. The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and printer ink, crackled with the nervous energy of a woman on the edge.  Outside, the gothic spires of St. Giles' Cathedral were swallowed by the swirling grey mist, and the mournful cry of a distant foghorn echoed through the narrow, cobbled streets below.  Amy, clad in a threadbare cashmere cardigan and paint-splattered jeans, hunched over her battered laptop, the glow of the screen illuminating the fierce concentration etched on her face.  The manuscript she was wrestling with, a sprawling epic fantasy novel titled "The Obsidian Heart," was proving to be more challenging than she'd anticipated.  And with the author, a notoriously demanding recluse named Alistair Finch, breathing down her neck, Amy knew she was in for a long, and potentially very stressful, night.
