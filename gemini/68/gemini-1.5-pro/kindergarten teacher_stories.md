The aroma of stale apple juice and construction paper clung to the air in Ms. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom, a persistent reminder of the tiny tornadoes that whirled through five days a week.  Sunlight, filtered through a grimy window streaked with tiny handprints, illuminated a riot of colour: finger-painted masterpieces clinging precariously to the walls, alphabet blocks scattered across the worn rug, and a half-finished cardboard castle, its ramparts sagging under the weight of glitter glue.  Outside, the crisp October air rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over Maplewood Elementary, its branches reaching towards the classroom window like skeletal fingers. The school, a squat brick building nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, held generations of laughter and learning within its walls â€“ and today, Ms. Vance was bracing herself for another day of both.
