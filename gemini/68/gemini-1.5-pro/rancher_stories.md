The wind, a raw, biting thing straight off the Sangre de Cristo mountains, whipped at Amelia Hayesâ€™s chapped lips as she surveyed the skeletal remains of what had once been a sturdy corral fence.  Splintered wood lay scattered across the frozen ground, a testament to the brutal winter storm that had raged through the San Luis Valley just two days prior.  Amelia, bundled in a thick shearling coat and a worn Stetson pulled low over her brow, shoved her gloved hands deeper into her pockets.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs, vanishing quickly against the vast, steel-grey sky.  The Rocking H Ranch, nestled in a high-altitude basin shadowed by the towering peaks, looked ravaged. The usually vibrant green pastures were now a blanket of snow, and the lowing of her cattle, usually a comforting sound, was tinged with an anxious edge this morning.  Something more than the storm had unsettled them.
