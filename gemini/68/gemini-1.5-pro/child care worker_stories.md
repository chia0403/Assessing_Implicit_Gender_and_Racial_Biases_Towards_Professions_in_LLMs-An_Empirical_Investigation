The air in the Bumblebrook Early Learning Center buzzed with the chaotic symphony of toddlerdom.  Tiny hands slapped paint onto paper with gleeful abandon, blocks clattered to the floor in rhythmic crashes, and a high-pitched shriek of laughter punctuated the general din.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking a small, fenced-in playground where a lone plastic tricycle lay abandoned. Inside, amidst the colorful chaos,  twenty-four-year-old Elara Josephine Bell knelt, patiently helping four-year-old Leo zip his bright red puffer jacket.  A faint smell of stale goldfish crackers clung to her cardigan, and a smudge of blue paint adorned her cheek, a badge of honor earned in the trenches of toddler art class.  Winter clung stubbornly to the small town of Havenwood, Maine, painting the world outside in shades of grey and white, but inside Bumblebrook, the vibrant energy of the children kept the cold at bay. This particular Friday, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, an unsettling stillness beneath the surface of the usual clamor. Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.
