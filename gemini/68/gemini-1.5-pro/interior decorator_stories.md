The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering a stray strand of auburn hair across her lipstick-smudged cheek.  She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, the icy air a stark contrast to the opulent warmth she expected within the wrought iron gates of Eventide Manor.  Perched on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning gray expanse of the Atlantic, the manor was a gothic masterpiece of weathered stone and shadowed gables. Tonight, it was bathed in the sickly yellow glow of sodium vapor lamps, casting eerie shadows that danced across the manicured lawns.  Eleanor, shivering despite her wool coat, adjusted the heavy portfolio clutched in her gloved hand.  This was it, the chance of a lifetime: to reimagine the interiors of one of Maine's most historic – and notoriously reclusive – estates.  The Fortheringhams, the manor’s owners, were notoriously particular.  Eleanor just hoped her vision for a modernized, yet respectful, restoration wouldn't be met with the same icy reception as the coastal wind.
