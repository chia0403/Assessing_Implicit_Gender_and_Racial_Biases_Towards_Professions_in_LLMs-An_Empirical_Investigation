The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, but ambitiously elegant restaurant nestled in the heart of Montmartre.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy, impressionistic smear of Parisian streetlights.  Chef Antoine Dubois, his apron smeared with flour and a frown etched deep between his dark eyebrows, stooped to retrieve the pan.  A single, perfect mirepoix lay scattered across the tiled floor, glistening like fallen jewels.  He sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain. This was not how he’d envisioned the eve of his restaurant’s one-year anniversary.  Not at all.
