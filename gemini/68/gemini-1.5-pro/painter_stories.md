The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, a fine mist that mingled with the already-present smudges of cerulean and cadmium yellow on her cheek.  The jagged cliffs of Monhegan Island, Maine, rose around her like the teeth of some ancient sea monster, their granite faces softened by a tapestry of clinging pines and wind-battered wildflowers.  September had arrived on the small island, bringing with it a crispness to the air and a deepening intensity to the colours of the landscape.  Amelia, perched precariously on a folding stool at the edge of Lobster Cove, squinted at the churning turquoise water below. Her easel, secured by a pile of rocks, held a canvas barely touched, the white expanse a stark contrast to the riot of colour that surrounded her. For two weeks, Amelia had been trying to capture the elusive light of this place, the way it shifted and danced on the waves, transforming the familiar world into something almost otherworldly.  But every stroke of her brush felt inadequate, a pale imitation of the vibrant reality before her.  This island, renowned for inspiring generations of artists, was proving a formidable, almost overwhelming, muse.
