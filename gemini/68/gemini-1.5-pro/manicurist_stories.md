The pungent scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Elizabeta "Lizzie" Petrova like a second skin.  Her salon, "Nailed It," was nestled between a laundromat with perpetually broken dryers and a bodega that sold lottery tickets alongside wilting bouquets. Located on the bustling corner of Bleecker and Mercer in Manhattan's West Village, the salon itself was a tiny jewel box of a space, crammed with plush velvet chairs, glittering shelves of polish, and the rhythmic whir of the nail drill.  Outside, the late October wind howled, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied dances along the cracked sidewalks. Inside, Lizzie, with her fiery red hair pulled back into a tight bun, meticulously painted a delicate floral design onto Mrs. Goldsteinâ€™s meticulously manicured nails, the only sound the gentle scratch of her brush against the hardened acrylic.  This Tuesday morning, like every other morning, Lizzie was ready to face the day, one perfect manicure at a time, unaware that her life, much like the unpredictable autumn weather, was about to take a dramatic turn.
