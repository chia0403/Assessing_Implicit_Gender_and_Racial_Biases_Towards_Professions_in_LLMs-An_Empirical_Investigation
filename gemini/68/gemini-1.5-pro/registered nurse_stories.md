The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the St. Jude's Clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic beat in Amelia Reyes's chest.  The air inside the small, rural clinic, usually thick with the comforting aroma of antiseptic and brewing coffee, was now sharp with the metallic tang of blood and fear.  Amelia, her dark hair plastered to her forehead with a mixture of sweat and rain, adjusted the oxygen mask on the face of a young boy, his skin ashen and clammy beneath her gloved hand.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the isolated building nestled between the towering pines and the churning gray expanse of the Pacific Ocean.  It was November 7th, 2023, and the first major storm of the season had effectively cut off the clinic, and its handful of occupants, from the rest of the world.
