The biting pre-dawn air, sharp enough to sting Elias Blackwood's exposed cheeks, hinted at the frost that would soon glaze the towering pines of the Cascade Mountains.  Elias, his breath puffing out in ghostly plumes, stomped his boots against the frozen ground outside his small cabin, the rhythmic thud a counterpoint to the hushed expectancy of the forest. The cabin, nestled in a clearing carved out of the dense woods near the rumbling Snoqualmie River, was a testament to Elias's solitary life: rough-hewn logs chinked with moss, a single window overlooking the river valley, and a plume of woodsmoke curling from the stovepipe, promising warmth and the strong scent of brewing coffee within.  The year was 1933, and the Great Depression had cast its long shadow even over this remote corner of Washington state, making the already arduous life of a logger even more precarious. But for Elias, the forest was more than just a source of income; it was a refuge, a church, and a constant companion.  Today, however, held a different kind of stillness, a pregnant silence that Elias couldn't quite place, and it made the hair on the back of his neck prickle with unease.
