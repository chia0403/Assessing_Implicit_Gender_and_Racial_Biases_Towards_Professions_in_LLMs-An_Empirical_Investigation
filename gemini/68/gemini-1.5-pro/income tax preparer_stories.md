The stale, recirculated air of Harold Finch's office hummed with the low thrum of a dying space heater.  February in Syracuse, New York, meant two things: mountains of dirty snow piled high along Salina Street, and tax season. Harold, full name Harold Perkins Finch, a man whose life was as organized as a perfectly alphabetized filing cabinet, sat hunched over his desk, a single, bare bulb illuminating the forest of 1040 forms before him.  His office, tucked away on the second floor of a nondescript building sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Italian restaurant, was small, but meticulously tidy. Every pen was in its designated holder, every stapler loaded with a fresh strip of staples, and every client file neatly labeled and stored in the looming metal cabinet that took up an entire wall. Outside, the wind howled like a disgruntled taxpayer, rattling the frosted windowpanes. Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Harold's calculator, a counterpoint to the ticking of the vintage clock on the wall, relentlessly counting down to April 15th.
