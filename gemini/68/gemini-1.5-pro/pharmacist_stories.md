The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Creek, baking the air to a shimmering haze. Inside Harmony Creek Pharmacy, the air conditioning hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the dry, crackling heat outside.  Eleanor Vance, PharmD, meticulously counted out metformin tablets, the rhythmic click of the pill counter a familiar soundtrack to her afternoon. The pharmacy, a small, independent business she'd inherited from her grandfather, was her sanctuary, a place where the pungent aroma of various tinctures and the quiet rustle of prescription bags offered a comforting familiarity.  Harmony Creek itself, however, was anything but comforting.  A once-thriving mining town, it was now a ghost of its former self, populated by stubborn holdouts and the occasional tumbleweed that dared to cross Main Street.  This afternoon, Eleanor sensed a different kind of stillness, a pregnant pause before something shifted in the desert air.  And she was right. The jingle of the front door bell heralded not a customer seeking a refill, but a figure shrouded in dust and desperation, a figure that would shatter the predictable rhythm of Eleanor's life.
