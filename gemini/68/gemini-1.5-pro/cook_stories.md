The clatter of tin pots and the sizzle of onions hitting hot oil were the soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life. His kitchen, tucked away in the cobbled backstreets of Port Blossom, was a haven of copper pans gleaming warmly in the gaslight, mismatched crockery stacked precariously high, and the ever-present aroma of something delicious simmering on the stove. Port Blossom itself was a town clinging to the edge of the Whisperwind Sea, a place where salty air met the sweet perfume of exotic spices unloaded from the tall ships that frequented its bustling docks.  The buildings, a riot of color from seafoam green to sunset orange, leaned against each other as if for support against the relentless ocean winds. Elias, with flour dusting his apron and a smudge of charcoal across his cheekbone, rarely ventured beyond his kitchen door, preferring the company of his bubbling sauces and the rhythmic chop of his well-worn knife. But tonight, the salty tang of the sea air carried something else â€“ a whiff of mystery, a hint of something brewing stronger than his strongest stock.
