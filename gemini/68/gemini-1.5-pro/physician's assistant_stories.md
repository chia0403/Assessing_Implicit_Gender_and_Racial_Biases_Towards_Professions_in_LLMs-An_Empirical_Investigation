The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  Gargoyles perched atop the gothic facade leered down, their stony faces dusted with a fine layer of snow. The aged wrought-iron lamps, casting flickering pools of orange light onto the frosted ground, did little to dispel the encroaching darkness or the sense of unease that had settled in Eleanor's stomach since receiving the cryptic page.  St. Jude's, nestled deep in the woods of rural Vermont, was a place of quiet dignity by day, but after nightfall, the shadows seemed to deepen, the silence to thicken, and the centuries-old building whispered secrets only the wind could understand.  Tonight, those whispers felt particularly sharp, almost accusatory.  Eleanor clutched her steaming thermos of tea tighter, her breath misting in the frigid air, and quickened her pace towards the brightly lit emergency room entrance, the pageâ€™s urgent message echoing in her mind: "Patient Zero. Isolation Ward. Immediately."
