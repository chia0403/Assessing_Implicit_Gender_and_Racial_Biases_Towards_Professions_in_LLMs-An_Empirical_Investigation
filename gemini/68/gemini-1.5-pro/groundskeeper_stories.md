The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's braid across her cheek as she surveyed her domain.  Wysteria Hall Gardens, once the jewel of the Derbyshire countryside, now wore the melancholy hues of late autumn.  Crimson and gold leaves swirled across the manicured lawns, collecting in drifts against the weathered stone balustrades.  Amy, head groundskeeper and sole caretaker of the sprawling estate for the last five years, tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The grand house loomed behind her, dark and silent, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the neglected beauty below.  Mr. Silas Blackwood, the reclusive owner, rarely ventured outside, leaving Amy to her own devices amidst the whispering ghosts of seasons past.  This morning, however, something was different.  A single light flickered in the attic window, a tiny beacon in the vast, shadowed facade, unsettling the eerie stillness that had settled over Wysteria Hall for so long.
