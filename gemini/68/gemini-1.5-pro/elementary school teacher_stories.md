The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s ankles as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude’s School playground.  Dry leaves, the color of burnt caramel, swirled around her sensible brown boots. Above her, the skeletal branches of a giant oak, the school’s unofficial mascot, clawed at the iron-grey sky. St. Jude’s, a small Catholic school nestled in the heart of the sleepy, almost forgotten, town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, had seen better days. The paint peeled from the clapboard siding, the swing set creaked a mournful song in the wind, and the once vibrant mural of Noah’s Ark on the gymnasium wall was now faded and streaked with mildew. But despite its outward appearance, St. Jude's held a special place in Amelia’s heart. It was here, amidst the chipped desks and worn hymnals, that she found her calling, her purpose: nurturing the bright, inquisitive minds of her third-grade students. Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  The normally boisterous playground was eerily silent, and the school’s heavy wooden front door, usually propped open with a brick, was firmly closed.
