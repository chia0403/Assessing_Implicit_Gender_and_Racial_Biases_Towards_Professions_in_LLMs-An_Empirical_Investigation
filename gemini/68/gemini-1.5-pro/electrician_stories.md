The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks raw even through the thick wool of his scarf.  He tugged his worn leather gloves tighter and squinted at the sprawling Victorian mansion looming before him, its silhouette stark against the bruised twilight sky.  Oakhaven Manor, they called it.  Perched high on a bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Irish Sea, the house seemed to exhale a palpable sense of melancholy.  Elias, a pragmatic electrician by trade and by nature, usually scoffed at such notions, but even he couldn't deny the unsettling aura clinging to the place.  His van, a battered Ford Transit plastered with "Thorne Electrical -  No Job Too Small," rumbled to a stop at the foot of the long, weed-choked driveway.  The headlights briefly illuminated a wrought-iron gate, its hinges groaning in protest as if warning him away.  He'd been called out to fix a faulty circuit, a simple enough job, but something about Oakhaven Manor feltâ€¦different.
