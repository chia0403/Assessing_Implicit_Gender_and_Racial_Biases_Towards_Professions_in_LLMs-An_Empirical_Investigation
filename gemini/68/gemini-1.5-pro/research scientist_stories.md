The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick balaclava.  Crystalline snow, driven near horizontal, scoured the ice shelf, obscuring the already limited visibility.  The McMurdo Station, a distant cluster of orange and white modules, was swallowed by the whiteout, leaving Aris feeling utterly isolated. He hunched deeper into his thermal layers, the cold seeping into his bones despite the cutting-edge cold-weather gear.  His breath plumed out, instantly freezing into miniature ice sculptures that danced briefly on the wind before vanishing.  Attached to his wrist by a thick, insulated cable, a ground-penetrating radar unit emitted a steady, low hum, its orange screen the only splash of color in the monochrome landscape. Aris was searching, meticulously scanning the frozen expanse, for something buried deep beneath the ice â€“ something that had the potential to rewrite human history.
