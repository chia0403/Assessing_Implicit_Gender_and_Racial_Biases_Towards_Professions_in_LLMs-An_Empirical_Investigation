The brass-plated doors of the Grand Blackwood Hotel revolved with a stately sigh, ushering in a flurry of snowflakes and the sharp scent of winter pine.  Built in the opulent style of the Gilded Age, the Blackwood was a monument to excess, a place where money whispered secrets in velvet-draped corners and champagne flowed like the nearby Hudson River.  Tonight, the lobby buzzed with the pre-Christmas rush, a chaotic symphony of tinkling glasses, excited chatter, and the rhythmic click-clack of heels on marble.  Amidst this opulent whirlwind, Elijah Beaumont Finch, a bellhop of slight build and surprisingly sharp eyes, straightened his pillbox hat and plastered a practiced smile on his face. He knew the holiday season meant overflowing tips, but it also meant dealing with the Blackwood's most demanding clientele â€“ the kind who expected miracles wrapped in tissue paper and delivered with a bow.  Tonight, Elijah had a feeling, was going to be one of those nights.
