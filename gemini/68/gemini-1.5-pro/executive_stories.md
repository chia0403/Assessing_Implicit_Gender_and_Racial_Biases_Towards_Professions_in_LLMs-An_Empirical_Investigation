Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Thorne's forty-fifth-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of Manhattan into a shimmering, impressionistic canvas.  Amelia, CEO of Thorne Dynamics, a cutting-edge robotics firm, tapped a manicured fingernail against the cool glass, her brow furrowed.  The city below, usually a vibrant tapestry of activity, was subdued, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  The mahogany desk behind her, usually pristine, was a battlefield of scattered documents, prototypes, and half-empty coffee cups, testament to the seventy-two hours she'd spent wrestling with a problem that threatened to unravel everything she'd built.  The launch of the "Aether," Thorne Dynamics' revolutionary new AI-powered drone, was just weeks away, and a critical systems failure threatened to turn the most anticipated tech event of the decade into a public relations nightmare.
