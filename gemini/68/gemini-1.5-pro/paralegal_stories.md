Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Darrow & Quince law offices, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Hayes.  The mahogany-paneled room, usually a sanctuary of hushed whispers and the rustle of legal documents, crackled with an unusual tension.  It was 7:48 pm on a Friday, and the city lights of Philadelphia glittered like scattered diamonds through the downpour. Amelia, her chestnut hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped a manicured nail against her laptop, a frown etching itself deeper into her face with each passing second.  The opulent office, with its Persian rugs and leather-bound volumes lining the walls, felt more like a gilded cage tonight.  She was waiting. Waiting for Mr. Darrow, senior partner and notorious workaholic, to return with the news that could make or break her career â€“ the verdict in the Peterson vs. Cartwright case, a case Amelia had poured her heart and soul into for the past six months.
