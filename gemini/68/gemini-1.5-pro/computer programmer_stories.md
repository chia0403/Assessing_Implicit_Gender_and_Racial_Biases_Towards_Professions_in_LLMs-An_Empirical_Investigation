The apartment, perched high above Puget Sound in the Belltown neighborhood, normally boasted breathtaking views of the Olympic Mountains, but tonight, it felt like a cage. The rhythmic clatter of keys against the mechanical keyboard was the only sound, save for the occasional frustrated sigh that escaped Elias's lips as he wrestled with the stubborn code. Tonight, the digital fortress he was tasked with breaching felt more impenetrable than ever.  The deadline, looming like a guillotine, was only hours away.
