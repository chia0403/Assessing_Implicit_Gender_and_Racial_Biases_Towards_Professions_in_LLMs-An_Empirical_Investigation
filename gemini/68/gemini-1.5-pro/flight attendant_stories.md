The stale recirculated air hung heavy in the cabin, thick with the scent of lukewarm coffee and someone's aggressively floral perfume.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her smile professionally plastered in place, navigated the narrow aisle of the budget airline's 737, dodging outstretched legs and carelessly placed carry-ons.  Outside, the bruised purple sky hinted at the approaching dawn, casting long shadows across the sleeping faces of her passengers. They were somewhere over the Nevada desert, en route from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles LAX, a route Amelia had flown so many times she could practically recite the safety demonstration in her sleep.  This particular flight, however, felt different.  A prickling unease settled at the base of her spine, a feeling she couldn't quite shake, like a forgotten dream clinging to the edges of her consciousness.  The cabin lights flickered, a brief stutter in the otherwise monotonous hum of the aircraft, and Amelia's grip tightened on the coffee pot. Something was wrong.
