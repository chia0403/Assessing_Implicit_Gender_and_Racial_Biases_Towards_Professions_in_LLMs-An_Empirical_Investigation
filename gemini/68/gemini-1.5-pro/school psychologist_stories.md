The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the snow-dusted quad of Crestwood Preparatory Academy.  Gargoyles perched atop the gothic revival buildings leered down, their expressions mirroring the gnawing anxiety in Eleanor's stomach.  Crestwood, a prestigious boarding school nestled deep in the Vermont woods, was a place of hushed whispers and long shadows, both literally and figuratively.  The imposing stone structures, the sprawling, untamed forest that pressed close to the manicured lawns, even the perpetually overcast sky, all contributed to an atmosphere of unsettling quiet. Eleanor tugged her thick wool coat tighter around her, the cold seeping into her bones despite the layers.  She was due to meet with Headmaster Thorne in ten minutes, a meeting hastily arranged and shrouded in an unsettling lack of detail.  All the Headmaster’s secretary had divulged was that it concerned a “sensitive matter” involving one of the students.  Eleanor’s experience had taught her that “sensitive matter” at Crestwood rarely meant a scraped knee or a homesick phone call.
