The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle tea shack, a relentless metallic drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s stomach.

All she knew was that this story, whatever it was, felt bigger, more dangerous, than anything she’d ever encountered in her ten years as a journalist.  The chipped, enamel clock on the tea stall wall ticked towards midnight, each click echoing the growing unease in her heart.
