The neon "Open" sign in the window of Aligned Spine & Wellness pulsed a sickly green, casting an eerie glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., rubbed his temples, the persistent Oregon drizzle mirroring the dull ache behind his eyes.  His clinic, usually bustling with the groans and pops of adjustments, was eerily silent.  The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from his grandfather, also a chiropractor, who had established the practice almost a century ago.  Elias glanced at the clock; 7:58 pm. Two minutes until closing on a Tuesday night, a night that had been as slow as molasses in January.  He was about to switch off the infernal neon sign when the bell above the door chimed, announcing a late arrival.
