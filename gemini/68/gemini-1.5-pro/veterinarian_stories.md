The biting wind whipped across Dr. Elias Thorne's face, stinging his cheeks and causing the loose strands of his brown hair to dance wildly. The desolate beauty of the Scottish Highlands, normally a balm to his soul, offered little comfort tonight.  Glencoe, normally a haven of picturesque lochs and towering munros, was cloaked in a thick, swirling mist that seemed to seep into his bones.  His Land Rover, affectionately nicknamed "Angus," shuddered as it navigated the treacherous, single-track road leading to the croft of Old Man MacTavish, a notoriously reclusive shepherd.  Elias squinted through the swirling grey, his headlights barely penetrating the oppressive darkness.  Angus's engine whined in protest as it climbed the steep incline, the only sound besides the mournful cry of a distant stag.  A sense of unease settled deep in Elias's gut, a feeling that went beyond the challenging weather. Tonight's call wasn't for a sick ewe or a lame Highland cow. It was for somethingâ€¦different.  MacTavish had been cryptic, his voice tight with fear, muttering about a "beast" and a "curse."
