The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking Port Blossom.  Below, the small fishing village clung to the coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull.  A kaleidoscope of brightly painted houses tumbled down towards the harbor, their colors echoing the vibrant hues of the fishing boats bobbing gently on the turquoise water.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and woodsmoke, whipped Elara’s auburn braid around her shoulders as she sketched furiously in her worn leather-bound notebook, capturing the dramatic interplay of light and shadow on the churning sea.  Port Blossom, nestled in a hidden cove on the western edge of Aethelgard, was a place of both vibrant life and quiet solitude – the perfect inspiration for Elara's next masterpiece.
