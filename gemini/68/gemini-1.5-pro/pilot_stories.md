The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight suit as she prepped her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver for takeoff.  Snow dusted the corrugated metal roof of the tiny hangar at Iliamna Air Taxi, and the frozen surface of Lake Iliamna stretched out before her like a vast, pewter mirror reflecting the bruised pre-dawn sky.  Ace adjusted her fur-lined hood, the breath clouding before her face a stark white against the deepening grey.  The air crackled with the promise of snow, the kind of heavy, wet snow that could ground a plane faster than a faulty magneto.  Today's route was a challenging one: delivering supplies to a remote geological survey camp nestled deep in the rugged peaks of the Chigmit Mountains.  A shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down Ace's spine. It wasn't the terrain that worried her, she'd flown worse. It was the unsettling silence on the other end of the radio that morning when she'd called in her flight plan.
