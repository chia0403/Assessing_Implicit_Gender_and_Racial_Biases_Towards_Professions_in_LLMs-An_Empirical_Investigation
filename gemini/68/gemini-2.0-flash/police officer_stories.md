The greasy aroma of stale donuts and cheap coffee clung to the pre-dawn air inside the precinct's break room like a stubborn burr. Rain hammered against the single, grimy window overlooking the back alley, a relentless drumbeat echoing the knot of unease tightening in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's gut. She stared down at the lukewarm, sludgy liquid in her mug, the swirling brown depths reflecting the dim fluorescent lights and, perhaps, a sliver of her own apprehension. Today was going to be a long one.

**Setting:** The story begins in the cramped and perpetually damp break room of the 17th Precinct of the Hartford Police Department, in Hartford, Connecticut. It's 5:47 AM, on a particularly dreary Tuesday in late October. The building is a hulking brick structure, dating back to the 1950s, and shows its age in peeling paint, chipped linoleum, and a general air of weary resignation. The back alley outside the window is littered with overflowing dumpsters and stray cats, their eyes glinting in the downpour.
