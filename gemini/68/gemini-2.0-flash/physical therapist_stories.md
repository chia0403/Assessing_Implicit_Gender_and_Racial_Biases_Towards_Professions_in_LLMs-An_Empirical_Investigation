Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a physical therapist as the main character:

**Setting:**

The crisp autumn air swirled fallen leaves across the parking lot of "Motion & Grace Rehabilitation," a small, locally-owned physical therapy clinic in the charming, yet slightly rundown, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The clinic itself was housed in a converted Victorian house, its once-grand facade now peeling in places, painted a faded shade of robin's egg blue. Inside, the space was surprisingly bright and welcoming, filled with the scent of disinfectant, liniment, and a subtle hint of brewing chamomile tea. Treadmills, balance boards, and resistance bands were strategically arranged around the room, interspersed with motivational posters depicting athletes in peak performance and anatomical charts of the human muscular system. A small, cluttered office, overflowing with patient files and medical journals, was tucked away in the back.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Grace Tremaine, her hands calloused yet gentle, meticulously wrapped an ace bandage around Mrs. Higgins' swollen knee. "There you go, dear," she said, her voice a warm balm against the older woman's pain. "Keep this on, and remember those exercises. Twenty reps, twice a day. No cheating."

Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose years had etched a map of hardship onto her face, chuckled weakly. "Oh, Eleanor, you're too good to me. I don't know what I'd do without you and your magic hands. This knee's been giving me fits for months."

Eleanor smiled, the gesture crinkling the corners of her eyes, a feature that, despite her thirty-eight years, still retained a hint of girlish charm. "No magic, Mrs. Higgins, just a little physics and a lot of patience. Now, promise me you won't overdo it with the pumpkin pie baking this weekend. We don't want to undo all this hard work."

As Mrs. Higgins hobbled out, carefully making her way to the front desk, Eleanor sighed. The clinic was quiet, save for the rhythmic hum of the air purifier. Autumn in Port Blossom was beautiful, yes, but it also meant an influx of older residents eager to get their bodies ready for the upcoming holidays, the constant drizzle, and the inevitable icy conditions of winter. And with Dr. Albright, the clinic's owner, hinting at retirement again, Eleanor knew she was shouldering more and more of the weight of keeping Motion & Grace afloat. But as she glanced around the room, seeing the subtle changes in her patients' range of motion, the increased strength in their limbs, and the renewed hope in their eyes, she couldn't imagine doing anything else. This town, this clinic, these people... they were a part of her now, woven into the very fabric of her life. But lately, a gnawing feeling had been growing within her, a sense that something was about to change, a feeling as undeniable as the scent of the approaching nor'easter. A feeling that had nothing to do with sore knees or aging joints, and everything to do with secrets hidden within the walls of Port Blossom and a past she thought she'd buried long ago.
