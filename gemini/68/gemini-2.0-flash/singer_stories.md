## Story Opening:

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, even at 10 PM. A lone cicada buzzed its mournful tune, a tiny, vibrating lament that echoed the feeling in Magnolia "Maggie" Duboisâ€™s chest. She stood backstage at "The Bayou Blues," a ramshackle roadhouse just outside of Houma, the scent of stale beer and simmering jambalaya clinging to everything, even her custom-made, sapphire-blue gown. The sequins, usually dazzling under the stage lights, seemed dull, lifeless in the dim backstage.

Maggie pressed a cold bottle of Abita Purple Haze against her forehead, hoping to quell the throbbing headache that had been building since the third encore. The crowd had been ravenous tonight, chanting her name, demanding more of her soulful vocals. They didn't see the cracks in the facade, the growing hollowness that threatened to swallow her whole. They just wanted the legend, the "Queen of the Bayou Blues," the girl with the voice that could raise the dead.

But tonight, even Maggie's voice felt tired, strained, like a beloved instrument left out in the rain. She pulled the bottle away and stared at her reflection in the cracked, dusty mirror. Her brown eyes, usually sparkling with an inner fire, were shadowed with exhaustion. The smile that usually came so easily felt forced, unnatural.

"Five minutes, Maggie," croaked a raspy voice. Earl, the roadhouse owner, a mountain of a man with a permanently stained apron and a heart of gold (or so he liked to think), peered through the doorway. "Gotta give 'em one more for the road, darlin'."

Maggie sighed, the sound lost in the roar of the crowd on the other side of the thin plywood wall. One more for the road. That was her life in a nutshell, wasn't it? One more song, one more show, one more performance for a life that felt increasingly like a script she hadn't written.

## Setting:

**The Bayou Blues Roadhouse:** Located just outside Houma, Louisiana, this is a classic, if slightly dilapidated, roadhouse. Think weathered wooden walls, a zinc-topped bar sticky with spilled beer, and mismatched tables and chairs crammed onto a concrete floor. Strings of bare light bulbs cast a yellow glow on the lively crowd. The air is thick with the smell of jambalaya, stale beer, and the sweet, floral scent of magnolias growing wild just outside. The stage is small and worn, but bathed in the vibrant colors of the stage lights.

**Backstage:** Cramped, cluttered, and dimly lit. Contains a cracked mirror, a rickety wooden chair, and various discarded props and costumes. The air is stuffy and smells of mildew and sweat. This is Maggie's sanctuary, her brief escape from the spotlight.

**Louisiana Bayou:** The surrounding landscape is lush and vibrant, dominated by cypress trees draped with Spanish moss, sluggish bayous teeming with life, and the humid, oppressive heat that defines the region. The beauty of the natural world contrasts sharply with the gritty reality of the roadhouse and the internal struggles of the main character.
