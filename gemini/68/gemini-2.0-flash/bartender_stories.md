## Opening:

The clinking of ice was a lullaby to Amelia Rose Sterling. It was the only sound that cut through the thick, sticky silence that had descended on The Rusty Anchor, a silence that clung to the worn mahogany like sea moss to a barnacled hull. A silence that screamed, "Slow night, slow night, another night sunk like a forgotten treasure."

Amelia sighed, polishing the same already-gleaming pint glass for the fifth time. Outside, a restless wind rattled the weather-beaten sign, its painted anchor groaning in protest against the approaching storm. Inside, the amber glow of the gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows, making the empty barstools look like ghosts waiting for their drink.

The only other soul in the place, besides Amelia, was old Silas, slumped in his usual corner booth, nursing a near-empty glass of something dark and smelling faintly of regret. He hadn't spoken a word for the last hour, content to stare out at the brewing tempest through the rain-streaked windows.

Tonight felt ominous. The kind of quiet before the storm that pressed down on your chest and whispered that something was about to change, whether you wanted it to or not.

## Setting:

The Rusty Anchor was nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, a fishing village clinging precariously to the rugged coast of Maine. The air perpetually smelled of salt, seaweed, and the faint, lingering scent of fish guts. The buildings were a patchwork of weather-beaten clapboard, painted in faded shades of blue, grey, and the occasional defiant burst of crimson.

The Anchor itself was a two-story structure that had seen better days. Its wooden planks groaned underfoot, and the salty air had permeated every crack and crevice. Inside, it was a haven of dim light and nautical charm (or at least, what passed for charm after decades of hard use and spilled beer).

Walls were adorned with faded photographs of fishing boats battling treacherous seas, dusty maps depicting the treacherous coastline, and the occasional mounted marlin, its glassy eyes staring blankly into the middle distance. A large, ornate anchor, salvaged from a shipwreck long ago, hung above the fireplace, a silent sentinel guarding the space.

The bar was a long, curved expanse of scarred mahogany, worn smooth by countless elbows and spilled drinks. Behind it, a cluttered array of bottles glittered in the lamplight, holding promises of warmth, solace, and sometimes, trouble.
