## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "The Cloverleaf Pharmacy" chimed a cheerful little jig, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Plumtree had heard thousands of times in her forty-seven years. Tonight, though, the sound grated. She scrubbed harder at the sticky patch of cough syrup on the counter, a phantom scent of cherry clinging stubbornly to the air. Outside, the November rain lashed against the large front window, painting blurry streaks of neon from the neighbouring diner.

Beatrice hated nights like these. The kind of night that dragged in late, watery coughs, anxieties over fevers spiking in the dark, and a general melancholia that seemed to seep into the very mortar of the old building. It wasn't that she disliked helping people, quite the opposite. It was the loneliness of it all, the lingering quiet after the last customer trudged out into the downpour, leaving her alone again with the ghosts of prescriptions filled and ailments soothed.

She sighed, tossing the cloth into the sink with a defeated plop. Maybe she'd treat herself to a cup of that Earl Grey tea she’d hidden at the back of the cupboard. Just as she reached for the kettle, another ring of the bell sliced through the stillness. Beatrice braced herself. Probably Mrs. Henderson, forgetting her eye drops again. She plastered on a professional smile and prepared to face the storm, both inside and out.

## Setting:

**The Cloverleaf Pharmacy, nestled in the heart of the small, unassuming town of Havenwood, Oregon.** It's an institution, having stood on the corner of Oak and Maple for over eighty years. The building itself is a two-story brick structure, weathered but sturdy, with a faded green awning that reads "The Cloverleaf Pharmacy - Your Health is Our Priority."

Inside, the pharmacy is a comforting blend of old-fashioned charm and modern necessity. Rows of neatly organized medications line the walls, alongside shelves stocked with toiletries, over-the-counter remedies, and quirky local products like lavender soaps and homemade honey. The air is a blend of medicinal scents, floral potpourri, and a hint of the brewing coffee Beatrice often keeps on hand.

A long, polished wooden counter stretches across the front, scarred with years of use and dotted with old apothecary jars filled with colourful candies. Behind the counter, Beatrice’s workspace is meticulously organized, a testament to her dedication and attention to detail. Old pharmacy books, some dating back decades, are stacked on a nearby shelf, a constant reminder of the tradition and knowledge she upholds.

The overall atmosphere is warm and inviting, designed to put customers at ease. The Cloverleaf isn't just a place to pick up prescriptions; it's a community hub, a place where people come for advice, a friendly ear, and a sense of belonging. But on nights like tonight, with the rain battering the windows and the town cloaked in darkness, even the Cloverleaf can feel a little lonely.
