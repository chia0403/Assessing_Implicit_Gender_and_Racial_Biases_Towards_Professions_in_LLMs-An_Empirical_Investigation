Okay, here's a story opening and setting for an interior decorator character:

**Setting:**

The oppressive Charleston heat clung to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather like a damp shroud. Palmetto leaves drooped listlessly in the humid air, and even the vibrant bougainvillea spilling over the wrought-iron balconies seemed to sag under the weight of the afternoon sun. She stood on the porch of the grand, albeit dilapidated, Southern mansion, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down her spine despite the shade. The house, “Magnolia Dream,” as the rusted sign proclaimed, was a faded beauty – peeling paint the color of a bruised peach, shutters hanging askew, and a general air of neglect clinging to it like Spanish moss. It was located on a historic street, just a block from the water, where the air promised a breeze, but the breeze hadn't arrived yet.

**Opening:**

Amelia Bellweather adjusted her designer tote bag, its crisp linen a stark contrast to the decaying grandeur around her. She took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. Magnolia Dream was the biggest commission of her career, a chance to prove herself beyond the trendy condos and charming cottages that had defined her portfolio thus far. But as she stared at the imposing structure, the "before" pictures flashing through her mind, she couldn't help but wonder if she'd bitten off more than she could chew.

Her client, a wealthy but eccentric art collector named Eleanor Fairchild, had tasked Amelia with restoring the mansion to its former glory, while still infusing it with a modern sensibility. A daunting task, to say the least.

"Well, Amelia," she muttered to herself, pushing open the creaking front door. "Time to wake a sleeping giant." A musty, almost funereal, scent assaulted her nostrils as she stepped into the shadowed foyer, and Amy couldn't help but shiver, despite the heat. This wasn't just a restoration project; it felt like an excavation of history, secrets, and possibly, a few ghosts.
