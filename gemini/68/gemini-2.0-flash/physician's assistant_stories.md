Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a physician's assistant:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of the clinic, a familiar and oddly comforting aroma for Dr. Evelyn Reed's physician's assistant, **Dr. Alistair James Finch**. Alistair sighed, running a hand through his perpetually rumpled auburn hair. He was staring at the overflowing in-tray on his desk, each manila folder representing a life, a worry, a potential disaster. He’d already been here for twelve hours and the blinking red light on the phone taunted him with the promise of more urgent calls, more demanding patients, more things to juggle.

He knew he should be grabbing a quick bite – the granola bar he’d choked down hours ago was a distant memory – but a deep-seated exhaustion had settled in his bones, the kind that no amount of caffeine could truly conquer. The rural town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains, might seem idyllic on a postcard, but its medical needs were anything but serene. A sharp knock on the door jolted him from his contemplation. Before he could even muster a "Come in," Dr. Reed poked her head inside, her face etched with concern.

“Alistair, we’ve got a situation at the old sawmill. Possible accident. Head trauma.”

Alistair's fatigue evaporated instantly, replaced by the surge of adrenaline he knew so well. He grabbed his emergency bag, the weight of it a grounding presence. “On my way, Doc."

**Setting:**

The Harmony Creek Medical Clinic is a small, single-story building, constructed of worn red brick, situated on the outskirts of the town of Harmony Creek, North Carolina. Inside, the waiting room is decorated with faded landscape paintings depicting the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains. The furniture is mismatched and well-worn, bearing testament to years of patient use. The air is usually thick with the scent of disinfectant, mingled with the faint aroma of stale coffee emanating from the staff break room.

Alistair's office, a cramped space barely large enough for a desk and two chairs, is cluttered with medical journals, patient files, and an assortment of anatomical models. A worn stethoscope hangs prominently on the coat rack, and a whiteboard on the wall is filled with scribbled notes and reminders. His personality comes through in the books piled high and the quirky desk calendar.

Harmony Creek itself is a small town, seemingly frozen in time. The main street is lined with antique shops, local eateries, and mom-and-pop stores. The pace of life is slow, and the community is tight-knit. However, beneath the surface of small-town charm lies a struggling economy, a growing opioid crisis, and a population with limited access to specialized healthcare. The old sawmill, located a few miles outside of town, represents a significant source of employment for the community, but also a potential source of danger.
