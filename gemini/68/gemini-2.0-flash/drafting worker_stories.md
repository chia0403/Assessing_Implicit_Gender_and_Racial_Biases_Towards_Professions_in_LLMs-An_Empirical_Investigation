## Story Opening:

The rhythmic scratch of the graphite against the mylar was the only sound Mildred Abernathy found comforting these days. Outside, the ceaseless honking of New York City clawed at the edges of her awareness, but within the cramped confines of Drafting Room B at the Sterling & Finch Construction Company, she had found a precarious peace. Today's project was a doozy: a proposed renovation of the landmark Majestic Theatre's backstage area. Mildred traced the delicate lines of the stage's infrastructure, feeling the weight of history in her hand. She imagined the sweat, the triumphs, the heartbreak absorbed into the very timbers she was painstakingly rendering. It was a far cry from the sleek, modern skyscrapers her colleagues preferred, but Mildred found beauty in the old, in the stories whispered in the grain of wood.

A sharp rap on the door startled her. Mildred jumped, nearly smearing the precious graphite dust all over her drawing. "Come in!" she called, her voice a little too loud in the otherwise silent room.

## Setting:

The year is 1958. Drafting Room B at Sterling & Finch Construction Company occupies the rear of the 12th floor of a nondescript office building in Midtown Manhattan. The space is cramped, dominated by rows of large, drafting tables angled towards the shared light fixtures hanging low from the ceiling. The walls are a pale, institutional green, peeling slightly in places. Blueprints, technical manuals, and discarded coffee cups litter every surface. The air is thick with the smell of paper, ink, and stale cigarette smoke. A window, perpetually grimy from city soot, offers a sliver of view onto the chaotic tapestry of the street below. It's a utilitarian space, functional above all else, but Mildred has attempted to personalize it with a small, framed photograph of her late mother and a pot of wilting geraniums struggling for survival on the windowsill. The room feels more like a forgotten corner of the bustling city than a vital hub of its architectural development.
