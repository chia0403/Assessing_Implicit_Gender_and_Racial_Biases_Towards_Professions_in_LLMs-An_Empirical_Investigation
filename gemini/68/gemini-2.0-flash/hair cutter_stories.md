Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and main character information:

**Main Character:** Genevieve Marguerite Dubois, a hair cutter.

**Setting:** The story opens in a sleepy coastal town called Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged Oregon coast. The air hangs heavy with the scent of salt and brine, mixed with the fainter aroma of freshly baked sourdough from the bakery across the street. It's a Thursday morning in late October, the kind of day where the sky is a bruised purple and the wind howls a mournful song, rattling the windows of the small shops that line Main Street.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Bliss," Genevieve Marguerite Dubois's tiny salon, jingled with a hesitant chime, announcing the arrival of her first appointment. Genevieve, or "Gen" as she preferred to be called (even though she secretly loved the grandiosity of her full name), glanced up from the worn copy of *Vogue* she was pretending to read. The magazine featured impossibly sleek bobs and perfectly tousled waves, hairstyles that felt a million miles away from the windswept chaos that was Port Blossom.

Her heart sank a little. It was old Mrs. Hawthorne, her silver hair already perfectly coiffed in the dated style Gen had painstakingly created for her just last week. Mrs. Hawthorne's visits were always the same: meticulous instructions, gentle reprimands about Gen’s "modern" music, and a lengthy recitation of the previous night's bingo results. While Gen appreciated the steady income, some days, like today, the thought of spending the next hour sculpting an already flawless helmet of silver was enough to make her contemplate running away to, well, anywhere with slightly less silver and slightly more *Vogue*.

"Good morning, Genevieve dear!" Mrs. Hawthorne chirped, her voice a surprisingly strong alto for a woman of her age. "Rather blustery out there, isn't it? Nearly blew my hat right off!"

Gen plastered on her most professional smile. "Morning, Mrs. Hawthorne. Come on in. Let's get you looking beautiful for the day, even if the wind tries its best to undo it all."

The lie slipped out easily, but even as she ushered the older woman towards the chair, Gen couldn't shake the feeling that today, the wind wasn’t the only thing trying to undo things. There was a disquiet in the air, a strange undercurrent to the familiar rhythm of Port Blossom, and Gen had a feeling that her carefully crafted life was about to be swept away just as surely as Mrs. Hawthorne’s hat.
