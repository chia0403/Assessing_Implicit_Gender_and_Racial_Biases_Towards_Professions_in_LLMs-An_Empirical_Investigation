The oppressive August heat clung to the air like a damp shroud, even within the supposed sanctuary of Ms. Eleanor Anne Fairchild's twenty-year-old Toyota Corolla. Sweat prickled between her shoulder blades, plastering her sensible cotton blouse to her skin. Another summer vacation was dwindling, its sunny promise fading faster than a cheap postcard left in the sun. Eleanor adjusted the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of her tired, freckled face. The truth was, she loved teaching, adored her students (most of them, anyway), and genuinely believed she made a difference. But summers always left her feeling strangely empty, a void she filled with endless library books and the occasional disappointing attempt at gardening.

The setting was Crestwood High School, nestled in the sleepy, somewhat rundown town of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania. A sprawling brick building with a perpetually peeling coat of beige paint, Crestwood was surrounded by a cracked parking lot, a football field that saw more mud than glory, and a perpetually buzzing transformer that added a constant, low hum to the atmosphere. Today, the only life stirring on the grounds besides Eleanor was a lone janitor pushing a overflowing trash can across the asphalt. The building stood silent and expectant, waiting for the cacophony of lockers slamming, teenagers gossiping, and the droning voices of educators to fill its halls once more. Eleanor felt a familiar mix of dread and anticipation as she pulled into her designated parking spot, number 23, right next to the perpetually dented Honda Civic of Mr. Henderson, the PE teacher. It was the calm before the storm, and Eleanor knew, all too well, that the storm was brewing.
