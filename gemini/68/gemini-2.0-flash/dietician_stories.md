## The Story Opening:

The low hum of the refrigerator was practically a lullaby in the otherwise silent apartment. Dr. Eleanor Anne Vance sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It was 3:17 AM. Again. The neon glow of the clock mocked her from the microwave display. She'd been staring at it for the last twenty minutes, willing it to rewind, willing herself back to sleep. But sleep was proving elusive, haunted by the phantom taste of stale, mass-produced pizza and the ghost of her most recent patient’s desperate, hopeful face.

Eleanor pushed herself up, the threadbare floral sheets clinging to her like a remorseful lover. Maybe some herbal tea would help. Or maybe, just maybe, she needed to break her own cardinal rule: no professional work after ten PM. But Mrs. Gabble’s food diary – a chaotic scrawl of processed snacks and sugary drinks – was beckoning from the kitchen counter like a siren's song.

Eleanor knew she shouldn't. But knowing and doing were two very different things, especially when her patient's health, and perhaps even her life, hung precariously in the balance.

## The Setting:

Eleanor's apartment was a small, two-room affair nestled on the third floor of a creaky brick building in the heart of Baltimore's Hampden neighborhood. The neighborhood itself was a vibrant tapestry of quirky boutiques, vintage shops, and the ever-present aroma of freshly brewed coffee. But Eleanor's corner of it felt quieter, more secluded.

The apartment reflected Eleanor's practical, slightly overworked nature. It was clean and organized, but undeniably lived-in. Books on nutrition, anatomy, and psychology lined the shelves, interspersed with the occasional dog-eared paperback mystery. The walls were painted a calming, albeit slightly faded, shade of sage green. A worn, but comfortable, armchair sat beneath a window overlooking a small, overgrown courtyard. The kitchen was small but functional, dominated by a large, stainless steel refrigerator filled with fresh produce, lean proteins, and meticulously portioned containers of pre-cooked meals – a constant reminder of the life she preached, and often struggled to fully embody.
