## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, clawing at the windows of the First National Bank Building. It was late November in Chicago, the kind of bone-chilling day that made even the pigeons huddle for warmth on the concrete ledges. Inside, the grand lobby, all marble and brass, hummed with the muffled energy of commerce, but the air, despite the forced-air heating, still held a faint undercurrent of winter's breath.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Margaret Evelyn Dubois' sensible heels echoed faintly against the linoleum as she hurried down the narrow, fluorescent-lit hallway on the 27th floor. She was late. Again. And Mr. Abernathy, bless his cotton socks but curmudgeonly soul, did not tolerate tardiness. Margaret clutched the steaming coffee cup in her gloved hand, hoping its warmth would thaw the anxiety knotting in her stomach. Last night's mahjong game with Mrs. Petrovsky had run a little long, fuelled by gossip and lukewarm Earl Grey. Not that she regretted it; those evenings were her only escape from the relentless grind of filing, typing, and fielding Mr. Abernathy's increasingly bizarre requests. Today, she was certain, would be another test of her patience, and judging by the way the fluorescent lights were flickering ominously, her sanity. She just hoped the coffee hadn't spilled in her haste. A coffee-stained blouse was the last thing she needed on a day like today, especially with the annual Holiday Bazaar looming, a forced-fun exercise in corporate cheer that Margaret secretly dreaded more than a root canal.
