## The Opening

The antique brass telescope, usually trained on the distant constellation of Orion, now focused on the flickering streetlamp three houses down. Dr. Eleanor Vance, Clinical Psychologist, gripped the cool metal, her brow furrowed. It wasn't the odd way the light pulsed - like a dying firefly - that bothered her. It was the shadow. A shadow that didn't match the streetlamp's architecture. A shadow that stretched and writhed like something alive.

Eleanor sighed, pulling away from the telescope. Exhaustion clung to her like a shroud. Late nights with patients, grappling with the labyrinthine complexities of the human psyche, left her with little energy for late-night mysteries. But something about the way the shadow elongated, reaching towards the darkened window of the old Montgomery place, prickled at her instincts. Instincts honed by years of listening to the whispers of trauma and the screams of the silent wounds people carried.

She told herself it was just her overactive imagination, a side effect of her profession. After all, she treated paranoia for a living. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

## The Setting

Eleanor's home, a Victorian gingerbread house with a wraparound porch, sat perched on a gentle hill overlooking the quaint town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Havenwood was the quintessential New England town, picture-postcard perfect with its white picket fences, historical society meetings, and an unnervingly low crime rate. The town square boasted a charming bakery, a bookstore brimming with literary treasures, and, of course, Eleanor's office, nestled above a vintage apothecary.

The house, like Eleanor herself, was both beautiful and slightly eccentric. She’d inherited it from her grandmother, a renowned botanist with a penchant for the unusual. The rooms were filled with mismatched furniture, vibrant tapestries, and the lingering scent of dried herbs and potpourri. Books lined the walls, a testament to Eleanor’s lifelong love of learning and her deep understanding of the human condition. The garden, a riot of color and fragrance, was a haven for butterflies and hummingbirds, a stark contrast to the often-dark landscapes of the minds she navigated.

Havenwood was supposed to be a safe haven, a place of quiet predictability. But lately, the town had been feeling…different. A subtle unease had settled over the community, a disquiet that Eleanor sensed in her patients and even in the friendly greetings of the local grocer. And now, this unsettling shadow. The perfect setting, she thought grimly, for something truly sinister to take root.
