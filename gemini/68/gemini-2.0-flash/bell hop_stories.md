## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The Hotel Grand Imperial, a gilded cage of a place in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. Stepping inside was like walking into a time warp. The air hung heavy with the perfume of ancient money, the murmur of hushed conversations, and the lingering scent of lilies from the perpetually fresh floral arrangements that graced every polished surface. The lobby was a symphony of marble floors, crystal chandeliers, and plush velvet seating, all meticulously maintained to reflect an image of old-world elegance that was slowly, but surely, crumbling around the edges. Outside, the vibrant, chaotic energy of the Quarter pulsed, but inside, the Grand Imperial held onto its anachronistic grandeur with a desperate grip.

**Opening:**

The sweltering Louisiana heat clung to Elias Bartholomew Dubois like a damp shroud as he hauled yet another monogrammed Louis Vuitton trunk off the luggage cart and into the cavernous lobby of the Hotel Grand Imperial. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his crisp, though slightly frayed, uniform sleeve, trying not to let the weariness seep into his smile. He was a bell hop, and bell hops, particularly those at the Grand Imperial, were expected to exude an air of effortless charm and unwavering helpfulness, no matter how many cranky tourists they had to escort or how many overflowing suitcases they had to lug. This particular trunk, emblazoned with the initials "V.V.W." in ornate gold lettering, was remarkably heavy, even for a seasoned bell hop like Elias. He glanced up at the woman who'd emerged from the limousine, a vision in a flowing white linen dress and oversized sunglasses, radiating an aura of expensive ennui. She barely acknowledged him, her gaze fixed on the towering crystal chandelier that dominated the lobby. Elias sighed inwardly. Another guest who would undoubtedly expect him to know the history of every antique chair, the recipe for the perfect Sazerac, and the best place to buy a bespoke hat, all while simultaneously managing her luggage and maintaining a respectful distance. He straightened his shoulders, plastered on his most winning smile, and prepared for another day navigating the labyrinthine corridors and demanding clientele of the Hotel Grand Imperial. Little did he know, this particular "V.V.W." and her suspiciously heavy trunk were about to drag him into a mystery that would unravel the very fabric of the hotel's carefully constructed facade.
