## Story Opening & Setting

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic squeak of Mrs. Higgins’ ancient swivel chair was the soundtrack to another Tuesday morning. Eleanor Vance, Guidance Counselor at Crestwood High, barely registered it anymore. She was too focused on the list of students sprawled across her desk, each name a little paper weight holding down a potential crisis.  There was Marco’s sudden truancy, Chloe’s inexplicable drop in grades, and then, as always, the looming college application deadlines that threatened to turn every senior into a walking, talking stress ball. Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her perpetually messy bun.  She loved her job, she really did.  Helping these kids navigate the treacherous waters of adolescence felt…important. But sometimes, just sometimes, she wished she could trade her sensible flats for a pair of hiking boots and disappear into the wilderness, far away from the teenage angst and the echoing anxieties of their parents. The squeak, ever insistent, reminded her she wasn't going anywhere. Not yet.  Today, she had to help them build their rafts.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Crestwood High School, a sprawling, slightly dilapidated public high school in the fictional town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the rolling hills of western Massachusetts. The school building itself is a mix of red brick and faded grey siding, a testament to generations of underfunded budgets and hasty repairs.  Eleanor's office is a small, cluttered space on the second floor, tucked away in a quiet corner near the library. It's overflowing with college brochures, motivational posters (most of which are peeling at the edges), and stacks of student files that threaten to topple over at any moment.  A worn, floral-patterned armchair sits in the corner, offering a small oasis of comfort amidst the chaos. The window overlooks the school’s football field, usually buzzing with activity but currently dormant in the pre-dawn gloom of a chilly October morning. The air inside is perpetually thick with the scent of old paper, lukewarm coffee, and a faint undercurrent of teenage anxieties.
