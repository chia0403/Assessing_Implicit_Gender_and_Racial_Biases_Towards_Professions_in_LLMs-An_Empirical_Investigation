Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill clung to the air outside Mercy General Hospital in Willow Creek, Oregon. Fog, thick as cotton batting, hugged the ground, obscuring the already faded lines of the parking lot. The only color came from the flickering neon sign above the emergency room entrance, casting a weak, sickly green glow on the wet asphalt. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, sterile tune, a constant counterpoint to the low, anxious murmur of voices.

**Opening:**

Willow Creek's emergency room, even at 5:30 AM, was a controlled chaos. Amelia Rose Hayes, phlebotomist extraordinaire, navigated the tight corridors with practiced ease. She dodged a gurney being wheeled towards radiology, sidestepped a harried-looking nurse clutching a coffee cup, and exchanged a weary nod with the security guard at the triage desk. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun, felt the familiar knot of tension tighten in her shoulders. It was always this way before the sun fully broke. This liminal space, suspended between night and day, seemed to breed a specific brand of desperate energy.

Amelia pulled on a fresh pair of purple nitrile gloves and approached her supply cart, a rolling metal beast laden with vacutainers, needles, and tourniquets. Her gaze scanned the board outlining her morning assignments. Room 3 needed a STAT CBC and CMP. Great. Room 3 meant Mrs. Petrov, the notoriously difficult patient with vanishing veins and a sharp tongue. Amelia sighed, adjusted the name tag on her crisp, blue scrubs, and reminded herself that even the most challenging patients deserved her best. After all, it was just a little prick, and maybe, just maybe, it could help someone get a little bit better.
