## Story Opening:

The smell of ammonia and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume only appreciated by the truly dedicated. Eleanor Beatrice Finch, hairdresser extraordinaire and chronic worrier, squinted through the steam rising from Mrs. Higgins' head, a swirling nebula of caramel and ash blonde attempting to become something resembling “expensive honey.”

"Just a *touch* more gloss, dear," Mrs. Higgins crooned, her voice a syrupy drawl that could charm the birds from the trees, or, in Eleanor’s case, convince her to add just one more dash of the dreaded Violet Booster #7.

Eleanor knew she shouldn't. She’d added a dash already. Two dashes, if she was being honest with herself. But Mrs. Higgins was a longstanding client, a walking, talking advertisement for “Finch’s Fancies,” and frankly, a generous tipper. Plus, a little voice, a persistent gremlin whispering in her ear, chirped, "She'll leave. She'll go to that ghastly 'Snip-tastic' across the street."

Eleanor hated the gremlin.

She squeezed a minuscule amount of the purple goo onto her gloved finger. One tiny dot wouldn’t hurt, would it?

## Setting:

The scene unfolds inside "Finch's Fancies," a small, slightly cluttered hair salon nestled on a quiet corner of Primrose Lane in the quaint, postcard-perfect town of Willow Creek, Pennsylvania. Sunlight streams through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and reflecting off the brightly painted walls, a cheerful (if slightly overwhelming) shade of daffodil yellow.

Each station is a miniature shrine to a specific style icon: a faded photograph of Audrey Hepburn graces Eleanor’s station, while Marlene Dietrich stares haughtily from the station opposite. The floors are linoleum, patterned with a swirling design that resembles a kaleidoscope of spilled hair dye. Mismatched antique chairs line the waiting area, upholstered in fabrics that range from floral chintz to velvet brocade. The air is thick with the combined scents of hairspray, shampoo, and the ever-present undercurrent of Eleanor's anxiety. It's a place where gossip flows freely, secrets are whispered under the drone of the hair dryer, and where, for a brief hour or two, women (and the occasional brave man) can escape the mundane realities of Willow Creek and emerge, hopefully, feeling just a little bit more fabulous.
