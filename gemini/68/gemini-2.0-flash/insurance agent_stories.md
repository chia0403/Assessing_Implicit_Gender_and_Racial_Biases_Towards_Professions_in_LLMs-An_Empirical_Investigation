The lukewarm coffee stung Thomas Ashton's tongue as he navigated the labyrinthine hallways of Ashton & Associates, ironically his father's former firm. He hated the name. It smelled of old money and stale ambition, a potent combination that always made him itch. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grimy, gothic windows, leaving the endless rows of cubicles bathed in a perpetual twilight that mirrored his own professional malaise. Outside, the bustling heart of downtown Chicago pulsed with life, but inside, time seemed to tick slower, each stapled policy and whispered phone call a tiny weight pulling him further into the quicksand of mediocrity.

Thomas Ashton, Insurance Agent, felt about as far removed from the "Associate" part of the company name as a person could get. He longed to be a writer, a painter, a baker - anything but the man staring back at him in the mirrored surface of his computer screen, his tie slightly askew, his face etched with the early signs of impending burnout. Today, however, felt different. A new file sat squarely in the center of his desk, demanding attention like a screaming toddler. The name embossed on the cover wasn't just a name; it was a legend, a ghost whispered amongst the older agents: "Isabelle Moreau." This wasn't just another insurance claim. This was a whisper of something far more intriguing, and Thomas, for the first time in a long time, felt a flicker of genuine curiosity ignite within him.
