## Story Opening:

The papercut stung like a bee sting. Beatrice Eleanor Thorne, Senior Editor at the venerable but increasingly precarious publishing house of Thistle & Quill, pressed her thumb to her lips, a frustrated sigh escaping. It wasn't the pain itself – though that was annoying enough – it was the disruption. Disruption to the flow, to the process, to the frantic race against the deadline for the Spring catalogue.

Beatrice glanced up from the manuscript splayed across her mahogany desk, a manuscript she'd already wrestled with for weeks, bleeding red ink onto its overblown prose and tortured metaphors. *The Serpent's Kiss*, a historical romance that, if marketed right, could keep Thistle & Quill afloat for another quarter, maybe even two. But right now, all Beatrice felt was the dull throb in her thumb and a rising tide of despair.

She pulled a box of tissues towards her and dabbed at the tiny wound. Outside her office, the building hummed with the low thrum of frantic activity. Phones rang unanswered. Typewriters clacked with a nostalgic urgency. The air, thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, felt heavy, pregnant with the unspoken dread of a company teetering on the brink.

## Setting:

The offices of Thistle & Quill, established in 1888, occupy the fourth and fifth floors of a once-grand brownstone building on Lower Manhattan's Printing House Row. Time has etched its mark on the building; the ornate moldings are chipped and faded, the once-gleaming brass fixtures now dulled with age and neglect.

Beatrice's office, located on the south-facing side of the fourth floor, is a testament to the company's fading glory. Sunlight streams through the large, grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Her desk, a hulking antique inherited from a long line of Thistle & Quill editors, is covered in stacks of manuscripts, galley proofs, and rejection letters. A teetering tower of books threatens to topple at the slightest tremor.

A framed portrait of the company's founder, a stern-faced man with a walrus mustache, hangs on the wall behind her. His gaze, perpetually judgmental, seems to follow Beatrice around the room, a constant reminder of the high standards and even higher expectations she struggles to meet. Beyond her office window, the relentless clamor of the city provides a stark contrast to the quiet desperation brewing within Thistle & Quill's walls.
