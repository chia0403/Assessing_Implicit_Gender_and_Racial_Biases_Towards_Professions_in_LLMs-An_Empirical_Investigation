The relentless August sun beat down on Dwayne "Deuce" McAlister's neck, turning his sweat into a salty river that trickled down his spine. The air shimmered above the blacktop of State Route 22, blurring the already distant horizon into a hazy mirage. Deuce squinted, pushing his safety glasses further up his nose. He’d been laying asphalt since sunrise, the rhythmic thump and grind of the paver a constant, grating soundtrack to his existence.

The setting was the rural heart of Ohio, specifically a long, desolate stretch of SR-22 between the tiny, almost forgotten towns of Harmony and Liberty. The landscape was a tapestry of cornfields, bleached golden by the late summer heat, interrupted only by the occasional dilapidated barn clinging precariously to life and the somber, leafy embrace of ancient oak trees lining the roadside. The air was thick with the scent of hot tar, diesel fumes, and the faint, sweet perfume of ripening corn. Deuce, along with the rest of his crew from the Ohio Department of Transportation, were resurfacing this stretch of road, a vital but often overlooked artery connecting these small communities to the rest of the world. They were out here day after day, patching up the cracks and filling the potholes, battling the elements and the endless stream of passing vehicles that seemed oblivious to their efforts. This particular section of the road was notorious for its uneven surface and the dangerous blind curves, making Deuce and his crew’s work not just important, but potentially life-saving. And today, something felt... different. The air seemed heavier, the silence between the roaring trucks more pronounced, a subtle but unsettling premonition humming in the back of Deuce's mind.
