The squeak of Mr. Jonathan Thistlewick's rubber-soled shoes against the linoleum floor of Room 2B was a sound as familiar as his own heartbeat. It was seven-fifteen AM, and the pale, pre-dawn light struggled to penetrate the grimy windows of Pine Ridge Elementary School in Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania. Harmony Creek, a town clinging to the bottom slopes of the Allegheny Mountains, was picturesque in its way, all clapboard houses and maple trees, but a little down-at-the-heels, like a favorite sweater worn too often.

Room 2B, Jonathan's second-grade domain, mirrored the town's quiet dignity and faded charm. Heâ€™d inherited the room from Mrs. Abernathy, a legend in Harmony Creek, and had tried, with limited success, to bring it into the 21st century. Faded construction paper cutouts of dinosaurs still clung to the corkboard, their edges curling despite his best efforts. The alphabet frieze, slightly askew above the whiteboard, had been hand-painted in 1987, according to a faded inscription on the back. Even the scent of the room - a peculiar mix of stale glue, chalk dust, and vaguely antiseptic cleaner - seemed to whisper tales of generations past.

Jonathan surveyed his kingdom. The twenty-four miniature desks, each meticulously lined up, stood empty and expectant. Soon they would be filled with the whirlwind of laughter, questions, and the occasional unexplained eruption of glue-related chaos that defined a typical Tuesday in Room 2B. He adjusted the wilting sunflower on his desk, a gift from little Lily Mae Jenkins, whose mother had been convinced sunflowers brought good luck. Jonathan chuckled softly. He could certainly use some luck today. Today was standardized testing day. And Jonathan Thistlewick, despite his best efforts to impart a love of learning, knew in his heart that more than a few of his second-graders were about to embark on a journey through a labyrinth of multiple-choice questions that would leave them more confused than informed.
