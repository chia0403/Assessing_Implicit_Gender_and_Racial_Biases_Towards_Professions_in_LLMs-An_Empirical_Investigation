## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering fluorescent lights of the Nightingale Ward cast long, skeletal shadows across the sterile floor. The scent of antiseptic, stale coffee, and a hint of despair hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail in this chronic care facility. It was 2:47 AM on a Thursday, the kind of pre-dawn hour where the city outside held its breath, and the only sounds were the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the occasional, weary sigh from a sleeping patient. The air conditioning, set too high as always, hummed a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to the quiet battle being waged between life and death.

**Opening:**

Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the nursing station, mimicking the turmoil churning in Amelia Grace Harding's stomach. She chewed absently on the end of her pen, her gaze fixed on the patient chart in front of her, but her mind miles away. Mrs. Gable in room 302 was rapidly declining, her breaths shallow and rattling, and Amelia felt a familiar, unwelcome knot tightening in her chest. She'd grown accustomed to loss over her years as a registered nurse, but that didn't make it any easier. Each passing was a small, sharp pain, a reminder of the fragility of life and the limitations of her own abilities. She glanced at the digital clock blinking red on the wall, then back at the chart. Time, it seemed, was running out for both Mrs. Gable and Amelia's shift. And tonight, it felt like time was running out for something more than just a single patient. A low hum resonated through the ward, a sound Amelia instantly recognized, sending a shiver down her spine. It wasn't just the rain; it was the aging generator kicking into gear, a harbinger of the coming power outage and the chaos it would unleash on Nightingale Ward.
