Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a nutritionist named Eleanor Vivian Finch:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun cast long, golden rays across the sprawling vegetable gardens of "Heartwood Health Retreat," nestled deep within the rolling hills of Sonoma County, California. Lavender bushes, thick with buzzing bees, lined the gravel paths, their scent mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly tilled soil. Heartwood was a haven for stressed-out CEOs, burnt-out entrepreneurs, and anyone else willing to pay a hefty sum to reconnect with themselves (and their digestive systems). Its rustic-chic cabins, yoga studios, and meticulously crafted farm-to-table meals were designed to cleanse both body and soul.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Vivian Finch, her crisp linen shirt slightly rumpled after a long day of lecturing on the microbiome, stood at the edge of the herb garden, a pair of pruning shears dangling from her hand. The air, thick with the promise of evening, carried the faint sound of a didgeridoo from a sunset meditation session in the adjacent meadow. Eleanor sighed, a weary sound that seemed to carry the weight of countless kale smoothies and lectures on the perils of processed sugar. She was a nutritionist, a damn good one if she did say so herself, yet lately, she felt more like a therapist for anxieties manifesting as dietary restrictions. Another guest had demanded almond milk so "organic it practically sprouted diamonds," and Eleanor had reached the end of her rope. Tonight, however, she wasn't thinking about organic almonds or stressed-out clients. Tonight, she was focused on the drooping basil plant in front of her and the nagging feeling that something wasâ€¦ off. Not just with the basil, which clearly needed more sun, but with Heartwood itself. There was a subtle dissonance, a disharmony hidden beneath the veneer of wellness, and Eleanor, with her keenly observant eye and intuition honed by years of listening to bodies (and their complaints), was beginning to sense it.
