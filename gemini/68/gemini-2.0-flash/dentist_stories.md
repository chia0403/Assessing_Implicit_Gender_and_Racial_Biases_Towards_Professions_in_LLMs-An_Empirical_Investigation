Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a dentist as the main character:

**Setting:** A bustling, yet somehow charming, dental office in the heart of Savannah, Georgia, called "The Smiling Oak Dental." The building itself is a two-story Victorian, painted a cheerful butter yellow with bright white trim. A porch swing hangs lazily on the front porch, and potted magnolias perfume the air with their heady scent. Inside, the waiting room is a symphony of calming blues and greens, with comfortable armchairs, antique side tables holding stacks of outdated magazines, and a bubbling fish tank providing a hypnotic background hum. The treatment rooms are meticulously clean, state-of-the-art, and designed to minimize any sense of clinical coldness with warm lighting and soothing artwork depicting Georgia landscapes.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth smoothed down the crisp linen of her lab coat, a familiar knot tightening in her stomach. It wasn't the root canal scheduled for 2 PM that had her on edge, though those always required a deep breath and a steady hand. No, it was the letter, tucked safely away in the top drawer of her roll-top desk, that was gnawing at her. A letter postmarked from Dublin, Ireland, and addressed in a script that both thrilled and terrified her. Ellie glanced at the clock, the rhythmic tick-tock a mocking countdown. Ten minutes until Mrs. Higgins, her first patient of the day, was due. Ten minutes to mentally prepare for a day of fillings and fluoride, and to push the swirling anxieties back down where they belonged. She adjusted the porcelain cherub perched on her desk, a small, superstitious ritual, and took a deep breath of the magnolia-scented air. Savannah was good at secrets. Maybe she could keep hers buried just a little longer.
