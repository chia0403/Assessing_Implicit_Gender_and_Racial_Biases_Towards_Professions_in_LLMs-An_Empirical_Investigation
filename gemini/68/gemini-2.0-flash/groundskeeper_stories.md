## The Story Opening:

The pre-dawn air clung to the manicured lawns of Haverbrook Estate like a damp shroud. Dew, thick as melted butter, coated the grass, reflecting the faint, ghostly glow emanating from the mansion's upper windows. Elias Thorne, his breath clouding the still air, leaned against the ancient oak that served as the estate's silent sentinel. He tugged at the brim of his worn tweed cap, the fabric smelling faintly of fertilizer and damp earth. A lone owl hooted, its call echoing through the meticulously sculpted topiary garden.

Elias frowned. The hoot soundedâ€¦ wrong. Distressed, almost. He'd lived on Haverbrook Estate his entire life, had been its groundskeeper for the past twenty years, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. He knew every nook and cranny of the sprawling grounds, every rustle of leaf, every chirp of cricket, every haunting cry of the resident owl. This was different. Something was amiss, and Elias felt a familiar, prickling unease settle in the pit of his stomach. An unease that had haunted him since the new owner, the enigmatic Ms. Seraphina Blackwood, had arrived six months ago.

## The Setting:

**Haverbrook Estate**, a sprawling manor house nestled in the rolling hills of the English countryside. Steeped in history, the estate boasts manicured lawns, a sprawling rose garden, a dense and ancient woodland, and a mysterious, overgrown topiary garden said to be over a hundred years old. The manor house itself is a gothic masterpiece, with soaring turrets, stained-glass windows, and a labyrinthine layout that has seen generations of Haverbrooks, and now, the enigmatic Ms. Blackwood. The atmosphere is one of quiet grandeur and a lingering sense of secrets, both living and long buried.
