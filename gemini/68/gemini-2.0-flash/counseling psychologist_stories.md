Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:**

The setting is a Victorian-era house, carefully converted into a private practice in the upscale neighborhood of Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia. The building is stately, with a red brick fa√ßade softened by climbing ivy and wrought-iron window boxes overflowing with vibrant impatiens. Inside, the waiting room is painted in calming shades of sage green and furnished with comfortable, antique chairs and a mahogany side table laden with current issues of *The New Yorker* and *Psychology Today*. Sunlight streams through the large, lace-curtained windows, creating a peaceful, almost reverent atmosphere. Her office, just off the waiting room, is equally serene, featuring a plush velvet chaise lounge, a well-stocked bookshelf, and a large, antique desk cluttered with files, a porcelain lamp, and a small framed photograph of the Grand Canyon.

**Story Opening:**

Rain lashed against the bay window of her office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Abigail Ainsworth's latest patient. Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a reputation for empathy and unwavering patience, leaned forward slightly, her gaze steady and encouraging. The rhythmic drumming of the rain against the glass seemed to amplify the silence hanging in the air. Across from her, Mr. Peterson, a man whose shoulders appeared permanently stooped under the weight of some unseen burden, wrung his hands, the knuckles white. "I just... I don't know what to do, Doctor," he finally choked out, his voice thick with despair. "It feels like I'm drowning." Eleanor took a slow, deliberate breath, allowing the silence to linger a moment longer. Her intuition, honed by years of listening to the fractured narratives of troubled souls, told her there was more to Mr. Peterson's despair than he was willing to reveal. "Tell me about the drowning, Mr. Peterson," she said softly, her voice a calming balm against the storm raging both outside and within him. "Tell me everything."
