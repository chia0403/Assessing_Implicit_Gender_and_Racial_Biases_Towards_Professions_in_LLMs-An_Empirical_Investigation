Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The stale fluorescent hum of Superior Tax Solutions buzzed in Beatrice Ainsworth's ears, a familiar drone that signaled the start of another beautiful day. Or rather, another day of deciphering W-2s, sweating over Schedule Cs, and praying to the IRS gods that no one's deduction for a "therapy alpaca" would trigger an audit.  Beatrice took a long, fortifying sip of lukewarm coffee, the taste doing little to dispel the creeping dread that always accompanied the approach of April 15th.  Outside, the Seattle rain pattered against the plate glass window, a monotonous rhythm that mirrored the beat of her own weary heart.  Today, she had Mrs. Henderson's mountain of receipts to conquer, Mr. Nguyen's meticulously kept (but utterly baffling) ledger, and a growing pile of panicked voicemails to return.  Just another Tuesday in tax hell, thought Beatrice, as she adjusted her reading glasses and braced herself for the coming onslaught.

**Setting:**

*   **Location:** A small, slightly rundown strip mall in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. Specifically, the office of Superior Tax Solutions.

*   **Description:** Superior Tax Solutions is a one-room office, crammed with filing cabinets overflowing with documents and tax forms. The walls are a drab beige, attempting to be brightened by generic motivational posters depicting eagles soaring and slogans about "achieving your financial dreams." The furniture is a mix of mismatched hand-me-downs. Beatrice's desk, the largest in the room, is cluttered with tax preparation guides, calculators, a half-eaten bag of pretzels, and a perpetually ringing phone. A small, worn rug partially covers the linoleum floor, attempting to soften the clinical atmosphere. The air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee, printer toner, and a faint undercurrent of quiet desperation. A single, perpetually struggling spider plant hangs precariously from the ceiling. The overall feeling is one of organized chaos, a testament to the controlled panic of tax season.
