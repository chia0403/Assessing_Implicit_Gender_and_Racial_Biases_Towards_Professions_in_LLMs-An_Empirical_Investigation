The fluorescent hum of the office lights was a constant, buzzing lullaby for Agnes Penelope Plumtree, bookkeeper extraordinaire. It hummed over the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard, the rustle of receipts she meticulously filed, and even the faint, persistent ringing in her ears that she blamed on the aforementioned lights. Agnes’s sanctuary was, ironically, the small, windowless office tucked away in the back of "Petals & Provisions," a quaint, but perpetually chaotic, flower shop and artisan bakery on Willow Creek’s main street.

Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of the rolling Pennsylvania countryside, was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else, and gossip bloomed faster than the prize-winning roses Mrs. Abernathy grew down the road. It was a place where life moved at a slower, more deliberate pace, where front porches were still used, and where the biggest scandal in recent memory involved the mayor’s questionable use of grant money for a new statue of a squirrel holding an acorn. 

But Agnes, despite living in Willow Creek for the past thirty years, had always been more comfortable with numbers than with narratives. While the town thrived on interpersonal connections, Agnes preferred the concrete logic of debits and credits. She found solace in spreadsheets, a sense of accomplishment in balancing the books down to the very last penny. And at Petals & Provisions, amidst the fragrant chaos of lilies and lavender, sourdough and shortbread, Agnes Penelope Plumtree was the anchor, the calm, calculating force that kept the entire operation afloat. Today, however, the hum of the fluorescent lights seemed louder than usual, and even the comforting click-clack of her keyboard couldn’t quite drown out the unsettling feeling brewing in her stomach. Something wasn't adding up. And Agnes Penelope Plumtree, a woman who lived by the numbers, knew that feeling all too well.
