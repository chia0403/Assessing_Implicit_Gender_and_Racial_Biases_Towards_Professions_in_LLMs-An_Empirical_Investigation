The rain, a greasy sheet clinging to the neon-slicked streets of Little Saigon, was doing its best to wash away the day's grime and secrets. Arthur Theodore Finch, a man who made a living unearthing the latter, shivered and pulled his trench coat tighter. He stood across from the dimly lit "Golden Dragon" restaurant, its window a kaleidoscope of garish reds and yellows, and felt the chill seep into his bones, a constant companion since the divorce.

His office, a cramped, second-floor walk-up above a dusty pawn shop two blocks away, offered no respite from the city's persistent dampness. The walls, once a cheerful cream, were now stained with years of cigarette smoke and coffee spills, mirroring Arthur's own gradual decline from optimistic rookie cop to jaded private eye. A single, bare bulb hung precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered desk, littered with unpaid bills, half-eaten takeout containers, and the cold case files he swore he'd crack one day. The only splash of color came from a faded photo taped to his monitor: a younger, smiling Arthur, arm-in-arm with a woman whose name he now struggled to remember.

He took another drag from his cigarette, the ember a tiny beacon against the oppressive darkness. The rain intensified, turning the city into a blurry, impressionistic painting. Across the street, the door to the Golden Dragon opened, and a lone figure emerged, pulling their collar high against the downpour. Arthur Theodore Finch straightened, the familiar thrum of adrenaline momentarily warming his icy veins. This was it. This was the beginning.
