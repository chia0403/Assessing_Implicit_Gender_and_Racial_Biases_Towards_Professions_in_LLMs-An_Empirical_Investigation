Okay, here's a story opening and setting, introducing our main character:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange orb, slanted through the bamboo blinds of the 'Kairos Wellness Studio' in the heart of Portland's Hawthorne district.  The air, thick with the calming scents of lavender and sandalwood, hummed with the barely audible drone of a nearby streetcar.  Outside, the sounds of bicycle bells and snippets of overheard conversations ("...organic kombucha..." "...ethical clothing...") drifted in, a gentle urban lullaby. The studio itself was a carefully curated haven of tranquility: exposed brick walls painted a soothing cream color, a small trickling fountain in the corner, and soft, ambient music playing at a barely perceptible level. Woven rugs from Morocco adorned the polished concrete floor.

**Story Opening:**

Cordelia Mae Beaumont smoothed the crisp, white linen sheet on the massage table, a habitual motion that both calmed her and ensured absolute perfection.  Even after seven years of practicing massage therapy, she still took immense pride in preparing her space.  Today's final client, a new referral from a local yoga studio, was due to arrive in ten minutes.  Cordelia took a deep breath, the familiar blend of essential oils grounding her.  She wasnâ€™t nervous, not exactly. But there was always a flicker of anticipation before a new client, a wondering about the story their body held, the tension they carried, and how, with her hands, she could help them release it.  The rhythmic drumming of her fingers on the edge of the table broke the silence.  She glanced at the clock, a sleek, minimalist piece of art that felt strangely out of place against the backdrop of the studio's intentional imperfection. 4:56 PM. Just enough time to refill the small, stoneware bowl with Himalayan salt rocks.  She turned, her movement fluid and graceful, the quiet confidence of a woman comfortable in her skin radiating from her like the gentle heat of a hot stone.
