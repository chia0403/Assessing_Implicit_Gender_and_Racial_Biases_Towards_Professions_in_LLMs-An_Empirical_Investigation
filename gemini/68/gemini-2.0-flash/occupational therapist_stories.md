The insistent beeping of the heart monitor was a jarring counterpoint to the soft, watercolor hues of the sunrise painting the walls of room 312. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne, Occupational Therapist, stifled a yawn and tightened the knot of her messy bun. She'd been up most of the night, charting progress and troubleshooting equipment failures – the perils of a grant-funded study on adaptive technology for stroke survivors. This morning felt heavier than usual, weighed down by the quiet desperation that often clung to these hospital corridors like the antiseptic smell.

The setting was the neurological rehabilitation wing of St. Jude's General Hospital in the bustling, somewhat gritty city of Detroit, Michigan. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the Detroit River, usually a source of solace for Eleanor. Today, though, the shimmering water just seemed to amplify the feeling of being stuck, of being a tiny cog in a machine that moved too slowly.

St. Jude's, with its labyrinthine hallways and perpetually lukewarm coffee, was a far cry from the idyllic image Eleanor had conjured during her idealistic OT school days. Yet, despite the institutional drabness, a palpable sense of hope resonated within its walls – a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the tireless dedication of its staff. Eleanor, with her empathetic gaze and unwavering belief in the power of small victories, was a vital part of that hope. And today, she had a feeling she was going to need every ounce of it.
