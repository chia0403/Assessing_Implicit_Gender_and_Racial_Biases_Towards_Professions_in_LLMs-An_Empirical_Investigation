## Story Opening:

The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of rain against the corrugated iron roof was a lullaby only if you were already asleep. For Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, it was a relentless drumbeat amplifying the emptiness of the abandoned mill. She chewed nervously on the end of her pen, the bitter taste of the plastic a poor substitute for the nicotine she was desperately trying to quit. Outside, the wind howled through the shattered windows, carrying with it the damp scent of rotting wood and somethingâ€¦ else. Something that prickled at the back of her neck.

She glanced at her watch. 1:17 AM. Three hours she'd been sitting in this godforsaken place, waiting for a ghost. Or, more accurately, waiting for irrefutable evidence of a ghost. Tonight was supposed to be the night. Tonight, she was going to break the biggest story of her career and finally escape the obituaries desk at the *Bay Harbor Beacon*.

But the only thing she'd broken so far was her resolve to stay awake.

## Setting:

The setting is the **abandoned Blackwood Textile Mill**, located on the outskirts of the small, isolated coastal town of Bay Harbor, Maine. The mill, a sprawling, multi-story structure built in the late 19th century, has been derelict for over fifty years. It stands on a small rise overlooking the turbulent waters of the Atlantic, the sea constantly threatening to reclaim the crumbling foundations.

Inside, the mill is a labyrinth of decaying machinery, collapsed floors, and graffiti-covered walls. Rust coats everything, and the air is thick with the smell of mold, dampness, and the ghosts of long-gone workers. Rain leaks through the damaged roof, creating puddles that reflect the faint moonlight. The silence is punctuated only by the wind, the creaking of the building, and the occasional scuttling of unseen creatures.

The mill holds a dark history, riddled with rumors of industrial accidents, unfair labor practices, and even a supposed suicide in its early days. Local legend claims the spirits of the mistreated workers still haunt the building, their mournful cries echoing through the empty halls. These rumors, initially dismissed as folklore, have recently gained traction due to a string of unexplained events, including strange noises, flickering lights, and whispers heard only in the dead of night. This resurgence in paranormal activity is what brought Eleanor Vance to the mill, armed with her notebook, a voice recorder, and a healthy dose of skepticism she was desperately hoping to shed.
