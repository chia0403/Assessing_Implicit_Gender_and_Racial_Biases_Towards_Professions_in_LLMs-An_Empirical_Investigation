## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and cheap printer ink hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Leonard Archibald Penwright. Outside, a Thursday afternoon threatened to erupt into a storm, the grumbling sky mirroring the tempest brewing in his own gut. Leonard tapped a perfectly manicured finger against the spreadsheet on his screen, the numbers blurring before his tired eyes. Forty-seven thousand, three hundred and eighty-two dollars and twelve cents. The same sum that had been taunting him for the last three days, a digital phantom refusing to be reconciled.

He knew, deep down, that the problem wasn't with the figures themselves. The numbers, as always, were honest. The problem was where those numbers *should* be. According to every calculation he could devise, forty-seven thousand, three hundred and eighty-two dollars and twelve cents was simplyâ€¦missing. And not in a "lost in the couch cushions" sort of missing. More like a "vanished into thin air, leaving behind only the lingering scent of impending doom" kind of missing.

Leonard took another gulp of his lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to soothe his frayed nerves. His boss, Mr. Henderson, a man whose jowls quivered with disapproval at even the slightest deviation from the norm, was due back from his golf outing any minute. And Leonard, a man whose very existence revolved around order and precision, had absolutely no explanation for this financial black hole that threatened to swallow him whole.

## Setting:

Leonard Penwright works as a Senior Accountant at **Henderson, Finch & Bartlett, Chartered Accountants**. The office, located on the 7th floor of a nondescript office building in downtown **Middleton, Ohio**, is a study in beige. Beige walls, beige carpets, beige cubicles, even the staplers seem to be a shade of beige. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, leaving the fluorescent lights to cast a harsh, clinical glow over the rows of desks. The atmosphere is perpetually hushed, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards and the occasional sigh of overworked employees. Leonard's cubicle, nestled near the back of the office, is meticulously organized, a tiny island of order in a sea of quiet desperation. He keeps a small, framed photograph of his prize-winning begonias on his desk, a splash of color and life in the otherwise monochromatic world of Henderson, Finch & Bartlett.
