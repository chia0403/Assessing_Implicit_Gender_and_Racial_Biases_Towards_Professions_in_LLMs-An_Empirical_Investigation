The biting wind, laced with the metallic tang of the incoming tide, whipped strands of Amelia Grace Hardingâ€™s auburn hair across her face. She tucked them behind her ear, the movement exposing the worn leather strap of her watch, the face still glowing faintly green from the last call. It was 3:17 AM on a Tuesday, and Amelia was perched precariously on the edge of the weathered seawall, a thermos of lukewarm coffee clutched in her gloved hands.

The setting was Port Blossom, Maine, a picturesque town nestled on the rugged coast, where the rhythm of life was dictated by the ebb and flow of the ocean. In the summer, tourists flocked to its charming shops and clam shacks, but in the dead of winter, it was a stark, unforgiving place, haunted by the ghosts of fishermen lost at sea and the mournful cry of gulls. The small, brick-built ambulance station, affectionately known as "Medic One," was the only sign of life this early, its lone light cutting a yellow swath through the inky blackness. Amelia, fresh off a twelve-hour shift, was just trying to catch a moment of peace before heading home to her cramped apartment above the bakery, the lingering scent of yeast and sugar doing little to mask the lingering smell of antiseptic and adrenaline that clung to her skin. This was her sanctuary, this cold, windswept seawall, the only place where the ceaseless urgency of her job could momentarily fade into the vast indifference of the ocean. She just hoped it would last long enough to gather her strength for whatever the next call might bring.
