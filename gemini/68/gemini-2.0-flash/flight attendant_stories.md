## Story Opening:

The turbulence hit like a grumpy giant shoving the 777 around. "Fasten your seatbelts," the pilot's voice crackled over the intercom, a strained calm woven into its timbre. For most passengers, this was a moment of white-knuckle anxiety, a silent plea for a smooth landing. For Eleanor Beatrice Finch, however, it was Tuesday.

She'd seen worse. Much worse. Like the time a chihuahua escaped its carrier and went rogue in the first-class cabin, attempting to mate with a very expensive Louis Vuitton handbag. Or the time a passenger, convinced he was a reincarnated Elvis Presley, tried to lead the entire plane in a singalong of "Hound Dog" mid-Atlantic.

Eleanor, with fifteen years of flying experience etched into the fine lines around her eyes, held onto the galley counter, her posture betraying none of the instability surrounding her. She took a deep breath, mentally running through her emergency procedures, not because she needed to, but because the rote repetition calmed her. Besides, a calm flight attendant was a reassuring flight attendant, and reassuring flight attendants were worth their weight in gold - or at least, in overpriced airplane peanuts.

## Setting:

The story is set on **Flight 347 from London Heathrow to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).** The year is 2024.

The interior of the Boeing 777 is typical of long-haul flights: a sea of plush, slightly worn-looking seats bathed in the unnatural, always-slightly-too-bright glow of the cabin lights. Overhead screens are playing a re-run of a popular sitcom, but most passengers are plugged into their own devices, cocooned in their own little worlds. The air smells faintly of re-circulated oxygen, jet fuel, and the lingering scent of the duty-free perfume samples that Eleanor had sprayed earlier to combat the stale atmosphere.

Outside, the jet is bucking its way through a particularly nasty patch of air over the North Atlantic, somewhere between Greenland and Iceland. The vast expanse of dark, churning ocean lies far below, a silent, indifferent witness to the drama unfolding within the metal tube hurtling through the sky. The weather radar painted a mosaic of ominous greens and yellows, hinting at the even nastier conditions yet to come.
