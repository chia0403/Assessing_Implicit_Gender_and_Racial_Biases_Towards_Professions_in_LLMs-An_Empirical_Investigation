The biting wind whipped across the exposed fields, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks red and threatening to tear the wool hat right off his head. He squinted against the swirling snow, his breath pluming out in frosty clouds, and cursed under his breath. It was barely mid-October, and already Winter was tightening its icy grip on Thorne Valley Farm. He’d rushed the harvest, working from dawn until well after dusk, fueled by cold coffee and sheer stubbornness, but he still wasn’t finished. A good portion of the squash patch remained untouched, buried beneath a thin, deceptive layer of white.

Thorne Valley Farm wasn't much to look at. A rambling, two-story farmhouse, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, stood sentinel on a gentle rise overlooking the patchwork of fields. A dilapidated barn, patched with more sheet metal than original wood, groaned ominously in the wind. A rusting tractor, affectionately nicknamed "Bessie" despite its temperament that more closely resembled a rabid badger, sat parked near the barn, its engine coughing and sputtering defiance at the approaching blizzard. 

The farm, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, had been in Elias's family for generations. He could practically taste the history in the soil - the sweat and tears of his ancestors who had carved a life out of the unforgiving landscape. He wasn’t about to let it go, not without a fight.

He tugged his gloves tighter, the worn leather offering little warmth. "Alright, Bessie," he muttered, slapping the tractor's hood. "Let's get those squash in before we're all buried alive."
