The late August sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned bakery like a vengeful god, turning the metal into a sizzling griddle. Sweat beaded on the forehead of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, blurring his vision as he hauled another roll of tar paper up the precarious ladder. The ladder itself was a rusty relic, more rust than ladder actually, procured from a salvage yard five years ago and held together with a prayer and duct tape. Bart didn't particularly like ladders, or heights for that matter, but Bartholomew Finch didn't particularly like starving either. And roofing jobs, even dilapidated, abandoned bakery roofing jobs, put bread on his table.

The setting was Harmony Creek, a forgotten town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, where the only harmony came from the crickets chirping in the oppressive summer heat. The bakery, Mrs. Higgins' Sweet Surrender, had been the heart of Harmony Creek once, its windows filled with sugared donuts and freshly baked pies. Now, it was a hollow shell, its windows boarded up, its sweet scent replaced by the musty odor of decay and the persistent drip of rainwater seeping through the neglected roof. Bart had been contracted by a mysterious out-of-towner, someone who'd bought the property sight unseen, promising to restore it to its former glory. Bart wasn't holding his breath. Harmony Creek didn't have much glory left to restore.
