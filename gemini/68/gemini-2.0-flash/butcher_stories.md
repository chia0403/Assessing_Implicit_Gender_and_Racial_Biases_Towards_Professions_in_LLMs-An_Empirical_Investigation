Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of a butcher as the main character:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped through the narrow, cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a village nestled on the edge of the Blackwood Forest.  Houses huddled close, their thatched roofs dusted with a fine layer of early morning frost.  Steam billowed from crooked chimneys, carrying the scents of woodsmoke and brewing coffee.  The year is 1888. Oakhaven was known for two things: its hardy sheep and the grim tales whispered about the creatures lurking in the ancient, whispering woods.

**Opening:**

Ebenezer Blackwood, his breath clouding in the frigid air, unlocked the heavy oak door of "Blackwood & Son, Purveyors of Fine Meats."  The sign above the door, faded and slightly askew, was a relic of a time when Ebenezerâ€™s father, Arthur, had been a partner and the business was thriving. Now, Ebenezer ran it alone. The chill of the November morning seeped into the shop, a familiar and unwelcome guest. He fumbled with the key, his large, calloused hands, more accustomed to cleavers than small metal objects, struggling with the lock. Inside, the familiar aroma of sawdust, cured meats, and a faint, underlying metallic tang hung heavy in the air. A single ray of sunlight, piercing through the grimy front window, illuminated the dust motes dancing in the stillness, a scene almost as still and silent as the village cemetery. Ebenezer knew he needed to build up the fire in the stove, but the first item of business on his list was to clean the blood splatter from the wall from last night's butchering.
