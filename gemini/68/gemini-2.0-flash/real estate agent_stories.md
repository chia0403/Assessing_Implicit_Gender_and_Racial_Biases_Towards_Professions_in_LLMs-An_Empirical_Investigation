Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and main character introduction:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of lavender and lingering old money hung heavy in the air of the Gilded Age mansion. Constance Albright, a wisp of a woman dressed in sensible beige linen, trailed a manicured fingernail along the mahogany banister. It felt cool and smooth beneath her touch, a subtle invitation into the buildingâ€™s opulent past. Today, that past was about to become someone's future, assuming she could convince them the drafty rooms and leaking roof were "charming quirks" and not deal-breakers.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Newport, Rhode Island. The time is the present day, but the narrative often dips into the history and grandeur of the Gilded Age mansions that line Bellevue Avenue. The focus is initially on "Seaview," a sprawling, albeit dilapidated, mansion overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The house is a prime example of turn-of-the-century excess, boasting intricate carvings, towering ceilings, and a ballroom that could host a small army. However, time and neglect have taken their toll. The paint is peeling, the gardens are overgrown, and a general air of faded glory permeates the estate. Newport itself, despite its touristy veneer, still holds onto a sense of old wealth and whispered secrets.

**Main Character:**

**Full Name:**  Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth

**Occupation:** Real Estate Agent. Eleanor works for a boutique agency specializing in historic properties in Newport. She has a keen eye for detail and a genuine appreciation for the architectural beauty of the mansions, but also possesses a pragmatic understanding of the realities of the modern market. She is in her late 30s, intelligent, and slightly cynical, with a dry wit that often masks a deeper idealism about preserving the past.
