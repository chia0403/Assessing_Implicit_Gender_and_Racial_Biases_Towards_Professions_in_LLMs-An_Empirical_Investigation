The scent of warm cardamom and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a comforting cloud that clung to everything in the small bakery – the chipped Formica countertops, the worn linoleum floor, even the perpetually flour-dusted apron of Esmeralda Beatrice Bellweather. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful song, rattling the frosted glass of the window display, but inside, Esmeralda hummed along to the crackly Billie Holiday record on the old radio, a small sanctuary against the approaching winter. The bakery, "Bellweather's Blissful Bites," was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Washington, a place where the fog rolled in off the Puget Sound like a spectral blanket and secrets settled as thick as the drizzle. Esmeralda, with her perpetually rosy cheeks and a dusting of flour that seemed permanently etched onto the bridge of her nose, was as much a fixture of Port Blossom as the lighthouse that stood sentinel on the cliffs overlooking the water. Today, however, a different kind of unease churned within her, a feeling far sharper than the usual pre-holiday baking frenzy. A new postcard had arrived that morning, slipping silently through the mail slot and whispering a name she thought she'd buried deep within the doughy, comforting heart of her baking… a name that threatened to unravel everything she held dear.
