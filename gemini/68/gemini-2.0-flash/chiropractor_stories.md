The air in the waiting room was thick with the scent of lavender and muted anxieties. Amelia Grace Lancaster surveyed the scene with a practiced eye, noting the woman clutching her lower back, the teenager fiddling with her phone, and the older gentleman who seemed to be asleep, slumped in his chair like a deflated soufflé. It was a Tuesday afternoon in Harmony Creek, Iowa, and Amelia’s practice, “Lancaster Chiropractic & Wellness,” was in full swing.

Harmony Creek itself was the quintessential Midwestern small town, a postcard picture of picket fences, friendly waves, and a deep-seated belief in the power of a good casserole. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, which could be both a blessing and a curse. Amelia had moved here five years ago, seeking a slower pace of life after the relentless hustle of Chicago. She found it, alright. Sometimes a little too slow.

Lancaster Chiropractic & Wellness was nestled in a converted Victorian house on Main Street, painted a cheerful shade of yellow that was a direct affront to the beige conformity that seemed to dominate the surrounding buildings. Inside, the house retained its quirky charm, with creaking floorboards, stained-glass windows, and a comforting aroma of peppermint oil and liniment. It was Amelia’s sanctuary, a place where she could use her skills to ease pain, improve lives, and hopefully, occasionally, convince people that cracking their knuckles wasn't the end of the world. She sighed, adjusted the angle of the sunflower arrangement on the reception desk, and braced herself for the next patient, hoping it wasn't Mrs. Higgins again, and her endless stories about her prize-winning petunias.
