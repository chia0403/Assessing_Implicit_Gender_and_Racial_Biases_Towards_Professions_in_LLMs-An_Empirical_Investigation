The aroma of crayon wax, disinfectant wipes, and something vaguely sweet, like leftover birthday cake, hung in the air of Room 4B at Sunnyside Elementary. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a cheerful counterpoint to the controlled chaos of the art table. Mrs. Eleanor Amelia Hawthorne, a woman whose laughter lines were etched deeper than the wrinkles around her eyes, surveyed her domain with a practiced calm. Tiny hands, sticky with glue and glitter, flitted around, creating masterpieces â€“ or, at least, what kindergarteners perceived as masterpieces.

Today, Eleanor was attempting to teach the concept of "still life" to her rambunctious group. A bowl of lopsided apples, a slightly bruised banana, and a wilting daisy sat perched on a checkered tablecloth, a stark contrast to the vibrant, imaginative artwork blooming around it. Eleanor hoped at least one child would capture the essence of the exercise, the simple beauty of everyday objects. But, as she watched little Leo attempt to eat the banana, she suspected she might be fighting a losing battle. The bell was due to ring in fifteen minutes, signaling the end of art and the beginning of the much-anticipated free play, and Eleanor knew those fifteen minutes would feel like an eternity.
