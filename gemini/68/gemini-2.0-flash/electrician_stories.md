## Opening:

The smell of burnt ozone hung thick in the air, stinging Elias Thorne's nostrils. He coughed, the taste acrid on his tongue, and squinted through the gloom. A single, battery-powered lantern cast a meager circle of light, barely illuminating the rat's nest of wires spilling from the gutted electrical panel. He ran a calloused hand through his already disheveled brown hair, leaving a smudge of grime across his forehead. “Well, that’s just great,” he muttered, his voice rough from the dust and the lingering fear that had spiked through him moments earlier.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne was knee-deep in the basement of the Oakhaven Historical Society, a Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning gray waters of Lake Erie. The basement itself was a labyrinth of damp stone walls, cluttered with forgotten artifacts and the ghosts of bygone eras. Cobwebs hung like macabre tapestries, clinging to dusty mannequins dressed in period clothing and to shelves overflowing with chipped porcelain dolls that seemed to follow him with their glassy, unblinking eyes.

The air was heavy with the scent of mildew, musty paper, and something indefinably…old. The only sound besides Elias’s heavy breathing was the drip, drip, drip of water echoing from somewhere deeper within the maze, a relentless rhythm that chipped away at his nerves. This wasn't just any electrical job; this was a favor for Mrs. Hawthorne, the Society's president and a woman who could guilt-trip a saint into wiring her gazebo with neon pink Christmas lights. He should have said no. He *really* should have said no. But the promise of a sizable donation to the local animal shelter – and Mrs. Hawthorne's thinly veiled threat to "mention his... eccentricities to the mayor" – had sealed his fate. Now, here he was, wrestling with a panel box older than he was, in a basement that felt like it had been ripped straight from the pages of a Stephen King novel. And something was definitely wrong. Beyond the faulty wiring, beyond the creepy atmosphere, there was a palpable sense of…being watched.
