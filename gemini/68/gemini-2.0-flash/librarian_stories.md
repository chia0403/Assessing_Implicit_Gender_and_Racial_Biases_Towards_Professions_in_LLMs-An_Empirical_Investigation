The scent of aging paper, leather balm, and a hint of lavender always calmed Eleanor Maeve Abernathy. It was the signature aroma of the St. Augustine Historical Society Library and Archive, and after fifteen years spent within its hallowed halls, it had become synonymous with "home" for Eleanor. Outside, the relentless Florida sun beat down on cobblestone streets, turning tourists into lobster-red wanderers. But inside, cool air circulated, a gentle hum emanated from the dehumidifiers, and dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the tall, arched windows.

The library itself occupied the top floor of the historic Spanish colonial building. High ceilings, lined with dark wooden beams, soared above rows upon rows of meticulously organized shelves. Each shelf was labeled in elegant, faded gold lettering, indicating the subject matter within: *Local Histories*, *Maritime Records*, *Genealogy*, *Rare Maps*. At the far end of the room, a massive oak desk, worn smooth by generations of researchers, stood sentinel, piled high with books awaiting cataloging. This was Eleanor's domain, her sanctuary, and her responsibility.
