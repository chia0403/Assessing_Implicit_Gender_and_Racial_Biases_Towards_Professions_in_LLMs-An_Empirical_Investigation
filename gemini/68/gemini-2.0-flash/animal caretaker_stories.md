## Opening:

The first whiff of dawn always smelled the same at the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary: a potent mix of damp earth, pine needles, and, depending on the wind, a healthy dose of badger musk. For Clara Beatrice Finch, it was the smell of home. It was the smell of purpose, of fur and feathers, of the rhythmic thrumming of life that resonated in her soul. This morning, however, there was an undercurrent she couldn't quite place, a high-pitched anxiety that prickled at the back of her neck like static electricity. Even before her boots crunched on the gravel path towards the raptor enclosure, she knew something was wrong. The usually boisterous morning chorus of the resident crows was muted, replaced by an uneasy silence.

## Setting:

**Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary** sprawled across a hundred acres of rolling hills in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It was a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, ranging from tiny field mice to majestic birds of prey. The sanctuary consisted of a cluster of sturdy, rustic buildings: a main clinic with examination rooms and surgery suites, a research lab humming with sophisticated equipment, and a series of interconnected enclosures tailored to the specific needs of each animal. 

**Clara's Quarters**, a small but cozy cabin nestled amongst the pines at the edge of the property, was her sanctuary within the sanctuary. Filled with well-worn books on animal behavior, half-finished embroidery projects depicting local fauna, and the comforting scent of lavender and beeswax candles, it was a space of calm and quiet reflection.

**The Raptor Enclosure**, where Clara would spend most of her mornings, was a vast, aviary-like structure designed to mimic a natural forest environment. Towering trees provided perches for the hawks and owls, while a babbling brook trickled through the center, offering a source of fresh water. This morning, however, the scene was unsettlingly still.
