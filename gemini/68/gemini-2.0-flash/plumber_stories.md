The wrench slipped, the knuckles on Elias Thorne's left hand catching hard against the corroded brass elbow. A string of curses, born of decades battling the city's geriatric plumbing, escaped his lips, mingling with the hiss of escaping steam. He sucked air through his teeth, glaring at the offending pipe. It wasn't just old, it was spiteful.

The setting was the bowels of the Grand Majestic Hotel, a gilded cage built in 1908 and riddled with pipes that seemed to predate civilization. Elias had been called in to deal with a particularly nasty geyser erupting from a showerhead on the tenth floor, threatening to turn a room rented by some oil baron into a miniature indoor swimming pool. Down here in the basement, though, time seemed to move differently. The air was thick with the scent of mildew, rust, and the faint ghost of forgotten feasts. Pipes snaked across the low ceiling like metallic pythons, dripping intermittently onto the damp concrete floor. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow that did little to dispel the gloom. It was a world of shadows and echoing drips, a world Elias knew better than his own living room. A world where a plumber named Elias Thorne could truly feelâ€¦needed.
