Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a school psychologist:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic squeak of the fluorescent lights felt like a personal mockery to Dr. Eleanor Vance. It was the Thursday before Thanksgiving break, a day typically filled with paper turkeys and the sugar-fueled antics of children anticipating four days of freedom. Instead, Eleanor was staring at the faded, nicotine-stained tiles of her office floor, trying to unravel the knot forming in her gut. Mrs. Gable, the sixth-grade English teacher, had just left, her face etched with a worry that mirrored Eleanor’s own. The boy was quiet, withdrawn, even for him. And his drawings… they weren't childish expressions of holiday cheer. They were dark, intricate, and unnervingly fixated on sharp objects. Eleanor rubbed her temples, a familiar ache blossoming behind her eyes. Another case, another child teetering on the edge. She just hoped, this time, she could pull him back.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Maplewood Elementary School**, a brick building nestled in the quiet, working-class town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Maplewood is a place of routine and modest resources. The classrooms are functional but worn, the playground equipment is faded, and the air perpetually smells faintly of disinfectant and cafeteria food. Eleanor's office, Room 112, is a small, boxy space tucked away near the library. It's furnished with a mismatched collection of hand-me-down furniture: a worn armchair with floral upholstery, a sturdy oak desk overflowing with files, and a brightly colored rug featuring cartoon animals that is more optimistic than the room's atmosphere often warrants. A window looks out onto the school's basketball court, but Eleanor usually keeps the blinds half-drawn, preferring the dim, artificial light to the harsh glare. The walls are decorated with motivational posters (a little too cheerful for her taste) and children's artwork – a rotating gallery curated from the work of her students, a visual reminder of the young lives she strives to help. The overall feeling of the space is one of quiet desperation, a haven carved out in a place that is in constant flux.
