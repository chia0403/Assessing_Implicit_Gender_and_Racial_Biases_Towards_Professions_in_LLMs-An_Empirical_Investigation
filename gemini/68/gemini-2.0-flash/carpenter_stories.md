The damp chill of a November morning seeped through the gaps in the workshop’s corrugated iron roof, clinging to the air like a mournful spirit. Elias Thorne, his breath puffing out in white clouds, rubbed his gloved hands together, the calluses on his palms rasping like dry leaves. Sawdust, illuminated by the pale, watery sunlight filtering through the grime-covered windows, danced in the air like tiny, golden motes.

The workshop, situated on the outskirts of the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, was Elias’s sanctuary and his prison. For three generations, the Thorne family had worked wood here, their hands shaping it into everything from fishing boats to intricate furniture. The scent of cedar, pine, and oak permeated the air, a comforting aroma that spoke of history, tradition, and Elias’s complicated legacy. The tools hung neatly along the walls, each one a testament to years of use and meticulous care: hand planes worn smooth with countless passes, a brace and bit glinting under the weak light, and a collection of chisels sharpened to razor perfection.

Elias, forty-two years old and carrying the weight of more than just timber on his broad shoulders, was a man of quiet habits and even quieter sorrows. He wasn’t built for the solitude that carpentry demanded, but it was a solitude he craved nonetheless. He ran his hand over the smooth surface of a half-finished rocking chair, the wood cool beneath his touch, and sighed. Today, he wasn't crafting something practical or beautiful. Today, he was building a box. A box that felt far too much like a coffin.
