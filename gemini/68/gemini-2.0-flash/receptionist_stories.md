## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a constant reminder of the endless cycle of Mondays. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth adjusted the lapel of her navy blazer, a silent battle against the growing tendrils of boredom threatening to engulf her. Outside, the Seattle sky was doing its usual impression of a perpetually overcast day, mirroring the somewhat dismal mood that permeated the offices of "Stratton & Hayes, Legal Eagles with Bite," as the obnoxious advertising campaign had branded them. Eleanor had seen better days, and she’d definitely heard better slogans. She stifled a yawn, reaching for her lukewarm cup of Earl Grey, the only thing standing between her and succumbing to the siren call of cat videos on her phone. As if summoned by her thoughts, the double doors to the elevator *dinged* open, and Eleanor straightened, plastering a professional smile onto her face.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the lobby of Stratton & Hayes, a mid-sized law firm located in the heart of downtown Seattle. The lobby is a study in modern corporate aesthetics: cool greys, brushed steel accents, and expensive abstract art that no one, including Eleanor, truly understands. A low, grey sofa sits opposite the reception desk, flanked by sleek glass coffee tables displaying perfectly arranged issues of *Forbes* and *The Economist*. The reception desk itself is a monolithic structure of dark wood, its surface kept meticulously clean except for a strategically placed vase containing a single, stark white orchid. Behind Eleanor, a large, illuminated sign proclaims the firm's name in elegant, sans-serif lettering. The overall impression is one of professional efficiency and understated wealth, a carefully curated image designed to inspire confidence in prospective clients. While the atmosphere is undeniably sophisticated, it also feels sterile and impersonal, a reflection of the often cutthroat world of corporate law that unfolds beyond the polished façade.
