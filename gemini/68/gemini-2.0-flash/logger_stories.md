## The Opening

The whine of the chainsaw bit into the crisp morning air, a high, sharp sound that echoed through the skeletal branches of the winter-stripped forest. Jebediah Isaac Tanner, his breath puffing out in white clouds, leaned into the shuddering weight of the saw, guiding it through the thick trunk of the ancient pine. The saw bucked, a familiar dance, and Jebediah swore under his breath, a low rumble swallowed by the drone of the engine. He adjusted his grip, his calloused hands tightening around the vibrating steel, and pressed onward, the scent of resin and sawdust filling his nostrils. The wood finally gave way with a groan, and the giant swayed, hesitated for a heartbeat, and then crashed to the earth with a deafening thud that shook the very ground beneath Jebediah’s boots. He cut the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the frantic beating of his own heart. It was a good fall. Clean, efficient. No widow-makers hanging precariously in the surrounding trees. But as he stood there, amidst the scattered snow and broken branches, a prickle of unease ran down his spine. It wasn't the usual apprehension that came with felling such giants. This felt…different. Like the forest itself was holding its breath, watching him with unseen eyes.

## The Setting

The setting is the rugged, isolated wilderness of the Cascade Mountains in Western Washington State. It's late January, deep in the heart of winter. Snow blankets the ground in a thick, uneven layer, punctuated by the dark green of the surviving evergreens. The air is biting, carrying the promise of more snowfall, and the sun, when it manages to break through the dense cloud cover, offers little warmth.

Jebediah works a small, independent logging operation on a section of land his family has worked for generations. The land is a mix of old-growth forest, scarred clear-cuts from past logging seasons, and steep, treacherous slopes. The nearest town, Darrington, is a small logging community a good hour's drive away, accessible only via a winding, poorly maintained mountain road. It's a hardscrabble life, a life of physical labor and constant danger, but it's the only life Jebediah has ever known, and a life he clings to with a stubborn, almost primal, devotion.
