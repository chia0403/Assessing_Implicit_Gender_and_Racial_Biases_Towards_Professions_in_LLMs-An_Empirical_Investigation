The rain was relentless, a steel-grey curtain blurring the neon glitz of Neo-Tokyo outside the panoramic window. Amelia Hayes-Goldberg, Vice President of Strategic Acquisitions for OmniCorp, barely noticed. She was too busy wrestling with the knot in her stomach, a feeling as persistent and unwelcome as the damp chill seeping through the reinforced glass. The OmniCorp Tower, a gleaming obsidian monolith that pierced the clouds, was supposed to be a symbol of success, of power. Tonight, it felt like a cage.

Her office, on the 88th floor, was designed to impress. Polished chrome and simulated wood dominated the minimalist space, accented by a single, carefully cultivated bonsai tree struggling to thrive under the artificial sunlamps. A holographic projection of real-time global market data flickered silently across the far wall, a constant, distracting reminder of the billions of credits Amelia was responsible for managing. It was a far cry from the dusty, book-lined office sheâ€™d envisioned for herself back in university. She had wanted to be an archaeologist, uncovering forgotten histories. Instead, she unearthed market vulnerabilities and engineered corporate takeovers.
