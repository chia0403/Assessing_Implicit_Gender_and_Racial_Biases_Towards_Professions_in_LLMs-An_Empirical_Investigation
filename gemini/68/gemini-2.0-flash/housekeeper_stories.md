**Story Opening:**

The chipped Delft Blue tile bit into Agnes Penelope Cartwright's kneeling knee, but she didn’t flinch. Pain was an old friend, a familiar ache alongside the constant thrum of anxiety that came with cleaning up after the Vandergelt family. Today’s mess, however, surpassed even the usual level of aristocratic disregard. Champagne corks littered the Persian rug like drunken soldiers, and a half-eaten plate of canapés, swarming with miniature fruit flies, clung precariously to the edge of the marble coffee table. Agnes sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous drawing room, and reached for a discarded feather boa, wondering just how much longer she could endure this particular brand of opulent chaos.

**Setting:**

**The Vandergelt Estate, "Oakhaven Manor," in the Hudson River Valley, New York, late 1930s:**

Oakhaven Manor was a Gothic Revival behemoth, built on a bluff overlooking the Hudson River. Gargoyles leered from the eaves, and stained-glass windows cast kaleidoscopic patterns across the polished floors. Inside, the house was a museum of questionable taste: heavy velvet drapes, ornate furniture that looked more like torture devices, and portraits of stern-faced Vandergelt ancestors lining the walls, their painted eyes seeming to follow Agnes as she worked. The air was thick with the scent of beeswax polish, expensive perfume clinging to the upholstery, and the ever-present, faint undercurrent of decay that seemed to seep from the very stones of the aging mansion. The grounds were meticulously manicured, featuring rolling lawns, a rose garden, and a winding path that led down to the riverbank. But even the beauty of the natural surroundings couldn't quite dispel the feeling of oppressive weight and unspoken secrets that permeated Oakhaven Manor.
