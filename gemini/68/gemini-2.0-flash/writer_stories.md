The clatter of Mrs. Henderson's tea trolley was a symphony of discomfort for Arthur Benedict Finch. Every chipped porcelain cup, every rattling sugar bowl, felt like a tiny hammer blow against his already throbbing temples. The seaside air, thick with the scent of brine and deep-fried fish, did little to soothe him. In fact, it only served as a pungent reminder of his self-imposed exile.

Arthur, a writer of moderately successful, yet critically despised, romantic comedies, had fled London two weeks ago in a fit of pique. A particularly brutal review in *The Literary Gazette* had painted his latest offering, *Love, Lobsters, and Legal Briefs*, as "a saccharine-drenched assault on the English language." He needed to escape, to regroup, to find inspiration that didn't involve improbable meet-cutes and witty misunderstandings at lobster festivals.

His escape had led him to the tiny, windswept village of Saltburn-on-Sea, nestled precariously on the Yorkshire coast. He'd taken a room at the Seafoam Inn, a place that boasted "charm, character, and a surprisingly persistent smell of damp." The inn was a faded tapestry of floral wallpaper, creaking floorboards, and the aforementioned Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose smile seemed permanently stuck halfway between a greeting and a grimace. The only redeeming quality was the view from his window: a vast, turbulent expanse of grey ocean that stretched to the horizon, occasionally punctuated by the mournful cry of a seagull.

This was it. This was where Arthur Benedict Finch, purveyor of palatable pap, would find his muse, his voice, hisâ€¦ well, something other than a talking chihuahua named Mr. Snuggles who dispensed romantic advice. He just hoped it wouldn't take too long. Mrs. Henderson's tea was beginning to taste suspiciously of floor polish.
