The dust swirled, a rusty-red halo around the beat-up Dodge Ram, momentarily obscuring the harsh Montana sun. Jebediah "Jeb" Calhoun squinted, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by decades of unforgiving weather and even more unforgiving decisions. He killed the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the drone of cicadas hidden amongst the parched sagebrush. This was it. The back forty. Or rather, what was *supposed* to be the back forty. Right now, it was more like the back *nothin’*.

The setting was the vast, arid landscape of eastern Montana, specifically, the sprawling Calhoun Ranch, a spread that once boasted rolling fields of golden wheat and healthy herds of Hereford cattle. The year was 2024. Drought, like a relentless desert phantom, had been stalking the land for the past five years, turning fertile pastures into cracked earth and sucking the lifeblood out of the family legacy. Jebediah, the last of the Calhouns with a real grit for the land, felt the weight of generations settling heavily on his slumped shoulders. He climbed out of the truck, the dry air immediately clinging to him like a shroud. The ghosts of promises broken and dreams withered seemed to whisper on the wind, a constant, mournful lament that echoed in the vast emptiness of his failing ranch. He’d come here to assess the damage, or what little remained of it. He knew deep down it wasn’t going to be pretty.
