The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of petunias and desperation, a particularly potent combination that morning. Sweat already plastered strands of auburn hair to Eliza Mae Harding's forehead, even though the sun was barely cresting over the manicured hedges of the sprawling estate. Eliza, owner and sole employee of "Harding's Habitats," crouched low, wrestling a stubborn rhododendron into a freshly dug hole. She muttered a string of apologies to the bruised plant, her gloved hands careful despite her mounting frustration. This was her third, and hopefully last, rhododendron of the day. Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman whose garden was only slightly less intimidating than her bank account, insisted on a symmetrical display, and apparently, Eliza's measurements weren't quite up to par.

The setting was the Vandergelt Estate, nestled in the exclusive enclave of Willow Creek Heights. It was a place where lawns were greener than money, and the only things that grew faster than the hydrangeas were the anxieties of the homeowners. The Vandergelt property was a showcase of old money and meticulously curated beauty. Wrought iron gates guarded a winding driveway that led to a sprawling Victorian mansion with a wraparound porch and a rose garden that could rival Versailles. Ancient oak trees cast long shadows across perfectly striped lawns, dotted with carefully placed sculptures and bubbling fountains. It was the kind of place where dandelions were considered a personal affront and weeds were spoken of in hushed, horrified tones. It was also Eliza's biggest, and arguably, most demanding, client. This morning, it felt less like a garden and more like a battlefield.
