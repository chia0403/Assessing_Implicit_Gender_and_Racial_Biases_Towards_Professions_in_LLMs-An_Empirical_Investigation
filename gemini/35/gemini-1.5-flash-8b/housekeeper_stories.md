The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey by decades of lukewarm water and forgotten teaspoons, reflected Elara Nightingale’s weary face.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the air, mimicking the frantic flutter of her own heart.  The grand, echoing halls of Blackwood Manor, usually a symphony of rustling silks and polished mahogany, were now eerily silent, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall – a constant, insistent metronome marking the passage of a time she desperately wanted to escape.

Elara Nightingale, housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past twenty-seven years, stood hunched over the sink, scrubbing a stubborn stain from the bottom of a silver tray.  It was a task she’d performed countless times, yet tonight, the stain seemed to writhe and resist like a trapped spirit. Tonight, something felt different, a prickling unease that ran deeper than the usual chill of a November wind.

The manor, built on a rise overlooking the whispering woods of Ashdown, had always felt like a heavy cloak draped over her life.  Its opulence was a cruel parody of the meager existence she led in the attic bedrooms.  Yet, she knew its secrets as well as she knew the constellation patterns etched into the worn wooden floorboards.  A life lived in the shadows of grand expectations. A life lived on the edge of a forgotten secret.
