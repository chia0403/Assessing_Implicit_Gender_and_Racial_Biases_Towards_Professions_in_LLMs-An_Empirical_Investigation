The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped around Elias Thorne, carving icy patterns into the already grey stone of the quarry.  Dust, fine as powdered granite, swirled in the air, stinging Elias's eyes and coating his thick leather apron in a film of grit.  Sunlight, a pale ghost, barely pierced the swirling clouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the vast expanse of the quarry.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and the metallic tang of freshly broken stone, clung to Elias like a second skin.

This wasn't the pristine, carefully manicured quarry of the elite.  This was the Heartstone, a place of raw power and brutal beauty, where the veins of the earth ran wild and the stones, stubborn and defiant, fought against the very forces of creation.  Elias, a stone cutter for nearly two decades, knew the heart of the Heartstone intimately.  He could feel the pulse of the stone beneath his hammer, hear the whispers of the ancient earth in the groaning of the rock face.  His life, like the stone itself, was carved by the rhythms of this brutal, unforgiving landscape.
