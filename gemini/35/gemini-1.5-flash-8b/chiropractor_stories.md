The fluorescent hum of the waiting room vibrated through Dr. Amelia Nightingale's bones, a low thrum that mirrored the anxieties she saw etched on the faces of her patients.  Rain hammered against the single pane window, mimicking the relentless pounding in her own head.  She traced the chipped paint on the wall, a faded mural of idyllic wildflowers, a stark contrast to the tense, skeletal figures hunched in the plastic chairs.  Amelia, a chiropractor with a practice tucked away on a quiet side street in the burgeoning suburb of Oakhaven, felt the weight of the city pressing down on her. Today, more than most days, it felt like a physical burden, a dull ache in her own back.

Oakhaven, once a sleepy collection of modest homes, had blossomed into a sprawling development.  Luxury estates jostled for space with new apartments, their gleaming exteriors reflecting the relentless sun.  But beneath the facade of progress, a different kind of tension coiled.  The hurried pace of life, the relentless pursuit of 'more,' had fractured the rhythm of the community.  People were stressed, their bodies betraying the sacrifices they made on the altar of ambition. Amelia's small practice, "Aligned Wellness," was a refuge, a quiet sanctuary in the storm.
