The chill of the early November air snaked through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of "The Butcher's Block," biting at Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's exposed cheeks.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering gaslight hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom.  Slaughterhouse smells, pungent and familiar, hung heavy in the air â€“ a symphony of blood, brine, and something akin to regret that Barty hadn't yet learned to ignore.  Outside, the rhythmic howling of the wind, amplified by the dilapidated brick building, echoed the frantic pulse in his own chest. Tonight, he wasn't just facing a typical Tuesday night. Tonight, he was facing a storm.

The small shop, tucked away on the shadowed edge of the city, was a testament to its own passing glory.  Once a bustling hub, a place where the smell of freshly butchered meat hung heavy with the chatter of the marketgoers and the clanging of knives on steel, it now stood as a silent mausoleum to a different era.  The gleaming steel of the counters and knives lay dulled, dulled by the years of neglect, reflecting the bleakness of the present.  Stacks of crates, once overflowing with glistening cuts, were now filled with the gathering dust of forgotten promises. Only the relentless chill of the old ice chest, the very essence of cold, unwavering purpose, remained as a constant in this crumbling landscape.
