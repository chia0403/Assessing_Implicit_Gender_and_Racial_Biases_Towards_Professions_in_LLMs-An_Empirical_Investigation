The biting wind whipped across the desolate, snow-capped peaks of the High Atlas Mountains, stinging Captain Elara Al-Rahman's cheeks as she wrestled the controls of the Zephyr 7.  Below, the jagged peaks of the mountain range stretched like a skeletal hand clawing at a bruised sky.  A thin veil of swirling snow obscured the valley floor, swallowing the distant village of AÃ¯t Bouguemez in a muted white.  Elara, a seasoned pilot with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hands as steady as granite, felt the familiar hum of the twin turbines as they strained against the unforgiving conditions.  Her mission, as always, was precarious.  The remote Berber community, nestled in the treacherous folds of the mountains, had once again been cut off.  The snow had swallowed the winding mountain pass, and their vital supply drops had been cancelled.  The Zephyr, her trusty steed, was the only link between the world and the villagers.  Elara knew that time was running out.
