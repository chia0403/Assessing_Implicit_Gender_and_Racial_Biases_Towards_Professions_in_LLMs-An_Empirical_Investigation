The chipped paint of the "Melody Moon" music hall clung to the humid air, a testament to years of smoky nights and whispered secrets.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a frantic percussion accompanying the anxious thrumming in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s chest.  She traced the faded floral pattern on the worn velvet seat, the scent of stale beer and cinnamon clinging to the air like a second skin.  Tonight, the Melody Moon held the fate of her career, and perhaps her future, in its leaky hands.  Elara, a singer with a voice as clear and powerful as a mountain spring, had poured everything into this one performance.  Her debut album, "Whispers of the Wildwood,"  had been met with a curious silence, and tonight was her chance to break through the stagnant air and find her audience.
