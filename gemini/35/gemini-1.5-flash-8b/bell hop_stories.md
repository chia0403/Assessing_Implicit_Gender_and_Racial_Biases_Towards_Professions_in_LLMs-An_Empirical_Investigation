The chipped Formica countertop of the Grand Magnolia Hotel's breakfast room reflected the hazy, pre-dawn light filtering through the grimy, floral-patterned drapes.  A single, sputtering fluorescent light hummed above, casting a sickly yellow glow over Reginald Bartholomew Pruitt, the bellhop.

Reginald, a lanky young man with eyes perpetually shadowed by fatigue, felt the familiar gnawing emptiness in his stomach.  Another slow, gray morning in Ashwood.
