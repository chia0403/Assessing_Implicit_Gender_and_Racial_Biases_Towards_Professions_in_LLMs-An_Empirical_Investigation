The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she wrestled the battered ambulance into the narrow, snow-packed lane.  The flickering sodium streetlights cast long, skeletal shadows across the frosted fields that surrounded the small, isolated town of Havenwood, a place where the rhythm of life seemed to slow to a glacial pace, even in the face of sudden, urgent emergencies.  Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a tapestry of weathered clapboard houses, each with its own unique story etched into the aged wood.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke, usually held a comforting warmth, but tonight, a bone-chilling cold clung to everything, mirroring the apprehension tightening in Amy's chest.  Her pager, a relentless metronome of beeping urgency, vibrated against her hip, counting down the seconds until her arrival at the scene.  The call had come in a short time ago, but the agonizing silence of the drive had already started to eat at her.  This wasn't her usual run-of-the-mill accident or illness, something felt profoundly off about this call.
