Professor Eleanor Vance, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest layer of forgotten chalk dust, stared out the grimy window of her office at the relentless grey London drizzle.  Rain lashed against the ancient panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her meticulously organized office, a haven of scholarly texts and overflowing bookshelves, felt strangely claustrophobic.  Ink-stained papers littered her desk, a testament to the unending revisions and re-evaluations of her groundbreaking thesis on the societal impact of Victorian-era wallpaper designs.  She ran a hand through her silver-streaked hair, a gesture both habitual and resigned.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain was a counterpoint to the frantic ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, a persistent metronome marking the relentless march of time and the mounting pressure on her.  The year was 1904.  London, shrouded in a perpetual twilight of fog and rain, held a particular brand of oppressive beauty, a backdrop to Professor Vanceâ€™s existential crisis.
