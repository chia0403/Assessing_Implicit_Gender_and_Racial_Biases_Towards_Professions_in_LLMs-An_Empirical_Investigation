The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny auto repair shop tucked between a struggling bakery and a dilapidated toy store.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through grimy windows, painted dancing patterns on the cluttered workbench.  Tools – wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers – lay scattered like fallen soldiers around Amelia "Ace"  Kingston, her name a testament to the grit and determination she poured into every job.  Ace, her forearms stained the shade of burnt umber, crouched beneath a sputtering Honda Civic, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The engine coughed, a ragged, wheezing beast.  Outside, the midday sun beat down on the dusty streets of Oakhaven, a town where time seemed to have slowed, leaving its residents stuck in a perpetual cycle of rusting cars and weary hopes.
