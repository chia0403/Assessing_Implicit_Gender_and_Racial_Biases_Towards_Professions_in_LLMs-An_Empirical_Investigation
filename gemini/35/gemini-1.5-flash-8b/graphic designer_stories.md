The fluorescent hum of the office buzzed, a constant, low thrum that echoed the relentless rhythm of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s thoughts.  Amelia, a graphic designer with a penchant for muted pastels and meticulously crafted typography, stared at the blinking cursor on her screen.  Across from her, stacks of rejected logos and brochures, each a silent testament to her creative struggles, towered like miniature, paper-mache mountains.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint aroma of printer ink, felt oppressive.

The office was a stark, rectangular box, the beige walls reflecting the harsh glare of the overhead lights.  Rows of identical cubicles, each a miniature prison of productivity, lined the space.  A single, large window, perpetually shrouded in dust-coated grime, offered a glimpse of a grey, overcast sky and a city that seemed to sleep under a perpetual haze.  A flickering, out-of-tune clock in the corner relentlessly ticked, each second a hammer blow against Amelia's already strained patience.  The city outside, reflected in the window's stained glass, was a muted impressionist painting of urban decay and forgotten dreams. Outside, the distant rumble of traffic suggested the life she yearned to capture in her meticulously designed images was relentlessly out of reach.
