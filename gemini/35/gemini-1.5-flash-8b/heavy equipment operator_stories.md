The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Badlands, stinging Elias Thorne's face.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled around the hulking Caterpillar D9R, its massive tracks churning the earth like a restless beast.  Sunrise bled across the jagged peaks, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched into the endless expanse.  Elias, his face weathered and tanned like ancient leather, gripped the joystick, his knuckles white.  The horizon, a bruised purple-grey, offered no solace, only the relentless reminder of the unforgiving landscape that was his domain.  He was alone, save for the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine, a constant, low heartbeat in the silent valley.  His task: to carve a new path through the heart of the Badlands, a path destined to change the lives of those who lived within, and perhaps even those who would follow.
