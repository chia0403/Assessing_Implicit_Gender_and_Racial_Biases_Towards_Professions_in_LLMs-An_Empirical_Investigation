Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Hayes's thoughts.  The small, unassuming building, nestled between a sprawling junkyard and a surprisingly vibrant flower market, housed more anxieties than patients.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a master's degree in biomechanics, meticulously adjusted the settings on the ultrasound machine, the flickering screen displaying a blurry image of a woman's knee.  Today's patient, a weathered farmer named Eleanor Vance, had complained of a persistent ache, a deep, throbbing pain that resonated in her bones, not just her joint. Amelia felt a prickle of unease.  The clinic,  a testament to its own stubborn resilience in a city constantly being reshaped, had seen its fair share of injuries â€“ broken bones, strained muscles, the usual wear-and-tear of a life lived hard. But Eleanor's case felt...different.  Something about the way she spoke of the pain, the way her eyes held a hint of something beyond the physical, sent a shiver down Amelia's spine.  The rain outside intensified, mirroring the unspoken tension filling the small examination room.
