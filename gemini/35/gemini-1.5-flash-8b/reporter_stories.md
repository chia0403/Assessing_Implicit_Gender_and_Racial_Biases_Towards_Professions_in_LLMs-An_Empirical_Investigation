The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Hayes, a reporter for the *Emerald Coast Chronicle*.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless rhythm of her frantic thoughts.  Outside, the deserted boardwalk, usually a vibrant artery of summer activity, felt like a graveyard.  Amelia huddled deeper into her threadbare raincoat, the cold seeping into her bones along with the rising dread.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy and oppressive.  She’d been chasing this story for three days, and now, with the city’s famed Seabreeze Festival cancelled, the only evidence she had was the chilling rumour spreading through the dwindling crowds:  the disappearance of the festival's famed seagull, Salty.
 
Amelia’s notebook, dog-eared and overflowing with scrawled notes, was her only companion.  The tiny, faded photograph of Salty, a magnificent white bird with a distinctive black wingtip, lay pressed between its pages.  This story was about more than a missing seagull.  It was about a town that felt strangely, unnervingly, empty.  And Amelia, despite the bone-deep chill and the gnawing fear, felt a strange compulsion to uncover the truth, however grim it might be.  She had to. This was her beat, her town.  This was *her* story.
