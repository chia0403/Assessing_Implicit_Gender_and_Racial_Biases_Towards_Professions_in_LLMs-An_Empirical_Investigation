The chipped paint of the "Artist's Retreat" sign, clinging precariously to its rusted metal frame, mocked the drizzle that plastered the cobblestones of Havenwood.  Rain hammered against the worn, leaded windows of Amelia Blackwood's studio, each drop a tiny, insistent percussionist beating out a melancholic rhythm against the backdrop of the dying afternoon sun.  Amelia, a portrait artist with a penchant for moody lighting and sorrowful subjects, hunched over her easel, the canvas draped in a protective charcoal-grey cloth.  Inside the cramped space, the air was thick with the scent of linseed oil and despair.  The studio, located in the heart of the winding alleyway that snaked through Havenwood's ancient quarter, was a kaleidoscope of half-finished paintings, discarded sketchbooks, and the ghosts of countless sittings.  Amelia's solitary existence, fuelled by the constant struggle to capture the intangible on canvas, felt as claustrophobic as the small, perpetually damp studio.
