The scent of mothballs and freshly-ironed linen hung heavy in the air of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's tiny, but meticulously organized, workshop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-streaked window, illuminating a stack of meticulously pressed velvet, a pile of finely woven silks the colour of a stormy sea, and a half-finished waistcoat, draped over a sturdy wooden mannequin.  Barty Butterfield, a tailor of unparalleled skill and dedication, worked with the quiet precision of a seasoned artisan, his nimble fingers tracing patterns on the fabric with a practiced grace.  He was, to be precise, a tailor of the most exacting sort, devoted not only to the craft, but to the ephemeral stories woven into each stitch, each buttonhole, each carefully selected thread.  Outside, the bustling marketplace of Veridian, a city of cobbled streets and towering spires, thrummed with the rhythmic clatter of carts and the boisterous cries of merchants.  Barty, however, was oblivious to the chaos; his world was contained within the four walls of his workshop, a sanctuary of quiet contemplation and exquisite craftsmanship.
