The biting wind whipped at Silas Blackwood's worn leather jacket, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the brim of his weathered hat.  He shivered, not just from the cold, but from the profound stillness of the forest.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, felt heavy, oppressive.  It was a stillness that held the weight of secrets, the whispers of ancient trees, and the silent promise of danger.  The sun, a pale disc hidden behind a curtain of grey clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced across the uneven terrain of the Redwood National Forest.  Silas, a seasoned logger with eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand felled trees and the scars of a lifetime spent battling the wilderness, surveyed the scene.  He was alone, as he often was, deep within the heart of the forest, his only company the rhythmic thump of his axe and the rustling of leaves under his boots.  Today, however, the rhythm was different.  Uneasy, almost frantic. This wasn't just another logging job.  This was something more. Something sinister.
