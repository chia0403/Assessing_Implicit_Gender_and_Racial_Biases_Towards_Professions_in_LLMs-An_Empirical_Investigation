The grey November sky, bruised and threatening, mirrored the mood in Elias Thorne's chest.  He squinted at the endless expanse of cracked asphalt stretching before him, the highway 127 snaking like a wounded serpent through the desolate landscape.  Dust devils, whipped up by a relentless wind, danced across the barren fields bordering the highway, their swirling shadows mocking the solitude.  He was alone, save for the rhythmic thrum of the jackhammer vibrating through his boots and the incessant shriek of the wind tearing at the flimsy tarpaulin shielding his makeshift shelter. Elias Thorne, highway maintenance worker, was not in a particularly good mood.  It had been raining steadily for three days, the ceaseless downpour turning the already-muddy shoulder of the highway into a quagmire.  His work boots were soaked, and the biting wind seemed to cut through the layers of his damp clothing.  The promise of a warm cup of coffee, a hearty meal, and a dry bed felt like a distant dream.
