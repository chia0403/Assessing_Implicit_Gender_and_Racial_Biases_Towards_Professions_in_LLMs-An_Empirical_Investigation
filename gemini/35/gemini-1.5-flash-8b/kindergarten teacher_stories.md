The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles" kindergarten classroom, a pastel yellow now faded to a sickly, apricot hue, reflected the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the window, illuminating a flurry of brightly colored paper scraps scattered across the floor.

Across the room,  Ms. Amelia Blackwood, the kindergarten teacher, knelt beside a small, trembling figure.  A tear, the size of a tiny pearl, traced a path down the cheek of a child named Leo.
