Her trench coat, perpetually damp from countless rain-soaked investigations, hung heavy on her frame.

Tonight, however, the air hung heavy with anticipation rather than anxiety.  Tonight, the silence was louder than any argument.  Tonight, the only hint of trouble came from the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the corner.
