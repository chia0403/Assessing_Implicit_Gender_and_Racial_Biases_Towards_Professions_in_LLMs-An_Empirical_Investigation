The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetually-damp rose, reflected Amelia Nightingale's anxious face.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windowpanes of the "Nail Nirvana" salon, cast long, distorted shadows across the small, cluttered room.  Clink, clank, the rhythmic sound of metal on nail file echoed through the air, punctuated by the occasional exasperated sigh from Amelia.

The salon, nestled in the heart of the bustling, grey concrete canyons of New Manchester, held a quiet hum of activity, a symphony of chattering clients and the sharp snip-snip of nail clippers.  But Amelia felt adrift in a sea of manicured hands and sculpted toes, her own hands trembling slightly as she meticulously trimmed a client's acrylic nails, each tiny movement a painful rehearsal of the day's impending disaster.
