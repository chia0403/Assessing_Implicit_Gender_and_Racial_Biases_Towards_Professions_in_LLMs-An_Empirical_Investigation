The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Amie" Hernandez's feet echoed through the cavernous studio, a soundtrack to the sweat-slicked floor and the panting breaths of her clients.  Sunlight, fractured by the towering windows, painted shifting patterns on the polished concrete, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  Amie, a whirlwind of emerald green athletic wear, moved with a practiced grace, her voice a clear, commanding tenor that cut through the murmur of exertion.  The studio, "Urban Flow," was a haven for stressed professionals, a sanctuary from the relentless demands of city life.  Each morning, Amie transformed the space into a crucible of controlled chaos, a place where bodies found release and minds found focus.  Today, a new wave of faces, faces etched with the familiar lines of city weariness, were ready to embrace the flow.
