The weight of the school year settled on her shoulders, a heavy cloak of unspoken worries and simmering tensions that echoed the muted drone of the old air conditioning system.  She sighed, a soft, almost imperceptible sound, a whisper against the stillness.  The silence hung in the air, thick and palpable, a prelude to what awaited her.
