The fluorescent lights of the Centennial Insurance Agency hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Hayes’ keyboard.  Rain lashed against the frosted windows of the second-floor office, mirroring the relentless drumming of deadlines in her head.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless policy documents, was drowning in a sea of paperwork.  Claims for leaky roofs and stolen bicycles, for damaged cars and tragically untimely accidents – it all felt the same under the glare of the stark fluorescent light.  Today, however, felt different.

Chrome-plated steel skeletons of forgotten factories scraped the grey sky, a stark contrast to the manicured lawns and stately homes clinging to the city's upper boundaries.  Oakhaven had weathered prosperity and decline, leaving behind a landscape of half-hearted ambition and lingering whispers of the past.  Amelia, however, was a creature of the present, focused on the bottom line, on the cold hard facts of damaged property and shattered dreams. Yet, a small, persistent voice whispered at the edge of her concentration, warning of something more profound than a simple claim—something… unsettling.
