The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of the Blackwood Forest.  Rain, relentless and icy, lashed against the corrugated metal roof of the Blackwood Station, mirroring the turmoil churning within Captain Amelia "Amy" Dubois.  The air inside the small, cramped station, usually filled with the comforting aroma of pine and the low thrum of engines, was thick with unspoken anxiety.  Amy, her boots already soaked through, paced the length of the dispatch room, her breath clouding in the frigid air.  The cryptic message, repeated over the crackling radio, was a chilling prelude to what she knew was a disaster waiting to happen deep within the shadowed heart of the forest.  It had started with a single, isolated report of a "fire in the woods", but the detail was missing the critical context.

The Blackwood Forest, a place of breathtaking beauty in the summer, was now a menacing labyrinth of tangled undergrowth and twisted, ancient trees.  A dense canopy of pine and fir choked the light, creating a perpetual twilight.  A network of narrow, winding paths, barely discernible in the gloom, crisscrossed the forest floor, the only signs of the human presence a crumbling ruin of a cabin and a weathered fire tower, perched precariously on a rocky outcrop, like a lonely sentinel overlooking the encroaching darkness.  The dense trees and thick undergrowth, usually a refuge from the relentless winter, were now a menacing shield, hiding whatever lay hidden within their depths.
