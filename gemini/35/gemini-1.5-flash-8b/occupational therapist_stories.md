Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Willowbrook Rehabilitation Centre," a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the rhythmic thumps in Amelia Blackwood's chest.  The air inside, despite the industrial-strength dehumidifiers, hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and something subtly metallic, like old pennies submerged in stagnant water.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak sunlight slicing through the grimy window.  Amelia, a physical and occupational therapist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless patient stories, sighed.  Another Monday. Another round of assessments, exercises, and whispered reassurances.  Willowbrook, nestled in the forgotten foothills of the Appalachians, was a place of both quiet desperation and quiet resilience.  The landscape outside, usually painted in muted autumnal hues, was shrouded in a perpetually damp grey, mirroring the pervasive atmosphere within.
