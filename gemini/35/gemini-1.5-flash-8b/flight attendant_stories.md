The fluorescent lights of the galley hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's anxieties.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and impending turbulence, mirrored the knot in her stomach.  Flight 742, bound for Santiago, was scheduled to depart in fifteen minutes, and Amelia, despite years of training and countless successful flights, felt a tremor of dread.  Not just any dread, but a specific, agonizing fear, clinging to her like the recycled air of the cabin.  She glanced at her reflection in the stainless steel sink, her carefully applied makeup seeming almost mocking.  Thirty-four years old, a career dedicated to service, and yet, for the first time in a long time, Amelia felt utterly, terrifyingly, alone.

The setting:  The cramped, pressurized galley of a Boeing 787, hours before dawn.  Rows of stowed trays and chipped ceramic mugs lined the walls.  Outside, the city lights of London Heathrow stretched into a hazy, pre-sunrise tapestry. Amelia, though surrounded by the constant motion and predictable rituals of the flight, couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that something was out of place.  A sense of foreboding, palpable and suffocating, pressed down on her like a heavy blanket.  A faint, persistent hum, deeper and more unnerving than the galley's usual hum, seemed to vibrate within her very bones.  The air, usually brisk and metallic, held an almost tangible weight.  It was as if the entire plane, the entire world outside, was waiting. Waiting for her.
