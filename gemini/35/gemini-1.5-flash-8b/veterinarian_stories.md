The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks as she wrestled the stubborn Labrador into the cramped examination room.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth, characteristic of the Blackwood Forest, mingled with the acrid tang of antiseptic and fear.

Every rustle of leaves outside the window, every chirp of unseen birds, every low growl from the forestâ€™s depths held a potential patient. This particular Tuesday morning was no exception.
