This particular ER, a hub of activity, was situated on the ground floor, its doors a constant buffet of arriving ambulances and worried faces. The room itself was a symphony of sterile white walls, chaotic medical equipment, and the urgent whispers of nurses.  Rows of hospital beds, each a small island of quiet distress, stretched into the dim recesses of the room.  The air buzzed with the beeping of machines, the sharp clang of metal instruments, and the strained voices of a chorus of overworked staff. Eleanor, her worn scrubs clinging damply to her frame, moved through the maelstrom, a small beacon of determined efficiency in the encroaching gloom.
