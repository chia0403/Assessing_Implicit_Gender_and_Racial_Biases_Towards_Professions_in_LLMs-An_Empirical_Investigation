The chipped paint of the classroom door, a faded shade of robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh in the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a scattering of half-finished drawings – a dragon with impossibly large wings, a cat with a human face, and a sun that looked suspiciously like a melted marshmallow.  This was Miss Amelia Butterfield's third-grade classroom at Oakhaven Elementary, a school nestled deep within the whispering woods of the Vermont countryside.  Autumn leaves, a kaleidoscope of burnt oranges and crimson reds, carpeted the walkways, their rustling symphony a constant counterpoint to the low hum of the town, a hum that always seemed to deepen during the quieter hours of the day.  Amelia, a woman with eyes the colour of warm honey and a laugh that echoed with the joyful abandon of a child, was already wrestling with the afternoon's unruly energy – a restless sea of buzzing chatter and the persistent, almost tangible scent of crayons and excitement.  Her afternoon tea, usually a tranquil balm, now seemed a distant memory.
