The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Hernandez's tired bones.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the scattered tax forms, receipts, and shredded paper that littered her small, cramped office.  The air, thick with the aroma of stale coffee and desperation, felt heavier than usual.  It was the penultimate day of tax season, and Amelia, owner and sole tax preparer of the modest business, was drowning in a deluge of last-minute clients.

Amelia Hernandez, 32, with her perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of dark curls that seemed to absorb the surrounding gloom, hunched over a tax return for a small-business owner.  This particular client, Mr. Henderson, a struggling baker with a sourdough starter as passionate as his hopes for a better tax bracket, was the source of Amelia's latest headache.  A meticulously organized spreadsheet, filled with columns detailing every crumb of Mr. Henderson's artisanal bread production, lay open on her desk, a testament to the meticulous documentation required for small business tax deductions.  The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a miniature hammer blow against the pressure cooker of tax season anxiety.  The muted chatter of other tax season warriors and the intermittent beeping of the office's antiquated fax machine provided a barely perceptible soundtrack to the impending chaos.  Outside, the relentless rain pounded against the window, mirroring the relentless torrent of forms and queries flooding Amelia's desk.
