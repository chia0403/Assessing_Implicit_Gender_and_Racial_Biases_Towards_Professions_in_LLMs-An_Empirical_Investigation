The fluorescent lights of the "Daily Grind" coffee shop hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed Amelia Katherine Finch's growing frustration.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, yet the line snaked out the door like a disgruntled serpent.  Each customer, each hesitant sip, each carefully placed order felt like a tiny pebble against Amelia's already strained patience.  The shop, tucked away in the quiet corner of Willow Creek, smelled of burnt coffee and stale pastries.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-coated windows, barely pierced the haze of lukewarm air.  A single, wilting fern slumped in a pot beside the counter, mirroring Amelia's mood.  The chipped ceramic mugs, stacked precariously on the shelves, seemed to mock her with their predictable dullness.  The clatter of a dropped spoon, followed by a sigh of annoyance from a nearby table, only further added to the suffocating atmosphere. Today, even the usual rhythmic clinking of Ameliaâ€™s cash register felt like a staccato drumbeat against her nerves.
