The rain hammered at the corrugated iron, a relentless tattoo that echoed the frantic rhythm in Elias Thorne's chest.  He clung precariously to the steep, mossy slope of the roof, his weathered leather gloves slick with a mixture of sweat and rainwater.  Below, the sprawling Victorian town of Ashwood, nestled amongst the emerald foothills of the Whispering Mountains, vanished in sheets of grey.  Elias, a roofer with eyes the colour of storm clouds and calloused hands that spoke volumes of a life spent battling the elements, knew this was no ordinary storm.  It feltâ€¦charged.  

Ashwood, a town steeped in history as old as the weathered stone walls lining its cobbled streets, was a place where legends whispered in the gaps between the church bells and the rustling pines.  Stories of forgotten fortunes, hidden tunnels, and the restless spirits of the mountain folk were woven into the very fabric of the town's existence.  Its towering Gothic cathedral, its quaint shops crammed with antique curios, and the ancient oak trees that lined the riverbanks all seemed to hold their breath in anticipation of the tempest brewing within the sky.  The air thrummed with an almost palpable energy, a sense of something unseen, something stirring beneath the storm clouds.  Elias felt a tremor in the very structure of the house, a tremor that resonated with his own uneasy soul.
