The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Wanderlust Wonders" travel agency, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic pace of Amelia Butterfield, the agency's owner and sole employee.  The tiny shop, crammed with brochures depicting sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains, reeked of damp paper and simmering anxiety.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows across Amelia's cluttered desk, highlighting the overflowing inbox of emails and the stack of crumpled itineraries threatening to topple onto the floor.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis choked by smog and grey skies, seemed to hold its breath, as if listening intently to the storm's wrath.  Amelia, however, was deaf to the tempest beyond her window, lost in the intricate dance of flight schedules, hotel bookings, and visa requirements. It was the eve of the annual Veridian Travel Fair, and her inbox reflected the relentless pressure to deliver.
