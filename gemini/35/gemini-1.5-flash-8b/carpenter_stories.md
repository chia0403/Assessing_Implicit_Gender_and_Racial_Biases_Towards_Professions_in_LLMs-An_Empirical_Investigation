The biting wind whipped through the gap in the crumbling eaves of the workshop, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating Elias Thornewood’s weathered face.  He hunched over a workbench overflowing with tools, his calloused fingers expertly shaping a piece of seasoned oak.  Elias, a carpenter of uncommon skill and quiet dedication, was lost in the rhythmic click and scrape of his work, oblivious to the relentless November storm raging outside.  His workshop, a ramshackle structure nestled in the shadowed valley of Blackwood Hollow, was a sanctuary, a refuge from the harsh realities of the world.  Within its walls, Elias sculpted beauty from the raw materials of the forest.  Today’s project was a intricate, bird-shaped finial for a newly commissioned chapel window in the nearby village of Oakhaven.  He’d been working on it for weeks, each carving a testament to his patience and unwavering artistic vision.
