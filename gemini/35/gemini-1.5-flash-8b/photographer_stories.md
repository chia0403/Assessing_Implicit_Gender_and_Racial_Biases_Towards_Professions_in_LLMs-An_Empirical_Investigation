The biting wind whipped Amelia Petrova's long auburn hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  She hunched deeper into the worn leather of her motorcycle, the engine sputtering protestingly in the frigid air.

She loved the raw beauty of the natural world, the way it revealed its soul when stripped bare.  This was the northern reaches of the Yukon, a place where the vastness of the wilderness both mesmerized and intimidated.  Each rustle of the wind-battered trees, each snap of the ice-coated branches, felt like a whispered secret.  Today, she was hunting for the perfect image of a phenomenon known only as the "Frost Bloom," a rare, fleeting spectacle said to only appear in the harshest, most unforgiving winters.
