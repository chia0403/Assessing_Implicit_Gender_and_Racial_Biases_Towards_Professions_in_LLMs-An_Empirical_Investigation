The scent of freshly cut hair, a potent mix of woodsmoke and lavender, clung to the air in the "Razor's Edge" barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the faded posters of vintage sports cars and the chipped ceramic mug perpetually filled with lukewarm chamomile tea.  This was the sanctuary of Bartholomew "Barty"  Cutforth, a barber of considerable renown (or, at least, renown amongst the regulars).  Barty, a man whose neatly trimmed beard matched the precise lines of his well-worn shears, was meticulously trimming the unruly mop of a burly construction worker named Gus.  The rhythmic snip-snip of the shears and the low rumble of Gus's grumbling formed a symphony peculiar to the barbershop, a soundtrack to the everyday dramas unfolding in the quiet town of Oakhaven.
