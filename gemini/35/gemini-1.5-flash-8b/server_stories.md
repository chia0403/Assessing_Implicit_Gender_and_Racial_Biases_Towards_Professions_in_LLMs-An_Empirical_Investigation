Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Mug, a diner more accustomed to the rhythmic clatter of spoons and the low hum of conversation than the ferocious drumming of the tempest.  Outside, the deserted highway stretched into a blurry grey canvas, swallowed by the downpour.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and frying onions, a familiar comfort in the face of the storm.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, a server at the Rusty Mug for the past five years, wiped a stray grease smudge from the polished Formica counter.  Her uniform, a faded navy blue, clung to her despite the chill.  The fluorescent lights buzzed above, casting a sterile glow on the half-empty booths and the lone figure hunched over a table in the corner.  A lone, flickering neon sign outside proclaimed "Open," a testament to the diner's stubborn defiance of the weather and the growing emptiness inside.
