The chipped paint of the "Shear Magic" sign, a faded emerald green, barely held on against the relentless Brisbane humidity.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Juniper's brow, slicking her already-perfect braid.  The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely chemical, hung heavy over the tiny salon.  Inside, Amelia, a whirlwind of focused energy in a crisp white uniform, expertly snipped at a particularly unruly fringe.  Her scissors, honed to a razor's edge, sliced through the strand with a satisfying *snip*.  Across the worn, Formica counter, a young woman with fiery red hair,  Ivy, stared intently at her reflection, a nervous twitch in her lip.  The rhythmic *click-click* of Amelia’s shears was the only sound, punctuated occasionally by the insistent buzzing of a nearby cicada.  

The salon, tucked away on a side street, felt a world away from the bustling city centre.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, cast long, dancing shadows on the floral wallpaper, which seemed to be clinging to its vibrancy despite the years of wear.  Old photographs, faded and brittle, lined the walls – portraits of smiling customers, all caught in a fleeting moment of pre-scissors anxiety.  A single, wilting bougainvillea vine clawed its way up a sun-baked brick wall, its purple blossoms struggling to bloom under the relentless Queensland sun.
