Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Lucky Clover" feed store, a cacophony that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Elara Nightingale's thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of damp hay and sawdust, hung heavy in the small, cluttered space.  Stacks of feed sacks, each bearing a different, slightly-off-kilter logo, leaned precariously against one another, creating a labyrinthine maze that challenged even the most seasoned shopper. Elara, a salesperson at Lucky Clover for the past three years, wished for a deluge of sales that would wash away the nagging feeling of inadequacy that had been clinging to her like a damp shroud.  Today, however, the only thing drenched was her spirit, and the faded floral print of her uniform.

The setting was rural, nestled deep in the rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley.  The year was 1938.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the worn, wooden counter where Elara meticulously arranged a display of alfalfa pellets.  The rhythmic clinking of the old cash register and the occasional bleating of a sheep from the neighboring pasture provided a soundtrack to her internal struggle.  Her small town, Oakhaven, felt as if it were holding its breath, waiting for the next whisper of the Great Depression's stifling hand.  Elara, though just a salesperson, felt the weight of the community's hopes and fears pressing down on her shoulders, a heavy burden that was amplified by the persistent, insistent drumming of the rain.
