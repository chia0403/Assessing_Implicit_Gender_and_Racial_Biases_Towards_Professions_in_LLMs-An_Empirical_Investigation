The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" office hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the quiet resignation settling over Elara Nightingale.  Her fingers, stained a faint purple from the crumpled invoice she'd just wrestled into the overflowing recycling bin, tapped a lethargic rhythm on the polished reception desk.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the perpetual drizzle of paperwork that seemed to accumulate like a damp shroud around her.  Apex Solutions, a company ostensibly dedicated to cutting-edge technological innovations, was, in reality, a labyrinth of overly-optimistic presentations and perpetually-delayed projects.  Elara, the receptionist, was the silent observer of their internal struggles, the buffer between the polished exterior and the often-chaotic heart of the operation.  It was a role she'd accepted with a quiet resignation that felt more like a well-worn trench coat. Today, it felt heavier than usual.
