The rhythmic whir of the drill, a low, insistent hum, was the only sound that pierced the silence of Dr. Eleanor Vance's cramped, yet meticulously organized, dental office.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windows of the Victorian building, cast long shadows across the polished chrome of her instruments.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glare of the overhead fluorescent light.  Eleanor, a woman of forty-three with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and a mouth that always seemed ready to offer a wry smile, meticulously filed her patient's X-rays.  Each image, a frozen moment of dental distress, was a tiny story in itself, a silent plea for healing.  Her office, tucked away on a quiet side street of the bustling city of Oakhaven, was a world apart from the vibrant energy of the city. It was a sanctuary of sorts, a haven from the clamoring world outside, a place where whispered anxieties and silent fears could be safely held.  This was her sanctuary, her laboratory, her world.
