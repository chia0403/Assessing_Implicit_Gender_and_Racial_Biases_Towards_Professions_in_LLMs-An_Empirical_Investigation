The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's rain-slicked trench coat.  The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and something vaguely chemical, hung heavy in the alley behind the bar.  A single, flickering streetlamp cast long, distorted shadows, dancing with the swirling mist rising from the overflowing dumpster.  This was the heart of the Lower East Side, a place where the city's underbelly whispered secrets in the echoing silence between rain-soaked alleyways.  Izzy, a seasoned detective with the NYPD's 22nd precinct,  had been called to the scene of a disturbance, but the noise had been a subdued hum, a low growl rather than a scream. And the only growl she heard now was the growling of her own stomach, rumbling louder than the city itself.
