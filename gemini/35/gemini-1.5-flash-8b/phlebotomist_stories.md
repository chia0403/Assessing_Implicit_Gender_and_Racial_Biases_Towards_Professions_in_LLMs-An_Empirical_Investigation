The fluorescent hum of the lab thrummed against Elara Nightingale's skin, a counterpoint to the steady drip, drip, drip of the automated blood collection system.  She wore the sterile white uniform, the familiar weight of the starched fabric a constant reminder of the precise protocols she was sworn to uphold.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard buzzed with its usual frantic energy, a symphony of car horns and distant sirens echoing through the reinforced glass walls of the Institute for Biometric Research.  Elara, however, was completely enveloped by the sterile, almost clinical, atmosphere within.  Her precise movements, her practiced technique, all a carefully choreographed dance to extract the vital fluid that held the answers.  Tonight, however, a specific specimen held an unsettling weight.  A sample from a young woman named Isolde; a sample that had arrived on a seemingly ordinary Tuesday with a peculiar note tucked inside.  A note that whispered of a secret, a disease that defied explanation, a possible curse... and a name, a name that haunted the very air around the lab's sterile corridors:  The Obsidian Plague.
