The flickering fluorescent light above Patricia Eleanor McAllister’s desk buzzed like a disgruntled honeybee. It was a sound that had become synonymous with disappointment in her life, a soundtrack to rejected claims and the weary sighs of customers facing astronomical medical bills. Outside, the rain hammered against the plate glass windows of the 'Safe Harbour Insurance' office, a rhythmic drumming that only amplified the feeling of being trapped inside a metaphorical, and increasingly damp, grey box.

Patricia, who preferred to be called Pat (or, on especially bad days, “The Closer” by her somewhat delusional boss, Mr. Henderson), surveyed the mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf her. Each form was a testament to someone's misfortune: a fender bender on Elm Street, a leaky roof on Maple Avenue, a slipped disc at the pickleball court down by the river. They were all seeking solace, a financial lifeboat in the storm of their personal crises, and Pat was the gatekeeper, the one tasked with deciding who deserved to be rescued and who would be left to drown in deductibles and policy loopholes.

The setting was a Tuesday afternoon in late October in the sleepy, somewhat depressing, town of Willow Creek, Ohio. The town prided itself on its tranquility, its "quaint charm," and its statistically low crime rate. But beneath the facade of well-manicured lawns and annual pumpkin festivals, Willow Creek was a hotbed of simmering resentment, quiet desperation, and secrets buried deep within the fertile Ohio soil. And Patricia Eleanor McAllister, insurance agent extraordinaire, was about to discover that the risks lurking in Willow Creek were far more dangerous than a hailstorm or a fallen tree.
