The rain lashed against the windshield of the Crown Victoria, blurring the already hazy neon glow of the late-night diners that clung to the edges of Port Blossom like barnacles. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white. The radio squawked intermittently, a garbled symphony of dispatch calls and static that reflected the unease churning in her gut. Port Blossom wasn't a place for unease; it was a place for quiet desperation, for dreams that faded like cheap tattoos in the summer sun. A place where nothing much ever happened, except for tonight.

The setting was the sleepy, perpetually overcast coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. Nestled between the churning Pacific Ocean and a dense, ancient forest, the town thrived, or rather, *survived*, on a precarious balance of fishing, tourism during the brief summer months, and the occasional forgotten logging operation. The permanent residents numbered around 5,000, a mix of grizzled fishermen, aging hippies, and families clinging to the generational roots that ran as deep as the redwood trees. The air always smelled of brine and damp earth, a constant reminder of the forces of nature that held Port Blossom in its precarious embrace. The year was 2023, and the relentless downpour painted the town in a perpetually somber hue.
