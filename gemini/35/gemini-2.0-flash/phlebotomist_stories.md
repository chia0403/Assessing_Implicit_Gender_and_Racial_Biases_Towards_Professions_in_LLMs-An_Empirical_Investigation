Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Iris Anya Petrova:

**Setting:**

The pre-dawn gloom clung to the windows of the St. Jude's Urgent Care, clinging like the persistent ache in Iris's lower back. It was 5:48 AM, and the linoleum floor, perpetually smelling faintly of disinfectant and anxiety, was cold beneath her sensible, non-slip shoes. The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, battling the encroaching darkness outside. The small phlebotomy station, tucked into a corner between a triage bay and the waiting room, felt cramped and isolating.  It was a sterile island, stocked with needles, vacutainers, tourniquets, and the quiet hum of a mini-centrifuge. The scent of alcohol wipes hung heavy in the air. Outside, the city was just beginning to stir, but in here, the day had already begun for those whose lives were on hold, waiting for answers held in vials of blood.

**Story Opening:**

Iris Anya Petrova cracked her knuckles, the sound echoing in the still-empty waiting room. She was a creature of habit, a necessity in a job where even the smallest deviation from routine could have serious consequences. First, check the equipment – always.  The tourniquets were supple, the butterfly needles sharp, the alcohol wipes plentiful. Then, she reviewed the morning's schedule, a litany of names and test requests that swam before her eyes. "Lipid panel, CBC, CMP, troponin..." she muttered, her breath fogging slightly on the cool glass of the computer screen.  Most days were predictable, a steady stream of patients, some grateful, some terrified, some indifferent. But there were always those that lingered, the ones whose blood held stories heavier than the weight of the vial itself. Like Mrs. Henderson, last week, clutching her rosary beads as Iris drew blood for a cancer screening. Or the young boy who’d squeezed her hand, his eyes wide with fear, before a battery of allergy tests. Today, a name on the list caught her eye, a name that sent a shiver, not of fear, but of an unsettling curiosity, down her spine.  “John Doe,” it read. “Unconscious. Cause Unknown.  Full Metabolic Panel. STAT.”
