**Opening:**

The insistent ringing cut through the rhythmic clatter of Amelia Chen's keyboard like a shard of ice. She winced, not even bothering to glance at the caller ID. It was probably Brenda, demanding another emergency patch for the abysmal onboarding process on "Project Phoenix," and Amelia was officially operating on fumes. The irony of a project called "Phoenix" being in a perpetual state of crashing and burning was not lost on her. With a sigh that deflated more than a balloon animal, Amelia finally surrendered, slamming her fingers onto the escape key.

**Setting:**

Amelia's apartment, a glorified box in the trendy but aggressively overpriced "Innovation District" of San Francisco, reflected her current state of existence: a chaotic jumble of brilliant ideas and half-finished tasks. Wires snaked across the floor like metallic vines, connecting multiple monitors displaying lines of code in varying neon hues. Empty ramen containers stacked precariously next to half-eaten avocados. Whiteboards, covered in diagrams that seemed to defy Euclidean geometry, leaned against the walls, flanking a desk piled high with textbooks on distributed systems and AI algorithms. The only concession to decoration was a small, potted succulent perched precariously on the edge of the monitor, a silent testament to Amelia's failed attempts at nurturing anything beyond her digital progeny. Sunlight, rare in this part of the city, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated window, casting the room in a perpetual twilight. The faint aroma of coffee, stale and bitter, hung in the air, a constant reminder of her dependence on caffeine to survive another code-fueled night.
