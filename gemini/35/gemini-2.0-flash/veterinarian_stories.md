**Opening:**

The scent of disinfectant, mingled with the more earthy aroma of wet dog, clung to the air like a persistent burr. Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She glanced at the clock above the exam table - 7:17 PM. Another late night. The terrier mix she’d just finished stitching up, a hapless victim of a poorly constructed chain-link fence, was finally resting comfortably in a recovery kennel. Tonight had been a parade of the unfortunate: a cat with a urinary blockage, a hamster suffering from wet tail, and now this little scrapper. Eleanor loved them all, of course, but her shoulders ached with the weight of their woes.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance’s Veterinary Clinic, “Pawsitive Care,” nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine. The clinic occupied a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful yellow with crisp white trim. Inside, the waiting room was designed to soothe anxious owners (and even more anxious pets). Comfortable armchairs were arranged around a coffee table stacked with dog-eared copies of *National Geographic* and *Modern Cat*. A bubbling fish tank gurgled quietly in the corner, its occupants blissfully unaware of the dramas unfolding just beyond the double doors leading to the exam rooms. While Pawsitive Care wasn’t flashy, it was clean, well-equipped, and overflowing with Eleanor's genuine care for the creatures she served. The aroma of pine needles, emanating from a small evergreen planted just outside the front window, was a constant, comforting reminder of the rugged beauty surrounding Havenwood.
