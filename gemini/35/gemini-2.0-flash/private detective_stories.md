## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The flickering neon sign of "Rosie's Diner" buzzed outside, casting a sickly yellow glow across the wet asphalt of Liberty Street. Rain, a persistent, melancholic drizzle that had plagued New York City for the past three days, slicked the sidewalks and blurred the edges of the towering buildings. Inside, the diner was a haven of greasy spoons and the lingering aroma of day-old coffee, a comforting balm against the chill seeping into even the thickest wool coat.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, announcing his arrival with a weary sigh. **Arthur Quentin Blackwood**, private detective, shrugged the rain from the shoulders of his trench coat, the fabric heavy and damp. He sank into the familiar red vinyl booth, the springs groaning in protest beneath his weight. He signaled Rosie, a woman whose face was etched with the stories of a thousand late-night heartbreaks, and she lumbered over, a steaming mug of black coffee already in hand.

"Rough night, Art?" she asked, her voice raspy but kind.

Arthur ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair. "You have no idea, Rosie. No idea at all." He took a long, grateful sip of the coffee. "Make that a double, will you? And tell me you've got a dame in the corner booth weeping into her eggs over some two-timing lug. Anything to break the monotony of rich guys getting richer and desperate people getting desperate-er." He took another sip, the caffeine already beginning to claw its way into his weary brain. Tonight's case, a missing poodle named Fluffy, had hardly been the stuff of Chandler novels. But tomorrow... tomorrow brought a new client, a whisper of danger, and a name that resonated with a chilling familiarity: Corvus. He didn't like the sound of it one bit.
