## Story Opening:

The shrill, insistent bleat of the pager cut through the last vestiges of peaceful sleep, dragging Anya Petrova's consciousness into the cold, pre-dawn reality. Groaning, she fumbled for the device on her nightstand, squinting at the flashing display. "Motor vehicle accident. Highway 17, mile marker 42. Multiple casualties. Priority One. Respond immediately."

Anya scrubbed her face, the urgency of the message already flooding her veins with adrenaline. Priority One. The words hung heavy in the air, painting a grim picture of crushed metal and broken bodies. She threw back the covers, the lingering warmth offering little comfort as she braced herself for another day, another chance to hold the line between life and death.

## Setting:

Anya's apartment was small, a cramped one-bedroom above a bustling bakery in the coastal town of Seabrook, Washington. The aroma of sourdough and cinnamon rolls, usually a comforting presence, was lost on her at this hour. The walls were a calming shade of seafoam green, adorned with framed photographs of her family - smiling faces that felt a million miles away from the horrors she often witnessed. Outside, the air was thick with the salty tang of the Pacific, a constant reminder of the raw power and unpredictable nature of the world around her. Seabrook itself was a picturesque town, a popular tourist destination with its charming shops, weathered docks, and stunning views of the Olympic Mountains. But behind the postcard veneer lay the same human vulnerabilities and tragedies that Anya encountered in every town, every day.
