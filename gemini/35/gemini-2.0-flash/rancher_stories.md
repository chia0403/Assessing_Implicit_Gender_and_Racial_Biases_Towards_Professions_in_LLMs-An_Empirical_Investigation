## Story Opening:

The wind, a constant, invisible beast in these parts, gnawed at Jebediah "Jeb" McKinley's weathered face, whipping strands of his thinning grey hair across his forehead. He squinted against the dust devils dancing across the parched earth of the Broken Spur Ranch, a kingdom of hard-won acres carved out of the unforgiving Montana landscape. Another damn dust storm brewing. He could taste the grit already, a familiar flavor on his tongue.

He leaned against the worn fence post, his boots scuffed and dusty, the scent of leather and horse sweat clinging to his clothes. The cattle, usually grazing contentedly in the morning sun, were huddled together nervously, their lowing a mournful counterpoint to the wind's howl. Jeb knew what they felt. A sense of unease, a feeling of something ominous on the horizon, had settled over him for weeks now. It wasn't just the drought, although that was bad enough. This was something deeper, something that prickled at the back of his neck and kept him awake nights.

His gaze drifted towards the distant, jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, their snow-capped summits stark against the pale blue sky. A lone hawk circled overhead, its cry a sharp, echoing sound. Jebediah watched it for a moment, then spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dust. He had a feeling that hawk wasn't just hunting rabbits today. Something was coming. And he had a sinking feeling it wasn't good news.

## Setting:

**Broken Spur Ranch, Montana. Present Day.**

The Broken Spur Ranch is a sprawling, isolated cattle ranch nestled in the heart of Montana. The landscape is characterized by rolling plains, sparse vegetation, and a relentless, dry climate. The ranch house is a sturdy, two-story structure built from weathered timber, its porch worn smooth by generations of boots. A large barn, several outbuildings, and corrals surround the house, all bearing the marks of years of hard work and the harsh Montana weather. The surrounding area is sparsely populated, with the nearest town, Harmony Gulch, a small, struggling community about thirty miles away. The Bitterroot Mountains dominate the western horizon, providing a dramatic backdrop to the ranch's stark beauty. The ranch is a place of immense physical labor, fierce independence, and a deep connection to the land, a connection that is constantly tested by the challenges of nature and the isolation of the frontier.
