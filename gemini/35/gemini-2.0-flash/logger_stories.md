The biting wind howled a mournful tune through the towering pines, each gust threatening to rip the last stubborn leaves from their branches. It was late October in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, and the air held the distinct, earthy scent of decaying leaves and damp wood, a smell that normally brought solace to Jedediah "Jed" Silas, but today, only amplified the gnawing unease in his gut. The forest, usually a tapestry of greens and browns, was now a palette of greys under a low-slung, bruised sky.

Jed, his face weathered and lined like a well-worn map, wiped a stray bead of sweat from his brow, despite the chill. He was perched precariously on a felled Douglas fir, his axe resting heavily beside him. The rhythmic roar of the chainsaw, which he'd silenced only moments before, echoed faintly in his ears. He hadn't been logging in this area for a while, not sinceâ€¦ well, not since *that* happened. And the silence, broken only by the wind and the rustling of unseen creatures, was deafening.
