## Story Opening:

The chipped Formica of the diner table felt cold beneath Delores "Dee" Ramirez's elbows. Outside, the neon sign of "Mama's Home Cooking - Open 24/7" sputtered a tired blue in the pre-dawn gloom. Dee, her dark hair pulled back in a severe braid, stared into the swirling dregs of her lukewarm coffee, the caffeine doing little to shake off the heavy blanket of exhaustion that had settled over her. Another 14 hours of hauling frozen turkeys lay ahead, a Thanksgiving delivery that felt more like a grim penance than a festive duty. She knew the route like the back of her calloused hand â€“ I-80 East, through the heartland, a monotonous grey canvas painted with the occasional burst of autumn color. But lately, the highway had started to feel different, heavier, somehow. Like it was watching her. Dee shivered, pushing the feeling aside. She wasn't one for superstitions, not after years spent crisscrossing the country, navigating blinding blizzards and dodging rogue tumbleweeds. But tonight, the silence felt too thick, the air too still. Something was coming.

## Setting:

The story opens in a small, roadside diner just outside of Kearney, Nebraska. Mama's Home Cooking is a classic trucker stop, boasting sticky vinyl booths, a perpetually buzzing fluorescent light fixture, and the aroma of stale coffee and frying bacon that clings to everything. The diner is mostly empty at this hour, save for a lone waitress, a wizened woman with a name tag that reads "Agnes," and a couple of drowsy truckers nursing their own cups of joe. Outside, the vast, flat landscape of Nebraska stretches out, a patchwork of fields and scrubland under the bruised, pre-dawn sky. The air is crisp and carries the scent of damp earth and the promise of an early winter frost.
