## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Caldwell's face as she wrestled with her "For Sale" sign, the wind threatening to rip it from her grasp like a rogue kite. Damn this blasted cliffside property, and damn the retired naval captain who'd stubbornly refused to lower his price by even a single, measly percent. Three months. Three months Amelia had been showing this windswept, perpetually damp, and architecturally questionable house, and all she'd managed to attract were gulls and a few very confused tourists.

She finally managed to jam the metal stake firmly into the scrubby, windswept ground, securing the sign against the relentless coastal gale. "Captain's Perch - Prime Ocean Views!" it proclaimed, the words seeming to mock the grim reality of the situation. Prime ocean views, yes, if you didn't mind feeling like you were about to be launched directly into the Atlantic Ocean every time you opened a window. Amelia sighed, pulling her scarf tighter around her neck. Another day, another potential buyer, another likely disappointment. At this point, she was considering offering the place to the local colony of seals. They seemed far less discerning.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the fictional town of Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom is a small, picturesque town nestled on the craggy coastline, known for its colorful fishing boats, charming antique shops, and a disproportionate number of artists who come to capture the dramatic landscape. The town boasts a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone else's business, a trait that Amelia sometimes appreciates and sometimes finds suffocating. The houses, a mix of weathered clapboard and Victorian gingerbread, cling precariously to the hillsides overlooking the Atlantic. Winter is long and harsh, but the summers are glorious, attracting tourists and seasonal residents alike. Captain's Perch, the bane of Amelia's existence, sits on the furthest edge of town, perched atop a particularly dramatic cliff overlooking the open ocean, separated from the rest of Port Blossom by a winding, often treacherous, coastal road. The house itself is a sprawling, two-story affair built in a haphazard style that could best be described as "nautical-meets-gothic," complete with a widow's walk and a turret that looks suspiciously like a lighthouse gone wrong.
