## Opening:

The chipped linoleum floor felt cold even through Cynthia Mae Miller’s worn leather boots. 8:57 AM. Three minutes until the buzzer would buzz, and the first of her parolees would shuffle in, radiating a potent mix of resentment and feigned repentance. Cynthia straightened the stack of files on her desk – Thompson, Rodriguez, Davis – each one a meticulously documented tapestry of bad choices and broken promises. She ran a hand through her short, practical haircut, a subconscious gesture meant to project an air of unwavering control, and glanced at the window. Another grey November day pressing down on the city.

## Setting:

Cynthia’s office, nestled deep within the bowels of the Cuyahoga County Probation Department in downtown Cleveland, was a testament to bureaucratic blandness. Beige was the dominant color - beige walls, beige desk, beige filing cabinets. The only splashes of color came from a slightly wilting spider plant precariously perched on the windowsill and a faded motivational poster tacked to the wall, featuring a soaring eagle and the inspiring, yet tragically ironic, phrase: "Reach for the Stars!" The air was thick with the stale scent of recycled air and institutional coffee. The room was small, cramped, and felt permanently damp, likely due to its proximity to the ancient and leaky plumbing system. A single fluorescent light buzzed overhead, adding a monotonous hum to the general ambiance of quiet desperation. The constant hum of activity just outside her door - phones ringing, voices murmuring, printers churning - served as a constant reminder of the sheer volume of lives intertwined with the criminal justice system.
