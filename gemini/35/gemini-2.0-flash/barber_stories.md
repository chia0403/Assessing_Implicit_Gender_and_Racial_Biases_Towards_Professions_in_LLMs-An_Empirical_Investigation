Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a barber as the main character, including his full name:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Arthur's Shear Delight" jingled a lazy, familiar tune, a sound that barely registered on Arthur Theodore Finch's consciousness anymore. He barely glanced up from the meticulous arrangement of shaving brushes on the mahogany shelf, his brow furrowed in concentration. The late afternoon sun, a hazy gold, slanted through the window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air – each one a tiny, suspended reminder of the decades he'd spent in this very spot. The newcomer coughed politely, shattering Arthur's reverie. With a sigh that puffed out his cheeks and ruffled the impeccably combed silver hair that framed his face, he straightened, smoothing the crisp white apron that protected his starched shirt and tweed trousers. “Be with you in a moment,” he called out, his voice a low, sonorous rumble, more accustomed to the clipped hum of clippers and the soft swish of a straight razor. He knew, without looking, it would be Old Man Hemlock, wanting his bi-weekly trim and a lively debate on the failings of modern plumbing. Arthur just hoped the man had remembered his dentures this time; understanding him was like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics when he hadn't.

**Setting:**

Arthur's Shear Delight was nestled on a quiet, unassuming corner of Elm Street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The shop itself was a time capsule, a living testament to a bygone era. Dark wood paneling lined the walls, adorned with framed photographs of Havenwood's founding families and antique barbering tools gleaming behind glass. Two well-worn, burgundy leather barber chairs occupied center stage, facing a large, fogged mirror that reflected the gentle chaos of the shop. Bottles of bay rum and aftershave lined the shelves, their labels faded but their scents potent and familiar. A checkered linoleum floor led to a small waiting area furnished with a stack of well-thumbed magazines - "Field & Stream", "National Geographic," and a surprisingly well-preserved collection of old "Life" magazines. The air was thick with the comforting aroma of sandalwood, talcum powder, and the faint, metallic tang of sharpened steel, a fragrance that Arthur had inhaled almost daily for the past fifty years. The window display held a rotating barber pole, its hypnotic swirl a beacon to the town's men, promising a clean shave, a friendly ear, and a brief respite from the troubles of the world.
