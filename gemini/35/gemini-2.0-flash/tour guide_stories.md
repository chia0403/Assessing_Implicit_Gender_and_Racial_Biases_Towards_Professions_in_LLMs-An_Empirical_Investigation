The air in San Sebastián hung thick and salty, tasting of adventure and overpriced pintxos. Rain, soft and persistent like a sigh, kissed the cobblestones of the Parte Vieja, slicking them to a dangerous sheen. Amelia Esperanza Rodriguez shivered, pulling her bright yellow raincoat tighter around her. The "Rain or Shine" promise emblazoned across the back felt particularly ironic this morning. Amelia glanced at her watch. 10:57 am. Three more minutes until the "History & Pintxos" tour officially began, and, judging by the empty alleyway leading to the Plaza de la Constitución, she was going to have a very intimate history lesson today.

Amelia smoothed down her unruly dark curls, tucking a stray strand behind her ear. She loved this city – the way the mountains embraced the beaches, the rumble of Basque being spoken on every corner, the sheer joy that dripped from its sun-drenched walls (even when those walls were currently damp and dismal). She just wished that love translated into paying customers on days like this. Sighing, she adjusted the volume on her microphone. Amelia Esperanza Rodriguez, Tour Guide Extraordinaire (on a good day) or Tour Guide Slightly Below Average (on a day like today), was ready, or at least as ready as she was ever going to be, to tell the story of San Sebastián, even if she had to tell it to herself.
