The relentless sun beat down on Ezekiel Bartholomew Peabody's weathered face, each ray carving deeper lines into his already crinkled skin. He squinted, his blue eyes, faded like a well-worn denim jacket, scanning the horizon. Not a cloud in sight, not even the wisp of promise that usually danced on the edge of the late afternoon sky. The dust devils, mischievous sprites born of the parched earth, whirled across his fields, mocking his efforts with their ephemeral dance.

The setting was Harmony Gulch, Kansas, 1933. The name itself was a cruel irony, a reminder of the dreams that had withered along with the crops during this, the worst year of the Dust Bowl so far. Ezekiel's farm, Peabody Acres, had been in his family for three generations. Before the dust, it had been a tapestry of green, a symphony of rustling corn stalks and golden wheat fields. Now, it was a monochrome landscape of gray-brown despair, the skeletal remains of a once-thriving farm poking forlornly from the suffocating dust. The wind, ever-present and unforgiving, carried the gritty soil from Oklahoma, from Texas, from anywhere but here, burying hope a little deeper with each gust.
