## Opening:

The scent of formaldehyde was a familiar, almost comforting, note in Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's orchestra of anxieties. It meant things were being preserved, scrutinized, understood. Unfortunately, tonight, the formaldehyde couldn't mask the lingering, metallic tang of blood, a scent that clung to the back of her throat and threatened to unearth the breakfast she'd barely managed to keep down. She pulled her cashmere scarf tighter around her neck, a futile attempt to ward off the chill emanating not just from the refrigerated room, but from the scene etched into her mind.

## Setting:

The Medical Examiner's Office of Portland, Oregon, hummed with a grim efficiency on this late Tuesday night. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glare on the stainless steel surfaces and tiled walls. Outside, the relentless Pacific Northwest rain beat against the windows, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic pace of Eleanor's thoughts. The autopsy suite, usually a hive of activity, was eerily silent save for the steady drip of a saline solution bag attached to a nearby stand. Tonight, the only occupant, besides Eleanor, was draped under a pristine white sheet on the central examination table. The air hung thick with a potent mix of science and sorrow, a cocktail Eleanor knew all too well.
