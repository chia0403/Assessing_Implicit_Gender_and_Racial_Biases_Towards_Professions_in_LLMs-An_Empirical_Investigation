The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, monotonous tune in the cavernous file room of Harrison & Grant, threatening to drive Bethany Anne Miller to the brink of madness. Dust motes, disturbed by her frantic searching, danced in the pale beams like tiny, mocking sprites. Bethany coughed, pulling the neck of her perpetually-stained, navy blue sweater higher. She hated this room. It smelled of aged paper and unspoken anxieties, the tangible residue of countless legal battles.

It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, and a bone-chilling wind rattled the grimy windows of the century-old building. Outside, the cityscape of Chicago was a blurry watercolor of greys and browns, reflecting the melancholic mood of the office. The air inside, however, was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Bethany had been tasked with finding a crucial document – an amendment to a contract signed over fifteen years ago – that could either make or break a multi-million dollar lawsuit. Her boss, the notoriously impatient and caffeine-addicted Elias Thorne, had given her a firm deadline: end of day. And end of day, in Elias’s world, meant precisely 5:00 PM, not a second later.

Right now, at 3:47 PM, Bethany felt about as close to finding the document as she was to winning the lottery. She ran a gloved hand through her already dishevelled auburn hair, leaving a smudge of dust on her forehead. “Just breathe, Bethany,” she muttered to herself, the sound swallowed by the towering shelves packed with yellowing manila folders. This was it. The file room, her personal purgatory, was once again her hunting ground.
