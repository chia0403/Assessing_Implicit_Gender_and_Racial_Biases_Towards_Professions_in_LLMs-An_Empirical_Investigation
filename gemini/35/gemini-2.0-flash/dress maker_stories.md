## Opening:

The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color, bled through the high, arched window of Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's workroom, painting the dust motes dancing in the air a swirling, ethereal violet. Agnes, needle clenched between her teeth, squinted at the delicate lacework she was painstakingly attaching to the bodice of a robin's egg blue gown. Each stitch, a tiny anchor, fought against the relentless tug of the setting sun, threatening to pull her into premature darkness. The silence in the room was thick, punctuated only by the rhythmic snip of her thread scissors and the distant rumble of a carriage on cobblestones. She was fighting time, as always. Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman whose patience was as thin as the silk Agnes was currently wrestling with, expected the gown by tomorrow morning. And woe betide Agnes if it wasn't perfect.

## Setting:

Agnes' workroom was perched above "Plumtree's Fine Haberdashery & Dressmaking," a deceptively modest establishment nestled in the heart of Primrose Lane, a bustling thoroughfare in the London borough of Bloomsbury. Downstairs, her bustling shop, a chaotic explosion of silks, velvets, and meticulously organized (or so Agnes liked to think) bolts of fabric, catered to the discerning ladies of the neighborhood and beyond. Upstairs, however, was Agnes' sanctuary, a haven of controlled chaos. Scraps of fabric lay scattered across the floor like fallen leaves, pinned sketches adorned the walls like miniature masterpieces, and half-finished garments hung from dress forms, waiting to be brought to life under Agnes' skilled hands. The air was always thick with the scent of beeswax, lavender, and the faint, metallic tang of iron. A towering oak dresser, its drawers overflowing with buttons, ribbons, and every conceivable sewing tool, dominated one corner. This room was Agnes' world, a place where imagination took tangible form, one stitch at a time.
