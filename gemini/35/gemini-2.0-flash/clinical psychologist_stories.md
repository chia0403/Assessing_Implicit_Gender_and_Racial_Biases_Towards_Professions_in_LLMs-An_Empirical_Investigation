Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a clinical psychologist named Dr. Eleanor Vance:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the waiting room of Dr. Eleanor Vance's private practice in the historic, yet slightly dilapidated, Victorian mansion she converted into a suite of offices. The mansion, named Blackwood House, sits on the quieter edge of the affluent town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.

The waiting room is a deliberate blend of comfort and professionalism. Soft, neutral colors dominate, punctuated by splashes of earthy greens and browns in the upholstery and the landscape paintings adorning the walls. A crackling fireplace (gas-powered, for convenience) casts dancing shadows on the antique side tables, each holding a carefully curated selection of magazines: nature journals, literary reviews, and psychology periodicals discreetly tucked underneath. The air smells faintly of sandalwood and chamomile tea, a scent Eleanor has cultivated to promote a sense of calm. However, today, the air feels thick with a different kind of tension, almost palpable.
The worn, plush chairs suggest years of supporting anxieties and secrets. The stained glass window depicting a tranquil forest scene, usually a source of solace, seems to be staring blankly today.


**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance stared at the file in front of her, the manila folder feeling heavy in her hands. “Mr. Silas Blackwood.” The name echoed in her head, a discordant note in the otherwise carefully orchestrated symphony of her practice. Blackwood House had been her sanctuary for the past fifteen years, a place of healing and understanding. Now, a descendant of the house’s namesake was about to walk through her door. She was supposed to be a scientist, a clinician following evidence-based practice, but the whispers that clung to the Blackwood name were hard to ignore in a town like Oakhaven. Old money, old secrets, and a legacy shadowed by tragedy were all interwoven into the fabric of the Blackwood family. A shiver traced down her spine despite the warmth emanating from the fireplace. Her 2:00 PM appointment was right on time. The grandfather clock in the hallway chimed twice and at that moment, there was a light knock on her door. It was time to start her session.
