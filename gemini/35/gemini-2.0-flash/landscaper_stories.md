## Story Opening:

The first crack of dawn found Elias Thorne, dirt already ingrained under his fingernails despite the early hour, staring at the manicured horror before him. He’d been called in as a last resort, the garden equivalent of cardiac arrest, and the patient was not responding well to CPR. The perfectly symmetrical rose bushes, each a different shade of nauseating pink, were arranged in a grid so rigid it bordered on militant. Geometric hedges, clipped with laser-like precision, looked less like living things and more like green, suffocating concrete. He’d seen more life in a suburban driveway.

Mrs. Hawthorne, the original architect of this floral crime scene, was notorious in the gardening circles of Willow Creek. Known for her iron fist and unwavering belief that nature should be forced into submission, she'd been a thorn in Elias's side for years. He'd always avoided her projects, preferring the wild chaos of native meadows to the sterile perfection she demanded. But now, here he was, hired to “fix” the very aesthetic he loathed. Because apparently, even Mrs. Hawthorne had finally realized that a garden devoid of soul was, well, a garden devoid of soul.

The problem was, Elias had no idea where to begin. He took a deep breath, the scent of heavily-perfumed roses doing little to calm his rising anxiety. He was a landscaper, not a miracle worker. But he owed a favor to his friend, whose landscaping business had crumbled under the weight of Mrs. Hawthorne's impossible demands. So, Elias Thorne, champion of the untamed and whisperer to wilting weeds, was about to wage war on the most meticulously-organized garden in Willow Creek.

## Setting:

**Location:** Willow Creek, a small, affluent suburb outside of Portland, Oregon. Known for its large, well-maintained properties and a surprising number of eccentric, wealthy residents.

**Specific Location:** The meticulously-maintained, multi-acre estate of Mrs. Agatha Hawthorne. The grounds feature:

*   A vast, formal rose garden arranged in rigid geometric patterns.
*   Hedges sculpted into unnatural shapes (spheres, cubes, even a bizarre pyramid).
*   Perfectly-mown lawns that resemble putting greens.
*   A koi pond that seems unnaturally sterile.
*   A large, Victorian-style house that overlooks the garden, with several watchful windows.

**Time:** Early morning, late spring. The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting long shadows across the garden. The air is cool and damp, typical of the Pacific Northwest.
