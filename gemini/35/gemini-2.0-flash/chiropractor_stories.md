Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a chiropractor named as the main character:

**Opening and Setting:**

The persistent hum of the dehumidifier was a constant companion in Dr. Eleanor Victoria Quince's chiropractic office, especially on days like this, where the Savannah humidity clung to everything like a damp shroud. Outside, the rain lashed against the French Quarter windows of the historic building that housed "Quince Chiropractic & Wellness," blurring the wrought-iron balconies across the street into an impressionistic wash of black and gray.

Eleanor, or Ellie as most of her patients called her, kneaded a particularly stubborn knot in her own shoulder as she reviewed Mrs. Dubois' chart. At 6:58 AM, before the first rays of sunlight could even hope to cut through the downpour, and two minutes before she was scheduled to open, Eleanor already felt the familiar tension creeping in. This morning, though, it wasn't just the weather or the upcoming day's appointments that had her on edge. It was the whisper she'd overheard at the farmer's market on Saturday, the one about "that old bonesetter, the one who lives out on Tybee," and the sudden, inexplicable chill that ran down her spine when she heard it. Folklore and whispered remedies were part and parcel of Savannah's charm, but this one...this one felt different, heavier. And Ellie, despite her dedication to evidence-based practice, couldn't shake the feeling that something more than just aches and pains was about to walk through her door.
