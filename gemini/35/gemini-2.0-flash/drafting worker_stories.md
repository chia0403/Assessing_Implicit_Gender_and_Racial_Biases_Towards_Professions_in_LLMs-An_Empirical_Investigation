## Story Opening:

The smell of stale coffee and printer toner hung heavy in the air of the drafting room, a scent Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Davies had grown so accustomed to, she barely registered it anymore. Outside, the Seattle drizzle pattered against the oversized windows of the Ballard Engineering building, blurring the already muted cityscape. Ellie, her brow furrowed in concentration, hovered over a blueprint of a new high-rise, a sleek, modernist tower slated for Belltown. Her hand, guided by decades of experience, moved with practiced precision, adding a crucial detail to the HVAC system layout.

But today, the familiar rhythm felt jarring. The rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to amplify the nervous flutter in her chest. Today wasnâ€™t just another Tuesday. Today, they were going to hear the results of the city's bid for the Pioneer Square revitalization project. A project Ellie had poured her heart and soul into, meticulously drafting plans that breathed new life into the historical heart of Seattle. A project that could save Ballard Engineering from the brink.

## Setting:

The Ballard Engineering drafting room was a windowless, rectangular space on the third floor of a utilitarian office building in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Its walls were painted a dull, institutional beige, punctuated by overflowing corkboards plastered with architectural sketches, project updates, and faded photographs of past successes. Row after row of drafting tables, each equipped with a worn-out adjustable lamp and a half-eaten mug of lukewarm coffee, filled the space. The hum of computers, the clicking of mice, and the occasional muffled phone call created a constant, low-level drone. The room felt both timeless and suffocating, a place where ideas took shape, dreams were forged, and the future of Seattle was drawn, pixel by pixel, line by line. It was Ellie's domain, a messy, comfortable corner of a city constantly reinventing itself.
