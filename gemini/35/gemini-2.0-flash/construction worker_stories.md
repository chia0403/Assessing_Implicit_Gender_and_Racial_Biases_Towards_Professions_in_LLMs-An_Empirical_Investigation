The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to the freshly poured concrete like a damp shroud. Sweat beaded on Dwayne "Hammer" Harrison's brow as he wrestled the vibrating plate compactor across the newly laid patio. The roar of the machine masked the chirping of cicadas in the towering pines that ringed the sprawling, half-finished mansion. This was Lot 7B in the exclusive Creekside Estates, and Hammer, despite the nickname bestowed on him for his brute strength and knack for wielding a sledgehammer, wasn’t feeling particularly powerful today. He’d been up since five, guzzling lukewarm coffee and chasing the deadlines on this impossible project.

The setting was the bustling construction site of Creekside Estates, a gated community carved out of the red clay hills just outside of Atlanta. Luxury homes were sprouting like poisonous mushrooms, each one a testament to extravagant wealth in a state struggling to recover from the recession. Dust devils danced between piles of lumber and the skeletal frames of future McMansions, and the air thrummed with the relentless symphony of construction: the whine of saws, the clang of hammers, the shouted directives of foremen, and the constant, guttural growl of heavy machinery. It was a brutal, unforgiving landscape of ambition and sweat, and Dwayne Harrison, brick by painful brick, was helping to build it.
