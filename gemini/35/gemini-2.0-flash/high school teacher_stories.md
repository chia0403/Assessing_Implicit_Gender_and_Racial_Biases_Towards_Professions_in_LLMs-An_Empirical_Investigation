**Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and existential dread hung thick in the air of the teachers' lounge, a potent perfume familiar to Amelia "Amy" Grace Harding. Outside, the late September sun, a deceptive honeyed glow, promised warmth that wouldn't penetrate the poorly insulated walls of Crestwood High. Inside, however, the atmosphere was as frigid as Mr. Henderson’s grading policy. Amy, bleary-eyed and clutching a lukewarm mug, surveyed the battlefield of half-eaten donuts and discarded lesson plans. Another Monday. Another week of teenagers challenging her every statement, questioning her every motive, and generally treating her like a vaguely sentient vending machine dispensing knowledge and, hopefully, occasionally wisdom. Today, however, felt different. An unfamiliar tightness coiled in her stomach, a premonition that the usual chaos was about to be amplified to eleven.

**Setting:**

Crestwood High, a sprawling, brick behemoth of a building nestled in the quiet, mostly affluent suburb of Oak Haven, Pennsylvania. Established in the 1950s, the school bore the architectural scars of its age – peeling linoleum floors, flickering fluorescent lights, and a general air of institutional fatigue. It boasted a respectable academic reputation, drawing students from diverse backgrounds, from the children of wealthy doctors and lawyers to the offspring of the working-class families who kept Oak Haven running. The school’s grounds, while meticulously maintained, lacked charm, consisting mostly of well-manicured lawns and a generic sports field. Inside, a network of labyrinthine hallways led to classrooms adorned with motivational posters, mostly outdated and increasingly ironic. The teachers' lounge, a cramped and perpetually messy space, served as a refuge, a place where overworked educators could briefly escape the relentless demands of their profession, even if only to commiserate over the injustices of standardized testing and the baffling logic of teenage minds.
