## The Story Opening:

The aroma of burnt sugar, a sweet and acrid tang that clung to the damp Edinburgh air, yanked Eleanor Rose Blackwood awake. It was a smell she knew intimately, a smell that haunted her dreams as much as it perfumed her waking hours. Another batch of caramel gone wrong. Groaning, Eleanor pulled the threadbare floral duvet tighter around her shoulders, wishing, not for the first time, that her tiny flat above Blackwood's Bakery wasn’t quite so…connected.

Even with the thick stone walls, the mournful wail of her father’s frustration echoed faintly from downstairs, a low, rhythmic thrum that vibrated through the floorboards and into her very bones. He’d been chasing the perfect salted caramel recipe for months, a Sisyphean task if ever there was one. Eleanor knew she should get up, offer a word of encouragement, perhaps even lend a hand. But the thought of facing the sticky, ruined mess, the furrowed brow of her father, and the crushing weight of her own baking expectations was enough to keep her pinned beneath the covers, pretending to sleep.

Besides, the rising sun promised another long day, and Eleanor knew that before the first tourists even stumbled off the Royal Mile, she'd need to be downstairs, kneading dough, shaping croissants, and conjuring the magic that kept Blackwood's Bakery afloat.
