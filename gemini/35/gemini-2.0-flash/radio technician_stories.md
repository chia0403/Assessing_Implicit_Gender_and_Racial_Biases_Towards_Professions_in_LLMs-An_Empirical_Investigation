The hum of aging vacuum tubes was the only sound that kept Arthur Reginald Penhaligon company in the dead of night. The cramped workshop, a converted potting shed clinging to the side of the cliff overlooking the Cornish coast, was overflowing with coils of wire, disassembled radios, and the lingering scent of flux and dust. Moonlight, filtered through grime-streaked windows, illuminated a workbench cluttered with tools â€“ soldering irons, multimeters, and pliers lay scattered like fallen dominoes. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, punctuated by the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below. Tonight, however, the wind seemed to carry more than just the salty tang of the sea; there was a subtle, almost imperceptible, distortion in the air, a vibration that resonated not just in Arthur's ears, but deep in his bones. And it was coming from the old Marconi transmitter, a hulking beast of brass and copper, currently spitting static and stubbornly refusing to cooperate.
