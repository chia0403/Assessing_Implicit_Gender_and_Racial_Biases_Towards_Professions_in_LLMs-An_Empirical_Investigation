The fluorescent lights of the 'Department of Anomalous Artifacts and Unexplained Phenomena' hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins' already monotonous life. It was 3:17 AM, according to the chipped Mickey Mouse watch he’d gotten as a bonus for his five-year anniversary at the Department, and the only sound accompanying the hum was the rhythmic squeak of his mop across the polished, albeit unnervingly uneven, floor.

Barty, dressed in his regulation grey overalls and rubber boots, navigated the cavernous storage hall with practiced ease. Shelf after shelf towered above him, laden with objects that would make the hairs on a normal person's neck stand on end. A shrunken head with disturbingly lifelike eyes sat next to a cage that perpetually emitted a faint, high-pitched whine. Across the aisle, a velvet-draped box thrummed with an energy that tickled Barty's skin, a sensation he'd learned to ignore long ago.

Tonight's focus was Section Gamma-9, home to the more… *unstable* artifacts. Barty had learned to treat everything with the utmost respect, even the inanimate objects. A few months ago, he’d accidentally bumped into a ceramic gnome, and the resulting three days of incessant, polka-themed hallucinations had been enough to teach him a lesson. He sighed, pushing his mop deeper into the murky, suspiciously green puddle that had mysteriously appeared near a cage labeled, in faded Cyrillic, "Subject: Baba Yaga's… *Implement*." Whatever that was, it was definitely leaking something.
