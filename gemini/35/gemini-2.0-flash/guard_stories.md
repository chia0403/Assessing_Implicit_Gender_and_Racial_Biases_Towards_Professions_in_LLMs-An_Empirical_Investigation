## Story Opening:

The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's face, turning the sweat on his brow to stinging brine. He shifted his weight, the worn leather of his greaves creaking in protest. Another hour, maybe two, and he'd be relieved. Another two hours closer to a cool drink, a crust of bread, and the blessed oblivion of sleep. Elias traced the worn grooves of the granite gatehouse with a calloused finger, anything to distract himself from the gnawing monotony. Heâ€™d seen more excitement in a bowl of porridge than he had guarding the Western Approach of Oakhaven in the last three months.

Elias sighed, the sound lost in the buzzing chorus of cicadas in the surrounding forest. He peered out at the winding dirt track leading into the city. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the already sparse traffic. A lone merchant cart lumbered into view, pulled by a pair of weary oxen, and Elias straightened, mentally preparing himself for the routine inspection. At least it was *something*. Anything was better than nothing.

## Setting:

The Western Approach of Oakhaven was a study in quiet, rustic simplicity. Oakhaven itself, a city famed more for its sprawling oak forests and skilled woodcarvers than for its bustling trade or military might, stood nestled in the valley below. The gatehouse, a sturdy but unremarkable structure built of rough-hewn granite, was perched on a small rise overlooking the only clear passage through the dense woods. Two weathered wooden gates, reinforced with iron bands, stood ready to be slammed shut in the event of danger.

The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth. The forest pressed close on either side of the road, its green canopy a welcome respite from the harsh sun, but also a constant source of whispered anxieties. Rumors of wild creatures and bandit activity were as common as the leaves on the trees, though Elias had seen little evidence of either during his watch. Beyond the gates, the road snaked downwards, eventually leading to the sprawling farms and orchards that surrounded the city, before finally opening into Oakhaven's cobbled streets.
