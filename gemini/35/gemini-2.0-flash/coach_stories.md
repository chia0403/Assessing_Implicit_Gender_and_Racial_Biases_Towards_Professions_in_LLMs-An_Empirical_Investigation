## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Coach Eleanor “Ellie” Harding's cheeks as she adjusted the brim of her Bears cap. She pulled the worn leather gloves tighter, the ingrained scent of chalk and sweat a familiar comfort. The smell couldn't mask the sharp tang of ozone in the air, a promise of more snow to come. The digital clock on the dashboard of her aging Subaru flickered 6:03 AM. Too early. It was always too early. But if she wanted to beat the morning rush and get the ice rink prepped, she had no choice. Besides, the solitude of these pre-dawn hours was a necessary ritual, a quiet moment before the chaotic symphony of shrieking whistles and clashing skates began.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, blue-collar city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, nestled on the shores of Lake Michigan. The main setting is the **"Kenosha Comets Ice Arena,"** a weathered, utilitarian building that has seen better days. The arena, affectionately nicknamed "The Comet" by the locals, is more than just a hockey rink; it's a community hub. It hosts everything from early morning figure skating lessons to late-night beer leagues. The air perpetually smells of melted ice, disinfectant, and the lingering aroma of burnt popcorn. While not glamorous, The Comet is deeply embedded in the fabric of Kenosha, representing the grit, resilience, and unwavering passion for hockey that defines the town. Outside the arena, the city is characterized by its working-class neighborhoods, historic architecture, and the ever-present influence of the lake. The story takes place during a particularly harsh Wisconsin winter.
