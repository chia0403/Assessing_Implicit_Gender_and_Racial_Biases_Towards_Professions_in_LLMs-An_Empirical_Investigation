## The Setting:

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp fur, wood shavings, and something vaguely fishy. Sunlight, filtered through dusty panes of glass, painted uneven stripes across the worn brick floor of the Havenwood Animal Sanctuary's oldest building, the Reptile and Amphibian House. This particular section, nicknamed "The Swamp" by the staff, was a humid, close environment, alive with the croaks, clicks, and rustles of its inhabitants. Vines, both real and artificial, snaked across the walls, punctuated by the occasional basking lamp illuminating a contented lizard sunning itself on a carefully placed branch. Water trickled constantly through a miniature waterfall in the corner, feeding a shallow, murky pond where algae bloomed riotously. Outside, the sanctuary stretched for acres, a green haven of rolling hills and shaded forests, but inside The Swamp, it felt like a different world entirely.

## The Story Opening:

The first thing Dr. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth noticed wasn't the humidity, or the symphony of amphibian calls, but the overturned bucket of crickets. Tiny black bodies scattered across the floor like spilled pepper, a disastrous escape for the evening feed. Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the damp air. She knelt down, pushing stray wisps of auburn hair behind her ear, and began the painstaking task of scooping up the escapees. 

"Just my luck," she muttered under her breath, her voice tinged with a Lancashire accent that hadn't faded despite years of living in America. Today, Eleanor had planned to finally rearrange the terrarium of the Emerald Tree Boa, a notoriously temperamental reptile. But no, the cricket rebellion had to take precedence. As she diligently collected the crickets, a flicker of movement in the corner of her eye caught her attention. Something wasn't quite right. One of the Cuban Tree Frogs, usually a vibrant green, was clinging to the side of the glass, its skin mottled and dull. And its usually bright, inquisitive eyes were strangely vacant. Eleanor's heart sank. This was definitely not how she wanted to start her Tuesday.
