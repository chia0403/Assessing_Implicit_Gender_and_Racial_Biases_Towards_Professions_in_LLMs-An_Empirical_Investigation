## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the rehab center hummed a discordant tune with the rhythmic whir of the exercise bike in front of Eleanor Maeve Riley. Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the resistance knob, wincing as Mrs. Henderson, perched precariously on the seat, let out a theatrical groan.

"Oh, Dr. Riley, you're trying to kill me! At my age, you know, the hips aren't what they used to be..." Mrs. Henderson wheezed, clinging to the handlebars like a shipwreck survivor.

Eleanor plastered on her most encouraging smile, the one she reserved for patients on the brink of giving up. "Just five more minutes, Mrs. Henderson. Think of the delicious apricot tart you’ll be able to bake for your grandchildren. You wouldn’t want them to miss out, would you?"

Mrs. Henderson’s face lit up. “Apricot tart, you say? Well, alright then. Five minutes, but not a second longer. And you owe me a slice, young lady.”

Eleanor chuckled, relieved. Persuasion, it seemed, was just as vital a tool as her knowledge of anatomy and kinesiology. As Mrs. Henderson pedaled with renewed vigor, Eleanor glanced out the large window that overlooked the center's courtyard, the late afternoon sun casting long, dancing shadows.

## Setting:

**The Golden Years Rehab and Recovery Center** sprawled across a meticulously landscaped five acres in the heart of Willow Creek, Oregon. It wasn’t a luxury facility, no marble fountains or aromatherapy sessions, but it was clean, well-maintained, and staffed with a dedicated team. The main building, constructed in a vaguely Tudor style, housed the physiotherapy gym, occupational therapy suites, dining hall, and administrative offices. Connected via covered walkways were several smaller cottages designed for longer-term residents needing more intensive care.

The physiotherapy gym itself was a bright, open space, dominated by gleaming exercise equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, and a raised parallel bar. Mirrors lined one wall, reflecting the determined faces of patients, young and old, pushing their bodies to recover from injuries, surgeries, and the ravages of time. The air buzzed with the low hum of machinery, the rustle of clothing, and the hushed murmur of encouragement from the therapists working alongside their patients. A corkboard plastered with inspirational posters and “get well soon” cards added a touch of warmth to the clinical atmosphere.
