## Story Opening:

The clatter of the rain against the skylight in the attic was a percussive symphony, a chaotic rhythm perfectly mirroring the jumbled thoughts swirling inside the head of Alistair Finch. He hadn't written a single worthwhile sentence in weeks, and the deadline for his latest historical fiction, "The Serpent's Knot," was looming like a malevolent gargoyle, perched precariously on the precipice of his dwindling sanity. Alistair scrubbed a hand across his tired eyes, the scratchy stubble on his chin rasping against his palm. The aroma of stale coffee and the faint, lingering scent of pipe tobacco filled the air, clinging to the threadbare velvet armchair he occupied like stubborn memories. He glanced at the overflowing ashtray, a testament to countless hours spent staring blankly at the manuscript, a landscape of red pen marks and crossed-out phrases. "Alistair," he muttered to himself, his voice a low rumble that barely cut through the downpour, "youâ€™re losing it, old boy."

## Setting:

Alistair Finch's attic study was a testament to a life lived amongst words. Nestled in the sprawling, slightly dilapidated Victorian house he'd inherited from his eccentric Aunt Agatha in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, it was a haven of organized chaos. Books lined every wall, crammed onto overflowing shelves, stacked precariously on the floor, and even teetering on the window sill. Ancient maps, their edges frayed and their colours faded, hung askew, depicting forgotten lands and sea routes. Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the rain-streaked skylight, illuminating the eclectic collection of curiosities scattered throughout the room: a tarnished brass telescope, a fossilized ammonite, a collection of antique quills, and a faded photograph of Aunt Agatha, her eyes twinkling with mischief. The air was thick with the scent of old paper, leather, and the lingering ghosts of stories waiting to be told. Outside, the relentless rain continued to lash against the house, blurring the edges of the picturesque town below, transforming it into a watercolor painting of muted greys and blues.
