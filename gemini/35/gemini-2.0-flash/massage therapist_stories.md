The air in "The Serenity Sanctuary" hung thick with lavender and sandalwood, a carefully crafted aroma designed to coax tension from knotted muscles and worried minds. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her hands steeped in warm oil, paused, her thumbs resting gently on the taut curve of Mrs. Dubois' shoulder. Outside, the relentless drizzle of Seattle continued its dreary symphony against the large, frosted windows, but inside, a soft flute melody tinkled from hidden speakers, fighting a losing battle against the rhythmic creak of the massage table.

Amelia resumed her work, applying gentle pressure, searching for the release points that would, hopefully, unfurl the tight knot of worry she felt radiating from beneath her fingertips. The Serenity Sanctuary, nestled just off Queen Anne Avenue, was her haven, a refuge from the city's constant hum. It was more than just a job; it was a calling, a way to offer solace and healing through touch. And sometimes, Amelia suspected, a little bit of detective work, too. She just needed to figure out what had Mrs. Dubois so utterly unstrung.
