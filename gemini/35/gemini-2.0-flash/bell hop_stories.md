## Story Opening:

The clatter of a dropped ice bucket echoed in the marble-floored lobby, sharp and momentarily silencing the hushed murmur of polite conversation. Edgar Allen Pruitt, bell hop at the grand Hotel Regal, winced. He hadn't even been carrying the thing for five steps. He quickly knelt, gathering the scattered cubes with practiced efficiency, his cheeks burning a slow, painful red. Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman whose diamonds rivaled the chandeliers overhead, watched him with a barely concealed disdain that could chill a penguin.

"Really, young man," she drawled, her voice a low hum that carried surprisingly well. "One would expect a bit more grace from the Regal's staff."

Edgar swallowed, offering a tight, apologetic smile. "Terribly sorry, Madam Vandergelt. Won't happen again." He righted the bucket, a cold dread settling in his stomach. This was just the start of his Thursday, and Thursdays, Edgar had learned, were rarely kind to bell hops.

## Setting:

**The Hotel Regal, Chicago, 1938.**

The Hotel Regal was a monument to Gilded Age opulence, a towering art deco skyscraper shimmering against the grey Chicago skyline. Its lobby was a vast expanse of polished marble, adorned with towering potted palms and intricate wrought-iron details. Crystal chandeliers hung from the high, ornate ceiling, casting a warm, golden glow over the well-dressed clientele. The air buzzed with the muffled sounds of conversation, the clinking of champagne glasses, and the occasional, jarring clatter of a clumsy bell hop. Behind the mahogany reception desk, smartly uniformed clerks fielded requests with impeccable politeness. Outside, the rumble of traffic and the distant wail of a blues saxophone provided a constant, subtle soundtrack to the Regal's carefully cultivated atmosphere of luxury and refinement. It was a world of privilege and power, and Edgar Allen Pruitt, in his slightly too-tight uniform and perpetually nervous demeanor, felt acutely out of place within its gilded cage.
