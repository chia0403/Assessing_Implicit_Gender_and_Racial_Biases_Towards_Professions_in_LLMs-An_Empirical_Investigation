## Story Opening:

The hum of the autoclave, usually a comforting drone that lulled patients into a near-trance, was today a grating buzz in Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Thorne's ears. She pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint smell of antiseptic doing little to soothe the tension throbbing behind her eyes. Today, the sterilization machine felt less like a tool of hygiene and more like a tiny metal cage holding all her anxieties.

Eleanor stared out the frosted glass window of her dental surgery, ignoring the vibrant splash of autumn colours trying to penetrate the gloom. The rain, which had been a gentle drizzle when she arrived this morning, had escalated into a full-blown tempest, plastering the leaves against the panes and making the picturesque Cotswolds village look more like a scene from a gothic novel. The wind howled, rattling the sash windows of her charming, albeit drafty, practice, "The Thorne Practice: Gentle Dentistry for All," a title she now felt was a bald-faced lie. Today, gentleness felt like an impossible feat. Mrs. Gable, a notoriously anxious patient, was due in fifteen minutes for a root canal, and Eleanor felt as if she were about to perform open-heart surgery with a butter knife.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the charming, yet increasingly dreary, village of Lower Biddlecombe in the Cotswolds, England. "The Thorne Practice: Gentle Dentistry for All" is located in a converted stone cottage on the village green. The interior is designed to be comforting: soft lighting, floral wallpaper, and a soothing colour palette of blues and greens. However, the cottage, being old, has its quirks: draughty windows, uneven floors, and a constant battle against damp. The autoclave hums in the sterilisation room, which is small but functional. The waiting room is filled with well-worn copies of "Country Living" and a fish tank containing three lethargic goldfish. Outside, the village green is usually a picture postcard scene, but on this particular day, it is a windswept, rain-lashed landscape.
