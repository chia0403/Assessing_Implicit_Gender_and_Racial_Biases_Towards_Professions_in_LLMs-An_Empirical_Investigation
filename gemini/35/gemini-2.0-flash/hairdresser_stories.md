Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a hairdresser:

**Opening:**

The scent of citrus hairspray hung heavy in the air, a sweet, almost cloying perfume that clung to everything in "Tangles and Trends," from the antique barber chair salvaged from a dusty estate sale, to the meticulously curated collection of vintage hair clips displayed like jewels on a velvet tray.  Eliza Mae Beaumont, her own auburn hair pulled back into a severe, yet somehow softening, chignon, surveyed her salon with a critical eye. It was almost ten AM, and the first client was due any minute.  A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach, a familiar companion to the pre-appointment rituals of sanitizing combs, double-checking dye formulas, and mentally rehearsing the consultation questions: *What are we *really* hoping to achieve today? What secrets are hiding beneath this current style?* Today, though, the usual jitters felt amplified, heavier than usual, a reflection of the heavy clouds rolling in outside, mirroring the storm brewing in her own life.
**Setting:**

**Location:**  The story is set in Havenwood, a small, picturesque town nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Havenwood thrives on tourism, attracting visitors with its charming bed-and-breakfasts, artisan shops, and breathtaking hiking trails.

**Salon Ambiance:** "Tangles and Trends" is more than just a salon; it's Eliza's carefully crafted sanctuary.  The building itself is a converted Victorian-era cottage, painted a cheerful lavender with white trim. Inside, sunlight streams through large bay windows, illuminating the eclectic decor.  Think exposed brick walls adorned with framed vintage advertisements for hair products, mismatched antique furniture reupholstered in vibrant fabrics, and shelves overflowing with organic shampoos and conditioners.  The overall vibe is a blend of vintage charm and modern sophistication, reflecting Eliza's own unique style and personality. Soft jazz music always plays in the background, creating a relaxed and inviting atmosphere. It feels more like stepping into a friend's living room than a typical hair salon.

Hopefully, this gets you off to a good start! Let me know if you'd like any further development.
