Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a cosmetologist named Seraphina Amelia Bellweather:

**Setting:**

The humid air hung thick and heavy over Savannah, Georgia, even at seven in the morning. Spanish moss draped languidly from the ancient oaks lining Bull Street, creating dappled shadows that danced across the pastel facades of the historic buildings. The air smelled of sweet tea, blooming magnolias, and something vaguely…metallic. That, Seraphina knew, was the trolley tracks sizzling under the early morning sun. Her salon, "Bellweather Beauty," nestled in the ground floor of a beautifully preserved Victorian townhouse painted a soft, almost ethereal lavender, was just beginning to stir.

**Story Opening:**

Seraphina Amelia Bellweather hummed a gentle tune – something vaguely Ella Fitzgerald-ish, but played entirely off-key – as she unlocked the wrought-iron gate guarding the entrance to Bellweather Beauty. The scent of jasmine, which she meticulously trained to climb the trellis beside the door, washed over her. It was a small victory, a daily reaffirmation that she was building something beautiful in a place that felt perpetually on the verge of crumbling, both physically and emotionally.

She wrestled with the heavy oak door, pushing it inward with a grunt. Inside, the air was mercifully cooler, thanks to the ancient window unit struggling to maintain a semblance of chill. The salon was a haven of organized chaos. Hair dye samples lined the walls like miniature rainbows, vintage vanity mirrors reflected the early morning light, and the faint scent of lavender mingled with the sharper, more professional aroma of peroxide and hairspray.

Before she could even switch on the lights, a voice, gravelly and impatient, cut through the stillness. "Seraphina? You in there, darlin'?"

Seraphina sighed, a little puff of exasperation escaping her lips. "Good morning to you too, Mrs. Davenport. I’m here. And early, as usual." This was going to be one of *those* mornings.
