## The Setting:

The air in "Tax Haven," a small, unassuming office sandwiched between a nail salon and a struggling bookstore on Elm Street in Anytown, USA, hung thick with the scent of desperation and stale coffee. Fluorescent lights buzzed incessantly, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stacks of paperwork threatening to topple from every surface. The linoleum floor, once a cheerful blue, was now scuffed and faded, reflecting the wear and tear of countless worried feet shuffling through. Outside, the relentless drizzle mirrored the oppressive atmosphere within. It was mid-March, the dreaded heart of tax season, and Tax Haven felt less like a refuge and more like a purgatory for forms 1040 and W-2s. A vintage calculator, a relic from a bygone era, sat perched precariously on a stack of receipts, a silent testament to the unchanging dread of April 15th.

## The Opening:

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray strand of her perpetually messy auburn hair behind her ear. The rhythmic clatter of her keyboard was the only sound breaking the tense silence in the office. The blinking cursor on the monitor seemed to mock her, a digital taunt in the face of yet another convoluted tax return. She rubbed her temples, the familiar ache a constant companion during these frantic months. Mrs. Henderson, the elderly woman with the overflowing box of grocery receipts and vague recollection of charitable donations, had just left, promising to return "tomorrow, dear, maybe with a little more clarity." Amelia doubted that. She leaned back in her creaky office chair, the springs groaning in protest, and stared out the window at the dismal weather. Sometimes, she wondered if her life had become as dreary and predictable as the endless stream of tax forms she processed.
