## Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1888. Fog, thick and greasy as mutton fat, clings to the cobbled streets of Whitechapel, London. Gas lamps hiss and flicker, casting pools of sickly yellow light that barely pierce the gloom. The air smells of coal smoke, damp brick, and something vaguely metallic, a scent that hangs heavy even on clear days.

**Opening:**

Abigail Elizabeth Hawthorne pricked her finger. Again. A small crimson bead blossomed on the tip, startling against the crisp linen she was meticulously stitching. She sucked at it, the metallic tang doing little to soothe her frustration. Outside, the foghorn on the Thames bellowed a mournful cry, a sound that echoed the unease simmering in her chest. Tonight, like so many nights lately, felt different. Moreâ€¦ ominous. She glanced at the darkened window of "Hawthorne & Daughter, Tailors," the flickering gaslight reflecting back her own worried face. She should probably bolt the door, not just the usual latch, but the heavy iron bar at the bottom. These last few weeks, with the whisperings and the fear that clung to the fog like a second skin, had made her increasingly wary. She sighed, pushing aside the half-finished lining of Lord Ashworth's hunting coat. Perhaps a cup of strong tea would calm her nerves before she dared venture back into the labyrinthine world of Whitechapel.
