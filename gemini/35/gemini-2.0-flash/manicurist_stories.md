Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The salon, "La Vie en Rose," smelled perpetually of acetone and ambition. Nestled on a rapidly gentrifying street in the trendy Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, it was a kaleidoscope of blush pink walls, gold-framed mirrors, and the constant click-clack-buzz of electric nail files. Sunlight, filtered through the large front windows, dappled across the plush velvet seating, creating a hazy, almost dreamlike atmosphere. On one wall, a neon sign in looping cursive proclaimed, "Nails: The Only Accessory You Need."

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Anya Volkov hummed along to the Ariana Grande blasting softly from the salon’s hidden speakers, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her face was illuminated by the bright LED lamp positioned above the perfectly manicured hands of her client, Mrs. Eleanor Pembry, whose wrinkles were currently as deep as the San Andreas Fault. Eleanor was notoriously picky, a retired Hollywood costume designer who still dressed like she'd just stepped off a movie set, complete with oversized sunglasses, a silk scarf artfully draped around her neck, and enough jewelry to sink a small boat.

Beatrice meticulously applied a second coat of "Rose Quartz Reverie," a delicate, shimmering pink polish, her hand steady despite the three double espressos she'd already consumed that morning. "Almost there, Mrs. Pembry," she said, her voice a soothing balm. "Just a touch more sparkle and you'll be ready for your luncheon."

Eleanor Pembry peered down her nose at her nails. "It still doesn't quite capture the feeling, darling. It needs...more *oomph*."

Beatrice sighed inwardly. *Oomph*. Eleanor always wanted *oomph*. It was Beatrice's job to figure out what that meant and deliver it on ten tiny canvases.  "Perhaps a tiny crystal at the base of each nail?" she offered, her voice carefully neutral.

Eleanor tapped a perfectly sculpted nail against the armrest. "Hmm.  Intriguing... but still lacking..."

Suddenly, the salon door chimed merrily, announcing a new arrival and cutting short Eleanor's critique. Beatrice glanced up, ready to plaster on her most welcoming smile, when her blood ran cold. Standing in the doorway, looking every bit as polished and perfect as the clientele of La Vie en Rose, was *him*.

Beatrice hadn’t seen Liam Carmichael in seven years, but one look at his smug smirk and impeccably tailored suit was enough to rip open a whole can of worms that she thought she had buried alive, and then sprinkled with glitter.
