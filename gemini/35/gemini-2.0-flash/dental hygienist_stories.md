And for Gwendolyn, home meant more than just a place; it meant a community built on familiar faces, comfortable routines, and the satisfaction of keeping those smiles healthy and bright, one cleaning at a time. Today, however, a restless energy thrummed beneath the surface of her usual calm. Something felt different, like the air before a summer storm.
