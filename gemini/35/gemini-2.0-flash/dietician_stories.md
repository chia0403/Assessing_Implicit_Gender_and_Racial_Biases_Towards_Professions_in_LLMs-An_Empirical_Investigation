The insistent beep of her alarm clock ripped Amelia Stone from a dream involving a giant broccoli spear wielding a tiny sword and demanding she validate its nutritional value. Groaning, Amelia slapped the snooze button with more force than necessary. Six AM. The bane of her existence. While she preached the importance of a consistent sleep schedule to her clients, her own was a chaotic patchwork quilt of early starts, late finishes, and the occasional frantic Googling of "how to tell if cauliflower is judging you."

Amelia Stone, Registered Dietitian and owner of "Nourish & Thrive Wellness," blinked awake in her tiny Brooklyn apartment. Sunlight, what little dared to penetrate the grime-covered windows, cast dusty beams across the mismatched furniture she'd collected from various flea markets and the curb on trash day. The walls, painted a cheerful but slightly nauseating shade of avocado green by the previous tenant, were plastered with motivational posters featuring smiling fruits and vegetables. *Eat Your Way to Happiness!* one proclaimed. Amelia found the irony rather amusing.

Her apartment, perched precariously above Mario’s Pizza on Bedford Avenue, smelled faintly of stale pepperoni and hope. The aroma, usually comforting, was a stark reminder that her own breakfast consisted of a lukewarm protein shake she'd prepared three days ago. Today, though, the usual cacophony of Brooklyn street life was muted, replaced by an eerie quiet. It was a Saturday, but not the usual lazy Saturday. Something felt…different. Amelia couldn't quite put her finger on it. Maybe it was just the broccoli dream.
