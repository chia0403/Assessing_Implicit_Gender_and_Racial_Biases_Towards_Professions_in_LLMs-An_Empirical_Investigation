## Story Opening:

The scent of disinfectant and old coffee clung to the air in the breakroom, a comforting, if not particularly pleasant, aroma that marked the start of another day. Across town, the sky was beginning to bleed a watery pink, but here, in the fluorescent glare of the St. Jude’s Urgent Care, it was perpetually 8:00 AM. Eleanor “Ellie” Maeve O’Connell, a physician's assistant with a penchant for brightly colored scrubs and a no-nonsense attitude, sighed and ran a hand through her perpetually messy auburn bun. She needed caffeine, badly. The last patient of the night, a poor kid who’d stuck a crayon so far up his nose it required a minor surgical extraction (and a very stressed mother), had drained her last reserves of patience.

She reached for the nearly empty pot on the counter, its glass carafe stained a permanent brown. “Please tell me there’s at least a mouthful left,” she muttered, her voice raspy. The pot yielded only a sad, lukewarm slosh, which she poured into a chipped mug emblazoned with the slogan “World’s Okayest PA.”

Ellie took a tentative sip and grimaced. Today was going to be a long one.

## Setting:

**St. Jude’s Urgent Care, Scranton, Pennsylvania:** The facility is located on the outskirts of the city, a squat, brick building nestled between a gas station and a car wash. The interior is a mix of sterile efficiency and weary practicality. The walls are painted a calming, yet vaguely depressing, shade of pale green. The waiting room features a mismatched collection of plastic chairs, tattered magazines dating back several years, and a perpetually malfunctioning fish tank that houses a single, listless goldfish.

The exam rooms are small and functional, each containing an examination table covered in crisp white paper, a sink, a blood pressure cuff, and a scattering of medical instruments. The breakroom, located at the back of the clinic, is a cramped, windowless space that offers a brief respite from the chaos. It features a small table, a microwave covered in mysterious stains, and a perpetually overflowing trash can. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet urgency and simmering stress, a constant hum beneath the surface of routine medical procedures. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, a persistent reminder of the long hours and the endless parade of coughs, cuts, and complaints that walk through the doors.
