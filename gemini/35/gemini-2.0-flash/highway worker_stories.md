Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, featuring a highway worker as the main character:

**Setting:**

The predawn air hung thick and heavy with the smell of pine and damp earth in the Cascade Mountains of Washington state. A sliver of bruised purple hinted at the coming dawn, but for now, the world was swallowed by shadows. State Route 2, notorious for its winding curves and unpredictable weather, snaked its way through the towering evergreens. Patches of melting snow clung to the steep embankments, glistening under the amber glow of a single blinking hazard light. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic chirping of crickets and the distant rumble of a logging truck struggling up a grade.

**Story Opening:**

The orange glow of a portable heater barely managed to fight back the chill seeping into Jasper McKinley's bones. He huddled closer, cupping his gloved hands around a steaming mug of coffee that tasted suspiciously like burnt rubber. At 5:17 AM, the world felt raw and unforgiving, especially when you were staring down another twelve-hour shift patching potholes on a stretch of highway that seemed to breed them overnight. Jasper sighed, the sound a puff of white against the pre-dawn gloom. He took a swig, the bitterness of the coffee a necessary jolt. He hadn't slept well, the persistent ache in his lower back a constant reminder of the years spent wrestling with asphalt and unforgiving machinery. He glanced at the worn picture taped to the dashboard of his truck â€“ his daughter, Lily, grinning gap-toothed in a school play costume. He needed this job. Lily needed him to have this job. And right now, this blasted road needed him to fill a crater large enough to swallow a Prius whole. With a grunt, Jasper McKinley straightened, his eyes scanning the darkened road one last time. Time to get to work. The day was coming, whether he was ready for it or not.
