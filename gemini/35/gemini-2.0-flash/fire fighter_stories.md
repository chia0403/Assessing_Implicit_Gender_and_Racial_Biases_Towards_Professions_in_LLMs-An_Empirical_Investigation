## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The air hung thick and greasy over the sprawling, industrial outskirts of Port Algiers, Louisiana. Buildings here were a patchwork of corrugated iron, stained concrete, and aging brick, coughing up a perpetual haze of smoke and exhaust. The humidity clung to everything, promising a drenching afternoon downpour that would do little to wash away the grit. It was a landscape that seemed eternally on the verge of rusting, a place where the smell of brine and burning oil competed with the sweet, sickly aroma of decaying marshland.

**Story Opening:**

Sergeant Anya Mireaux slammed the heavy door of Engine 14 shut, the clang echoing across the otherwise quiet firehouse bay. She wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, smearing the grime across her forehead. Even before the alarm, even before the call, the heat had been relentless. Today felt different, though. Not just the heat, but a prickling unease that crawled beneath her skin like an errant mosquito. Sheâ€™d learned to trust that feeling. It usually meant trouble, and in Port Algiers, trouble was never far away.

She took a swig of lukewarm coffee from her chipped mug, the bitter liquid barely registering on her parched tongue. The bay doors were open, offering a framed view of the shimmering heat waves rising from the asphalt. She could hear the distant hum of the refinery, a constant, low-level thrum that vibrated in her teeth. Today, though, she couldn't shake the feeling that the hum was off-key, like a warning note played just a little too loud.
