## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and aging meat hung thick in the air, clinging to Thomas Archibald McKinley like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, a low grunt rumbling in his chest, a habit he’d cultivated over twenty years of standing behind the oak counter of McKinley & Sons Fine Meats. This morning, though, the familiar aroma wasn't comforting. It felt…ominous. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth, sharpened steel of his cleaver, the blade reflecting the pale dawn light filtering through the frosted windows. Outside, the wind howled, whipping snow against the glass with a ferocity that mirrored the churning unease in his gut. He didn't like mornings like this, mornings where the silence of the sleeping town felt heavy, expectant. Something was coming. He could feel it in the marrow of his bones.

## Setting:

The story opens in McKinley & Sons Fine Meats, a small, family-run butcher shop located in the heart of Havenwood, a secluded mountain town nestled deep within the Appalachian range. Havenwood was a place where secrets grew like moss on ancient stones, clinging to the ramshackle buildings and the taciturn faces of its inhabitants. The shop itself was a testament to simpler times. Its dark, wood-paneled walls were adorned with faded photographs of Thomas's grandfather and father, both men wielding the same cleaver he held now. String lights, strung haphazardly across the ceiling, cast a warm, flickering glow on the rows of neatly arranged cuts of meat – plump sausages, marbled steaks, and glistening roasts. A hand-painted sign above the counter, its lettering worn and cracked, proclaimed "McKinley & Sons: Providing Havenwood with the Finest Meats Since 1923." Outside, Havenwood, blanketed in a fresh layer of snow, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the storm to break.
