Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a guidance counselor:

**Setting:**

The story begins in the bustling, slightly chaotic office of the Northwood High School Guidance Department in the waning days of March. Northwood High, a public school nestled in the sleepy, upscale suburb of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, is a pressure cooker of college applications, AP exams, and simmering teenage drama. The guidance office itself is a warren of mismatched furniture, overflowing file cabinets, and inspirational posters that seem to mock the perpetual state of low-grade anxiety clinging to the air. The scent of lukewarm coffee, stale popcorn (a relic from a recent college presentation), and a faint, lingering aroma of teenage angst permeates everything. Sunlight struggles to break through the grimy windows, casting long shadows across the room as the day begins.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Penelope Hawthorne, her sensible navy blue blazer slightly askew, stared into the depths of her chipped ceramic mug, searching for answers in the swirling dregs of lukewarm chamomile tea. It wasn't working.  The answers, she knew, weren't at the bottom of a mug, but buried somewhere in the crumpled transcript of a particularly challenging senior named Damien Riley, or perhaps lost in the mountain of scholarship applications threatening to spill onto her already cluttered desk. Beatrice had been a guidance counselor at Northwood High for fifteen years, and she'd thought she'd seen it all – the tearful confessions, the rebellious outbursts, the quiet desperation masked as apathy. But this year felt different. The pressure was palpable, a thick fog that seemed to suffocate the students – and, if she were honest with herself, her too.
Damien's case was really beginning to worry her. His grades had dropped, his attendance was a mess, and his parents were both stressed and frustrated. She had to find a way to help him...and soon.

I hope that gets you off to a good start! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any part of this.
