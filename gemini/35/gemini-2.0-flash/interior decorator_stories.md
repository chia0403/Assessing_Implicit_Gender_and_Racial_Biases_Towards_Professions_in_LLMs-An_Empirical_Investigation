The stale scent of dust and neglect hung heavy in the air, a thick, suffocating blanket that Amelia Grace Thornton could practically taste. She wrinkled her nose, pulling the collar of her silk scarf higher, not that it did much to keep out the chill that seeped from the decaying grandeur of the place. Sunlight, filtered through grime-caked, gothic windows, painted weak, anemic stripes across the parquet floor of what was once, no doubt, a magnificent ballroom. Now, the floor was warped, cracked, and littered with debris: shards of forgotten chandeliers, tattered remnants of tapestries, and the skeletal remains of what looked suspiciously like a taxidermied peacock.

Amelia stood smack-dab in the center of this abandoned fairytale gone wrong, clutching her worn leather portfolio like a life raft. Her sensible, block-heeled boots crunched softly as she pivoted, taking it all in. Grey Havens Manor. It had been advertised as a "fixer-upper" in the obscure property listing, but Amelia suspected that was like calling the Titanic a "minor plumbing issue."

The Manor itself was a hulking beast of grey stone, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning, slate-colored sea. Its architecture was a confused jumble of styles - Victorian gingerbread clinging desperately to Gothic arches, a dash of Tudor half-timbering peeking out beneath a Romanesque portico. It looked like a drunken architect's fever dream.

Amelia Grace Thornton, proprietor of "Graceful Spaces, Personalized Places," had a reputation for finding beauty in the unlikeliest of places. But even she was starting to question if she'd bitten off more than she could chew with this one.
