The bell above the door of "The Good Remedy Pharmacy" chimed a cheerful, albeit slightly rusty, greeting. It was a sound that normally soothed Elias Thorne, calming the anxieties that brewed within him like a poorly mixed emulsion. But today, it only served to highlight the silence that followed. Elias, hunched over a stack of prescription forms under the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights, barely registered it.

The pharmacy itself was a microcosm of Willow Creek, Iowa - quaint, reliable, and perpetually behind the times. Oak shelves, worn smooth by generations of hands reaching for cough syrup and liniments, lined the walls. Jars of colorful, dusty hard candies sat temptingly by the register, a relic of a bygone era when a spoonful of sugar wasn't just a cliché, but a legitimate business strategy. The air, thick with the aroma of medicinal herbs, camphor, and the faintest ghost of Mrs. Henderson's lavender perfume (she’d passed away three years ago, but Elias could still swear he smelled her), hung heavy, a comforting blanket woven from years of community history.

Outside, a late October wind rustled through the bare branches of the ancient willow tree for which the town was named. The sky, a bruised purple threatening snow, mirrored the ache in Elias's chest. It had been exactly one year since... well, since everything had changed.
