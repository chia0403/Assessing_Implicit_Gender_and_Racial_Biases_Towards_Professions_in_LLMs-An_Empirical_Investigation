Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a school psychologist named Dr. Evelyn Reed:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of Northwood High School hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the daily anxieties of teenagers and the weary patience of their educators. The school itself was a sprawling brick building, a relic of the 1970s, with faded green lockers lining the hallways and a lingering aroma of cafeteria pizza and disinfectant. Outside, a wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, scattering fallen leaves against the chain-link fence that bordered the athletic field.

**Opening:**

The crumpled paper airplane, fashioned from a detention slip, landed with a soft thud on Dr. Evelyn Reed's desk. She sighed, pushing her half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee aside and picking up the offending object. "Well, that's a new one," she muttered, smoothing out the wings. Usually, it was just tissues soaked in teenage angst.

Dr. Evelyn Reed, School Psychologist, had seen it all in her fifteen years at Northwood. From garden-variety anxiety over pop quizzes to more serious cases of self-harm and suicidal ideation, she'd become a silent witness to the turbulent inner lives of hundreds of students. Today, though, felt different. The air in her small, cluttered office was thick with a premonition she couldn't quite shake. A sense that something, something bigger than a rogue paper airplane, was about to disrupt the carefully constructed order of Northwood High. The note scrawled inside the plane, in shaky, almost childish handwriting, did little to alleviate her unease. It simply read: "They're watching."
