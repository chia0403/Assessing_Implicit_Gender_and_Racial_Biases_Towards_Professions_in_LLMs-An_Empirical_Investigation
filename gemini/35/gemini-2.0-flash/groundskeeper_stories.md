Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a groundskeeper:

**Setting:**

The story opens at Oakhaven Cemetery, a sprawling necropolis nestled on the outskirts of a perpetually misty town called Havenwood. Oakhaven is no ordinary cemetery. It's ancient, its oldest stones dating back to the town's founding in the early 1700s. Towering oaks, their branches gnarled and draped with Spanish moss, give the place an air of solemn grandeur and a touch of the macabre. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and a hint of something indefinably sweet – perhaps the honeysuckle that climbs the crumbling mausoleums, or something more… spectral. The cemetery is divided into sections, each with its own character: the Old Section, with its weathered headstones and forgotten plots; the Victorian Gardens, a riot of roses and weeping willows; and the Modern Section, with its sleek, granite memorials. The main toolshed, a ramshackle structure overflowing with rakes, shovels, and the lingering scent of gasoline, sits near the main entrance.

**Story Opening:**

Elias Thorne shivered, pulling his worn wool coat tighter around himself. The Havenwood mist was particularly aggressive this morning, clinging to everything like a damp shroud. Elias, full name Elias Theodore Thorne, Grounds keeper of Oakhaven Cemetery for the past twenty years, was accustomed to the cold, the damp, and the general atmosphere of melancholy that permeated the place. But today was different. The air crackled with a strange energy, and even the usually stoic robins seemed to be chattering with an unusual urgency. He glanced at the sky, a murky grey canvas threatening rain. "Another fine day in paradise," he muttered to himself, the words barely audible above the rustling of leaves. He hefted his trusty leaf blower and began his rounds, the whine of the machine a temporary intrusion on the quiet stillness of the cemetery. It wasn't long before he found his work interrupted. Near the Blackwood mausoleum, Elias stumbled upon something that made the blood run cold in his veins. Not a neglected grave, nor a broken statue. But a flower, a single, perfectly bloomed black dahlia, placed directly on top of a recently deceased plot. The dahlia, with its velvety petals and sinister hue, was something he'd never seen before in Oakhaven. Elias knew every plant within its walls, and that black beauty was no indigenous growth. As he cautiously bent to examine it, a whisper of wind seemed to carry a single word to his ear: "Remember." And with that, Elias Thorne knew this was no ordinary day in Oakhaven.
