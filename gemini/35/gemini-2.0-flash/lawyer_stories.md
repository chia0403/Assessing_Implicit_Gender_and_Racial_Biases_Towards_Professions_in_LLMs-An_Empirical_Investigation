The humid Georgia air, thick as swamp gas, clung to Arthur Cornelius Penhaligon as he stepped out of the Glynn County Courthouse. He loosened his tie, the knot suddenly feeling like a garrote, and tugged at the damp collar of his shirt. The midday sun hammered down on St. Simons Island, reflecting blindingly off the white gravel paths that crisscrossed the manicured lawns. A symphony of cicadas buzzed relentlessly, adding to the sense of suffocating heat.

Arthur ran a hand through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair, a gesture that was becoming increasingly habitual these days. He'd just suffered another defeat in the courtroom, representing a crab fisherman accused of poaching in protected waters. The evidence had been circumstantial, flimsy even, but the jury had been swayed by the prosecution’s theatrical outrage and the local sentiment against anyone who “stole” from the delicate coastal ecosystem. 

He walked slowly towards his vintage powder-blue Cadillac, parked under the shade of a sprawling live oak. The Spanish moss hanging from its branches stirred in the slight breeze, casting dancing shadows on the car's gleaming hood. Arthur’s office, Penhaligon & Daughters, was a small, two-story building just a few blocks from the courthouse. The downstairs held the main office and his daughters' offices, while Arthur had his own separate office upstairs. He wasn't sure he could face his daughters, both sharp and capable lawyers in their own right, just yet. He’d rather wallow in his failure in the solitude of his cluttered upstairs office, surrounded by stacks of yellowed legal texts and half-finished crosswords. Maybe, just maybe, a cold glass of sweet tea and the gentle whir of his ancient ceiling fan could soothe his frayed nerves and offer a glimmer of inspiration for his next case.
