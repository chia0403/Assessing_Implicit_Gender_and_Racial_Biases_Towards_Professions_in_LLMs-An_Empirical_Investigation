## The Dust of Secrets

**Setting:** The sprawling, slightly decaying grandeur of Thorne Manor, nestled in the perpetually overcast hills of the Scottish Highlands. Think imposing grey stone, dripping with ivy, overlooking a windswept moor dotted with skeletal trees. Inside, the air hangs thick with the scent of beeswax, old paper, and something indefinably ancient. The grand hall, once a beacon of warmth and laughter, now echoes with the whispers of history and the silence of a family dwindling into obscurity.

**Opening:**

Agnes Moira MacMillan sighed, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic hiss of her Hoover. Dust motes, disturbed by her efforts, danced in the weak sunlight that managed to squeeze through the grimy windows of the Thorne Manor library. Three generations of Thorne men, rendered in stern portraits above her head, seemed to disapprove of her presence. Agnes ignored them, as she always did. They’d never lifted a finger in their lives, most likely, and she had a manor the size of a small village to keep in order.

Today, it was the library's turn. Years of neglect had transformed the once-pristine mahogany shelves into veritable dust traps. Agnes attacked them with the fervor of a seasoned warrior, her feather duster a weapon against the encroaching decay. She didn’t begrudge the work; it was honest, and it paid the bills. Besides, there was a strange comfort in the quiet solitude of the Manor, a feeling of being a silent observer to the secrets it held.

She paused, running a calloused finger along the spine of a particularly thick, leather-bound volume. *The Collected Poems of Alistair Thorne, 1888.* Alistair Thorne, the melancholic ancestor who’d supposedly penned tragic odes to lost love and the wild beauty of the Highlands. Agnes had never met a Thorne who was anything other than aloof and vaguely disappointed in everything. She pulled the book from the shelf, intending to dust it properly, but as she did, something slipped out from behind it, landing with a soft thud on the worn Persian rug at her feet. It wasn't a bookmark. It was a key. A small, ornate key, tarnished with age, and undeniably out of place. Agnes bent down, a flicker of curiosity, a spark of something other than mere duty, igniting within her. What lock did this key open? And what secrets lay hidden behind it, waiting to be uncovered in the dusty heart of Thorne Manor?
