Okay, here's a story opening and setting with an auto mechanic as the main character:

**Setting:**

The year is 2042. The setting is a bustling, neon-drenched city called Neo-Kyoto, built on the reclaimed lands of the former Japanese coastline. Flying vehicles are common, weaving between towering skyscrapers that pierce the perpetually overcast sky. Ground-level streets are a chaotic mix of traditional ramen stalls and holographic advertisements for cybernetic enhancements.  Air quality is perpetually poor, despite the city's constant efforts at carbon capture. The dominant culture is a blend of hyper-modern technology and traditional Japanese values, often creating a fascinating and sometimes jarring contrast. The air hums with the electric thrum of a city perpetually on the move.

**Story Opening:**

The wrench slipped, scraping across the titanium chassis with a sound that made Etsuko Tanaka grit her teeth. Another mark on the already battered hover-coupe. "Damn it!" she muttered, her voice barely audible over the roar of a passing sky-bus. Neo-Kyoto never slept, and neither, it seemed, did its malfunctioning vehicles.

Etsuko, sweat slicking her brow beneath the grime and anti-grav grease, shoved a stray strand of her cobalt blue hair behind her ear. The neon glow of her auto-repair shop, Tanaka Motors, painted her small frame in a pulsating mosaic of color. The shop itself was a squeezed-in pocket of analog amidst the digital frenzy of Neo-Kyoto: cluttered with real tools, greasy rags, and salvaged parts – a defiant island of practicality in a sea of fleeting trends.

She’d been wrestling with this particular vehicle, a vintage 2030 Mitsu-Glide, for the better part of fourteen hours. Its anti-grav coils had fried, likely due to some cheap black-market upgrade the owner had installed. Etsuko hated working on these old relics, but they were the only thing keeping her business afloat. Most people preferred the sleek, automated self-repair systems of the newer models, but every so often, someone needed a mechanic with *real* skill, someone who understood the grit and grease that held these machines together.
