The insistent chirping of Gertrude "Gertie" Ainsworth's parakeet, Percy, dragged her from the clinging tendrils of a dream where she was inexplicably ballroom dancing with a sentient stapler. Groaning, Gertie smacked her bedside table until she found the offending alarm clock and silenced it. 6:15 AM. Time to face the music, or rather, the dictation.

The setting was Gertie's tiny, one-bedroom apartment in the "up-and-coming" (according to the overly enthusiastic real estate agent) neighborhood of Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn. It was a charmingly dilapidated space, all exposed brick and drafty windows, furnished with a mismatched collection of hand-me-downs and thrift store finds. Sunlight, filtered through grime-coated panes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air. A half-finished crossword puzzle lay abandoned on the floral-patterned coffee table, next to a stack of paperbacks with titles like "Mysteries of the Nile" and "The Secret Life of Gertrude Stein" â€“ Gertie's escapes from the daily grind. The air smelled faintly of lavender potpourri and stale coffee, a fragrant cocktail that perfectly encapsulated Gertie's life: a blend of quiet ambition and stubborn routine.
