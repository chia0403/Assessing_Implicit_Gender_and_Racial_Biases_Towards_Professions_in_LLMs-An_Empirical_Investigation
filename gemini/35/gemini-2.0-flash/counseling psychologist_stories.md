## The Story Opening:

The chipped porcelain of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's mug warmed her hands, a small comfort against the chill radiating from the oversized window. It was 6:00 AM, the city barely awake, and the only sounds were the low hum of the building's ventilation system and the frantic chirping of a robin perched on a fire escape across the alleyway. Eleanor watched the robin, feeling a kinship to its frantic energy. She needed to be just as persistent, just as loud, to break through the thick fog of anxiety threatening to engulf her.

Yesterday's session with Mrs. Davison was still clinging to her like a damp, wool blanket. The woman's quiet despair, the way she spoke about her life as if it were a faded photograph, had burrowed its way under Eleanor's skin. Sometimes, the weight of other people's pain felt almost unbearable. She took a long, slow sip of her coffee, hoping the caffeine would kick in and silence the echo of Mrs. Davison's voice in her head. Today was Wednesday. Today, she had to be present, focused, and ready to face whatever walked through her office door. Today, she needed to remember why she did this.

## The Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's private practice, "Sanctuary Counseling," is located on the fourth floor of a renovated brownstone in the heart of Park Slope, Brooklyn.** The building's brick exterior is softened by ivy creeping up the side, hinting at the comfort and growth that Eleanor hopes to foster within.

Inside, the waiting room is painted a calming shade of pale green, accented by warm oak furniture and carefully chosen artwork depicting nature scenes. A small fountain gurgles softly in the corner, its gentle sound intended to soothe anxious nerves. The scent of lavender essential oil hangs lightly in the air.

Eleanor's office itself is smaller, more intimate. A comfortable armchair and loveseat face each other, separated by a low coffee table covered with a woven rug. Sunlight streams through the large window, illuminating the rows of books that line one wall - psychology textbooks, self-help guides, and even a few well-worn novels. A framed photograph of Eleanor hiking in the Adirondacks sits on her desk, a reminder of the restorative power of nature and a connection to the world outside the city. The space is meticulously organized, but not sterile; a few personal touches, like a hand-painted ceramic bird on the windowsill and a worn teddy bear tucked into the corner of the loveseat, add a touch of warmth and vulnerability.
