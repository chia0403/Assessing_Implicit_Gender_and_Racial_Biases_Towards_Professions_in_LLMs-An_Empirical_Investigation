The chipped porcelain of Mrs. Gable's toilet bowl reflected the harsh fluorescent light of her cramped bathroom, a blinding, sickly glow that made Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield squint. The air hung thick and heavy, a pungent cocktail of floral potpourri and something vaguely reminiscent of wet dog. Bart knelt awkwardly on the checkered linoleum, his trusty wrench digging uncomfortably into his thigh. Mrs. Gable, a woman whose floral housecoat seemed to have been designed by a committee of garden gnomes, hovered nervously in the doorway, a teacup trembling precariously in her hand. 

This was his least favorite kind of job: elderly customers, finicky fixtures, and the pervasive feeling that one wrong move would unleash a flood of biblical proportions. Bart Butterfield, master plumber (according to the fading lettering on his van), sighed, the sound swallowed by the gentle gurgle emanating from the bowels of the offending commode. He muttered under his breath, "Just another Tuesday in suburban purgatory."
