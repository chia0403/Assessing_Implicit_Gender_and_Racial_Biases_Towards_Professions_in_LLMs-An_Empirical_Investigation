## The Setting:

The air in the Vale of Avondale clung thick and heavy, smelling of damp earth and the sharp, metallic tang of worked stone. Sunlight, struggling to penetrate the ever-present mist that draped the valley, painted the rugged peaks surrounding the small village in shades of grey and ochre. Avondale, nestled against the foothills of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains, was a place carved from the land itself. Its houses, squat and sturdy, were built from the grey granite quarried from the mountainside, their roofs thatched with tough, wind-resistant reeds. The constant rhythm of hammer against stone was the village's heartbeat, a sound as familiar as the bleating of sheep on the slopes above. At the heart of the village, a rough-hewn square, stood the Stonecutter’s Guild, a sprawling complex of workshops, storage sheds, and a bustling market where newly carved gargoyles, lintels, and milestones were traded with travelers and merchants from the lowlands.

## The Story Opening:

Bartholomew Silas Blackwood stood ankle-deep in granite dust, the rhythmic *thwack* of his hammer against the chisel a steady counterpoint to the relentless drizzle. He wasn't carving gargoyles today, nor any grand monument. Instead, he was wrestling with a particularly stubborn block of grey granite, slowly shaping it into a simple headstone. Bartholomew, a man whose face was etched with the same rugged lines as the mountains he worked, paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He was a man of few words and immense patience, a stone cutter whose skills were whispered about with reverence throughout the Vale. But even for Bartholomew Silas Blackwood, this stone felt… different. It resisted his every blow, whispering back with a dull thud that echoed the growing unease in his gut. He glanced up at the grey sky, a premonition settling heavy upon him. This wasn't just any stone; it felt like a harbinger of something far more significant, something darker, brewing on the horizon.
