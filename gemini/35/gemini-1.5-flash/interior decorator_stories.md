The scent of old varnish and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Aurelia "Rella" Davenport truly appreciated.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windows of the abandoned Victorian mansion.  Rella, her sensible beige trousers dusted with a fine layer of plaster, ran a gloved hand along the crumbling cornice, the fragile detail crumbling further beneath her touch.  The house, a gothic behemoth named Blackwood Manor, sprawled before her, a testament to faded grandeur and untold secrets, its skeletal branches of wrought iron clinging to the decaying stone like skeletal fingers. This wasn't just another renovation project for Rella Davenport, Interior Design; this was a challenge, a whisper of a haunting, and possibly, the biggest risk of her career.
