Augustus himself, a man whose age was as carefully concealed as the secrets whispered behind closed doors of the Blackwood Hotel, polished it with a practiced hand, his reflection a blurry ghost in the dark tarnished surface.  Rain lashed against the arched windows of the lobby, a relentless, melancholic rhythm that matched the drumming of his own weary heart. The Blackwood, once a jewel of Victorian elegance, now stood on the precipice of decay, its grandeur masked by a thin veneer of faded opulence.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the stained-glass ceiling, illuminating the chipped marble floors and the threadbare velvet of the ancient armchairs.  The scent of damp wool and lingering pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Augustus seemed to truly appreciate.  Tonight, however, even the familiar aroma couldn't quite mask the unsettling prickle of unease that had settled over him like a shroud.
