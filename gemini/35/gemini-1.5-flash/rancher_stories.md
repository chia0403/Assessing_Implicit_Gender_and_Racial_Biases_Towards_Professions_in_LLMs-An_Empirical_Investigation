The wind, a rasping, gritty thing, clawed at Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed his kingdom.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the parched expanse of the Double T Ranch, their whirling silhouettes mocking the stillness of the midday sun.  The Texas sky, a vast, unyielding blue, offered no promise of rain; the cracked earth beneath Elias’s worn boots echoed the despair that gnawed at his heart.  He’d seen droughts before, of course – thirty years on this land had taught him the brutal rhythms of nature – but this one felt different, a slow, relentless strangulation choking the life from everything he held dear.  The cattle, gaunt and listless, huddled in the scant shade offered by the skeletal mesquite trees, their ribs a grim testament to the failing pasture. Even the usually boisterous crows seemed subdued, their cawing a mournful whisper on the wind.
