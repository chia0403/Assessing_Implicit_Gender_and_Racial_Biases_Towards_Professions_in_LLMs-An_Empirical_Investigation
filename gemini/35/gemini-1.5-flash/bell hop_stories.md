The brass spittoon glinted under the flickering gaslight, reflecting the weary slump of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shoulders.  Barty, a bellhop at the Grand Majestic Hotel, a crumbling behemoth of Gilded Age grandeur clinging precariously to its former glory on the edge of  New Orleans’ French Quarter, sighed.  The air hung thick and humid, a cloying blend of jasmine, stale beer, and the faint, unsettling sweetness of decay.  Rain hammered against the stained-glass windows of the hotel lobby, a relentless percussion accompanying the mournful strains of a distant jazz funeral.  Dust motes, illuminated by the gaslight's weak glow, danced in the oppressive stillness between the sporadic bursts of raucous laughter from the hotel bar and the rhythmic creak of the ancient elevator shaft. Tonight, however, the usual symphony of the Grand Majestic felt… off.  A dissonant note vibrated in the air, a feeling as heavy and oppressive as the impending storm.
