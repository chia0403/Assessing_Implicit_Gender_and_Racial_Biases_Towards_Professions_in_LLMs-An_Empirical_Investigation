The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp concrete clinging to her wool coat.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered her unruly curls to her forehead, obscuring the sharp angles of her cheekbones â€“ angles that often found their way into her meticulously crafted sketches.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs, a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost garish, neon signs illuminating the bohemian heart of Greenwich Village.  Amelia, a graphic designer whose apartment overlooked Washington Square Park, was late.  Terribly, spectacularly late.  And not for a gallery opening or a client meeting, but for something far more important: the annual Village Halloween Costume Parade.
