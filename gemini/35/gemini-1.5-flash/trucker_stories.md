The biting Montana wind howled a mournful song around Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's rig, rattling the windows of his battered Kenworth like a skeleton shaking its bones.  Snow, thick and unrelenting, plastered itself against the cab, obscuring the already dwindling light of the late afternoon.  Zeke, his face etched with the deep lines of a man who'd stared down too many blizzards and too many lonely stretches of highway, wrestled the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather.  The engine groaned, a weary beast struggling against the onslaught of the storm, as he navigated the treacherous, snow-covered pass leading into the desolate expanse of the Beartooth Mountains.  Ahead, only the swirling white void offered any clue to the road's unforgiving path.  The radio crackled with static; the only company Zeke had for the next few hundred miles was the relentless howl of the wind and the gnawing anxiety that something – or someone – might be waiting for him in the heart of the storm.
