The biting November wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Blackwood Lane, whipping Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s already-chapped lips raw.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs as she wrestled a stubborn section of conduit into place, the metal cold against her gloved fingers. The air smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar scent in the sleepy, almost forgotten village of Oakhaven, where time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace – a pace that was utterly infuriating when you were already three hours behind schedule on a critical job.  The flickering gaslights of the village cast long, dancing shadows, making the already eerie atmosphere seem even more unsettling, a stark contrast to the bright, buzzing energy usually humming around Amy and her tools. Tonight, however, even the electricity felt reluctant, hesitant to cooperate with her frantic efforts.
