Amelia Hernandez, a veteran flight attendant with a weary smile etched onto her face, adjusted the tiny, silver nametag pinned to her crisp, navy blue uniform.

Outside, a blizzard raged, a swirling white fury that promised delays and, more importantly, irate passengers.  Amelia sighed, the sound swallowed by the low hum of the airportâ€™s mechanical heart and the distant, muffled roar of a jet engine powering up for its transcontinental flight.  Tonight, it was Chicago.  Tonight, it was a flight to nowhere, at least for Amelia.  Nowhere except the next stressful encounter with the human condition, crammed into a metal tube thirty thousand feet in the air.
