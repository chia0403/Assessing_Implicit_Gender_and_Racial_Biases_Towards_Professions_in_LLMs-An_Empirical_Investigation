The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, baking the sweat already clinging to his skin.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat rising from the asphalt, blurring the already indistinct lines of the Nevada desert stretching endlessly to the horizon.  The air hung heavy, thick with the smell of diesel fumes and the acrid tang of burnt rubber â€“ a familiar perfume for a man who spent his days wrestling with broken-down semis and impatient drivers on US Route 93, a ribbon of blacktop that cut a lonely swathe through the heart of nowhere.  Elias, a veteran highway maintenance worker with calloused hands and a sun-weathered face that seemed carved from the very rock surrounding him, squinted at the distant dust cloud approaching from the west.  Another one.  Another potential headache on this already sweltering Tuesday.
