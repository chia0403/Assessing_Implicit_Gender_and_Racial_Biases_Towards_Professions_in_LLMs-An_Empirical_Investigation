The sterile scent of antiseptic, usually a comfort to Dr. Elias Thorne, felt suffocating tonight.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of his penthouse apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  From his balcony, the glittering cityscape of Hong Kong sprawled below, a million pinpricks of light against the inky canvas of the night. But Elias saw none of it.

The silence, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain, pressed in on him, heavy and suffocating as the humid air clinging to the city below.  He hadnâ€™t slept properly in days, the weight of a recent, complicated surgery pressing down on his soul like a physical burden.
