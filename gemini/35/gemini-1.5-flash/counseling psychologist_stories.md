The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room seemed to sigh under the weight of another Tuesday afternoon.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air like tiny, troubled spirits.  The scent of stale coffee and something faintly floral – possibly lilies, attempting a valiant but ultimately doomed struggle against the pervasive aroma of damp carpet – hung heavy.  Eleanor, a woman whose own carefully constructed composure often felt as fragile as those dust motes, sat behind her worn oak desk, her gaze fixed on the meticulously organized files stacked before her.  Each file represented a life fractured, a mind grappling with its own internal storm.  Today, the storm seemed particularly fierce.  The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a tiny hammer blow against the quiet anticipation that thrummed beneath the surface of the seemingly tranquil room.
