The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar blanket for Eleanor Vance, Head Librarian of the Blackwood County Historical Archives.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness of the reading room.  Outside, a relentless November rain lashed against the gothic stone walls, a soundtrack to the quiet symphony of Eleanor's work.  The building itself, a relic of a bygone era, seemed to breathe history, its every creak and groan a whispered tale waiting to be unearthed.  Today, however, the usual peaceful hum of research was punctuated by a sharp, insistent rapping at the heavy oak door, a sound that shattered the afternoon's quietude and promised something far from the usual dusty delights of Eleanor's domain.
