The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Evelyn Reed's Sunflower Class!" sign peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the way the August heat seemed to shimmer off the asphalt playground.  Evelyn Reed, a woman whose smile lines spoke volumes of patience and slightly less of sleep, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye.  The sandbox, a testament to a hundred tiny hands' industriousness, was currently a chaotic landscape of half-buried plastic dinosaurs and abandoned castles.  The climbing frame, usually a hub of squealing activity, stood eerily silent in the midday sun.  Today, however, the usual cacophony was absent, replaced by a heavy, humid stillness that hung thicker than the scent of sunscreen and freshly mown grass.  This wasn't the usual pre-nap quiet. This wasâ€¦ different.
