The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tap-tap-tap of Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured nails against the polished mahogany desk.  Penelope, or Penny as only a select few dared to call her, adjusted the pristine silk scarf at her throat, a vibrant splash of turquoise against the stark, beige landscape of her reception area.  The air, thick with the scent of expensive coffee and something faintly floral – probably Mrs. Gable's perfume, the CEO's assistant, and a potent blend of ambition and desperation – hung heavy in the otherwise spotless space.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad against the towering glass façade of the Zenith building, a stark contrast to the carefully cultivated calm within. Today, however, even Penny's meticulously organized world felt poised on the edge of chaos.  The CEO was late, the coffee machine was malfunctioning, and a particularly persistent telemarketer was relentlessly trying to break through the automated phone system. This was going to be a long day.
