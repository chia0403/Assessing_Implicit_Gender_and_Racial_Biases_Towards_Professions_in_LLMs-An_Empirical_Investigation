The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn “Evie” Reed’s battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-obscured windows.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, a jagged tapestry of snow-laden peaks and shadowed valleys, clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  The only visible light emanated from the tiny, isolated village of  Qilak, a cluster of brightly colored houses clinging precariously to the edge of a frozen fjord, looking for all the world like a scattering of fallen stars.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, checked her instruments one last time, the needle of the altimeter stubbornly refusing to climb above 3,000 feet.  The storm, a snarling beast of snow and wind, was pushing her back, testing her limits, and the lives of the two passengers huddled silently behind her depended on her ability to outwit it.
