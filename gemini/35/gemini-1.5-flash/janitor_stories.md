The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Memorial Museum hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Amelia Katherine Finch's mop bucket wheels on the polished terrazzo floor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the beams as Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, methodically worked her way through the echoing halls.  The museum, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and imposing gargoyles, stood silent and still under the cloak of a pre-dawn gloom, its treasures locked away in secure vaults, awaiting the arrival of the day's visitors.  The only sound besides Amelia's cleaning was the occasional mournful sigh of the ancient building, settling slowly into its centuries-old slumber.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier, charged with an almost palpable unease.
