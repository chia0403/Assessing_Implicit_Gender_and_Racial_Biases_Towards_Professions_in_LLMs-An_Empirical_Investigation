The acrid smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in Elias Thorne's world.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights of the drafting room, danced in the stagnant air like tiny, frantic spirits. Elias, meticulously tracing a fine line with his technical pen across a sheet of vellum, barely registered their frenetic ballet.  The rhythmic scratch of his pen was the only soundtrack to his existence, a steady counterpoint to the low hum of the aging air conditioning unit fighting a losing battle against the summer heat. Outside, the city of Birmingham thrummed with a life Elias only glimpsed through the grime-streaked window â€“ a world of car horns and bustling crowds, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost monastic silence of his drafting table in the back room of  Archimedes & Sons Architectural Design.  The year was 1963, and the blueprints Elias was working on were for a new municipal library, a project that felt as monumental and enduring as the weight of the world on his shoulders.
