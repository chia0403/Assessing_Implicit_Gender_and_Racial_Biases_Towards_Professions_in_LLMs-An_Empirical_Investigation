The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She stood perched on the jagged rocks of Widow’s Point, the wind whipping her auburn hair into a frenzy around her as wild as the storm brewing on the horizon.

Before her, the canvas – propped precariously against a wind-battered boulder – seemed dwarfed by the overwhelming grandeur of the scene.  Aurelia, however, felt no intimidation; instead, a familiar thrill pulsed through her, a potent mix of fear and exhilaration that always preceded her most powerful works.  This tempest, this raw, untamed beauty, was her muse.  The small, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled in the crook of the rocky coast, lay behind her, its twinkling lights a mere counterpoint to the drama unfolding before her eyes.
