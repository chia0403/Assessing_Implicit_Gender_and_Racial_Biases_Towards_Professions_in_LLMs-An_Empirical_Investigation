The salt spray stung Aurelia “Rel” Davenport’s face as she wrestled the stubborn For Sale sign into the wind-whipped sand.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the turbulent Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered clapboard of the beachfront property.  Rel, a real estate agent whose tan spoke volumes about her dedication (or perhaps just her unfortunate susceptibility to sunburn), muttered a string of colorful curses under her breath. This wasn't just any beachfront property; it was *The Mariner's Rest*, a sprawling Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the ocean, and it had been sitting on the market for longer than Rel cared to remember.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, held a peculiar stillness, broken only by the relentless roar of the waves and the mournful cry of a distant gull.  This wasn't just a sale; it was a battle against the elements, the market, and perhaps, something far more sinister.
