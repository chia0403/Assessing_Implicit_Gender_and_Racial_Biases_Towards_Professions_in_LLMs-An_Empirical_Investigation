The rasp of granite against steel was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  For thirty years, the rhythmic screech had echoed through the grey, windswept quarry of Penhaligon Moor, a constant counterpoint to the mournful cry of gulls wheeling overhead.  Elias, his hands gnarled and stained the colour of rust, worked with a patient intensity born of generations of stone cutters before him.  The biting Cornish wind whipped at his thick wool coat, doing little to penetrate the chill that settled deeper than the bone, a chill that stemmed not from the weather, but from the weight of a secret he carried â€“ a secret buried as deep as the granite he hewed from the earth. The quarry itself, a gaping maw in the moorland, seemed to hold its breath, waiting, as Elias did, for the coming storm.
