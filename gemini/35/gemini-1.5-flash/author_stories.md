The chipped paint of the lighthouse keeper's cottage flaked like dying skin in the relentless Atlantic wind.  Rain, a fine, icy drizzle that stung Amelia Blackwood's cheeks, plastered her unruly auburn curls to her forehead.  Amelia, author of the bestselling "Whispers of the Sea" trilogy, hadn't expected such a bleak welcome to the remote island of Aisling.  The dramatic cliffs, usually a source of inspiration, felt more like menacing giants tonight, their silhouettes jagged against the bruised purple sky.  The only sound louder than the wind was the mournful cry of gulls, a soundtrack to her growing sense of unease.  She clutched her battered leather satchel closer, the manuscript of her fourth novel – a chilling tale of isolation and forgotten secrets – tucked safely inside.  This trip to Aisling, a retreat intended to spark her creativity, felt less like an escape and more like a descent into something… darker.
