The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under the weight of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hand, the tremor mirroring the anxious flutter in her stomach.  Amelia, or Amy as most of the perpetually-hungry regulars at the Rusty Mug Diner called her,  carefully balanced a precarious stack of diner plates – two short stacks, one order of biscuits and gravy threatening to avalanche, and a single, lonely plate of eggs over easy – on her forearm. The air hung thick with the aroma of frying bacon and burnt coffee, a familiar perfume she’d come to associate not with disgust, but with the comforting predictability of another Friday night shift in the heart of Harmony Creek, a town whose charm was only slightly overshadowed by its chronic lack of ambition.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the peeling maroon vinyl booths and the faded photographs of local sports teams tacked haphazardly to the walls.  Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the diner’s grimy windows, a soundtrack to the low murmur of conversations and the clanging of cutlery.
