The scent of Bay Rum and old leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. Elias, proprietor of Thorne's Traditional Barbershop, ran a hand over the worn mahogany countertop, the grain smooth beneath his calloused fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window, danced in the quiet stillness of the shop.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of tires, the blare of a distant siren – was muted, swallowed by the thick, sound-dampening walls of the century-old building.  This was a sanctuary, a pocket of calm in the chaotic heart of New Birmingham, a place where the only sharp edges were those of Elias's meticulously honed straight razors.
