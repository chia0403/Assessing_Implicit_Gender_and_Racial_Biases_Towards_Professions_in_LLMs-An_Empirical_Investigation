The dawn painted the eastern sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, a stark contrast to the damp, grey chill clinging to the dew-kissed grass beneath Elara Vance's worn work boots.  Elara, a landscaper with hands as rough as bark and eyes the colour of a summer sky, stretched, her muscles protesting the early hour.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, hung heavy around her as she surveyed her current project:  a sprawling, neglected Victorian estate nestled deep within the whispering woods of Blackwood Manor.  Ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed at the crumbling stone walls, while overgrown rhododendrons choked the once-grand gardens, their blooms a riot of faded, melancholic hues.  This wasn't just a landscaping job; it felt more like an archaeological dig, unearthing the ghosts of a forgotten beauty.
