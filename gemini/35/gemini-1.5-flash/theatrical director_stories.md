Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of moonlight slicing through a grimy skylight, danced in the cavernous space.

The Blackwood, once a jewel of the city's theatrical scene, was now a crumbling monument to forgotten ambition, and Kit, its reluctant custodian, felt its decay mirroring her own.
