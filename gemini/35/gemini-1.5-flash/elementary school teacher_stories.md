The chipped paint of the fourth-grade classroom seemed to sigh with the weight of another Monday morning.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun struggling through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the still air.  Miss Eleanor Vance, a woman whose auburn braid had seen more years than the school building itself, stood poised at her cluttered desk, a half-eaten apple core resting beside a stack of meticulously graded papers. The scent of stale coffee and impending rain hung heavy, a familiar prelude to the chaotic symphony of twenty-eight eight-year-olds about to burst through the door.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree scraped against the windowpanes, a mournful counterpoint to the nervous flutter in Eleanor's stomach.  This wasn't just any Monday; today was the day the new principal, Mr. Fitzwilliam, was conducting his first official classroom observation.
