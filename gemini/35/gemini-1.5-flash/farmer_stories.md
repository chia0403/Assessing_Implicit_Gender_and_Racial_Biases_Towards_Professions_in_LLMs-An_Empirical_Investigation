The biting wind, a cruel caress from the North Sea, whipped across Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Winter had arrived early this year on the bleak, windswept coast of Northumberland, clinging to the rugged landscape like a stubborn beggar refusing to relinquish his hold.  Elias, his breath puffing out in ragged white clouds, adjusted the thick wool scarf around his neck, the grey wool scratching against his chapped skin. The Thorne family farm, nestled between the unforgiving grey expanse of the sea and the equally unforgiving, rocky hills, was a testament to generations of stubborn resilience.  The grey stone farmhouse, its windows like dark eyes staring out at the turbulent ocean, seemed to huddle against the wind, as if fearful of being swept away.  This year, however, the fear felt a little more justified.  The harvest had been poor, the meagre yield barely enough to see them through the winter months. And a new threat, colder and more insidious than the winter wind, was beginning to blow.
