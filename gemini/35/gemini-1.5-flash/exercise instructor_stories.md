The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez like a second skin.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, reflecting the neon glow of the “Body Blast” sign flickering above the entrance to Fitness First.  It was 6:00 AM, and the pre-dawn darkness outside pressed against the panoramic windows, a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost manic energy that crackled within the gym. Amy adjusted the microphone clipped to her sleek, sweat-wicking tank top, the faint scent of lavender and lemon from her pre-workout spray battling the ever-present aroma of stale sweat and chlorine.  Today’s 6:30 AM bootcamp was shaping up to be a monster; she could already see the determined glint in the eyes of her regulars gathered near the mirrored wall, a silent promise of grueling sets and shared pain. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the bass from the upcoming Zumba class vibrated through the floor, a prelude to the chaotic symphony of exertion about to commence.
