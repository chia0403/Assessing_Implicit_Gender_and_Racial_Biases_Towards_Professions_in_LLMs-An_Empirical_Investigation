The rasp of Elias Thorne's plane sang a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the relentless screech of gulls overhead.  Salt spray, thick as a shroud, clung to the rough-hewn timbers of his workshop, a ramshackle affair perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The wind, a tireless sculptor, had carved the wood of the building itself into fantastical shapes, mirroring the chaotic beauty of the storm-tossed ocean below.  Elias, his face weathered and lined like the ancient driftwood scattered along the shore, worked with a practiced hand, his calloused fingers dancing over the stubborn oak.  The air, thick with the scent of sawdust and brine, carried the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ a scent Elias had, sadly, grown accustomed to.  This wasn't just any carpentry; this was coffin-making, a grim trade in a grim corner of the world.
