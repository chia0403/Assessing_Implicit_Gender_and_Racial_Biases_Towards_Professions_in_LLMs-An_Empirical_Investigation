The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Grace Holloway, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the triple-layered fleece she wore.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, danced in the ethereal twilight, illuminating the stark, white expanse of the McMurdo Station research base.  The air, thin and frigid, tasted of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of sea ice.  Evelyn, hunched against the gale, wrestled with a recalcitrant satellite dish, its antenna stubbornly refusing to align with the faint signal she’d been chasing for months.  The silence, broken only by the wind’s relentless shriek and the occasional groan of the station’s aging infrastructure, pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant, chaotic data she hoped to capture from deep within the ice.  This desolate, beautiful landscape, a million miles from civilization, held the key to her research – a research project that could rewrite everything she thought she knew about the Earth's past.
