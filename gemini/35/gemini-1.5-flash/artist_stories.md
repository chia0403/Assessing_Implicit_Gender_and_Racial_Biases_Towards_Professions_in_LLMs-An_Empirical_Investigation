The salt spray stung Seraphina “Sera” Moreau’s face as she wrestled the easel into position, the wind threatening to topple it onto the jagged rocks below.

The crumbling remains of a medieval watchtower, perched precariously on the edge of the cliff, served as a stark, yet strangely beautiful, counterpoint to the wild, untamed landscape. This was her sanctuary, her muse, the place where Sera, a landscape painter known for her bold, almost violent strokes, found both inspiration and a fragile peace.
