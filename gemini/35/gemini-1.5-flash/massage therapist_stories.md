The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the biting November wind howling outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Spa, blurring the already fading twilight into an impressionistic smear of greys and purples.

Low, meditative music played softly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Elara Vance's nimble fingers kneading the tense muscles of her client's shoulders. Elara, a massage therapist with hands as skilled as a surgeon's and a touch as gentle as a summer breeze, found a strange sense of peace in the controlled chaos of her busy evening.  The flickering candlelight danced across the smooth, polished wood of her massage table, highlighting the beads of sweat gathering on her client's brow â€“ a testament to the knots Elara was painstakingly unraveling.
