Tiny pins, glinting like fallen stars, dotted the surface amongst scraps of fabric, each a testament to the countless hours Evangeline had spent coaxing beauty from threads and needles.  The rhythmic click-clack of her scissors, a familiar soundtrack to her life, was the only sound louder than the persistent drumming of the rain.
