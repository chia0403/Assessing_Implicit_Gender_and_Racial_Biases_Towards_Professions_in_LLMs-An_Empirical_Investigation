The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  Frozen ground crunched under her worn wellies, the sound swallowed by the vast expanse of the Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary.  The sanctuary, a sprawling 200 acres nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, was a patchwork of dense forest, rocky outcroppings, and meticulously crafted enclosures â€“ each a miniature ecosystem designed to house the injured, orphaned, or otherwise displaced creatures under Amelia's care.  The air, sharp with the scent of pine and damp earth, held the faint, musky aroma of a thousand different animals; a comforting perfume for Amelia, a symphony of survival echoing through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of the sanctuary was replaced by an unsettling stillness, broken only by the mournful howl of the wind and the distant, panicked squawk of a bird.
