The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s crisp white linen suit, a tiny, ironic snowfall against the oppressive July heat clinging to the Brooklyn brownstone.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the condensation clinging to her tumbler of lukewarm iced tea.  Below, the cacophony of sirens and shouting drifted up from the teeming streets of Carroll Gardens, a familiar, discordant symphony that Amelia usually found comforting.  Tonight, however, the city’s roar only amplified the gnawing unease in her gut.  The flickering gaslight above cast long, distorted shadows, twisting the familiar wrought-iron into something menacing.  She took a shaky sip of her tea, the bitter taste a stark contrast to the sweetness of the honeysuckle blooming riotously in a nearby window box – a deceptive sweetness, much like the case she was currently wrestling with.
