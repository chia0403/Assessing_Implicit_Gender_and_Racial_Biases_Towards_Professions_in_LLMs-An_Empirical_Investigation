The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina Antoinette Dubois.  Rain lashed against the frosted glass windows of "Seraphina's Sanctuary," her small but stylish salon nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic Vieux-Montréal.  Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, rattling the antique apothecary jars lining the shelves, their contents – exotic oils, shimmering powders, and potent tinctures – promising a transformation as potent as any fairy tale.  Inside, however, the only transformation underway was the painstaking work Seraphina was performing on Madame Dubois’s already impressive platinum bob, a task requiring the utmost precision and a steady hand – qualities Seraphina possessed in abundance.  The flickering gaslight above cast long shadows across the plush velvet chairs, illuminating the fine strands of silver threaded through Madame Dubois’s otherwise immaculate hair, a stark reminder of the relentless march of time even within Seraphina's haven of beauty.
