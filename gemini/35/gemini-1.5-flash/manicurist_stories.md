The scent of acetone and almond hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina Evangeline Moreau.  Seraphina, or “Sera” as most of her clients called her, meticulously buffed the last vestiges of chipped crimson polish from Mrs. Henderson’s thumbnail, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The tiny salon, "Nails of Serenity," was tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, its walls adorned with faded posters of jazz greats and chipped, but charming, wrought-iron chandeliers.  Outside, the humid air vibrated with the insistent rhythm of a street musician’s clarinet, a counterpoint to the gentle hum of the salon’s air conditioner and the rhythmic rasp of the electric file in Sera’s hand.  Today, however, the usual comforting chaos of the Quarter felt subtly…off. A nervous energy thrummed beneath the surface, a tremor in the usually boisterous heartbeat of the city, and Sera couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was about to break.
