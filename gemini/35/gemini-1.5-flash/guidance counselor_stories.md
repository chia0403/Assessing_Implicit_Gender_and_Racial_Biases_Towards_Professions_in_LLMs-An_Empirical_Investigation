The chipped paint of the "Serenity Now" sign hanging crookedly above Ms. Eleanor Vance's office door had seen better days, much like the worn floral armchair that sat opposite her desk.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window, danced in the air, a silent, swirling commentary on the anxieties that permeated Northwood High. Eleanor, a guidance counselor with twenty years of experience etched onto her face in the form of fine lines around kind, hazel eyes, sighed.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage desperation, a familiar perfume that had become almost comforting in its predictability.  Outside, the manicured lawns of Northwood's campus hummed with the restless energy of Friday afternoon, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost suffocating stillness of her small, cluttered office.  The only sound was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eleanorâ€™s pen against her notepad, a counterpoint to the silent pleas for help that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves.
