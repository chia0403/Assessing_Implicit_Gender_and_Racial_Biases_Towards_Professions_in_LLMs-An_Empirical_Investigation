The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Reli" Davenport.  Reli, with her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of colours from years spent coaxing life back into lifeless locks, surveyed her salon, "Shear Perfection," with a practiced eye.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun slanting through the large bay window, illuminating the vintage Hollywood-style vanity chairs and the antique styling stations crafted from polished mahogany.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Charleston, South Carolina, hummed with the low thrum of a late summer evening.  The Spanish moss draped languidly from the ancient oaks, creating a hazy green curtain around the quaint, pastel-coloured buildings.  Reli sighed, the weight of the day settling on her shoulders like the humidity clinging to the Charleston air.  It had been a long one, filled with demanding clients, tangled extensions, and one particularly disastrous attempt at a balayage that had left her feeling thoroughly defeated.
