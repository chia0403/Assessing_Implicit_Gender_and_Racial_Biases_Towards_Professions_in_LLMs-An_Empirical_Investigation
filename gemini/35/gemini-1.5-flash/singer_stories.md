The stale scent of cigarette smoke and cheap beer clung to the velvet curtains like a second skin, a persistent perfume that clung to Seraphina Evangeline Moreau even after she'd left the smoky haze of the Blue Moon Tavern far behind.  Rain lashed against the cobblestones of Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego, each drop a tiny percussion instrument in the symphony of the city’s night.

The melody, a melancholic blues number she’d written herself, clung to her like the rain, a damp, chilling reminder of a broken heart and a broken promise.
