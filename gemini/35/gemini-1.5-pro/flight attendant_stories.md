The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, a familiar soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Reyes's life. Outside, the inky canvas of a pre-dawn sky was slowly bleeding into the bruised purple of a reluctant sunrise.  Below, the patchwork fields of Nebraska unfolded like a rumpled quilt, the occasional farmhouse light twinkling like a fallen star. Amy, perched on a jump seat in the galley of Flight 427 from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles International, stifled a yawn and rubbed the sleep from her eyes.  The aroma of reheated breakfast burritos, sickly sweet and artificial, hung heavy in the air.  This was her third red-eye in five days, and the glamour of being a flight attendant had long since worn off, replaced by the dull ache of exhaustion and the faint, lingering scent of airplane coffee.  This leg, thankfully, was almost empty.  Just a handful of passengers scattered throughout the otherwise deserted cabin.  Amy could almost feel herself relaxing, anticipating the blessed silence, when a sharp ping from the cockpit speaker startled her.  The Captain's voice, usually jovial, crackled with an unfamiliar tension. "Flight attendants, please report to the cockpit immediately."
