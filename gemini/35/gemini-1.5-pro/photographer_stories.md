The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, a familiar and welcome sting.  The pre-dawn air, thick with the scent of brine and kelp, clung to her wool sweater as she adjusted the tripod on the black sand beach of Reynisfjara, Iceland.  Jagged basalt columns, remnants of ancient lava flows, clawed at the churning steel-grey ocean, their stark silhouettes etched against the bruised canvas of the sky.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, tightened the lens cap on her Nikon D850, protecting it from the relentless mist.  She was here for the elusive perfect shot, the one that would capture the raw, untamed beauty of the Icelandic south coast, and this morning, with the promise of a dramatic sunrise, felt like it might finally be within her grasp.
