The relentless hum of the fluorescent lights mirrored the buzz in Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's head. Outside, the January sleet lashed against the window of "Wanderlust Voyages," frosting the glass with an intricate, ephemeral art.  Nestled in the heart of quaint, cobblestoned Oakhaven, Vermont, the travel agency was a riot of colour – posters of sun-drenched beaches, snow-capped mountains, and bustling metropolises plastered every inch of wall space, a stark contrast to the monochrome world outside. Amy, her fingers flying across the keyboard, was crafting an itinerary for a honeymooning couple destined for the Maldives.  Her own breath fogged slightly in the chilly air, a constant reminder of the escape she was building for others, while remaining firmly rooted in her small-town existence.  The scent of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet, artificial perfume of a forgotten hibiscus lei draped over a lampshade, a testament to a past trip she’d never taken herself.  This was Amy's world: a world of vicarious adventure.  And today, that world was about to be turned upside down.
