The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, whistling a lonely tune through the gaps in the cab of Evangeline "Eva" Rose McCoy's eighteen-wheeler.  The digital clock on the dashboard blinked 3:17 AM, a malevolent red eye in the pre-dawn gloom.  Outside, the only illumination came from the twin beams of Eva's headlights cutting through the swirling snow, revealing little more than the next twenty feet of Interstate 80. The radio crackled with static punctuated by the occasional burst of a country song â€“ a mournful ballad about a lost love and a life on the road, a story Eva knew all too well. Her thermos of coffee, usually a comforting presence, had long since gone cold, a mirror to the icy dread creeping into her bones.  This stretch of highway, notorious for sudden blizzards and vanishing cell service, was living up to its reputation tonight. And Eva, usually unflappable after twenty years hauling freight across the country, had a feeling this wasn't going to be just another long haul.
