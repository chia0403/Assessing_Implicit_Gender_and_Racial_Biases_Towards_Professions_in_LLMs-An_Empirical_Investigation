The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Amelie Dubois, her hands dusted with flour like a baker's benediction, peered through the misted window of her small boulangerie, "Le Petit Four," watching the cobbled streets of Montmartre slowly awaken.  Paris in November was a city of muted colours and hushed whispers, the vibrant energy of summer replaced by a quiet introspection.  Rain slicked the cobblestones, reflecting the warm glow spilling from Amelie's shop, a beacon against the grey. Inside, loaves of sourdough, still warm from the oven, nestled amongst baskets of croissants and pain au chocolat, their buttery scent mingling with the earthy fragrance of rye. This was Amelie's domain, a haven built on flour, water, and a lifetime of whispered family secrets.  But this morning, the usual comforting rhythm of kneading and proofing was laced with a distinct undercurrent of unease.
