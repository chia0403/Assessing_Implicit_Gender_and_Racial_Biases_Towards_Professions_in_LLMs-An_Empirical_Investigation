The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's early morning routine.  The clock on the wall of the phlebotomy lab read 5:47 AM. Outside, the Chicago sky was just beginning to blush a pale, wintry pink. Inside, the air held the sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint metallic tang of blood. Amelia, bundled in her burgundy St. Jude's fleece over her scrubs, methodically arranged her tray: tourniquets, vacutainers, butterfly needles, alcohol swabs, gauze.  Each item in its precise place, a ritual she performed with the quiet focus of a seasoned conductor preparing her orchestra. Today, however, a subtle tremor ran beneath her usual calm.  It wasn't the cold, although the drafts sneaking in around the ill-fitting window certainly contributed.  No, this was a nervous energy, a premonition that today, unlike the hundreds of Tuesdays that had come before it, something was going to be different.
