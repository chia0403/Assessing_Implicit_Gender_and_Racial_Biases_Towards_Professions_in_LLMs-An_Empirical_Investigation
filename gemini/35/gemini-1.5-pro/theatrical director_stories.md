The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, plastering strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her worn, charcoal grey scarf tighter around her neck, the frayed edges tickling her chin. Above her, the marquee of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre creaked ominously, its once-glorious gold lettering now chipped and faded, spelling out "CLOSED FOR REPAIRS" â€“ a lie that had stood for the better part of a decade.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight filtering through the grimy front doors, illuminating the peeling paint and cobwebs clinging to the ornate, wrought-iron details.  Esme, however, saw none of the decay.  She saw potential. She saw the ghosts of roaring applause and the shimmering promise of greasepaint and footlights.  Tonight, under the cloak of a hunter's moon, Esme Reyes had come to reclaim her kingdom.
