The siren's wail was a lullaby to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez. It was a familiar song, one that pulsed in her veins along with the adrenaline that came with every screech of tires and flash of red and blue. Tonight, the song was particularly shrill, echoing through the narrow, rain-slicked streets of Old Providence, a historic neighborhood in Providence, Rhode Island, clinging to the edge of the encroaching city.  Cobblestone streets, usually charming with their quaint gas lamps, now shimmered treacherously under the October downpour. Amy, an Emergency Medical Technician for Providence Fire and Rescue, gripped the metal bar above her head as the ambulance lurched around a corner, its headlights catching the ornate, decaying facades of the nineteenth-century brownstones.  Dispatch had reported a possible cardiac arrest at 47 Benefit Street, a notoriously difficult address to access in this weather. The air crackled with the urgency of the unknown, and Amy, despite the hundreds of calls she'd answered, felt the familiar knot of anticipation tighten in her stomach.
