The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet that settled over Northwood High. Outside, the skeletal branches of elm trees clawed at a bruised, indigo sky, hinting at the coming winter.  Frost feathered across the windowpanes, obscuring the view of the football field where, just hours earlier, the Northwood Wolves had suffered a crushing defeat in the homecoming game.  Elias, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up, surveyed the room.  Desks stood in rigid rows, each a small island in a sea of worn linoleum.  A half-erased equation lingered on the chalkboard, a ghost of yesterday's lesson.  The air smelled faintly of chalk dust and the stale coffee Elias had nursed since arriving at 6:00 am, his usual ritual before the onslaught of teenage energy descended upon him. This morning, however, a different kind of energy thrummed beneath the surface of the quiet, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with adolescent angst and everything to do with the anonymous note he'd found tucked into his grade book.  It read simply: "I know what you did."
