Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop a tiny percussionist in a symphony of Seattle gloom. Inside, nestled in the warm glow of the lobby, Eleanor Vance, the hotel's chief concierge, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the polished mahogany of her desk.  Around her, the usual hushed opulence hummed: the tinkling of a grand piano from the Palm Court, the murmur of hushed conversations, the discreet rustle of silk and cashmere. Eleanor, a woman whose calm exterior belied a mind that cataloged every guest’s whim and worry, glanced at the ornate clock ticking towards five.  It was the calm before the storm – the Friday afternoon influx of weekend guests, all demanding the best the Emerald City had to offer.  And tonight, Eleanor had a feeling, something more than the usual requests for theatre tickets and dinner reservations was brewing.  The air crackled with a subtle, electric tension, a premonition that clung to the back of her throat like the lingering scent of the lobby's signature jasmine and sandalwood.
