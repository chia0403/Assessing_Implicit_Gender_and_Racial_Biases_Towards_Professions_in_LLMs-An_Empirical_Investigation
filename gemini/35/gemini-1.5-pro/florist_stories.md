The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune as the November wind gusted in, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from conditioning a fresh batch of anemones, glanced up from her work.

Today, however, even the sunflowers seemed to droop a little, mirroring Elizaâ€™s own weary spirit. Outside, the rain had begun to fall, a fine, persistent drizzle that promised to turn the already sodden streets into a reflecting pool of the overcast sky.
