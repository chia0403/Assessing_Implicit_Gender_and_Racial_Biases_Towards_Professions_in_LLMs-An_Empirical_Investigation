The stale, recirculated air of Harold Finchley's office smelled faintly of desperation and instant coffee.  Tax season was in full swing, which meant Harold, a Certified Public Accountant and owner of Finchley & Sons Tax Preparation (the “Sons” being a hopeful aspiration rather than a current reality), was existing on a diet of lukewarm caffeine and the anxieties of his clients. His office, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery in the strip mall on Elmwood Avenue, wasn't exactly glamorous.  Faded floral wallpaper peeled from the corners, exposing patches of dingy plaster beneath.  The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like disgruntled wasps, adding a layer of sonic annoyance to the general atmosphere of low-grade panic. Outside, the grey slush of a late February thaw painted the parking lot a depressing shade of brown. This, Harold thought, wiping a smudge of coffee from his tie, was the glamorous life of an accountant.  Little did he know, the monotony was about to be spectacularly shattered.
