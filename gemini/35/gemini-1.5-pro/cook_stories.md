The clatter of pots and the sizzle of garlic in olive oil were the soundtrack to Amelia "Mimi" Dupres' life.  Her kitchen, nestled in the back of Le Chat Bleu, a small, unassuming bistro tucked away on a cobbled side street in Montmartre, Paris, was her sanctuary.  Copper pots gleamed from the walls, reflecting the warm glow of the afternoon sun that streamed in through the single, grime-streaked window.  Outside, the sounds of the city – the chatter of tourists, the rumble of Vespas, the melancholic strains of an accordion – faded to a gentle hum. Mimi, with flour dusting her apron and a smudge of chocolate on her cheek, was in her element, humming along to a Edith Piaf record as she kneaded dough for the evening's baguettes.  The air, thick with the scent of yeast and simmering bouillabaisse, promised a good night, the kind that warmed the soul like a perfectly aged Bordeaux.  Little did she know, this particular Tuesday evening would change everything.
