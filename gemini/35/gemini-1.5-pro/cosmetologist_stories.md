The pungent scent of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that Genevieve "Gen" Dubois barely registered anymore.  Her salon, "Curl Up & Dye," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Bleecker Street, hummed with the low thrum of hair dryers and the rhythmic snip of her shears.  The late afternoon sun, filtered through the grime-streaked windows, cast long shadows across the checkered linoleum floor. Outside, the cacophony of Greenwich Village – the rumble of the subway, the blare of car horns, the snippets of a dozen different conversations – faded into a muted white noise. Inside, Gen’s world was a carefully constructed sanctuary of hairspray, hot rollers, and the hushed confessions of her clients.  This Thursday, however, held a different kind of energy, a prickle of anticipation that had nothing to do with a new shipment of Moroccan Oil.  Gen had a feeling something was about to change, and not just the color of Mrs. Rosenblatt’s roots.
