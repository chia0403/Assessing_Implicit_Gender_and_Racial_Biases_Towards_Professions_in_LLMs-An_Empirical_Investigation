The insistent London drizzle seemed to mock Amelia Grace Hawthorne's meticulously chosen outfit: a vintage buttercup yellow raincoat, charcoal grey skinny jeans, and bright white trainers.  It was a Thursday, the kind that usually held a quiet promise of fish and chips and a good design podcast, but today the air crackled with a different kind of energy. Amelia stood beneath the awning of "The Quirky Quill," a small independent bookshop in Notting Hill, clutching her portfolio tighter against the damp. The scent of old paper and brewing coffee spilled onto the pavement, a comforting balm against the city's restless hum. She was here for a meeting, a potentially career-changing meeting, with the notoriously elusive children's author, Esme Blackwood. The commission to design the cover for Blackwood's next book was the kind of opportunity that could catapult Amelia's freelance career into the stratosphere, and the weight of that possibility settled in her stomach like a flock of nervous butterflies.
