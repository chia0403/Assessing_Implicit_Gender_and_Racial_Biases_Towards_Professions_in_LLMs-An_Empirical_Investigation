The crisp November air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hurried down the cobblestone street.  Above him, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Willow Creek Lane scraped against a bruised twilight sky.  The quaint, if slightly dilapidated, storefronts of Oakhaven, Vermont, were mostly dark, save for the warm glow spilling from the windows of Miss Agatha's Tea Room and the flickering neon sign of the Owl Diner.  Elias tugged his wool scarf tighter, the chill seeping through his tailored overcoat. He wasn't late, exactly, but Mrs. Periwinkle, his last patient of the day, had a reputation for both excruciatingly detailed accounts of her grandchildren's exploits and a deep-seated fear of the drill.  And Elias, despite a decade of practicing dentistry, still felt a pang of sympathy for anyone forced to endure the whine of that infernal instrument. His own dental office, "Thorne Family Dentistry,"  nestled between the bakery and the antique shop, stood in expectant silence, the brass plaque gleaming faintly in the encroaching gloom.
