The biting wind whipped off the Greystone Quarries, carrying with it the scent of granite dust and the ghostly echo of hammer against rock.  A thin layer of snow dusted the jagged peaks surrounding the valley, clinging precariously to the exposed faces where Elias Thorne, his calloused hands already numb despite the thick wool gloves, chipped away at a massive block of obsidian. The valley itself, nestled deep in the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, was a desolate bowl of grey and white, broken only by the dark, gaping maw of the quarry and the cluster of rough-hewn cabins that huddled together for warmth at its edge.  Here, under the perpetual shadow of the peaks, Elias had spent his entire life, shaping the unforgiving stone into works of both breathtaking beauty and brutal practicality.  This morning, however, the familiar rhythm of his work was punctuated by a disquiet he couldn't quite place. The wind seemed to whisper secrets he couldn't understand, and the shadows clinging to the quarry walls felt somehow... deeper.
