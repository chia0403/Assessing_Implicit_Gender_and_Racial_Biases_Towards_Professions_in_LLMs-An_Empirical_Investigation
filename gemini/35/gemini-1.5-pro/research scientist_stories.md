The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's lab coat around him like a frantic ghost, the fabric snapping against the metal scaffolding of the Baffin Island Research Station.  Ice crystals, sharp as needles, pricked at his exposed skin.  February in the Canadian Arctic was less a season and more a sustained act of aggression by nature.  Elias, however, barely registered the cold.  His attention was entirely consumed by the shimmering, otherworldly aurora borealis painting the sky above him in shades of emerald and violet.  He wasn't admiring its beauty, though. He was meticulously calibrating the massive radio telescope dish aimed directly at its heart, convinced the answers to the universe's greatest mysteries were woven into those ethereal threads of light. The station itself, a cluster of prefabricated modules clinging to the permafrost-locked earth, hummed with the low thrum of generators and the faint static hiss of the equipment Elias had spent the last six months painstakingly assembling.  He was alone, save for the occasional crackle of his research assistant, Anya, over the comms system from the main module, reminding him about mandatory hydration breaks he invariably ignored. Tonight, however, felt different. Tonight, Elias knew, he was on the precipice of something extraordinary.
