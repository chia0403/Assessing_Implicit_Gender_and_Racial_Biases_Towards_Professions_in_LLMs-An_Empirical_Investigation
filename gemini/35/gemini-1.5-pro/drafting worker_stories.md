The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne’s Wednesday morning.  Elias, whose official title was Junior Drafting Technician, but who everyone simply called "the CAD guy," squinted at the intricate lines glowing on his monitor. Outside, the Chicago wind howled against the glass facade of the skyscraper, a stark contrast to the sterile, climate-controlled environment of the 27th floor.  Scattered across the vast, open-plan office, other drafters hunched over their workstations, the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards and the whir of plotters filling the otherwise silent air.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat beside Elias’s hand, a testament to the early start and the long hours that lay ahead. Today was deadline day for the Barrington Estate blueprints, and Elias, responsible for the intricate detailing of the east wing, knew he was in for an all-nighter.  The smell of stale pizza from last night’s “crunch time” fuel still lingered in the air, a subtle reminder of the pressure that permeated the office.  He took a deep breath, the artificial air conditioning doing little to invigorate him, and zoomed in on a particularly complex section of the drawing, the ornate scrollwork of a grand staircase demanding his full attention.  He had a feeling this was going to be a long one.
