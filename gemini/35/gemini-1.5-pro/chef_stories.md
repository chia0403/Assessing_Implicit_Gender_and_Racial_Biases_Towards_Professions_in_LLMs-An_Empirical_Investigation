The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, but stubbornly ambitious, French bistro tucked between a laundromat and a pawn shop on Bleecker Street.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Chef Antoine "Toni" Dubois.  He ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair, the gesture doing little to smooth the deep creases etched into his forehead.  At 3:00 a.m., with the last of the prep work for the day finally finished, Toni should have been exhausted, but a nervous energy thrummed beneath his skin. Tonight was the night. Tonight, the notoriously fickle food critic, Madame Evangeline Dubois – no relation, thankfully – would grace his humble establishment with her presence.  Her review could either catapult Le Papillon Bleu into the culinary stratosphere, or crush Toni's carefully cultivated dream beneath her designer heel.  He surveyed the gleaming copper pots, the meticulously arranged mise en place, and the fragrant bouquets of herbs adorning the countertops. Everything was perfect.  It had to be.
