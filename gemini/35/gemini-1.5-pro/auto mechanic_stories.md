The rusty tang of iron oxide hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweeter scent of motor oil and the acrid bite of exhaust fumes.  Elara "Ellie" Vasquez, her name stitched in faded cursive on the breast pocket of her grease-stained coveralls, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of a grimy hand.  The late afternoon sun beat down on the corrugated tin roof of Vasquez Auto Repair, baking the small, cluttered yard in the Nevada desert.  Scrapped cars, their innards exposed like metallic skeletons, littered the space, some destined for resurrection, others to be cannibalized for parts. Ellie’s domain was a chaotic symphony of rust and rubber, nestled just outside the dusty, one-horse town of Harmony Springs, population 384 (not counting the coyotes).  A faded, hand-painted sign above the garage door declared it “The Only Shop in Town That Won’t Rip You Off (Probably).”
