The stale scent of frying oil clung to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez like a second skin, a constant reminder of her current station in life: server at the Greasy Spoon Diner, a twenty-four-hour haven of chipped Formica, questionable coffee, and the ghosts of countless spilled milkshakes.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the red vinyl booths. Outside, the Nevada desert wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the dusty windows of the diner, which sat solitary and forlorn on the edge of Highway 15, just a blinking neon sign and a flickering hope away from the forgotten town of Dust Devil Junction.  It was 3:17 am, the slowest hour of Amy's shift, the kind of hour where even the tumbleweeds seemed to sleep.  The only other soul in the diner was a trucker dozing in a booth by the window, his head resting on a pile of napkins, a half-eaten slice of apple pie congealing on his plate.
