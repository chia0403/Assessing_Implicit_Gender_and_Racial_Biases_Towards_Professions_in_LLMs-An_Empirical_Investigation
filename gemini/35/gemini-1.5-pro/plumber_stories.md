The air hung thick with the musty scent of earth and the acrid tang of rust, a familiar perfume in Elias's line of work. This particular crawlspace, nestled beneath a charming Victorian in the heart of Oakhaven, a town perpetually draped in a sleepy, wistful haze, was proving to be unusually stubborn. Elias sighed, the plumes of his breath mingling with the dust.  This was his third call-out to Mrs. Henderson's in as many months, and he had a sneaking suspicion this wouldn't be the last.
