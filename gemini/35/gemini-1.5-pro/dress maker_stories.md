The clatter of horse-drawn carriages against cobblestones echoed up to the attic room where Eliza Jane Hemsworth hunched over her Singer sewing machine.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the grimy windowpane, illuminating the rich sapphire velvet draped across her workbench. Outside, the bustling sounds of London, 1888, pressed against the glass, a world away from the quiet concentration of Eliza's workroom.  The room, tucked away under the eaves of a building in Whitechapel, was cramped but overflowing with the tools and treasures of her trade: bolts of silk and lace, spools of thread in every shade imaginable, half-finished gowns hanging like ethereal ghosts, and sketches pinned to the sloping ceiling beams.  A faint, sweet smell of lavender hung in the air, a desperate attempt to combat the ever-present scent of coal smoke that permeated the city. This was Elizaâ€™s sanctuary, her battlefield against poverty, and her canvas for dreams woven in thread and fabric.
