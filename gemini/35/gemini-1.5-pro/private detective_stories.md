Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning of Silas Blackwood's office, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the backdrop of a mournful saxophone solo leaking from the jazz club downstairs.  The neon sign for "The Blue Dahlia" flickered intermittently, casting a sickly green glow across Silasâ€™s desk, where a half-eaten pastrami on rye lay next to a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes. Silas Finch, Private Investigator, sat slumped in his worn leather chair, the pungent scent of stale cigarette smoke clinging to him like a second skin. His office, perched above the dimly lit Bourbon Street club in New Orleans' French Quarter, was a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of case files teetered precariously on every available surface, interspersed with overflowing ashtrays and dog-eared paperbacks.  The year was 1948, and the humidity hung heavy in the air, thick with the scent of jasmine and the promise of trouble.  The telephone jangled, a shrill cry in the oppressive silence.
