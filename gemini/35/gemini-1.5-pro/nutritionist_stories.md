The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Hibiscus Health Hut, a rhythm that usually soothed Elara Juniper Finch. Today, however, it felt like an insistent drumming on her already frayed nerves.  The Hut, nestled amidst the riotous greenery of a small Hawaiian town called Paia'ea, was usually a haven of tranquility, fragrant with ginger and hibiscus. But the vibrant colours of the flowering vines clinging to the wooden walls seemed muted, mirroring Elara's own subdued mood. A stack of unopened mail lay on her desk, topped by a letter bearing the stark, official logo of the Department of Health.  It had arrived three days ago, and she’d been avoiding it ever since, its presence a heavy weight in the otherwise breezy, salt-laced air. Paia'ea, with its close-knit community and laid-back lifestyle, was her refuge, a place she’d come to escape the pressures of city life. Now, it felt like that refuge might be threatened.
