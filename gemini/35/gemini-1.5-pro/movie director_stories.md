Rain lashed against the dilapidated pier, its wooden planks slick and treacherous beneath Evelyn "Evie" Reyes’ worn leather boots.  Neon signs advertising faded glories of bygone beachside attractions flickered erratically, casting a lurid, intermittent glow over the scene. Santa Monica Pier, once the jewel of Los Angeles's coastline, now felt more like a forgotten, rain-soaked graveyard of dreams.  Evie pulled her threadbare cashmere scarf tighter around her neck, the damp chill seeping into her bones.  This was supposed to be her comeback, her triumphant return to directing after five years in the wilderness of studio rejection and creative burnout.  Instead, it felt like another nail in the coffin of her career. The half-built set for her indie thriller, "Crimson Tide," lay abandoned, a skeletal framework of scaffolding and tarpaulin struggling against the relentless onslaught of the storm.  The investors, already skittish, were due to arrive for a progress check at dawn.  Evie knew, with a sickening certainty, that what they would find wouldn’t inspire confidence.
