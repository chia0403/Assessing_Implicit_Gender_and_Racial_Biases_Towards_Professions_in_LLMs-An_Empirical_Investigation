The biting November wind whipped around Elias Finch, rustling the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive of Blackwood Manor.  Frost crunched beneath his worn leather boots as he made his way across the expansive, neglected gardens.  Elias, his breath clouding the air before him, pulled his threadbare tweed cap lower over his ears.  Blackwood Manor, once a jewel of Victorian architecture, now stood in a state of dignified decay. Ivy clawed at its darkened stone walls, and the leaded glass windows, once shimmering with vibrant colours, were now obscured by years of grime and neglect.  Elias, the sole groundskeeper, was the only constant presence in the sprawling estate, a silent guardian of its fading grandeur.  He knew every twist of the overgrown rose bushes, every dip in the mossy cobblestone paths, every whisper of the wind as it sighed through the crumbling stone statues.  This morning, however, something felt different. A stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual pre-winter gloom.  It was the kind of stillness that precedes a storm, Elias knew, and not the kind that broke in the sky.
