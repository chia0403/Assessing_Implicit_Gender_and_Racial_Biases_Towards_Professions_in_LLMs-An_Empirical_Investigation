The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Reyes's dark braid across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Hawthorne's prize-winning rose bushes.  Frost glittered on the brown, brittle canes, and the once vibrant flowerbeds lay dormant beneath a thick carpet of fallen leaves in hues of rust and gold. Milly, her breath puffing out in white clouds, tucked her braid behind her ear and pulled the collar of her fleece higher.  Greystone Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the Hudson River in Sleepy Hollow, New York, loomed behind her, its many gables and turrets silhouetted against the steel-grey sky. This was Milly's last job of the season, prepping the grounds for winter – a stark contrast to the riot of color she'd coaxed from these same gardens just a few months prior. The air, usually thick with the scent of roses and damp earth, now carried the sharp, metallic tang of approaching snow.  A shiver ran down Milly’s spine, and it wasn’t entirely from the cold.  There was a stillness to Greystone Manor today, a heavy silence that went beyond the usual hushed expectancy of winter.
