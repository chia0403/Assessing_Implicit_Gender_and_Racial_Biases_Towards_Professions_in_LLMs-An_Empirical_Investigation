The frosted breath of November clawed at the leaded panes of the Alderbury Free Library, rattling them in their ancient frames.  Inside, Amelia Persephone Higgins, head librarian and self-proclaimed Keeper of Whispers, adjusted the emerald green shawl draped over her shoulders. The library, a two-story Victorian edifice of brick and ivy, hummed with the quiet rustle of turning pages and the tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reading room. Shadows danced in the corners, cast by the flickering gas lamps that fought valiantly against the encroaching dusk.  Beyond the towering shelves, crammed with everything from dusty tomes on beekeeping to first edition Dickens, lay the sleepy town of Alderbury, nestled in the heart of the Vermont mountains. Here, nestled amongst the whispering pines and the secrets held tight by the granite peaks, Amelia ruled her domain of words and whispers, blissfully unaware that the quiet solitude of her life was about to be shattered.
