Rain lashed against the arched window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon. The rhythmic drumming on the glass, usually a soothing backdrop to his sessions, today mirrored the relentless anxiety churning in his gut. His office, nestled in a converted Victorian townhouse on a quiet, tree-lined street in Brooklyn Heights, normally exuded a calming atmosphere with its warm, ochre walls, Persian rug, and the comforting scent of old books and sandalwood.  But tonight, the shadows seemed deeper, the silence between the rain bursts heavier, pregnant with an unease Elias couldn't quite place. He glanced at the ornate clock ticking above the fireplace â€“ 5:57 pm.  Three minutes until his last appointment of the day, and already he felt the familiar weight of anticipation, a strange premonition whispering that this session would be unlike any other.
