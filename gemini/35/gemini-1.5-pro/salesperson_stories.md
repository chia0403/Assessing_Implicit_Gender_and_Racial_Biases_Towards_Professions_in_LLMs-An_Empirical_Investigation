The air in the El Rancho Grande Motel lobby smelled of stale coffee and desperation, a fitting aroma for Bakersfield in July.  Agnes Periwinkle, regional sales representative for "Splendiferous Sinks and Exquisite Faucets," adjusted her floral print blazer and sighed.  Outside, the asphalt shimmered in the 105-degree heat.  Her sensible beige pumps were already sinking into the softening tar of the parking lot as she'd crossed it, a sticky omen for the sales pitch ahead.  She’d driven six hours from Sacramento, past endless fields of sun-scorched almonds, for this meeting.  Harold Grumbacher, owner of a chain of budget motels across Central California, held the key – or rather, the purchase order – to her making quota this quarter. He was notoriously tight-fisted, and Agnes had heard whispers of his penchant for avocado-green bathroom fixtures.  She shuddered.  Avocado had been out for decades, and Splendiferous Sinks was all about brushed nickel minimalism this season.  This was going to be a tough sell.
