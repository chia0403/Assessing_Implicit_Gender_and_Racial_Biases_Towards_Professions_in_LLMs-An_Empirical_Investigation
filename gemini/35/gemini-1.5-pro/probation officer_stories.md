The stale cigarette smoke clinging to Amelia Reyes's cardigan felt like a second skin. It was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays in the waiting room of the Southside Community Correctional Facility always smelled like regret and cheap tobacco.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor and the mismatched plastic chairs occupied by a rotating cast of fidgety parolees. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the barred windows and spitting sleet against the glass. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped her pen against her clipboard, her gaze fixed on the door marked "Officer Davies."  Her own reflection stared back, a tired woman with kind eyes that had seen too much. This was her life: navigating the fragile balance between hope and recidivism, one parolee at a time.  And today, she had a feeling it was going to be a long one.
