The insistent April rain hammered against the large bay window of Knead & Breathe Wellness, blurring the neon "Open" sign reflected in the slick pavement. Inside,  Elara Juniper Thistlewick, LMT, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drone of a white noise machine and the gurgle of a small tabletop fountain.  Her latest client, a particularly knotty accountant named Mr. Henderson, had just departed, leaving behind the lingering scent of eucalyptus and the faint impression of his tense form on the heated massage table. Elara, a woman whose slender frame belied surprising strength, adjusted the thermostat, chasing away the lingering chill of the spring downpour.  Knead & Breathe, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was Elaraâ€™s sanctuary, a place where she sought to unravel the tangled anxieties of others and, perhaps, a few of her own.  The salt-laced air, usually a calming presence, tonight felt heavy with a strange, unsettling energy.
