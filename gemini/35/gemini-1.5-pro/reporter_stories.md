The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's auburn hair across her face as she stood on the precipice of the Blackwood Gorge.  Far below, the churning, slate-grey waters of the Blackwood River snaked through the valley, the sound of their relentless rush a constant, low hum against the shriek of the wind.  Jagged, black rocks, slick with rain and draped with dark green moss, framed the gorge, giving the place its ominous name.  Pine trees clung precariously to the slopes, their branches gnarled and twisted, like skeletal fingers reaching towards the sky.  Mia, bundled in a thick wool coat, pulled her scarf tighter around her neck, the chill seeping into her bones despite her layers. She had arrived in the small, isolated town of Blackwood Falls, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, just hours ago, and the oppressive atmosphere of the place was already settling heavily on her shoulders. She was here to investigate the disappearance of Sarah Jenkins, a local high school teacher who vanished without a trace three months prior, a story the national media had largely ignored. Mia, a reporter for the small but tenacious Asheville Chronicle, was determined to uncover the truth, even if the whispering townsfolk and the foreboding landscape seemed determined to keep their secrets buried.
