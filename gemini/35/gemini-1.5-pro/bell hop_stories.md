The brass-plated doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel revolved with a hushed sigh, admitting Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins to the symphony of scents that defined his working life: a heady mix of expensive perfume, old money, and the faint, lingering aroma of chlorine from the rooftop pool.  Barty, in his crisp, maroon uniform with its gleaming brass buttons, adjusted his pillbox hat and surveyed the opulent lobby. Crystal chandeliers cast shimmering light across the marble floor, catching the dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering fairies.  Outside, the San Francisco fog swirled, clinging to the steep hills like a lover's embrace, but inside, the Grand Majestic existed in a perpetual state of balmy, artificial springtime.  It was the kind of place where dreams, real and imagined, checked in but rarely checked out.  And Barty Higgins, with his quick smile and even quicker hands, was the gatekeeper to those dreams. This particular Tuesday, however, promised to be anything but ordinary.
