The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Reyes, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  The ancient stone buildings of the hospital, nestled in the heart of rural Vermont, seemed to absorb the cold, radiating a damp chill that seeped through Ameliaâ€™s thick wool coat. Gargoyles perched on the eaves, their granite faces grim under a bruised twilight sky. Snow flurries, the first of the season, danced like icy ghosts in the air. Inside, the warm glow spilling from the tall, arched windows beckoned, promising a temporary reprieve from the encroaching winter.  Tonight, however, Amelia dreaded the warmth.  Tonight, she carried a secret colder than the Vermont mountains themselves.
