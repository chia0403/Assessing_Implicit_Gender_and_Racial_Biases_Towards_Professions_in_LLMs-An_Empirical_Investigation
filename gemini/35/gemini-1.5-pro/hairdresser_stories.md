The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Radiance" jingled merrily, announcing Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum's first client of the day.  Bea, a woman whose personality was as vibrant as the fuchsia streak currently decorating her own cropped hair, sighed and plastered a welcoming smile on her face.  Shear Radiance, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on the slightly seedy end of Clementine Street, wasn't exactly the glamorous salon Bea had envisioned owning when she graduated beauty school. The peeling wallpaper, the perpetually flickering fluorescent lights, and the faint aroma of stale coffee – courtesy of Mr. Henderson, the laundromat owner next door – were a far cry from the chic, minimalist aesthetic she'd always dreamed of.  But it was hers. And on this overcast Tuesday morning, in the heart of Willow Creek, a town where everyone knew everyone's business (and their preferred hairspray), Bea was ready to face whatever split ends and small-town gossip the day threw her way.
