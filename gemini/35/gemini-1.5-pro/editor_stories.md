Rain lashed against the attic window of Elias Thorne’s apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Elias, full name Elias Peregrine Thorne, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee against the overflowing ashtray on his desk.  Deadlines loomed, his landlord was threatening eviction, and the manuscript sprawled across his desk – the supposed magnum opus of a self-proclaimed "visionary" author – was a convoluted mess of purple prose and plot holes you could drive a truck through. Elias, a freelance editor with a penchant for tweed jackets and a vocabulary that could make Shakespeare blush, was beginning to suspect he'd traded his soul for a career built on correcting other people's grammatical sins. His apartment, crammed with precarious stacks of books and manuscripts, overlooked the perpetually grey rooftops of Bloomsbury, London. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, cigarette smoke, and the faintest hint of despair. The year was 1953, and the world outside was rebuilding after the war, but inside Elias’s cluttered attic room, the battle raged on.
