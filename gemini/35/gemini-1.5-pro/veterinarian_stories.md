The clinic, nestled in the small town of Antelope Wells, was her life's work, a beacon of hope for the ranchers and their livestock, and the occasional beloved family pet, scattered across this harsh but beautiful landscape.  The howling wind seemed to grow louder, a mournful cry that echoed the anxiety gnawing at Eleanorâ€™s heart. This wasn't just any winter storm; this was the beginning of something far more ominous.
