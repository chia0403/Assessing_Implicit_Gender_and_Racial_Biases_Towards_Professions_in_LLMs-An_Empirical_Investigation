The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the edges of his charcoal grey scarf.  He hunched deeper into his wool coat, the crisp collar scratching against his beard.  Below him, the city of Veridia sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of ancient terracotta rooftops and gleaming modern steel, nestled between the jade-green slopes of the Monti Veridiani and the restless, slate-grey expanse of the Tyrhennian Sea.  Elias, perched precariously on scaffolding clinging to the side of the Basilica di Santa Rosalia, felt a familiar thrill course through him.  He wasn't afraid of heights; he was invigorated by them.  From this vantage point, he could see not just the intricate mosaic work he was meticulously restoring, but the entire city laid out like a blueprint â€“ a living, breathing testament to centuries of architectural evolution, and the one place he truly felt at home.
