The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Iris Moreau's auburn braid across her face as she squinted at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Her easel, anchored by a trio of heavy stones, vibrated against the cobblestones of the Whitby pier, a symphony of creaks and groans accompanying the gulls' cries overhead.  The fishing boats, bobbing like brightly painted corks in the choppy water, were her subject today, their emerald and sapphire hulls a stark contrast to the muted tones of the sky.
