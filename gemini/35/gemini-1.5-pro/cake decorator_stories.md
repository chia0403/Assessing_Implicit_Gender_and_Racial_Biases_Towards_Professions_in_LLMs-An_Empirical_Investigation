The sugary scent of almond paste hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's apron like a second skin. Outside, the November wind howled against the frosted panes of "Sugar & Bloom," rattling the display of gingerbread houses in the window. Inside, the small bakery, nestled in the heart of quaint Hollyberry, Vermont, was a riot of warmth and color.  Garlands of twinkling fairy lights crisscrossed the low, beamed ceiling, and the countertops, usually pristine white marble, were currently dusted with a fine layer of powdered sugar, testament to Amelia's latest creation: a three-tiered wedding cake adorned with hand-sculpted sugar orchids.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic whir of Amelia's stand mixer, tirelessly whipping buttercream to a perfect, cloud-like consistency.  This was her sanctuary, her happy place, a world constructed of spun sugar dreams and the comforting aroma of vanilla. But even in this sweet haven, a storm was brewing.
