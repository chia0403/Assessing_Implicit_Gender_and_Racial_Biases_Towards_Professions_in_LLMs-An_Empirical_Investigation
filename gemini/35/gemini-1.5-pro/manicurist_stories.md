The bell above the door of "Nailed It," jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the persistent drizzle falling on Bleecker Street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of acetone and hibiscus blossom, a carefully curated combination meant to evoke both cleanliness and tropical relaxation. Elara Valentina Rossi, a woman whose hands could coax even the most brittle nails into works of art, sighed and glanced at the clock.  5:57 pm. Three minutes until she could lock up, kick off her impractical-but-stylish heels, and finally indulge in the pepperoni pizza currently calling her name from the fridge in her tiny West Village apartment.  The November gloom seemed to seep in through the large front window, painting the salon in shades of grey and blurring the vibrant colours of the nail polish bottles lining the wall. Elara hoped no last-minute walk-ins would interrupt her meticulously planned pizza-and-Netflix evening.
