The relentless Iowa wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of Dr. Elias Thorne’s chiropractic clinic, rattling the vintage “Thorne Chiropractic - Spine Aligned, Life Refined” sign that hung precariously above the door.  Inside, the waiting room, usually bustling with the aches and pains of Cedar Rapids’ citizenry, was eerily silent.  Dust motes danced in the muted light filtering through the frosted glass window depicting a stylized spine, straight and true. Elias, a man whose hands were as accustomed to coaxing vertebrae back into place as they were to holding his grandfather’s well-worn copy of Gray’s Anatomy, sat behind his oak desk, staring out at the swirling snow.  The clock ticked with an almost painful regularity, each second a hammer blow against the unsettling quiet of a Thursday afternoon that felt decidedly…wrong. The only other sound was the low hum of the electric heating pad draped over the vacant treatment table, a lonely beacon of warmth in the gathering gloom.
