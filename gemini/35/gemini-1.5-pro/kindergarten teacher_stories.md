The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of a swing set outside the window.  Rain lashed against the glass, transforming the usually vibrant playground of Sunny Meadow Elementary into a blurry, grey canvas.  Inside, amidst a kaleidoscope of brightly coloured construction paper, finger-painted masterpieces, and miniature plastic farm animals, Mrs. Vance, a woman whose smile lines crinkled even when her face was at rest, was attempting to corral her twenty charges into a semblance of order for story time.  The air hung thick with the sweet scent of Elmer's glue and the faint, earthy aroma of the class pet hamster, Mr. Nibbles, who snoozed peacefully in his cage, oblivious to the controlled chaos unfolding around him.  It was a typical Tuesday in Room 2B, or so it seemed.
