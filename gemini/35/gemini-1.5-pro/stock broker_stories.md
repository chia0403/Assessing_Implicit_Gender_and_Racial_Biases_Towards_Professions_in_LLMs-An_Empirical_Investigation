Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Alistair Finch's thirty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The cityscape of Chicago glittered below, a jagged tapestry of light struggling against the encroaching darkness.  From his vantage point in the sleek, steel-and-glass tower of Sterling-Holt Investments, Alistair could almost taste the metallic tang of the storm.

The numbers on his Bloomberg terminal glowed ominously, a sea of red reflecting the disastrous day on the market – a day orchestrated, Alistair suspected, by a man he’d once considered a friend.  He gripped his whiskey tumbler a little tighter, the amber liquid sloshing precariously close to the rim.  The ice clinked, a sharp sound that cut through the low hum of the city and the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  This wasn't just another bad day on Wall Street; this was the beginning of a war.
