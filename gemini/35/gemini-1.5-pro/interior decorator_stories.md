The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering strands of her auburn hair against her cranberry-colored lipstick.  She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter around her neck, the Burberry plaid a vibrant splash against the muted greys and browns of the Brooklyn brownstone she was appraising.  Number 17 Cranberry Street, the real estate listing had called it.  Ironically, Eleanor thought, eyeing the peeling paint on the front door, the current color scheme was closer to mud than cranberry.  Still, the bones of the house were good â€“ classic Greek Revival, with promising hints of original details peeking out from beneath decades of neglect.  Eleanor, whose keen eye for potential was the secret ingredient to her thriving interior design business, felt a familiar thrill of anticipation.  This wasn't just another client commission; this was a chance to breathe life back into a forgotten gem, a canvas yearning for her artistic touch in the heart of historic Brooklyn Heights.
