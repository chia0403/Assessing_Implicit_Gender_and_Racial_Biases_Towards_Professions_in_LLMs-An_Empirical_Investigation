The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles, carrying the metallic tang of snow and the distant drone of traffic from the highway.  He hunched deeper into his worn Carhartt jacket, the stiff canvas barely offering respite against the chill. Around him, the skeletal frame of the "Whispering Pines" development loomed against the pre-dawn sky, a stark latticework of unfinished timber and exposed wiring. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, surveyed the site with a practiced eye.  Fifty identical two-story houses, each promising warmth and family life, stood frozen mid-construction, victims of the developer's sudden bankruptcy.  Now, only the wind whispered through the empty window frames, a mournful symphony echoing the stalled dreams within these skeletal pines.  Elias, the sole electrician left on the abandoned project, had been hired by the bank to winterize the electrical systems, a lonely task in this desolate landscape of half-built hopes.  His van, a battered Ford Econoline with "Thorne Electric" stenciled on the side, sat idling nearby, its headlights cutting twin beams into the encroaching darkness.  This morning, however, Elias felt a different kind of chill, one that had nothing to do with the weather.
