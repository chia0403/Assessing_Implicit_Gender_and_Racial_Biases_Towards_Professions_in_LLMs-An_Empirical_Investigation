The rusty bell above the door of "Finnian's Fine Cuts and Close Shaves" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the low grumble of the approaching thunderstorm. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the deserted main street of Harmony Creek, Virginia.  Inside, Elias Finch, his apron dusted with clipped hairs, wiped down his straight razor with a practiced hand. The barbershop, a cozy space crammed with vintage barber chairs, framed photographs of impossibly coiffed men from bygone eras, and the faint, comforting scent of bay rum aftershave, was his sanctuary. The storm mirrored the turmoil brewing within him, a secret he kept locked tighter than the cash box under the counter.
