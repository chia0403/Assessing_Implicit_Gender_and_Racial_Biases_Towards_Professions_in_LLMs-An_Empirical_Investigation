The air in the Oakhaven Market hung thick and heavy, a miasma of sawdust, damp earth, and the metallic tang of blood.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, drumming a relentless rhythm against the symphony of shouting traders and clucking hens.  Jasper Finch, his apron stained crimson and his cleaver gleaming dully under the gas lamps, stood behind his stall, "Finch's Fine Meats,"  a bastion of order amidst the chaos.  His thick, calloused fingers, still slick despite repeated wipings on his already saturated apron, expertly trimmed a glistening side of pork belly. The rain, usually a deterrent to customers, tonight seemed to have driven them in, a huddled mass seeking solace in the warm, meaty smells emanating from Jasper's stall. Oakhaven, a small, isolated town nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, relied heavily on Jasper, not just for its Sunday roasts, but for a sense of normalcy, a steady hand in a world that often felt like it was tilting on its axis.  Tonight, however, the air crackled with a different kind of energy, a nervous hum that went beyond the usual Friday night bustle.
