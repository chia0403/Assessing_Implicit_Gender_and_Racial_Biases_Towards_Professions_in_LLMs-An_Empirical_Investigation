The biting November wind whipped around Captain Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the brim of his helmet.  Flakes of snow, fat and wet, began to fall, clinging to his soot-stained turnout gear.  Above him, the Chicago skyline was barely visible through the churning grey smoke that billowed from the top floors of the Burnham Building, a historic landmark currently undergoing renovations.  The acrid smell of burning wood and melting plastic filled the air, a potent cocktail that Elias had, unfortunately, become all too familiar with in his fifteen years with the Chicago Fire Department.  Red and blue lights pulsed across the scene, painting the surrounding snow a kaleidoscopic mess as fire engines roared and hoses snaked across the icy ground. The air crackled with the urgent chatter of radios and the shouts of firefighters battling the blaze. This wasn't just another fire; this was Elias's first major call since returning from medical leave, and the pressure to perform hung heavy in the frigid air.
