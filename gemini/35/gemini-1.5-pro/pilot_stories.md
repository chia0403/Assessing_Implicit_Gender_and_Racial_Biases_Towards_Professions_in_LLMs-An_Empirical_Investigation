The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Cartwright’s parka as she prepped the Cessna 185 on the frozen surface of Lake Hood.  Dawn was a hesitant smudge of grey on the horizon, painting the Chugach Mountains in a palette of charcoal and icy blue.  Breath plumed from Ace's nostrils, momentarily obscuring the web of cracks spidering across the lake’s icy surface.  Anchorage, still slumbering under a thick blanket of snow, twinkled faintly in the distance.  This was Ace's office – a vast, unforgiving wilderness stretching hundreds of miles in every direction, a place where survival depended on skill, nerve, and a healthy respect for the elements.  Today's flight was a routine mail and supply run to the remote village of Nikolai, nestled deep in the interior, but in Alaska, routine rarely meant predictable.  A low growl rumbled from the Cessna's engine, a reassuring sound against the howling wind, a promise of warmth and the familiar thrum of flight. The sky was waiting.
