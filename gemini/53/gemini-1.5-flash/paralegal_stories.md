The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Hernandezâ€™s crisp white blouse, a tiny, ironic snowfall against the oppressive July heat clinging to the back alleys of Brooklyn.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the droplets clinging to the overflowing overflowing trash cans below.  Amelia, a paralegal with a reputation for meticulousness that bordered on obsessive, adjusted her glasses, the thin wire digging into her temples.  The scent of simmering spices and exhaust fumes battled for dominance in the humid air, a pungent perfume uniquely Brooklyn.  She hadn't come to this crumbling brick building for the ambiance, however.  She'd come for the truth, buried somewhere within its cracked walls and shadowed corners, a truth that could send a powerful man to jail, or bury her own career under an avalanche of legal repercussions.  The flickering neon sign of "Sal's Pizzeria" cast a sickly yellow glow on the building's decaying facade, a grim, almost comical contrast to the serious business she was about to undertake.
