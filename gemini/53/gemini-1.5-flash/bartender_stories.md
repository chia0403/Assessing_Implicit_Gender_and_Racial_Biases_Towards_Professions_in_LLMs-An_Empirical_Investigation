The chipped Formica bar top gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the "Salty Siren," reflecting the weary lines etched into Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, a relentless percussion against the low hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation – the usual perfume of the late-night clientele at this dive bar nestled precariously on the edge of the docks in the perpetually rain-soaked town of Port Blossom.  Amelia, her auburn braid loosened and escaping its tie, wiped down the bar with a practiced hand, her movements as fluid and automatic as the tide ebbing and flowing outside.  Tonight, however, the usual rhythm of the Salty Siren felt…off. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine, a feeling more potent than the cheap tequila she'd been serving all night.
