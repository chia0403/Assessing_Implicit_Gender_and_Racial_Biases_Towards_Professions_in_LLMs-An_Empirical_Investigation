The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's already chapped lips as he wrestled a stubborn steel beam into place.  Above him, the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper clawed at the bruised, grey sky, a monument to ambition against the backdrop of a city choked by its own success.  Below, the streets of Manhattan hummed with a frantic energy, a symphony of honking taxis, screeching brakes, and the distant wail of a siren – a stark contrast to the quiet, controlled fury of Elias’s work.  He wore his usual uniform: worn jeans stiff with cement dust, a faded orange safety vest, and work boots that had seen better days, each scuff and gouge a testament to years spent battling concrete, steel, and the ever-present threat of gravity. The scent of sweat, metal, and the faintly sweet aroma of fresh concrete hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias, as familiar as the dull ache in his back.
