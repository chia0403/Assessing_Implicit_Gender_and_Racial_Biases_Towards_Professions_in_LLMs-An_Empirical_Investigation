The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley, illuminating the scene like a lurid stage set.  Detective Inspector Davies, his trench coat plastered to his frame, gestured towards the body slumped against a overflowing dumpster.  The stench of stale beer and something far more unpleasant – something metallic and sickeningly sweet – hung heavy in the air.  Dr. Evelyn Reed, forensic psychologist for the Metropolitan Police, shielded her nose with a gloved hand, her usually crisp, tailored suit now damp and dishevelled.  The downpour, relentless and unforgiving, mirrored the grimness of the situation.  This wasn't Evelyn's first rodeo, far from it, but the unsettling stillness of the victim, a young woman with eyes wide open in a silent scream, sent a shiver down her spine despite her years of experience.  The alley, a labyrinth of shadows and discarded refuse, felt more like a tomb than a backstreet in the heart of London.
