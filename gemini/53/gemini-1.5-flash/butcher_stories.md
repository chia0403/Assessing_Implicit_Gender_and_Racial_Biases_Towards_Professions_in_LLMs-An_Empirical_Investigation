The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of brine, blood, and woodsmoke, a perfume peculiar to the coastal town of Port Blossom.  Seagulls wheeled overhead, their cries a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's cleaver, slicing through a plump leg of lamb with practiced ease.  Barty, owner and operator of Butterfield's Fine Meats – a shop more charmingly ramshackle than fine – wiped his brow with the back of a hand perpetually stained crimson.  The morning mist still clung to the cobblestone street outside, blurring the edges of the fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbor, their masts like skeletal fingers against the pewter sky.  Inside, the butcher shop was a warm haven, lit by the flickering gas lamps and the cheerful glow of the wood-burning stove nestled in a corner, its comforting heat doing little to dispel the chill that seemed to seep from the very bones of Port Blossom itself.
