The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She stood perched precariously on the jagged rocks of Penwith Head, the wind whipping her auburn hair into a frenzy around her easel.  Below, the churning grey sea gnawed at the cliffs, a relentless symphony of crashing waves that echoed the turmoil within her own heart.  The sky, a bruised purple bruised by the fading light, mirrored the stormy palette she was attempting to capture on canvas â€“ a landscape as wild and untamed as Cornwall itself, a place where the earth seemed to writhe in perpetual rebellion against the sky.  The scent of brine and seaweed hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the isolation she both craved and feared.  Her small, battered wooden palette, cluttered with vibrant hues, felt strangely inadequate against the immensity of the scene before her. Tonight, however, Aurelia wasn't just painting the landscape; she was painting her soul.
