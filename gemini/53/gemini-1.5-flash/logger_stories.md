The biting wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, whipping snow into frenzied swirls around Jedediah "Jed" Stone's worn work boots.  He shifted his weight, the biting cold seeping through the layers of wool and canvas that comprised his winter attire.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar fragrance that had been Jed's constant companion for the past thirty years in the unforgiving wilderness of the Cascade Mountains.  His breath plumed out in white clouds, quickly swallowed by the swirling snow.  He stood on the precipice of a logging operation – a brutal scar on the otherwise pristine landscape – a stark reminder of the life he'd chosen, a life both rewarding and relentlessly demanding.  The roar of the chainsaw, a metallic shriek swallowed by the wind, was the only sound besides the relentless wind and the crunch of snow under his boots.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hidden behind a thick veil of clouds, offered little warmth.  Today, the mountain was a truly hostile mistress.
