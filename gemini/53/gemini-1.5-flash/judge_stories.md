The humid Louisiana air hung heavy and thick, a damp shroud clinging to the cypress trees that lined the bayou.  Fireflies blinked lazily, their ephemeral lights a stark contrast to the oppressive darkness clinging to the edges of Judge Evangeline Dubois’s expansive, moss-draped porch.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, maddening serenade, a soundtrack to the simmering heat that seemed to seep into the very bones.  Inside, the Judge’s antique fan creaked rhythmically, a counterpoint to the insistent chirping, doing little to dispel the suffocating stillness of the night.  Evangeline, a woman whose sharp intellect was only matched by the weariness etched into her face, sat on the porch swing, a half-empty glass of iced tea sweating onto the worn wood.  The scent of jasmine and decay mingled in the air, a peculiar perfume that perfectly captured the essence of her life in this remote corner of the bayou: a place of beauty, secrets, and simmering tensions, where justice was as elusive as the elusive moonbeams filtering through the Spanish moss.
