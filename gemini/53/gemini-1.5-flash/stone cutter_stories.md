The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the silent quarry, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of a distant hawk.  Dust, the fine, grey powder of a thousand years, motes in the pale morning sun, hung in the air like a shroud.  This was the heart of Cairngorm, a place where the mountains clawed at the sky and the wind howled like a banshee, a fitting backdrop for the solitary figure hunched over his work.  His name was Alasdair MacIntyre, and the cold, unforgiving stone was his canvas, his life's blood, and perhaps, his eventual tomb.  He worked with the rhythm of an ancient, forgotten prayer, each precise strike of his chisel shaping not just the raw material, but his own quiet contemplation.
