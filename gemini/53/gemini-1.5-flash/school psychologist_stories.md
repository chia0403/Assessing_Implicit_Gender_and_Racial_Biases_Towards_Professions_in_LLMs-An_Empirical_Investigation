The stale scent of disinfectant and old textbooks clung to the air in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, a space more reminiscent of a sparsely furnished waiting room than a haven for troubled minds.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes of Northwood High, cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn, floral-patterned carpet.  Eleanor, a woman whose forty-odd years were etched not so much in wrinkles as in the quiet weariness around her eyes, sat at her desk, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her pen against a notepad the only sound in the otherwise hushed room.  Outside, the relentless hum of Northwood, a sprawling suburban behemoth of brick and asphalt, throbbed with the barely contained energy of teenagers on the cusp of something – adulthood, perhaps, or something far more unsettling.  This wasn’t her first rodeo, not by a long shot, but even Eleanor, seasoned veteran of adolescent anxieties and teenage traumas, felt a prickle of unease settle in her stomach.  This case...this case was different.
