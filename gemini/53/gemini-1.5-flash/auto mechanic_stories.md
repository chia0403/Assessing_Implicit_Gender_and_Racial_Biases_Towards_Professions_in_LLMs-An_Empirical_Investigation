The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume that mingled with the sharp tang of ozone and the metallic tang of spilled coolant.  Amelia, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of grime and grease, wrestled with a stubborn distributor cap on a vintage Mustang, its cherry-red paint dulled by years of neglect.  The air hung thick and humid in her father's garage, "Hernandez Auto," a sprawling, chaotic haven of tools, parts, and half-finished projects tucked away on a quiet, tree-lined street in the heart of San Antonio, Texas.  The afternoon sun, already dipping low, cast long shadows across the concrete floor, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the single beam of a bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling.  Outside, the cicadas buzzed their relentless summer song, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clanging of Amelia's wrench.
