The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face, a familiar discomfort that mirrored the turmoil churning within.  Amelia, a writer whose bestselling novels painted idyllic Tuscan sunsets and whispered secrets of long-lost lovers, found herself utterly adrift.  The rusty, groaning hull of the *Sea Serpent*, a fishing trawler more accustomed to hauling cod than carrying authors, pitched violently beneath her.  The churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic stretched to the horizon, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards that populated her latest – and profoundly stalled – manuscript.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and diesel, held none of the lavender and rosemary that permeated her carefully crafted fictional worlds.  Amelia clutched a chipped mug of lukewarm tea, its warmth doing little to combat the icy wind that whipped through the gaps in the vessel's aging planks.  This wasn't the romantic escape she'd envisioned; this was a desperate, last-ditch attempt to find the inspiration that had abandoned her as completely as the land had disappeared beneath the waves.
