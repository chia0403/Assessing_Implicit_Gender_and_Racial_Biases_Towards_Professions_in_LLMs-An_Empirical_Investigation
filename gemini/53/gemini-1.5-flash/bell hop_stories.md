The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, reflecting the weary slump of Archibald "Archie" Finch's shoulders.  Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  It wasn't the downpour itself, though the relentless drumming on the glass was certainly irritating, but the weight of another slow Tuesday night at the Grand Majestic.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, expensive perfume, and something faintly floral that Archie suspected was a desperate attempt to mask the underlying aroma of aged upholstery and simmering resentment.  The Grand Majestic, once a jewel of the city, now felt more like a gilded cage, its grandeur slowly fading like a watercolour left in the rain. Archie, in his crisp, though slightly rumpled, uniform, was a small, unnoticed speck in this opulent decay, a silent observer to the dramas unfolding within its decaying walls.
