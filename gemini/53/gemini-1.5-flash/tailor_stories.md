The scent of lavender and aged oak hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind rattling the single-paned windows of Silas Blackwood's tailor shop.  Silas, a man whose life was measured in the precise stitches he took and the careful drape of a well-cut garment, sat hunched over a half-finished tweed jacket, his nimble fingers dancing across the fabric like spiders spinning a web of exquisite detail.  The shop itself, nestled on a cobbled lane tucked away from the bustling heart of Edinburgh, was a haven of quiet industry.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime on the glass, painted dappled patterns across rolls of rich velvets, bolts of shimmering silk, and stacks of perfectly pressed linen, a testament to years of dedication and painstaking craftsmanship.  The rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock, a family heirloom, punctuated the only other sound â€“ the gentle hiss of Silas's shears, a familiar symphony in this sanctuary of sartorial artistry.
