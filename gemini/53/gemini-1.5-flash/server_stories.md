The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated with the low hum of the refrigerator motor, a counterpoint to the clatter of silverware and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Lydia Mae Cartwright's worn-out sneakers against the linoleum floor of the "Sunrise Diner."  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour for the bleary-eyed and the desperately hungry, a time when the neon glow outside cast long, distorted shadows across the sticky booths and the perpetually sticky counter.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, frying bacon, and something vaguely floral Lydia suspected came from the eternally wilting bouquet of plastic lilies perched on the cashier's counter.  Lydia Mae, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, expertly navigated the cramped space, balancing a tray laden with lukewarm coffee and a plate piled high with pancakes the size of dinner plates.  Another night, another mountain of greasy goodness to conquer before the sunrise finally chased away the lingering shadows of the night.
