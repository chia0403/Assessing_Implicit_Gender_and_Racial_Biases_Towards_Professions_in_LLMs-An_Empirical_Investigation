The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful song around Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's rig, a tune as familiar to him as the rumble of his eighteen-wheeler's engine.  He sat hunched in the worn leather of his driver's seat, the cab illuminated by the flickering neon glow of a roadside diner a hundred yards back, its light painting stripes across the swirling snow.  Outside, the Interstate 80 stretched before him like a pale, frozen ribbon, disappearing into the blizzard's white maw.  The air inside the cab, despite the heater battling furiously, held the chill of the vast, unforgiving landscape, a stark contrast to the steaming mug of black coffee clutched in his calloused hand.  Barty wasn't just tired; he was bone-deep weary, the kind of exhaustion that settled in your soul as surely as the snow settled on the Wyoming plains.  This wasn't just another haul; this was a run against the clock, a race against the encroaching storm, and Barty Higgins knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the wind, that the stakes were higher than just delivering a load of frozen goods.
