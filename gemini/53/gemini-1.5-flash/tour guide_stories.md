The humid air hung heavy and sweet, a cloying blend of frangipani and exhaust fumes that clung to everything in the ancient city of Puno, Peru.  Amelia Hernandez, her dark braid bouncing against her sun-baked shoulders, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar.  The cobblestones beneath her worn leather sandals were slick with a recent shower, reflecting the hazy Andean sunlight in shimmering patches.  Before her, a small group of tourists – their faces a mixture of eager anticipation and weary jet lag – shuffled expectantly, clutching their brightly coloured pamphlets.  Amelia smiled, a practiced, reassuring expression that masked the familiar tremor of nerves that always accompanied the beginning of a new tour.  This wasn't just any tour; this was the "Mysteries of the Uros Floating Islands" expedition, and today, the legends whispered on the wind held a particular weight for Amelia.  For today, she carried not just the hopes of her clients, but also a secret, a family legacy woven into the very reeds that formed the islands themselves.
