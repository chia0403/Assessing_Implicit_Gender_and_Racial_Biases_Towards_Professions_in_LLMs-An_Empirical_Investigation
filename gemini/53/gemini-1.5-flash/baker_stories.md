The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia Katherine Finch like a damp shroud as she unlocked the bakery doors.  Frost, delicate as spun sugar, dusted the windowpanes of "Finch's Flourishes," its charmingly crooked lettering barely visible in the gloom.  The air, still thick with the scent of woodsmoke from neighboring chimneys, mingled with the sweeter, yeasty perfume already rising from within: a symphony of warm sourdough, caramelizing apples, and the faintest hint of cardamom.  Inside, the bakery was a haven of warmth, a comforting orange glow spilling from the ancient brick oven, illuminating shelves laden with yesterday's still-warm loaves and the promise of a new day's baking.  This wasn't just a bakery; it was Amelia's sanctuary, her legacy, and the very heart of the quaint, sleepy village of Oakhaven.
