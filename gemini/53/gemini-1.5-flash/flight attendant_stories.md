The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar scent to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois.  It clung to her crisp, navy-blue uniform like a second skin, a testament to another 12-hour flight, another cross-country trek from the bustling chaos of JFK to the sun-drenched serenity of Los Angeles.  This time, however, the usual low hum of the engines was punctuated by an unsettling silence – a silence that felt heavier than the lingering aroma of stale coffee and duty-free perfume.  Sera stared out the oval window of the cockpit jump seat, the city lights of LAX twinkling below like a scattered handful of diamonds on a velvet cloth.  But the beauty was overshadowed by the ominous, bruised purple of the twilight sky, a canvas pregnant with an approaching storm that mirrored the unease clenching her stomach.  This wasn't just another flight; something felt… wrong.
