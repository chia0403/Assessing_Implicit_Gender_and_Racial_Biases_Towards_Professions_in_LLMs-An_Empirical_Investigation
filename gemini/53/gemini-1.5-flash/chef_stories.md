The humid air hung heavy with the scent of roasting chiles and simmering spices, a fragrant curtain separating Chef Emilia “Mia” Rodriguez from the chaos of the bustling Mercado San Juan.

Sunlight, fractured by the woven awnings overhead, dappled the rough-hewn cobblestones, illuminating the vibrant displays of fruits, vegetables, and herbs that overflowed from overflowing baskets and wooden crates. This was Mia’s kingdom, a sensory explosion she navigated with the practiced ease of a seasoned queen.
