The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Dubois.  It clung to the plush velvet chairs of her salon, "Shear Indulgence," clinging also to the worn wooden floorboards beneath them and even, faintly, to the intricate floral wallpaper that threatened to overwhelm the space with its riot of faded roses and lilies.  Rain lashed against the oversized windowpanes overlooking the cobbled street of Rue des Fleurs, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Sera's heart.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos of her salon was absent.  Instead, a thick, unnerving silence held court, broken only by the occasional hiss of the leaky radiator and the frantic ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a metronome counting down to something…unforeseen.
