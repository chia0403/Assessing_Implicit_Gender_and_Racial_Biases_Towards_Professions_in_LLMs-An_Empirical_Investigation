The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the "Salty Siren."  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered wood.  Gulls cried overhead, their calls a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic creak of the boat.  Eleanor, her sensible beige trousers damp and clinging to her legs, shivered despite the warmth of the setting sun. This wasn't exactly the typical setting for a nutritional consultation, but then again,  Captain Silas Blackwood wasn't your typical client. His request – a dietary plan that would allow him to continue his legendary deep-sea fishing while simultaneously reversing decades of questionable culinary choices – was, to put it mildly, challenging.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine and something faintly…fishy.  Eleanor hoped it was just the fish.
