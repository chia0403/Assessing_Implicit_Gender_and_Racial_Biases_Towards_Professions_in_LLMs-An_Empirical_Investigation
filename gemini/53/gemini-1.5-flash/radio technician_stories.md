The acrid tang of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, radio technician extraordinaire – or at least, that’s what his slightly-too-enthusiastic business cards proclaimed.  Elias, however, preferred the less flamboyant title of "fixer of broken waves."  His workshop, tucked away in the shadowed alley behind the bustling fish market of Port Blossom, was a testament to this preference.  It wasn't glamorous; it was a chaotic symphony of spare parts: tangled wires snaked across every surface, valves and transistors lay scattered amongst half-eaten sandwiches, and the air vibrated with the low hum of a dozen different radios, each broadcasting a different language, a different story, into the cramped space.  The rhythmic slap of waves against the harbour wall provided a constant, almost hypnotic, backdrop to the workshop's electronic cacophony.  Tonight, however, even the familiar rhythm of the sea felt off-key, punctuated by an unsettling silence that seemed to emanate from the heart of the storm brewing just offshore.
