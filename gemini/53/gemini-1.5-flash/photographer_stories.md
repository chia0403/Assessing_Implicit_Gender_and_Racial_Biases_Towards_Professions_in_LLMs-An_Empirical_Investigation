The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Stone’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red.  She tugged her worn wool scarf tighter, the rough texture a stark contrast to the smooth, cold steel of the Leica M6 hanging heavy around her neck.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decay, a perfume uniquely Reykjavík, clinging to the basalt cliffs that clawed at the churning grey Atlantic.  Below her, the city sprawled, a patchwork of brightly coloured houses clinging precariously to the volcanic slopes, a scene both breathtaking and brutally unforgiving.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  This wasn't just another assignment; this was a pilgrimage, a desperate attempt to capture the elusive spirit of Iceland, a spirit that seemed as tempestuous and unpredictable as the ocean before her.
