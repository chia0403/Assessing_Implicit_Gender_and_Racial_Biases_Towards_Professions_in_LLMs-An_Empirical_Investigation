The acrid bite of smoke, thick and greasy with the scent of burning plastic and something sickeningly sweet, clawed at Captain Elias Thorneâ€™s throat.  He coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the three-story Victorian on Elm Street.  Flames, a malevolent orange dance, licked at the crumbling brickwork, casting long, flickering shadows that writhed like tormented spirits across the rain-slicked cobblestones of the narrow alleyway.  The relentless drumming of water against the metal of his helmet was a counterpoint to the crackling symphony of destruction, a desperate rhythm against the chaotic pulse of the fire.  Above the din, he could hear the panicked screams of trapped civilians, a desperate chorus he was sworn to answer.  This wasn't just another blaze; this was a fight for lives, a battle waged in the heart of Old Town, a labyrinth of twisting streets and crumbling architecture that held both beauty and brutal danger in equal measure.
