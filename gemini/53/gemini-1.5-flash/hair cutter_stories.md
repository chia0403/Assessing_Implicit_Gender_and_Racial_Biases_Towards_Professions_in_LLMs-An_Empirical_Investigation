The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Clementine "Clem" Hawthorne's salon, "The Snip & Stitch."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of her tiny shop, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and the chipped porcelain sink where she’d just rinsed the vibrant crimson from a client’s hair. Outside, the relentless thrum of the city – the screech of tires, the blare of sirens, the incessant chatter of a thousand hurried conversations – faded to a muffled roar against the thick, soundproofed walls Clem had painstakingly installed years ago.  The only other sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging a slow, measured beat against the frantic energy of her life.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A stillness, thick and unnerving, had settled over The Snip & Stitch, a silence that Clem felt prickling at the edges of her skin.
