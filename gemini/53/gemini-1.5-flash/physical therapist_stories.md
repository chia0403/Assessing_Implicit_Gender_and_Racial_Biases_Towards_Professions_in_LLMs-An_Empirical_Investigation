The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from a tangle of kelp.  The relentless Atlantic wind whipped her auburn hair across her eyes, momentarily obscuring the dramatic, craggy cliffs of the Maine coast.  Below her, the churning grey sea hammered against the jagged rocks, a constant, rhythmic roar that was both terrifying and strangely soothing.  Eleanor, a physical therapist with hands as strong as any fisherman's and a heart as weathered as the ancient pines clinging to the cliff face, wasn't supposed to be here, hauling nets.  But this wasn't just any fishing net; it belonged to Finnigan O'Malley, a patient, a friend, and a man whose stubborn refusal to follow doctor's orders had landed him in a predicament far more perilous than any physiotherapy session.  The scent of brine and seaweed hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile aroma of the clinic she usually called her office.  Today, her office was the unforgiving, beautiful wilderness of the Maine coast.
