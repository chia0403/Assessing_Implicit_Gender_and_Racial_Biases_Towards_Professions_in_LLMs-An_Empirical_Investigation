The chipped porcelain of Amelia Katherine "Amy" Finch's mug warmed her fingers, a small comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the old Victorian windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass panes, blurring the already dismal view of the perpetually grey Cornish coastline.  Inside, her cramped office, smelling faintly of damp wool and yesterday's lukewarm tea, was a study in organized chaos.  Policy files overflowed from their precarious stacks, threatening a paper avalanche at any moment.  A half-eaten Cornish pasty sat forlornly on her desk, a testament to a lunch break swallowed whole by a frantic phone call from a client whose prized prize-winning cow had inexplicably fallen into a quarry.  Amy sighed, swirling the lukewarm tea, the bitter taste mirroring the day's unfolding events.  It was, she thought, shaping up to be another typically unpredictable Tuesday in the sleepy, yet surprisingly accident-prone, town of Portwenn.
