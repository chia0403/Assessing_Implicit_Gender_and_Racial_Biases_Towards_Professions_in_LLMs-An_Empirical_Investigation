The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bonanza" hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez’s simmering frustration.  Dust motes danced in the weak beams, illuminating the haphazardly arranged aisles of discounted appliances and chipped crockery.  Amelia, a seasoned salesperson with a smile that could curdle milk and a commission-driven desperation that could charm a badger into buying a fur coat, adjusted her too-tight blazer.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and regret – a familiar aroma in this particular purgatory of retail.  Today, however, the usual lethargy was replaced by a prickling sense of foreboding.  A particularly stubborn stain on the carpet – shaped unnervingly like a footprint – seemed to pulse faintly in the dim light.  This wasn’t just another slow Tuesday at Bargain Bonanza; something felt… off.
