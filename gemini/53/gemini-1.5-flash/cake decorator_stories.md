The scent of vanilla bean hung heavy in the air, a sweet counterpoint to the metallic tang of fear clinging to Aurelia "Relly" Blackwood's apron.  Relly, a woman whose hands could coax roses from buttercream and construct miniature Eiffel Towers from marzipan, felt a tremor in her usually steady fingers.  It wasn't the usual pre-competition jitters; this was different.  This wasn't a cake-off at the county fair, with its friendly rivalry and predictable judging panel.  This was the kitchen of "Le Fleur," the most exclusive patisserie in Paris, and the air crackled with unspoken tension, thick as the ganache coating the decadent chocolate cake cooling on the marble countertop before her.  Outside, the Parisian twilight painted the city in shades of lavender and amethyst, a breathtaking vista Relly couldn't appreciate, her gaze fixed on the single, perfectly formed, blood-red poppy nestled amongst the otherwise pristine white frosting.  A single, unsettling detail in a meticulously crafted masterpiece, and a harbinger of the storm brewing within the patisserieâ€™s walls.
