The rasping shriek of metal on metal, a sound Elias Thorne knew better than the back of his own hand, sliced through the pre-dawn quiet.  Elias, a man whose hands were perpetually stained the ochre of highway tar and whose calloused fingers bore the imprint of countless asphalt patches, squinted at the bruised purple sky.  The biting November wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 40, whipping dust devils across the Arizona desert that painted the already stark landscape in shades of sepia and grey.  His battered pickup truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Grader," sat idling nearby, its engine a low growl of comforting companionship against the vast, empty expanse.  This was Elias's domain: miles of cracked pavement, broken guardrails, and the ever-present threat of speeding eighteen-wheelers, a landscape as unforgiving as the man himself.
