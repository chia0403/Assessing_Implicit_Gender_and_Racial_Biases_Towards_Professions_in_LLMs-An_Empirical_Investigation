The scent of old varnish and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Aurelia Blackwood truly appreciated. Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun slanting through the grimy sash windows, danced in the cavernous space.  Aurelia, a woman whose tailored suits always seemed to perfectly match the mood of her surroundings (today, a deep charcoal grey that echoed the gloom of the abandoned Victorian mansion), ran a gloved hand along the peeling wallpaper, its once-vibrant floral pattern now a faded whisper.  This wasn't just any derelict property; this was Blackwood Manor, rumored to be haunted, and Aurelia Blackwood, despite her reputation for transforming the most challenging spaces into breathtaking havens, felt a tremor of unease – a rare crack in her usually unwavering confidence. The manor, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the turbulent Atlantic, seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the storm – both literal and metaphorical – to break.
