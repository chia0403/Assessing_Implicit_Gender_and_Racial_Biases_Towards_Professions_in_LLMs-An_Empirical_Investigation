The siren's wail was a banshee scream, slicing through the pre-dawn stillness of the San Francisco fog.  Visibility was down to near zero, the Golden Gate Bridge a ghostly silhouette barely discernible through the swirling grey.  Rain, icy and relentless, plastered itself against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the already indistinct streetlights into shimmering halos.  Inside, Dr. Evelyn Grace Montgomery, her usually crisp white coat damp and clinging, gripped the side of the stretcher, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the emergency vehicle a counterpoint to the erratic beat of her own heart.  The patient, a young woman clutched in the arms of a frantic-looking man, coughed violently, a shuddering gasp escaping her lips â€“ each breath a desperate struggle against the tightening vise of what Evelyn suspected, with grim certainty, was a severe asthma attack.  The air crackled with the urgency of the situation, the city's usually vibrant pulse muted by the oppressive fog and the weight of life hanging in the balance.
