The biting November wind whipped at Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s tailored coat as she surveyed the desolate, windswept landscape.  The Scottish Highlands stretched before her, a tapestry of muted browns and bruised purples under a sky the color of pewter.  Jagged peaks clawed at the bruised sky, their summits shrouded in a low, swirling mist that seemed to cling to the very bones of the land.  This was it – the location for her ambitious new film, *The Serpent’s Kiss*, a gothic thriller she’d poured the last five years of her life into.  The air, thick with the scent of peat and damp earth, carried a melancholic beauty that perfectly matched the dark heart of her story.  Izzy, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the thick wool scarf around her neck, a small, defiant smile playing on her lips. This shoot wouldn’t be easy, not by a long shot. But it would be breathtaking.
