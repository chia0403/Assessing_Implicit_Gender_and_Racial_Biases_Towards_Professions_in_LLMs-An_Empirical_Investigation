The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed as she wrestled the controls of her de Havilland Beaver.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, jagged teeth bared against a bruised purple sky, clawed at the encroaching twilight.  A fresh dusting of snow, untouched except for the propeller’s furious churn, coated the unforgiving terrain, turning the already treacherous landing strip at Port Alsworth into a glistening, perilous expanse of ice and compacted powder.  Evie squinted, her breath fogging in the frigid cockpit air. This wasn't just a flight; it was a battle against the elements, a dance with death played out against the breathtaking, brutal backdrop of the Alaskan wilderness.  The radio crackled, a tinny voice barely audible above the wind’s roar, relaying a distress call – a lone hunter, injured, miles from anywhere.  Evie checked her fuel gauge, the needle hovering precariously close to empty.  This was going to be a long night.
