The scent of Bay Rum and sawdust hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, a scent that clung to him like a second skin after fifty years behind the clippers.  His barbershop, Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour, was a relic, a stubbornly persistent island of old-fashioned charm in the churning sea of a rapidly modernizing downtown Memphis.  The walls, painted a faded forest green, were adorned not with sleek chrome advertisements, but with framed photographs of past patrons â€“ grinning gangsters, stoic blues musicians, and generations of Thorne family members, each sporting their own distinct cut.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun that sliced through the grimy window, illuminating the swirling chaos of hair clippings that carpeted the floor like a neglected, auburn snowdrift.  Outside, the relentless Memphis heat beat against the glass, but inside Thorne's, time seemed to move at its own, more leisurely pace.
