The biting wind whipped Amelia Rose Harding's hair across her face as she wrestled the battered, rust-colored ambulance into the gravel lot outside the isolated mountain village of Silver Creek.  Dust devils danced in the frigid air, swirling around the skeletal remains of a centuries-old oak that stood sentinel over the narrow, winding road.  The rhythmic thump of the engine, usually a comforting drone, felt almost deafening in the stark stillness of the valley.  It had been a long, treacherous drive, the snow-packed roads a relentless, unforgiving enemy.  Amelia, a paramedic with the Alpine Rescue Squad, felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach.  She'd already spent too much time on call this season, too much time battling the elements, and the silence of Silver Creek, punctuated only by the occasional distant howl of a wolf, felt unnerving.  This call wasn't just a routine injury; a frantic, breathless plea had come over the radio, a plea that spoke of something far worse. The crisp morning air, usually invigorating, now felt heavy with unspoken dread.
