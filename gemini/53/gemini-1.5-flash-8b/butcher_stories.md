The chill of the dawn seeped into the cobbled alleyway, clinging to the damp stone like a shroud.  Dust motes, illuminated by the pale, filtered light of the rising sun, danced in the air above the butcher shop, "The Cleaver's Cut," owned by Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw.

He was already at work, his calloused hands moving with practiced precision as he carved a hefty ox rump, the rhythmic thud of the cleaver echoing against the stone walls.  This was his world, this was his rhythm, the pulse of the city beating in the steady drip of blood onto the worn wooden slab.
