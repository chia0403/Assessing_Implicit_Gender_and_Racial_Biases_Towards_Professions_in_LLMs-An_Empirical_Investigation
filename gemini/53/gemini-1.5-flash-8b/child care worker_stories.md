The fluorescent lights of the "Rainbow Sprout" daycare hummed, a monotonous drone punctuated only by the rhythmic clatter of plastic toys and the occasional, high-pitched squeal of a delighted child.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm in Amelia Grace Blackwood's chest.  She scrubbed a stubborn smear of blueberry jam off a tiny, scraped knee, the cool antiseptic almost a comfort against the rising tide of anxiety.  It was Tuesday, the day the twins, Leo and Lily, inevitably decided to unleash their inner volcanos of temper tantrums.  Amelia, a second-year child care worker,  had been on the verge of losing her cool for the past forty-five minutes.  Today, however, felt different.  An undercurrent of unease, thicker than the January fog clinging to the town of Oakhaven, permeated the air.  The usual chaos, the controlled pandemonium of a preschool, feltâ€¦wrong.


The daycare, nestled in the heart of a quiet, largely residential section of Oakhaven, was a deceptively cheerful place.  Brightly colored walls, adorned with crayon-drawn rainbows and stick-figure families, contrasted sharply with the stark, gray landscape outside.  The small, enclosed play area smelled faintly of baby powder and old wood.  Sunlight, usually abundant in the afternoons, was scarce today, the thick clouds blotting out the fading light.  Amelia felt the chill not just from the weather, but from the atmosphere, an almost palpable weight settling over the cheerful room.  There was an unsettling stillness to the quiet; a hush that hung heavier than the rain.
