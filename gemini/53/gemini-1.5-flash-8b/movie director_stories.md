The flickering neon sign of the "Crimson Comet" diner cast a lurid, sickly orange glow across Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the already chaotic symphony of clattering dishes and hushed conversations swirling within.  The diner, nestled in the heart of the grimy, industrial sprawl of Zenith City, smelled of burnt coffee and desperation. Amy, a woman of sharp angles and even sharper wit, nursed a lukewarm black coffee, her gaze fixed on the swirling grey clouds outside.  This was it. The final, agonizing moments before the reality of her latest directorial failure crashed down.  She’d poured her soul – and her meager savings – into "Echoes of the Void," a science fiction epic that had, judging by the lukewarm reviews, landed somewhere between a critical lambaste and a polite yawn.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of the rain seemed to echo the frantic drumbeat of her own thoughts. This film wasn't just a failure; it was a monument to everything she’d sacrificed. The future, as always, felt a long, dark tunnel ahead.
