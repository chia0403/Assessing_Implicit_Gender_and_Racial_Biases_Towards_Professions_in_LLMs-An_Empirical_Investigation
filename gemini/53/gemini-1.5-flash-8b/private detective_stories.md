The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated warehouse, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Amelia Kensington's temples.  The air, thick with the stench of mildew and something indefinably oily, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia Kensington, private investigator, wasn't accustomed to this kind of setting.  Her usual clientele, the well-heeled and the thoroughly respectable, rarely frequented the back alleys of the port city of  Aethelred.  But the scent of burnt sugar, strangely familiar and yet unnervingly specific, had led her here, to this forgotten corner of the city, a place where shadows stretched long and the secrets whispered on the breeze seemed to hold a grim, metallic tang.

The warehouse, a cavernous space swallowed by gloom, was lit only by the sputtering gas lamps that hung precariously from the ceiling, casting grotesque shadows that danced with the rain-slicked floor.  Stacks of crates, overflowing with unknown goods, lined the walls, their labels faded and illegible.  A sickly sweet smell, almost cloying, mingled with the grime, a contrast to the harsh realities of the environment.  This wasn't the opulent London salons she was accustomed to. This was a different kind of puzzle, one that spoke of desperation and hidden truths, a labyrinth Amelia, with her sharp intellect and seasoned experience, was determined to unravel.
