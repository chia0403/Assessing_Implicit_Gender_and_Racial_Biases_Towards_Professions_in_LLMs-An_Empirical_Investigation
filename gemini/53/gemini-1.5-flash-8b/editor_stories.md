Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the "Apex Publishing" penthouse, blurring the cityscape of Neo-Kyoto into a hazy watercolor.  Inside, bathed in the cool, sterile glow of fluorescent lights, Amelia Nightingale, Senior Editor at Apex, hunched over her desk, a mountain of rejection slips piled around her like a miniature Everest.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Her meticulously organized workspace, a testament to her control-freak tendencies, was a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony raging outside.  Outside the window, the neon signs of the city flickered like fevered dreams, their light reflecting on the slick pavement below.  A single, flickering candle on her desk cast long, dancing shadows across the pages of the manuscript she was currently scrutinizing.

Amelia, 32, with hair the colour of raven's wings, and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand sleepless nights, sighed, her shoulders slumping.  Sheâ€™d been staring at these opening lines for the better part of an hour, each attempt at a gripping start dissolving into saccharine mediocrity.  This was the third novel vying for a spot in their upcoming anthology, "Echoes of the Chrysanthemum," and still, nothing clicked.  The city's rhythmic drumming against the glass was a metronome keeping time with her racing thoughts, each drop a relentless reminder of the deadlines looming, and the looming spectre of publisher dissatisfaction.
