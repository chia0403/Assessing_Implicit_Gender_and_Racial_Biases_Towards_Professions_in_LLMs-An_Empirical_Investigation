The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, clawed at the weathered clapboards of the old farmhouse, rattling the windows like a pack of restless spirits.  Dust devils, swirling eddies of ochre and grey, danced across the parched, sun-baked plains of the Chihuahuan Desert, mirroring the turmoil in Elias "Storm" Cartwright's soul.  He, Elias Storm Cartwright, rancher of the Cartwright Cattle Company, stared out at the desolate landscape, the skeletal branches of the mesquite trees reaching towards a bruised, indifferent sky.  Autumn had arrived, but the promise of rain remained stubbornly elusive.  His cattle, his livelihood, were dwindling, their flanks gaunt, their eyes hollow with thirst.  The once vibrant green of the foothills was now a faded tapestry of brown and muted greens.  The silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of the wind-battered farmhouse and the distant howl of a coyote, felt almost oppressive.  He needed rain.  He needed answers. He needed a miracle.  And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the coming weeks would be desperate.
