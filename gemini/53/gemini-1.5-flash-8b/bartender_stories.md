The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faintest of freckles scattered across her nose.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something vaguely floral, probably a desperation-flower perfume someone had worn too liberally.  Inside, the bar was a labyrinth of dark wood booths, dimly lit tables, and the constant murmur of hushed conversations and clinking glasses.  This was her domain, this cramped, slightly grimy haven on the backstreets of New Haven, a city perpetually veiled in a grey smog of rain and ambition. Amelia, her name a whisper of forgotten elegance, felt the familiar tug of responsibility as she surveyed her domain, the line of patrons growing longer, each one an unspoken story waiting to be poured, or maybe just ignored.  Tonight, though, something felt different.  A tremor of unease, a sense of anticipation that chilled her to the bone.  The city outside, usually a muted symphony of sirens and hurried footsteps, was almost silent.  It was as though the whole world held its breath, waiting.
