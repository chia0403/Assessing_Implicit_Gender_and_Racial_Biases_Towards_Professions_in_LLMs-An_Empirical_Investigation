The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom, a faded, pastel swirl of blues and pinks, felt like a second skin to Eleanor Vance.  Twenty-five years, twenty-five years of chalk dust settling on the worn linoleum, of squeaky chairs and the almost-too-loud laughter of children.  Today, though, the usual cacophony was muted, replaced by a low hum of nervous energy.  It wasn't just the usual Monday morning jitters, there was something... *different*.  A tangible shift in the atmosphere, thick as the morning mist clinging to the woods behind the school.

The school, St. Jude's Elementary, was nestled in the valley, a quiet haven of towering oak trees and whispering pines.  A ribbon of a winding road, perpetually dusted with the fine red clay, snaked up the hill, leading to a weathered brick building.  Stone steps, worn smooth by countless generations of children, beckoned visitors upwards.  Eleanor, usually a whirlwind of activity, found herself pausing, her eyes scanning the scene.  The windows, streaked with the morning light, offered glimpses into the classroomâ€”a familiar and comforting sight until now.  This particular Monday, though, something felt ... different.  A sense of anticipation hung heavy in the air, almost palpable.
