The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed, a monotonous drone that, in the stillness of the pre-bell quiet, amplified the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes of  Northwood High, a school built on the crumbling foundation of a forgotten industrial era.  Brick, stained a mottled grey and punctuated by chipped paint, bordered the overgrown courtyard where whispers of past glories mingled with the current cacophony of teenage anxieties.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the air, a tangible weight mirroring the emotional burden Eleanor felt pressing down on her.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that seemed to drag on like a forgotten errand, and she was already wrestling with the mountain of papers stacked on her desk â€“ essays filled with half-formed thoughts and angst-ridden poetry.  Northwood High, a testament to the fading dreams of a once-thriving town, was her responsibility, and for the moment, it felt like a crushing weight.
