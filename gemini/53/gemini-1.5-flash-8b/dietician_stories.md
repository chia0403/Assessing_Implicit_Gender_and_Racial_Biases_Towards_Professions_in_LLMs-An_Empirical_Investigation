Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding headache thrumming in Dr. Elara Nightingale's temples.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp earth, hung heavy in the small, cluttered examination room.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered paperwork piled high on Elara's mahogany desk.  Elara, a registered dietician with a practiced calm that rarely cracked under pressure, leaned back in her chair, tracing patterns in the condensation collecting on the chipped enamel mug warming her hands.

Seabreeze, a haven for the weary souls seeking solace on the coast, was a place where hope and despair lived cheek by jowl. Elara,  with her keen eye for nutrition and innate empathy, found herself deeply interwoven into this tapestry of lives, both privileged and impoverished.
