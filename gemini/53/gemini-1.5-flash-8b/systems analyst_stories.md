The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, low thrumming, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's life.  Elara Vance, systems analyst at GlobalCorp, stared at the blinking cursor, a lonely sentinel on her monitor.  The rhythmic pulse of the network cables, the soft hiss of the cooling fans, all melded into a symphony of digital activity that she understood intimately, almost viscerally.  But tonight, the symphony was off-key.  A persistent, insidious glitch was spreading through the GlobalCorp network, originating from an obscure, rarely-used department:  the department of Advanced Temporal Studies.

The server room, a concrete bunker beneath the gleaming skyscraper of GlobalCorp headquarters, was a cathedral to the digital age.  Rows upon rows of server racks, sculpted metal monoliths humming with the silent power of thousands of processors, stretched into the darkness, their metallic surfaces reflecting the pale light of the emergency lights.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and burnt electronics, hung heavy and still.  Elara, dressed in her usual practical grey hoodie and cargo pants, felt a tremor of unease.  This wasn't just another coding error. This felt... different.  This felt... temporal.
