The greasy haze hung low in the air of "Rusty Wrench," the tiny auto repair shop nestled between a used bookstore and a bakery that smelled perpetually of cinnamon and despair.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic clanging of Amelia "Ace"  Abernathy's wrench against the chassis of a battered, midnight-blue Ford pickup.  Ace, her name a testament to her unwavering spirit and surprisingly gentle hands, hunched over the truck's engine, the faint glow of the shop's single fluorescent light illuminating the intricate maze of wires and metal.  Beads of sweat, clinging to her brow, mirrored the grime coating her work-stained overalls.  The air, thick with the pungent aroma of burnt oil and recycled ambition, was punctuated only by the occasional muttered curse and the rhythmic whir of a rusted fan.  Outside, the rain continued its relentless assault, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost spectral, energy within the shop.
