The biting wind whipped Amelia Grayson's grey parka around her as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of the Northwood Rehabilitation Center.  The sprawling, brick building loomed before her, its windows like cold, empty eyes staring out into the desolate November landscape.  A single, skeletal oak tree, its branches clawing at the bruised sky, stood sentinel at the edge of the property, a stark reminder of the encroaching winter.  Amelia, a physical therapist with ten years’ experience, knew this place intimately, knew the subtle shifts in the air that heralded a stormy night.  Tonight, though, it felt more than just cold; it felt…heavy.  She carried the weight of the day with her, the quiet desperation of a patient whose dreams lay shattered on the cold, hard floor of progress.  Her own resolve, usually forged in steel, felt surprisingly fragile. Tonight, something felt...wrong.

The setting is a desolate, windswept November night outside a large, imposing Northwood Rehabilitation Center.  The building's imposing structure is a stark contrast to the barren landscape surrounding it.
