The chipped porcelain sink of the "Grand Azure" hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum, a counterpoint to the hushed whispers emanating from the opulent foyer beyond.  Rain lashed against the French windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a watercolour wash of grey.  Agnes Periwinkle, concierge of the Grand Azure, adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel.  The faint scent of Earl Grey tea, and something indefinably floral, clung to the air, a familiar perfume of the hotel's meticulously maintained atmosphere.  The clock on the wall, its gold hands etched with delicate flourishes, ticked inexorably towards midnight.  It was a night for secrets, for whispered anxieties, and for the quiet, almost imperceptible shifts in the lives of the Grand Azure's privileged clientele.
