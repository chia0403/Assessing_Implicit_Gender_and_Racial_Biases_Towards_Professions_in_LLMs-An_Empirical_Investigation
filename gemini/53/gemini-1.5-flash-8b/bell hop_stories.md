The humid air hung heavy over the Grand Victoria Hotel, clinging to the polished mahogany floors and the crisp linen of the meticulously arranged beds.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the ornate, stained-glass window of the lobby.  Elias Thorne, bellhop extraordinaire, or at least that was the title he'd bestowed upon himself in the quiet moments of late-night solitude, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another symphony of frustrated travelers and the perpetual clinking of luggage carts.  The scent of old leather and lilies hung thick in the air, a perfume Elias had come to both abhor and oddly crave.  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his satchel, a faint outline of the hotel's crest subtly embossed into the worn leather.

The Grand Victoria, a sprawling monument to opulence and slightly-overdone Victorian grandeur, stood proudly on the edge of the whispering city of Aethelgard.  Its imposing facade, a tapestry of carved stone and intricate wrought iron, seemed to swallow the sunlight whole as it dipped behind the towering Gothic spires of the surrounding cathedral.  Guests, dressed in a kaleidoscope of silks and satins, flowed through the revolving doors, their whispers and laughter a constant, if subdued, hum.  Elias, stationed at the bell desk, a polished surface mirroring the restless energy of the bustling hotel, felt utterly insignificant amidst this grand display of wealth and fleeting joy.
