The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Grocer" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, reflecting off the chipped enamel of the soda cooler, a miniature sun in the cavernous store.  Rows of brightly coloured produce, now slightly bruised and wilting, lined the walls.  A faint, sickly sweet scent of decaying strawberries hung heavy in the air, a counterpoint to the overwhelming aroma of stale coffee brewing in the back room. Amy, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that seemed permanently stretched, scanned the latest batch of discount potatoes.  The year was 2024, and the perpetual twilight of a rapidly overheating planet cast a muted gray over the concrete-and-steel metropolis that had become her world.  The Corner Grocer, tucked away on a quiet side street, was a microcosm of the cityâ€™s struggles, a place where the remnants of normalcy met the harsh realities of climate change and scarcity.
