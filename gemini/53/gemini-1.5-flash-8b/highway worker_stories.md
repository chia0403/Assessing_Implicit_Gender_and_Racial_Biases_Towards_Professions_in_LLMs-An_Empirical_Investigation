The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  She hunched deeper into her worn, waterproof jacket, the greasy smell of asphalt and diesel clinging to her like a second skin.  The sun, a pale disc struggling behind a curtain of bruised grey clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows across the endless expanse of the desolate stretch of highway 16.  This stretch, known locally as “The Spine,” was notoriously prone to landslides and flash floods, a place where the raw, unforgiving beauty of the Sierra Nevada Mountains met the brutal reality of human infrastructure.

Amy, her name a quiet counterpoint to the roar of the wind, was a highway maintenance worker.  Not just a worker, but a custodian of this particular sliver of the world.  For the past five years, she’d navigated the treacherous terrain, the constant threat of rockfalls, the lonely miles, and the unrelenting monotony of patching potholes and resetting guardrails.  The highway, a ribbon of dark grey, stretched before her, seemingly endless, yet also utterly contained within the jagged, towering peaks surrounding her.  This particular morning, however, held a different kind of tension. The air thrummed with an unusual stillness, a premonition that hung heavy in the air like the moisture-laden fog that clung to the mountain slopes.  Something was different.  Something was…wrong.
