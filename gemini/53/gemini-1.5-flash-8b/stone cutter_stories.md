The biting wind whipped across the exposed crags of the Veridian Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  Dust, fine as powdered granite, swirled around her, coating her coarse linen tunic and the weathered stone tools strapped to her back.  High above, the jagged peaks of the Spine, a range rumored to be home to the ancient, wind-carved stone spirits, pierced the slate-grey sky.  Elara, her name a testament to the life-blood of the mountains, knelt before a towering monolith.  Its surface, a tapestry of swirling veins of pale gold and deep amethyst, spoke of a geological history older than any written record.  This was the Heartstone, a sacred landmark revered by the people of the Valley of Whispers, and Elara, a stone cutter of considerable skill and renown, was charged with its intricate carving.  Her hands, calloused and strong, trembled slightly with the responsibility, not from fear, but from the magnitude of the task.  The Valley of Whispers, nestled in the shadow of the Veridian Mountains, was a place of hushed reverence, where whispers of legends and ancient lore echoed through the canyons.  Simple life there revolved around the mountains, their stone and earth the very essence of their existence.  Elara, with her family's legacy steeped in generations of stone work, found profound meaning in shaping such enduring beauty.
