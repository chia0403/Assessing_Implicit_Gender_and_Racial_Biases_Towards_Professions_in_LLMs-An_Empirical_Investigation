Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated shack, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia Blackwood's chest.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and something subtly metallic, a scent that clung to the cobbled alley like a shroud.  Amelia, a sharp-eyed reporter for the *Riverton Chronicle*, crouched low, her worn leather boots sinking into the muddy ground.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows around her, highlighting the grime-coated brick walls and the skeletal remains of a once-bustling market.  This was the heart of the Blackwater district, a place whispered about in hushed tones and avoided by the respectable citizens of Riverton, a place where secrets festered and rumours bloomed like poisonous flowers.  Her assignment: uncover the truth behind the sudden, and suspiciously silent, disappearance of Silas Blackwood, a prominent merchant who'd vanished without a trace just three days ago.  Amelia knew this wasn't a simple missing person case.  The whispers spoke of smuggling, of hidden debts, and of something far darker lurking beneath the surface of Riverton’s polished façade.
