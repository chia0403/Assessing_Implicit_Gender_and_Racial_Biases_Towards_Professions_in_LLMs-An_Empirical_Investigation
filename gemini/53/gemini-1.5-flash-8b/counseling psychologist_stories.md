Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the turmoil brewing within Dr. Eleanor Vance.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the waiting room, highlighting the chipped paint and worn floral wallpaper, a stark contrast to the polished professionalism she projected during her sessions.  This particular Tuesday was a flurry of anxieties, each patientâ€™s unique storm colliding with the oppressive weather outside.  Across the room, a young man, his face hidden behind a thick, oversized jacket, shifted uncomfortably in his chair, a silent tremor in his posture reflecting the palpable tension in the air. Eleanor, with her meticulously neat grey cardigan and her ever-present calm, took a deep breath, her gaze unwavering as she prepared to welcome him into her office.  The smell of antiseptic mingled with the scent of stale coffee and impending rain, a familiar backdrop to the emotional landscapes she navigated each day.
