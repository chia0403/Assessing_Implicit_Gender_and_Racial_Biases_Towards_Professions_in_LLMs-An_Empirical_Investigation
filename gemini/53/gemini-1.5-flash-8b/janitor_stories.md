The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library hummed a mournful tune, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished marble floor.  Dust motes, tiny, ethereal dancers, swirled in the faint air currents, seemingly mocking Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, the library's night janitor.  Barty, a man whose face was weathered like a well-loved leather-bound book, sighed. Another night, another mountain of returned overdue novels, another faint aroma of aged paper and regret wafting through the hushed halls.  The library, a sprawling cathedral of knowledge, was his domain after hours, a place he knew intimately, from the hidden crevice behind the portrait of the founding benefactor to the whispering secret passages hidden within the labyrinthine stacks. Tonight, however, something felt different.  A different kind of stillness clung to the air, heavier than usual, a premonition of something more than just the usual quiet library hum.
