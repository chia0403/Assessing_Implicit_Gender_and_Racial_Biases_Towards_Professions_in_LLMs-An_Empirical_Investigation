The biting wind whipped Amelia "Stormcloud"  Kingston's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She crouched precariously on the rusted metal framework of the abandoned water tower, the city of Ashworth sprawling beneath her like a patchwork quilt of grey and ochre.  The tower, a skeletal sentinel against the bruised, perpetually overcast sky, was her current perch, her precarious office.  From this vantage point, Ashworth, a city choked by industrial grime and shrouded in a perpetual smog, seemed both magnificent and terrifying.  Below, the skeletal remains of skyscrapers, once proud emblems of progress, leaned precariously toward the heavens, like skeletal fingers clawing at the sky.  This was the view from 75 stories up, a vista of rusted steel, shattered glass, and the persistent, relentless howl of the wind.

Amelia, a roofer by trade, had seen her fair share of architectural oddities in her time.  From the crumbling facades of elegant Victorian homes to the jagged, industrial edges of the city's factories, her career had taken her to the heights and depths of Ashworth.  She wasn't your typical roofer.  Her specialty, her *niche* in this concrete jungle, was fixing the very heart of Ashworth's dilapidated infrastructure.  Not just replacing shingles, or patching leaks, but repairing the subtle damage that wind and time, and sometimes something else far more insidious, inflicted on the city's bones.
