The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending thunderstorms.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Sweat Equity" fitness centre, a testament to the relentless, equatorial sun that beat down on the sprawling compound just outside of Nairobi.  This was Amelia "Anya"  Owuor's kingdom, a haven of sweaty determination nestled amidst the vibrant, chaotic energy of the city.  Anya, a 30-year-old exercise instructor with a cascade of dark braids that bounced with each brisk movement, surveyed her domain.  Empty mats scattered like fallen leaves on the polished wooden floor.  The air buzzed with the anticipation of the evening Zumba class.  Tonight’s theme: "African Rhythms." Anya, clad in a vibrant, emerald green tank top and matching leggings, felt a surge of familiar excitement. Tonight, the city’s rhythm would be hers to command.
