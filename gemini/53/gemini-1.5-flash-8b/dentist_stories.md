The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the sterile white walls and the polished chrome instruments scattered across her work station.  A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, a constant companion in this small, almost claustrophobic space.  Outside, the city pulsed with a vibrant symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the quiet precision required within the confines of her practice, "The Gentle Grin."  Amy, a woman whose sharp angles and determined jawline often belied her soft eyes, concentrated on the patient in the chair, a young woman with a nervous tremor in her hand.  The scent of antiseptic mixed with the faint, sweet aroma of peppermint gum, a scent Amy had grown accustomed to, a comforting familiarity amidst the constant hum of the city.
