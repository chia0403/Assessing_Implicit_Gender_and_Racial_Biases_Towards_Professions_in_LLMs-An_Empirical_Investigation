The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow"  Fitzwilliam's already-chapped lips, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust devils, kicked up by the relentless desert sun, danced across the cracked earth, obscuring the skeletal remains of a once-proud city, now nothing more than crumbling stone and whispers of forgotten glory.

Amelia, their coach, stood atop a wind-scarred dune, her gaze sweeping the desolate expanse.  Each ripple in the sand, each fleeting shadow cast by the relentless sun, spoke volumes to her of the racers' hidden strengths and weaknesses, the vulnerabilities lurking beneath their steely exteriors.
