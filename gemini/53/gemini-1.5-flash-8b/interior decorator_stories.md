The house, perched on a windswept hill overlooking the grey, churning North Sea, was a study in contradictions.  Jagged peaks of slate roof battled with lush, overgrown gardens; grand, empty rooms, once the opulent heart of a bygone era, now lay shrouded in a thick, suffocating layer of neglect.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the library, where a massive oak desk, piled high with forgotten papers and dust, seemed to mockingly challenge her resolve.  The air, thick with the ghosts of forgotten parties and whispered secrets, felt heavy with the weight of history, a burden Amelia felt herself shouldering, one exquisitely fragile piece of her carefully constructed world at a time.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, a constant reminder of the unforgiving, unpredictable nature of both the weather and the man who had hired her.
