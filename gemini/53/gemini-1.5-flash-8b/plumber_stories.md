The flickering neon sign of "Mr. Fixit Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of the Lower Quarter.  Water, already pooling in the narrow alleyways, gurgled and hissed in the shadows.  Inside the cramped shop,  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with grease-stained hands and a perpetually furrowed brow, wrestled with a stubborn pipe.  He cursed under his breath, the sound muffled by the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of a leaky faucet echoing from the workshop.  The air, thick with the scent of copper and something vaguely floral (Barty suspected it was the old lady down the street's over-enthusiastic geraniums), hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive weight of the day.

The Lower Quarter of Oakhaven, a sprawling city built on the slopes of a forgotten volcano, was a labyrinth of narrow, twisting streets.  Towering, ochre-hued buildings crammed together, their aged facades crumbling in places, clinging precariously to the steep inclines.  Sunlight rarely reached the shadowed alleyways where Barty worked, casting a perpetual twilight that seemed to seep into the very bones of the city.  The relentless dampness, a constant companion in the Lower Quarter, clung to everything, from the overflowing gutters to the weary faces of the shopkeepers.  Barty, despite the challenges of his work and surroundings, felt a strange kinship with this part of Oakhaven, as if the very stones of the city understood the intricacies of a clogged drain.
