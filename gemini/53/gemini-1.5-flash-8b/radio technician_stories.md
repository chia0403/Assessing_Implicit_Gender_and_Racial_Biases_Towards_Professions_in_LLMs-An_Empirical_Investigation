The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio station hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the distant wail of a siren.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, each drop a tiny percussionist in a symphony of misery.  Inside, Amelia Petrova, radio technician extraordinaire, known throughout the crumbling city as "Sparky," hunched over a tangle of wires and ancient circuit boards.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and dust, clung to her, a second skin of faded sepia.  Outside, the city, once vibrant and bustling, now lay shrouded in a perpetual twilight, a testament to the fading light of a forgotten era.  Ameliaâ€™s greasy fingers traced the contours of a vintage amplifier, its etched metal a map of a bygone technological grandeur.  The station, once a beacon of communication, now echoed only with the ghosts of transmissions and the whispers of the storm.
