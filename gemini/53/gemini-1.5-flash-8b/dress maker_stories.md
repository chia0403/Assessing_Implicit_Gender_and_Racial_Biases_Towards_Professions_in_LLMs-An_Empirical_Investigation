The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting fog that clung to the cobbled alleyway and seeped into the very fabric of Amelia Nightingale's workshop.  Sunlight, fractured and dappled, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the intricate patterns laid out on the worn, mahogany table.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of deep, polished mahogany and hands that moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer, meticulously pinned a delicate silk rose to a bodice.  The workshop, nestled between a bustling market square and the whispering spires of St. Jude's Cathedral, was a haven of hushed whispers and rhythmic snips.  Old, ornate mirrors reflected the scene, distorting the light and Amelia's own focused concentration into a swirling vortex of textures and forms.  This was her world, her sanctuary, her life â€“  the quiet symphony of a dressmaker in the heart of a vibrant, yet often chaotic, medieval city.
