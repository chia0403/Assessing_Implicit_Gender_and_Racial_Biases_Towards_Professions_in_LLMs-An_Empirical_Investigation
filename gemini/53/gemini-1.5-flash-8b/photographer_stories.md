The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's camera bag tighter against her, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the frayed edges of her scarf.  Dust motes danced in the pale, filtered light of the late afternoon sun, painting the arid landscape in shades of ochre and grey.

This desolate expanse, she knew, held a story, etched into the very rock, waiting to be captured.
