The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the vet clinic, a rust-coloured blister on the otherwise emerald landscape of the Emerald Valley.  Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, a veterinarian with a shock of unruly auburn hair perpetually escaping its haphazard braid, hunched deeper into her worn leather coat.  The valley, once vibrant with wildflowers and the lowing of cattle, now lay shrouded in a pre-winter chill, a stark contrast to the summer heat she'd grown accustomed to in her ten years running Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic.  This clinic, nestled in the heart of a valley that once bustled with rural life, now felt more isolated than ever. The silence was punctuated only by the mournful cry of a lone owl and the occasional creak of the dilapidated building.  It was a Wednesday in late October, the kind of day that clung to the edges of twilight, promising a long, cold night.  Inside, the waiting room, normally filled with the anxious barks and whimpers of animals, was eerily quiet.  Ellie, a woman whose hands, calloused from years of handling animals, were surprisingly delicate, traced a nervous line on the worn Formica tabletop.  Something feltâ€¦off. Not just the unusual quiet, but a sense of impending doom that had settled over the valley like a thick fog.
