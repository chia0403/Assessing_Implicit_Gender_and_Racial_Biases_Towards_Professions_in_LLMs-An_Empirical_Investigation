The sterile white of the operating theatre hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum.  Sunlight, fractured by the frosted glass ceiling, painted elongated shadows across the meticulously arranged instruments.  Dr. Elias Thorne, surgical resident, felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach.  He wasn't nervous about the procedure itself â€“ he'd rehearsed the intricate steps a thousand times in his mind, practiced the delicate manoeuvres on countless cadavers.  No, this was different.  This was *personal*.

Setting:

The operating room, gleaming and sterile, was situated deep within the sprawling, ivy-covered walls of St. Jude's Hospital, a monument to medical dedication in the heart of the grey, industrial city of Ashhaven.  The city, choked by smog and factories, was a stark contrast to the serene, almost ethereal, atmosphere of the operating theatre.  A perpetual drizzle, a hallmark of the damp English climate, punctuated the constant hum of the city outside.
