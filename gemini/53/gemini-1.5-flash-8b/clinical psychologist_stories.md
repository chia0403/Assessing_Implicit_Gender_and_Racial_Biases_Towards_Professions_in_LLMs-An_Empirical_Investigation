Outside, the city of Alderhaven, a sprawling metropolis shrouded in perpetual grey, seemed to hold its breath, mirroring her own anxious stillness.

Individuals, once lauded for their intellectual prowess, now found themselves trapped in a web of self-doubt and crippling fear.  This pervasive neurosis, manifesting in a myriad of symptoms from insomnia and panic attacks to existential dread, had no clear origin.
