The salt spray kissed the shop's windows, carrying with it the tang of the sea and the cries of gulls.  Today was the busiest day of the week, a flurry of customers eager to find the perfect bloom for their loved ones, and Amelia, despite the chaos, found a strange peace in the familiar dance of petal and stem.  But a peculiar piece of news, delivered by a hurried messenger in the morning, had cast a shadow over the usual cheerful energy.
