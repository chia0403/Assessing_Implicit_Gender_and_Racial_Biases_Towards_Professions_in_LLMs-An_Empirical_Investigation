The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Springs Massage" cast a lurid, almost nauseating, glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Amelia Chen, owner and sole practitioner of the tiny, almost hidden establishment, adjusted the strap of her worn canvas tote bag, the weight of the day pressing down on her shoulders as much as the damp chill of the night air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the building, a relentless percussion against the silence that had settled over the city.

Serenity Springs wasn't exactly a haven of tranquility.  Nestled between a greasy spoon diner and a crumbling auto repair shop, the tiny storefront was a testament to a quiet desperation, its facade painted over decades of faded glory. Inside, however, lay a different kind of peace. A place where aches and pains, the stresses and anxieties of the concrete jungle, were momentarily laid to rest.  Amelia, with her calm, steady hands and the practiced ease of a seasoned healer, was the architect of that fragile serenity.


The setting:  A rain-soaked alleyway in a gritty, forgotten part of a sprawling, concrete city.  The year is 2024.
