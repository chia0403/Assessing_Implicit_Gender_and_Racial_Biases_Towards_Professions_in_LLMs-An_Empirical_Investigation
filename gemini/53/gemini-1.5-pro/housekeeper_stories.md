The biting November wind whipped around Eliza Mae Thistlewick's ankles as she trudged up the long, gravel driveway of Blackwood Manor.  Dead leaves, the color of rust and decay, swirled around her like disgruntled spirits. The manor itself loomed against the bruised, twilight sky, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded glass windows, most of which were dark and unwelcoming.  Blackwood Manor had stood for centuries, clinging to the edge of the windswept Yorkshire moors like a stubborn, gnarled tree, and Eliza, for the last five years, had been its solitary housekeeper, its silent guardian against the encroaching dust and the creeping shadows.  She knew every creaking floorboard, every dusty corner, every whisper of the wind that snaked through its echoing halls.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  A prickle of unease danced on her skin, a premonition as cold and sharp as the wind itself.  The air smelled of rain and something else… something faintly metallic, something like… fear.
