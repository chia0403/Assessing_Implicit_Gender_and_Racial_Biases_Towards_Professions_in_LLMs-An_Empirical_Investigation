The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her face as she hurried toward the imposing brick facade of Ashworth Preparatory Academy. Gargoyles perched atop the gothic archway, seeming to sneer down at her with knowing granite grins.  A thick layer of frost crunched under her sensible boots.  Ashworth, nestled deep in the Hudson Valley, was a prestigious boarding school, steeped in tradition and shrouded in an almost unsettling quiet this time of year. The skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawed at the overcast sky, and the air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and something indefinably…melancholy. Eleanor shivered, pulling her wool coat tighter. This was her third year consulting for Ashworth, and the place still unnerved her. It wasn't the grand, almost oppressive architecture, nor the hushed whispers that seemed to permeate the very walls.  It was something more…a subtle undercurrent of unease that clung to the grounds like the persistent valley fog.  Today, that unease felt particularly palpable. She was here to assess a student, a scholarship boy named Finnigan Hayes, who had reportedly been exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior.  Eleanor adjusted her briefcase, the leather cold against her gloved hand.  She hoped, for both her sake and the boy’s, that this visit would prove less complicated than she anticipated.
