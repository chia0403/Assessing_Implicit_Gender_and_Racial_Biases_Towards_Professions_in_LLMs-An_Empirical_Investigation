The late afternoon sun, a hazy apricot colour, slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom.  Dust motes danced in the golden rays, illuminating the chaotic aftermath of a particularly enthusiastic art project involving glitter, glue, and pipe cleaners.  Tiny, hand-painted paper butterflies clung precariously to the ceiling fan, fluttering with every lethargic rotation.  Crayon marks adorned the worn wooden tables like tribal tattoos, and a faint, sweet smell of dried apple juice lingered in the air.  Rosedale Elementary, a squat brick building nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley, was slowly emptying for the day, the excited shrieks of children replaced by the gentle murmur of teachers tidying up and the rhythmic squeak of Mrs. Vance's rocking chair as she graded papers, a half-eaten apple perched precariously on her desk.  The air hung heavy with the promise of a summer thunderstorm, the kind that would roll in with a dramatic flourish and leave the world washed clean and smelling of ozone.
