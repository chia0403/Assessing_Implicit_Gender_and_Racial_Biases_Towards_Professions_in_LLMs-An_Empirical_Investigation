The wind, a constant companion on the high plains, whipped Eleanor Vance Cartwright's auburn braid across her chapped cheek.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Cartwright Ranch, swirling red dirt against a sky the colour of faded denim.  The ranch, nestled in the heart of the Texas Panhandle, sprawled across thousands of acres, a patchwork of mesquite, scrub brush, and the occasional stubborn stand of cottonwood trees clinging to the dry creek beds.  The year was 1934, the heart of the Dust Bowl, and the usually vibrant green of spring was nowhere to be seen.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the hazy sky, beat down mercilessly, baking the already arid land.  Eleanor, her boots sinking slightly into the cracked earth, surveyed the scene with a familiar mix of weariness and determination.  The drought had been relentless, pushing both the land and its people to the brink.  But Eleanor Cartwright was not one to surrender easily.  She had inherited this ranch from her father, and she would be damned if she let a little dust – even a whole lot of dust – take it from her.
