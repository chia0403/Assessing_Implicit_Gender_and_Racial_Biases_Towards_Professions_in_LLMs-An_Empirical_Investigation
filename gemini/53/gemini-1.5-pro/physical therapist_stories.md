The relentless Oregon rain lashed against the windows of the Seaside Physical Therapy Clinic, mimicking the rhythmic thrumming in Elias Thorneâ€™s temples.  The clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a stubbornly persistent antique shop, usually held the comforting scent of eucalyptus and mint. Today, however, the air hung thick with the metallic tang of ozone and Elias's own rising anxiety. It was just past 7:00 am, the sky a bruised purple-grey, and Elias, despite his fifteen years of experience, felt a knot of unease tighten in his stomach. His first patient of the day, a local fisherman with a notoriously difficult personality, was due any minute, and Elias had a sneaking suspicion this appointment wouldn't be about rotator cuffs or pulled hamstrings. Something felt off, like the quiet before a storm, a storm that was brewing not out in the churning Pacific, but within the confines of his small, shingle-clad clinic.
