Below him, the scattered lights of Port Blossom winked faintly, nestled between the brooding silhouette of Mount Blackwood and the churning, iron-grey expanse of the North Sea.

He hauled the heavy toolbox the final few steps, the metal cold against his gloved hands, a familiar weight against his thigh.  The small, prefabricated hut that housed the relay station shuddered in the wind, a lonely sentinel against the gathering storm.  Inside, amidst the blinking dials and humming equipment, the erratic static intensified, a dissonant chorus that seemed to emanate not from the radio itself, but from the very air around him.
