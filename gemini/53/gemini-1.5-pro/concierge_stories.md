The rain hammered against the Art Deco windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop a tiny, frantic drumbeat against the backdrop of Chicago's roaring twenties.  Inside, the lobby glittered, a kaleidoscope of flapper dresses, polished marble, and the warm glow of Tiffany lamps.  Amidst this opulent chaos,  Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, the hotelâ€™s head concierge, stood as a serene island of calm.  Her navy uniform, impeccably tailored, contrasted sharply with the riot of color surrounding her, and her auburn hair, pulled back in a neat chignon, framed a face that was both intelligent and kind.  A string of pearls, her grandmother's legacy, rested against her collarbone, a subtle reminder of a simpler time, a stark contrast to the extravagant whirlwind of the Grand Majestic.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of activity felt charged, a subtle undercurrent of anticipation buzzing beneath the surface. Beatrice had a feeling tonight was going to be anything but ordinary.
