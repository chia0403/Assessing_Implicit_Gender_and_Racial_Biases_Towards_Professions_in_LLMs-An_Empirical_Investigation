The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, clinging to the brick walls of Bernadette "Bernie" Dubois's bakery like a comforting shawl.  The sky outside was the bruised purple of a pre-dawn plum, the only illumination coming from the warm glow spilling onto the cobblestone street from "Bernie's Bread Basket." Situated in the heart of the whimsical, perpetually-autumnal town of Hollow Creek, the bakery was a haven of warmth and sweet smells, a stark contrast to the misty chill that perpetually clung to the valley.  Bernie, her hands dusted with flour, hummed a tuneless melody as she slid another batch of her famous spiced pear and pecan scones into the oven, its ancient, iron door groaning in protest. The rhythmic clanging of the church bell nearby signaled the approaching dawn, and with it, the start of another day in a town where secrets were as common as sourdough starter.
