Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the Seattle skyline into a watercolor of greys and greens.  The 27th floor offered breathtaking views on clear days, but tonight, only the ghostly reflections of Elias's pale face and the flickering glow of his monitors pierced the gloom.  Empty takeout containers littered his mahogany desk, casualties of a coding marathon fuelled by lukewarm coffee and the insistent thrum of an approaching deadline.  Elias, fingers hovering over the keyboard, was lost in a labyrinth of code, chasing a particularly elusive bug in the new encryption software he was developing for ChronosCorp, a shadowy tech giant whose reach extended far beyond the sleek, glass-encased headquarters a few blocks down the hill. The air in the apartment, thick with the scent of stale pizza and ozone, crackled with a nervous energy, a palpable tension that mirrored the frantic pace of Elias's thoughts.  He had three days left. Three days to either become a hero orâ€¦ disappear.
