The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Finch as his own heartbeat.  It groaned in protest as he lowered Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose blue-rinsed hair now sat in perfect, gravity-defying curls, back down to earth. Elias’ barbershop, “Finch’s Fine Cuts,” nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller’s parlor on Bleaker Street, was a pocket of warmth and humming clippers in the otherwise damp and dreary heart of Grimsborough. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign and casting flickering shadows across the checkered floor.  The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had permeated the shop’s wood-paneled walls for the past forty years.  This Tuesday morning, however, felt different.  A strange stillness had settled over Grimsborough, a quiet that Elias couldn’t quite put his finger on, and it prickled at him like a misplaced hair on the back of his neck.
