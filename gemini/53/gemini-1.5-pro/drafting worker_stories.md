The fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyesâ€™ life.  It was a Thursday in late November, the kind of day that stole the light before 5 pm, leaving the world outside painted in shades of charcoal and steel.  Inside, Amelia sat hunched over her drafting table, the cool glow of her LED lamp illuminating the intricate lines of a blueprint for a new luxury condominium complex.  Pencils of varying hardness lay scattered across the worn surface of the table, like fallen soldiers after a long battle. Outside her small cubicle, the open-plan office buzzed with the low murmur of conversations, the clicking of keyboards, and the occasional exasperated sigh.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the slightly metallic tang of printer ink.  Amelia, however, was oblivious to the ambient symphony of office life. Her entire world had shrunk to the precise dimensions of the drawing before her, a world of perfectly measured lines, angles, and arcs.  This was her domain, a kingdom built not of concrete and glass, but of graphite and vellum. And tonight, she was determined to conquer it.
