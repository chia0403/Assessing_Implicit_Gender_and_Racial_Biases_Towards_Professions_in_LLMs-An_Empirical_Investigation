The relentless Chicago wind, sharp and biting even for late April, whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s trench coat around her legs as she hurried down LaSalle Street.  Sleek skyscrapers, monuments to finance and ambition, towered around her, their glass surfaces reflecting a fractured, distorted image of the overcast sky. Amy clutched her briefcase tighter, the leather cold against her gloved hand. Inside, nestled amongst neatly organized files, was the Paulson case, a particularly thorny claim involving a stolen vintage Gibson guitar. It was the kind of case that could make or break a junior insurance agent at Hawthorne & Sterling, and Amy, with only two years under her belt, desperately needed a win.  The opulent lobby of the Roanoke Building, with its gleaming marble floors and hushed air of importance, offered a brief respite from the biting wind.  Amy smoothed back a stray strand of auburn hair, took a deep breath, and stepped into the elevator, the faint scent of expensive cologne clinging to the air.  This meeting, with the notoriously difficult Mr. Paulson himself, was crucial.  It could mean the difference between closing the case and facing another grueling week of dead ends.
