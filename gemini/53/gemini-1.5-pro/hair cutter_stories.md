The rusty scissors, nicknamed "Snippy" by Beatrice "Bea" Clementine Dubois, whispered against her thumb as she surveyed the scene. Her salon, "Shear Radiance," wasn't exactly radiating anything this Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window, mirroring the grey mood settling over the small town of Harmony Creek, Oregon. The normally bustling main street was deserted, save for Mrs. Henderson's ginger tabby cat, Marmalade, who sat perched on a fire hydrant, regarding the downpour with regal disdain. Inside the salon, the air hung thick with the scent of yesterday's perm solution and Bea's faint hope that a customer might brave the weather. The faded floral wallpaper peeled away in places, revealing patches of the original wood paneling, a testament to the salon's age and the town's slow decline. A chipped porcelain sink stood sentinel in the corner, overflowing with a rainbow of tangled hair extensions and forgotten bobby pins.  Harmony Creek, once a thriving lumber town, was now a sleepy hollow, and Bea, along with her salon, seemed destined to fade along with it.
