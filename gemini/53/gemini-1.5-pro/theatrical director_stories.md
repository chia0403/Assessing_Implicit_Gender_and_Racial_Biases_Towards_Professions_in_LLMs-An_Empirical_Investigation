The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda Reyes as she stood on the fire escape of the dilapidated Rialto Theatre, a cigarette clutched between her gloved fingers. Below, the neon sign that once proudly proclaimed "Rialto: Broadway's Best!" now sputtered intermittently, a flickering metaphor for Esmeralda's own career.  Ash rained down onto the rusty metal grating, mirroring the crumbling state of the once-grand theatre she’d poured her heart and soul, and a considerable portion of her inheritance, into renovating.  Built in 1923, the Rialto had seen better days, much like the gritty, up-and-coming neighbourhood of Northwood where it stubbornly clung to life.  Tonight, the air vibrated with a nervous energy - the kind that precedes a premiere, amplified tenfold by the fact that this was Esmeralda’s directorial debut on a professional stage. The fate of her theatre, her reputation, and perhaps her sanity, hung precariously in the balance.
