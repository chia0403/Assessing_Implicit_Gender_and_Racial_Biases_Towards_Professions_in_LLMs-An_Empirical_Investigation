The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  The sun, a pale ghost in the perpetual twilight of early spring, cast long, distorted shadows across the jagged ice fields surrounding the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Elias, his breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted his goggles and surveyed the desolate landscape.  Five kilometers from the main station, nestled amongst a cluster of prefabricated research modules and shielded by snowdrifts almost as high as the structures themselves, lay the IceCube Neutrino Observatory's central control hub.  This isolated outpost, a beacon of human ingenuity amidst the unforgiving vastness of the polar desert, was Elias's domain for the next six months. He was here to hunt ghosts â€“ the elusive, almost massless subatomic particles known as neutrinos, messengers from the most violent corners of the universe. And he had a hunch this deployment would be different.  Something big was about to be discovered.
