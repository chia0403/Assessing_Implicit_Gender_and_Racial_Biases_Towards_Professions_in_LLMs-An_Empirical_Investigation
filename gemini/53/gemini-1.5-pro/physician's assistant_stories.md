The biting November wind whipped across the deserted parking lot of the Saint Jude's Free Clinic, stinging Amelia Reyes's cheeks even through the thick wool of her scarf.  Fluorescent lights flickered behind the frosted glass panes of the clinic's entrance, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling snow. Amelia hunched deeper into her parka, the weight of her medical bag digging into her shoulder. It was already past 9 pm, well beyond the clinicâ€™s official closing time, but the nagging worry about Mr. Henderson, a frail elderly gentleman with a persistent cough and a history of pneumonia, kept her tethered to the building. The rural Vermont town of Havenwood was usually picture-postcard perfect, nestled between snow-capped mountains and a frozen lake, but tonight, the isolation felt oppressive, the silence punctuated only by the mournful howl of the wind.  Inside, the waiting room was empty, the plastic chairs neatly arranged, and the air thick with the antiseptic smell that always reminded Amelia of a mixture of hope and despair.
