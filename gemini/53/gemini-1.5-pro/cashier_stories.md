The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes’ life. It was 2:17 am, the graveyard shift at its dreariest point. Outside, the New Jersey rain hammered against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the “Open 24 Hours” sign. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Amelia, her name tag pinned slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, leaned against the counter, idly watching the rotating hot dogs on the greasy rollers. The only other occupant of the store was a half-eaten box of donuts, abandoned on a table by the window, a testament to someone's unfinished sugar rush.  This, the intersection of Route 17 and Elm Street, was Amelia's kingdom for eight hours a night, a realm of lottery tickets, lukewarm burritos, and the occasional philosophical ramblings of a truck driver.  Tonight, however, felt different. The stillness, broken only by the rhythmic swish of the windshield wipers of the occasional passing car, held a strange anticipation, a pregnant silence that prickled the back of Amelia’s neck.
