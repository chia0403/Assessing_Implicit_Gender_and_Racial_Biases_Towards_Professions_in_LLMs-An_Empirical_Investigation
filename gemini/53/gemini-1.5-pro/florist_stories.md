The bell above the door to "Petal & Stem" chimed a discordant melody, the two notes slightly off-key, just like everything else seemed to be in Clementine Josephine Bellweatherâ€™s life that Tuesday.  Rain lashed against the large storefront window, blurring the view of the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. The usually vibrant hues of the hanging baskets outside were muted by the downpour, their cheerful blooms bowed under the weight of the water. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lilies and damp earth, a fragrance Clementine usually found comforting, but today it felt heavy, almost oppressive.  She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, a smudge of potting soil clinging to her cheek.  Business had been slow, the kind of slow that made the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner sound like a frantic drumbeat against the quiet.
