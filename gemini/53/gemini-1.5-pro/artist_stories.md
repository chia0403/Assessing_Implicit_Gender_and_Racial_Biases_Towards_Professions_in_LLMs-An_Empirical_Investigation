The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking Port Blossom.  The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped her auburn braid around her like a living thing, tugging at the edges of her canvas perched on a battered easel.  Below, the quaint Cornish fishing village nestled against the turquoise embrace of the Celtic Sea, its whitewashed cottages clinging to the hillside like barnacles to a hull.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows that stretched across the cobbled streets, transforming the everyday into something almost magical. Elara, however, saw only one thing: the furious dance of light and shadow across the churning sea, a tempest of colour and movement that she desperately yearned to capture.  Her fingers, stained with a kaleidoscope of oil paints, itched to translate the scene onto the blank canvas, to wrestle the wild beauty of the ocean into a tangible form.
