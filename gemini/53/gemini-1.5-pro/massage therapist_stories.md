Rain lashed against the large bay window of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, blurring the neon "Open" sign reflected in the slick, black asphalt of the parking lot. Inside, Eleanor Vance, LMT, kneaded the tight knots in Mrs. Higgins' shoulder, the rhythmic thump of her knuckles a counterpoint to the drumming rain. The small, warmly lit room smelled of lavender and eucalyptus, a stark contrast to the chill, damp air outside.  Serenity Now was Eleanorâ€™s sanctuary, tucked away on a quiet side street in the perpetually grey town of Port Blossom, Oregon. It was a town where the fog rolled in as often as the tide, and the locals were as weathered and stoic as the driftwood that littered the beach.  Eleanor, however, was a splash of sunshine yellow in this monochrome world, her cheerful demeanor a stark contrast to the melancholic atmosphere of Port Blossom. She loved her work, finding a quiet satisfaction in easing the aches and pains of her clients, both physical and, sometimes, emotional.  Little did she know, the quiet rhythm of her life was about to be disrupted.
