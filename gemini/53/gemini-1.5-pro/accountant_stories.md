Rain lashed against the ornate, bay window of Amelia Grace Holloway's office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Edinburgh.  The city, usually a vibrant tapestry of tartan shops and historic pubs, was muted and grey, mirroring the stack of invoices Amelia was currently battling.  Her office, perched above a bustling tea room on Victoria Street, usually offered a charming view of the colourful, curving street below. Today, however, the only colour came from the vibrant crimson of the "Overdue" stamp she wielded with a weary sigh.  Amelia, a chartered accountant with a penchant for order and a quiet disdain for creative accounting, was at war with the books of "The Haggis & Thistle," a struggling but beloved local pub. The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool and the faint, lingering aroma of shortbread from the bakery next door.  A half-eaten plate of said shortbread sat precariously perched on the edge of her overflowing desk, a testament to the frantic nature of her day.
