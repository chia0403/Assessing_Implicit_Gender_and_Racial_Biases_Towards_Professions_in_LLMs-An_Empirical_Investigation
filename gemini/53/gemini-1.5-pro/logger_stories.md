The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, whistling a mournful tune that Elijah "Eli" Blackwood knew all too well. It was the sound of approaching winter, the sound of the logging season drawing to a close in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon.  Eli, his thick beard already rimed with frost, adjusted the ear flaps on his worn leather cap and surveyed the clearing.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine resin and damp earth, a fragrance that usually invigorated him, but today it carried an undercurrent of unease. The felled giants lay scattered around him like fallen soldiers, their ochre trunks gleaming in the weak sunlight that filtered through the thinning canopy.  Beyond the clearing, the dense forest pressed in, a dark and brooding presence that seemed to hold its breath, waiting.  This particular stand of old-growth, known locally as the Whispering Woods, had always had a reputation for being…different. Eli couldn’t put his finger on it, but ever since they'd started working this section a week ago, a prickly sensation had crawled up his spine every time he entered its shadowy depths.
