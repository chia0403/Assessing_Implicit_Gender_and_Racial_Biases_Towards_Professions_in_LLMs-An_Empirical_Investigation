The siren's wail sliced through the humid Charleston night, bouncing off the pastel-painted stucco buildings lining Meeting Street.  A thick, cloying scent of jasmine and exhaust hung in the air, a disconcerting mix of beauty and urgency.  Inside the speeding ambulance, Amelia Grace "Amy" Rousseau, Emergency Medical Technician, gripped the metal handrail, her knuckles white against her tanned skin. The radio crackled with the dispatcher's frantic voice: "Possible GSW, victim down at the corner of Church and Chalmers.  Police en route, ETA five minutes." Amy's stomach clenched.  Gunshot wounds in the French Quarter were never good, especially not this late on a Friday night, when the tourists were thick and the alcohol flowed freely. The flashing blue and red lights painted the historic cobblestone streets in a strobe-like effect, a surreal backdrop to the unfolding drama.
