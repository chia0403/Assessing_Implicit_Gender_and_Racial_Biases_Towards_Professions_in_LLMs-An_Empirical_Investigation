The rusted sign above the garage, barely clinging to its moorings, proclaimed "Finnegan O'Malley's Auto Emporium - Where Miracles Happen (Sometimes)."  The "Emporium" part was a generous exaggeration.  It was less an emporium and more a ramshackle collection of oil-stained concrete, mismatched toolboxes, and half-dismantled engines scattered across a dusty yard in the sweltering Arizona sun.  Finnegan O'Malley, sweat beading on his brow despite the faded bandanna he wore, squinted at the stubborn bolt refusing to budge on a '67 Mustang fastback, a car that had seen better days, much like Finnegan himself.  Cicadas buzzed in the dry heat, their rhythmic drone punctuated by the occasional clang of metal on metal from Finnegan's determined assault on the rusted chassis.  Dust devils danced across the desert landscape, blurring the distant mesas in a hazy shimmer.  Dust and grit were as much a part of Finnegan's life as grease and gasoline, out here in the forgotten corner of Route 66, miles from anything resembling civilization.
