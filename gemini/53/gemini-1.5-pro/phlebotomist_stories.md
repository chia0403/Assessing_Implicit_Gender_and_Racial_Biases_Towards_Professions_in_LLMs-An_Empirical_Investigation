The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat above Eliza Jane Davies, reflecting off the polished linoleum floor in a sickly green sheen. It was 6:00 am, a pre-dawn gloom clinging to the edges of the frosted windows that overlooked a slumbering Charleston, South Carolina. Eliza, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp, cornflower blue scrubs, adjusted the blood pressure cuff on a sleeping patient. Room 304, Mr. Henderson, a kind-faced gentleman battling lymphoma, hadn’t even stirred. Eliza prided herself on her gentle touch, a skill honed over five years of drawing blood from the fragile and the fearful. The air in the room was thick with the antiseptic smell that always clung to the hospital, mingling with the faint, metallic scent of impending rain drifting in from the harbor. Today, the usual calm before the storm of a busy hospital morning felt different, charged with a subtle, unsettling energy that Eliza couldn’t quite place.  She finished with Mr. Henderson, tucked him back in, and moved towards the door, the subtle hum of the lights following her down the silent hallway.
