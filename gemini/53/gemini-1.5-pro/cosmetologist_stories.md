The pungent aroma of perm solution mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray, creating a chemical cocktail that hung heavy in the air of "Shear Perfection." Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the reflection of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois within.  Gen, a petite woman with a fiery mane of crimson hair that defied the gravity-defying hairstyles she crafted for others, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the worn countertop. The salon, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down Italian restaurant in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, was usually buzzing on a Saturday afternoon. Today, however, the only sound besides the relentless rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the vintage Coca-Cola clock on the wall, a relic from a more prosperous era.  Gen glanced at the clock; 4:57 pm. Three more minutes until closing time, and not a single client had walked through the door all day.  She sighed, the sound swallowed by the drumming rain. This was not how sheâ€™d envisioned her Saturday.
