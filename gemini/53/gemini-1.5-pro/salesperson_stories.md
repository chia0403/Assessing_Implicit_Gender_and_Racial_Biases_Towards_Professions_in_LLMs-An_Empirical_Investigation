The fluorescent lights of the Bargain Bazaar buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's meticulously arranged display of novelty cat toys.  Outside, the November wind howled through the gaps in the dilapidated strip mall's brick facade, rattling the dusty "GRAND RE-OPENING" banner that had been hanging there since, well, Amy wasn't entirely sure.  Probably since the grand re-opening of the now-defunct video rental store next door, five years and three failed businesses ago.  Amy tugged at the collar of her itchy polyester blazer, the Bargain Bazaar uniform a vibrant, unsettling shade of teal.  Today was Black Friday Eve, and despite the ominous weather and the general air of despair that clung to the Bargain Bazaar like cheap perfume, Amy was determined to make her sales quota.  This month's bonus was a George Foreman grill, and Amy had her sights set on perfectly grilled cheese sandwiches.
