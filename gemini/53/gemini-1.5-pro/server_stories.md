The flickering neon sign of the Stardust Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow across Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's tired face. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the already desolate landscape of Highway 17 into an impressionist painting of grey and black. Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic sizzle of the grill, the hum of the ancient refrigerator, and the mournful drone of Hank Williams from the jukebox. It was 11:47 pm on a Tuesday, and Gen, in her starched white uniform and scuffed black sneakers, was the sole inhabitant of the Stardust, save for a lone, hunched figure nursing a cup of coffee in the farthest booth.  The air hung thick with the mingled scent of stale coffee, frying onions, and a faint, lingering sweetness that Gen couldn't quite place. This stretch of highway in the Nevada desert was a liminal space, a place forgotten by time and bypassed by progress, and the Stardust Diner was its lonely, flickering heart.
