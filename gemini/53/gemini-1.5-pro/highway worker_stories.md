The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, carrying the scent of pine needles and diesel fumes.  Patches of snow clung stubbornly to the shoulders of the road, remnants of a storm that had blown through a week prior.  A slate-grey sky threatened more, and Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood pulled his orange safety vest tighter around his thick frame, the reflective stripes gleaming dully in the pre-dawn gloom.  He stamped his steel-toed boots against the asphalt, trying to coax some feeling back into his toes.  The coffee in his thermos had long since gone cold, and the sun, a pale ghost behind the cloud cover, offered no warmth.  Zeke was patching a particularly nasty pothole just past mile marker 147, a lonely stretch of highway that cut through the heart of the Sequoia National Forest, where the towering trees cast long, eerie shadows even at midday.  His orange highway truck, affectionately nicknamed "Pumpkin," idled nearby, its flashing hazard lights a beacon in the grey landscape. This was Zeke's office, a ribbon of asphalt winding through the wilderness, and today, his job was to make it a little less broken.
