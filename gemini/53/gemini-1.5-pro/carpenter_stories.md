The wind, sharp and smelling of pine resin, whipped around Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed the half-finished timber frame house perched precariously on the cliff edge.  Below, the slate-grey waters of the North Atlantic churned against the rocky coastline of Ailsa Craig, a volcanic plug thrusting dramatically out of the Firth of Clyde.  Late October in Scotland brought with it a biting chill that seeped into Elias’s bones, despite the thick wool of his sweater. He adjusted his tool belt, the familiar weight grounding him as he considered the next beam, its grain running like a river through pale wood.  This house, commissioned by a reclusive artist from the mainland, was Elias's most ambitious project yet – a testament to his skill and a gamble on a future he wasn't entirely sure he deserved.
