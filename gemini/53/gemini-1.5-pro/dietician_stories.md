The insistent Florida sun beat down on the turquoise awning of "Nourish," baking the sidewalk outside a shimmering white.  Inside, the air conditioning hummed a gentle counterpoint to the whirring blenders and the soft clinking of glasses. Eleanor Vance, RD, adjusted the oversized, brightly coloured fruit displays for the tenth time that morning.  She smoothed the vibrant green of a perfectly ripe avocado, her fingers lingering on its smooth skin. Eleanor loved the sensory symphony of her little beachfront cafe in Clearwater, from the tangy scent of freshly squeezed oranges to the comforting aroma of cinnamon-spiced oatmeal simmering on the stove. It was everything she'd envisioned when sheâ€™d traded in her sterile hospital office for the sun-drenched chaos of running her own business.  But this particular Tuesday, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach, a feeling as persistent as the Florida humidity. Her grand opening was just a week away, and despite months of meticulous planning, Eleanor was plagued by the nagging suspicion that she'd overlooked something crucial.  Something that could send her carefully constructed dream crumbling like a day-old gluten-free muffin.
