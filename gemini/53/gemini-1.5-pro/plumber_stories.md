The biting January wind whipped around Elias Vance, stinging his cheeks and turning his already chapped lips a painful shade of blue.  He hunched deeper into his threadbare coat, his breath puffing out in ghostly plumes against the backdrop of Mrs. Periwinkle's ramshackle Victorian.  Built sometime in the late 1800s on the outskirts of the perpetually grey town of Hollow Creek, Oregon, the house leaned precariously to one side, its gingerbread trim peeling like sunburnt skin and its once vibrant paint faded to the colour of a week-old bruise.  Elias, his toolbox heavy in his gloved hand, trudged up the crumbling concrete path. The call had been urgent: burst pipe, flooding basement.  It was just another Tuesday in the life of Hollow Creekâ€™s only plumber.
