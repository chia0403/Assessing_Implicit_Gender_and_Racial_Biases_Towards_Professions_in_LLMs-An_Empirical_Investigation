The crimson velvet curtains of the Orpheum Theatre in New Orleans hung heavy, thick with the dust of forgotten dreams and the lingering scent of stale beer. Rain lashed against the arched windows, a mournful jazz solo played by the capricious Louisiana weather.  A single spotlight, hazy and yellowed, illuminated a lone figure onstage. This was Amelia Evangeline Dubois, her microphone clutched loosely in one hand, her other tracing nervous patterns on the worn mahogany of her upright piano.  The year was 1952, a time when the city still throbbed with the rhythms of true blues, a time when a singer with a voice like Amelia's could still break hearts and mend them in the same breath.  But tonight, the usual vibrancy of the Orpheum was absent. The few scattered patrons huddled in their seats, their faces etched with a weariness that mirrored Amelia’s own. Tonight, she wasn’t singing for them. Tonight, she was singing for herself, trying to exorcise the ghosts that haunted the dimly lit corners of her memory.
