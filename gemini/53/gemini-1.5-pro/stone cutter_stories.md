The wind, sharp and smelling of pine resin and impending snow, whipped through the high mountain pass, tugging at Elias Thorne's thick woolen cloak.  He knelt beside a block of raw granite the color of a winter sky, its surface frosted with a fine layer of ice.  Around him, the quarry lay silent and still, a gouge of grey and white against the vibrant green slopes of Mount Cinderfall.  Scattered about were half-finished sculptures, draped in canvas against the elements – a winged lion, a pensive angel, a stern-faced warrior – all frozen mid-gesture, waiting for Elias's chisel to breathe life back into them. The sun, a pale disc barely visible above the jagged peaks, cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted ground, adding to the sense of isolation that clung to the quarry like the clinging mist.  Elias, his breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, ran a calloused hand over the smooth face of the granite, a faint smile touching his lips.  This block, he knew, held something special.
