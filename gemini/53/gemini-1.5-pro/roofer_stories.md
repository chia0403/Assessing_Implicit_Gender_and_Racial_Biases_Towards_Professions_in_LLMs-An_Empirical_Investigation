The rusty nail, slick with morning dew, slipped from Elias Thorne's calloused grip and tumbled three stories to the cobbled street below.  Elias winced, not at the near miss, but at the clang it made as it bounced off a dustbin, echoing through the pre-dawn quiet of Old Town Prague.  He was perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of the Church of St. Nicholas, the orange tiles warm beneath his worn leather boots. The Vltava River, a ribbon of dark jade, snaked through the city below, still shrouded in the misty breath of a fading summer night.  A faint apricot glow kissed the horizon, hinting at the sun's imminent arrival, but for now, the city belonged to the shadows and to men like Elias, who worked while the world slept.
