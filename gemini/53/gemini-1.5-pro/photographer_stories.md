The salt spray stung Amelia Reyes's face, a familiar welcome.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, had twisted the cypress trees lining the cliffs into grotesque, beautiful shapes against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Below, the churning waters of the Pacific gnawed at the base of the cliffs, a constant reminder of the raw power held within the seemingly serene Monterey Bay. Amelia, perched precariously on a rocky outcrop, adjusted the tripod for her large-format camera, her fingers numb despite the thick wool gloves.  She was here for the light, that ephemeral moment when the sun crested the horizon, painting the sky in hues that existed nowhere else on Earth, and she, Amelia Reyes, would capture it.
