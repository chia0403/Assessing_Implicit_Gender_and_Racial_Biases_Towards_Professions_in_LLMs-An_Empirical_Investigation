The bell above the door to "Nailed It," jingled, a shrill counterpoint to the smooth jazz humming through the tiny salon.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign and transforming the bustling Brooklyn street outside into a shimmering Impressionist painting. Inside, warmed by the aroma of acetone and lavender lotion,  Elara Sofia Hernandez meticulously painted a delicate floral design onto Mrs. Rosenblatt's acrylics, her brow furrowed in concentration. The salon, tucked between a laundromat and a bodega on Fulton Street, was Elara's sanctuary, her kingdom of glitter, gel, and gossip. It was a space where chipped dreams were buffed away and new ones, however fleeting, could be painted on.  Today, however, a different kind of tension hung in the air, thicker than the acrylic dust. Elara had a feeling, a prickling at the back of her neck that told her the rain wasn't the only storm brewing.
