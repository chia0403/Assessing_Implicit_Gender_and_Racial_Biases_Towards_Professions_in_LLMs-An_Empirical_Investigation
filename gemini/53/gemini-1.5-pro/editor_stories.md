Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Loose papers, covered in Amelia's meticulous scrawls and edits, danced across the worn wooden floor, stirred by the draft whistling through the ill-fitting window frame.  The only light in the room came from a battered desk lamp, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to mock her with their exaggerated movements.  Amelia, a freelance editor for 'The Metropolitan Quill', a literary magazine clinging to relevance in the digital age, was hunched over a manuscript, a half-eaten sandwich and lukewarm coffee her only companions. The manuscript, titled "The Obsidian Heart," was supposed to be her ticket to a promotion, a chance to finally escape the confines of her cramped apartment and the endless stream of mediocre submissions that flooded her inbox.  But as the hours ticked by, marked only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the increasingly frantic tapping of her pen, Amelia felt a growing unease. Something about this manuscript was...off.  It wasn't just the overwrought prose or the predictable plot; there was a darkness clinging to the words, a subtle wrongness that prickled at the back of her neck.  The setting of the story, a remote island shrouded in perpetual mist off the coast of Ireland, seemed to seep into her own reality, chilling the air around her.
