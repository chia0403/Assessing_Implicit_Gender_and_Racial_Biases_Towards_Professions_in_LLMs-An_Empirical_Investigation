The stale air in Rosalind "Roz" Parker's cramped office tasted of instant coffee and despair.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the overflowing file cabinets that lined the walls. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled around the corners of the Cook County Administration Building, rattling the aging windowpanes.  Roz, hunched over a pre-sentence report for a repeat offender caught boosting car radios, rubbed her temples.  November in Chicago was a special kind of bleak, a pre-winter chill that seeped into your bones and settled there, much like the stories of her clients.  This particular case, a kid barely out of his teens named Marco Diaz, felt particularly heavy.  He wasn't a hardened criminal, not yet, but Roz had seen enough to know the trajectory he was on, a path paved with bad choices and even worse luck. The gnawing feeling in her gut told her this report, filled with legalese and detached observations, wouldn't be enough to save him.  Not this time.
