The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne’s cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson leaves he was currently wrestling into oversized biodegradable bags.  Frost crunched beneath his worn work boots, the sound a stark contrast to the damp rustle of the oak leaves skittering across the manicured lawn. He pulled his knitted beanie further down over his ears, the grey wool itching pleasantly.  Elias surveyed his handiwork with a critical eye. The sprawling Tudor estate of the Vandergelt family in the affluent Westchester County village of Briarcliff Manor was almost ready for winter.  The flowerbeds were meticulously mulched, the hedges sculpted into obedient shapes, and the sprawling lawn, normally vibrant emerald, now lay dormant beneath a thin veil of frost.  Only the stubborn oaks continued to cling to their fiery foliage, refusing to succumb completely to the season’s advance.  Elias, however, would make sure they yielded. He had a reputation to uphold, and Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman whose standards were as high as her hedges, expected nothing less than perfection.
