The cab of the eighteen-wheeler shuddered as Dorothea "Dot" McMillan wrestled the rig through a patch of black ice on Highway 16, just outside of Cut Bank, Montana.  The January wind howled like a banshee, whipping snow across the desolate landscape, reducing visibility to near zero.  Dot’s knuckles were white against the worn leather of the steering wheel, her breath fogging the inside of the windshield. The radio crackled with static, occasionally spitting out snippets of a Johnny Cash song, a stark contrast to the swirling, white chaos outside.  The temperature gauge on the dashboard read a bone-chilling -15 degrees Fahrenheit, and Dot could feel the icy tendrils creeping through the insulation of her boots. This stretch of road, infamous for its unpredictable weather and long, lonely stretches, was known as the “Devil’s Playground” by local truckers. Tonight, it was living up to its name.  Dot, bundled in layers of flannel and denim, had a delivery of frozen goods bound for Seattle, a deadline looming, and a gnawing feeling that this trip was going to be anything but ordinary.
