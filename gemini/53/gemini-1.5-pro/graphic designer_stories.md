The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her chapped lips. She tugged her scarf tighter, the rough wool scratching against her chin, and hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts and damp leaves swirling around her.  Her destination, nestled between a vintage bookstore and a perpetually bustling falafel joint, was a small, brightly lit studio called "Ink & Pixel."  It was hers.  The vibrant, chaotic blend of Greenwich Village - the clash of old brick buildings and modern graffiti, the murmur of a dozen languages, the constant hum of creativity - was the lifeblood of her design work, a constant source of inspiration that fueled her late nights and endless cups of coffee.  Tonight, however, the usual thrill of the city felt muted, overshadowed by the weight of the email sitting unopened in her inbox. An email from a client she couldn't afford to lose. An email that could make or break Ink & Pixel.
