The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the open window of Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier, a symphony of urban noise that she'd long since learned to tune out.  Located on a bustling side street just off the Place Vendôme in 1888 Paris, her small but exquisitely appointed shop was a haven of silks, satins, and lace.  Sunlight, filtered through the gauzy curtains, illuminated swirling clouds of dust motes dancing above bolts of fabric in every shade imaginable, from the deepest indigo to the palest blush rose.  Evangeline, her silver thimble glinting on her index finger, meticulously pinned the hem of a midnight-blue velvet gown, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air hummed with the quiet industry of her two assistants, the rhythmic snip of scissors and the soft whir of a treadle sewing machine providing a gentle counterpoint to the cacophony of the street below.  This was Evangeline’s domain, a world of exquisite creations and whispered secrets, where dreams were woven into fabric and destinies were shaped by the fall of a hem.  But on this particular crisp autumn morning, the familiar rhythm of her work was about to be disrupted.
