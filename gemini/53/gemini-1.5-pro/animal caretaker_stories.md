The biting wind whipped across the salt-sprayed cliffs, carrying the mournful cry of a gull.  Below, nestled in a small cove sheltered from the worst of the gale, lay the Isle of Skye Wildlife Sanctuary.  Grey stone buildings, patched and weathered, huddled together like penguins against the elements.  Inside the largest, the "Raptor Roost," Amelia Grace Hawthorne knelt patiently, a leather-gloved hand outstretched to a young peregrine falcon perched on a wooden beam. Its feathers ruffled by the drafts whistling through cracks in the aging windowpanes, the falcon eyed Amelia with a mixture of apprehension and curiosity.  This was its first day out of the intensive care unit, a milestone Amelia had been eagerly anticipating. The sanctuary, with its patchwork of enclosures and the constant symphony of squawks, chirps, and roars, was her domain, a kingdom of feathers, fur, and scales she ruled with a quiet competence and boundless love.  Today, however, a different kind of storm was brewing, one that threatened not just the falcon's recovery, but the very future of the sanctuary itself.
