Rain hammered against the window of his chambers, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of anxiety building in his chest. This case, the brutal robbery of Hemlock Jewellers, felt different. Not just because of the sheer audacity of the crime, committed in broad daylight, but because a faint, unsettling familiarity clung to the details like the lingering scent of gunpowder.  It was a feeling Judge Finch had learned, over his thirty years on the bench, to never ignore. Outside, the city thrummed with its usual symphony of sirens and hurried footsteps, oblivious to the storm brewing both within the judge's heart and on the horizon.
