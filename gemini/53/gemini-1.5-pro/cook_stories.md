The clatter of pots and pans was Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's morning symphony.  The pre-dawn light, filtering through the grimy windows of the Salty Spoon Diner, painted streaks of grease-laden rainbows across the stainless steel counters.  Located on the frayed edge of Harmony Bay, Maine, a town where the fishing boats docked with more rust than paint, the diner was a haven of warmth and the aroma of frying bacon in the otherwise damp, salty air.  Amy, her red hair pulled back in a practical bun, hummed along to the crackling radio as she expertly flipped pancakes, her movements as practiced and rhythmic as a seasoned conductor leading an orchestra. Outside, the foghorns moaned a low, mournful greeting to the rising sun, a sound as familiar to Amy as her own heartbeat.
