Amelia, perched on her creaky swivel chair, meticulously recorded every transaction of the day, from Mrs. Higgins' purchase of a five-cent spool of thread to Mr. Henderson's extravagant splurge on a ten-dollar box of imported chocolates.  It was a predictable, quiet existence, and Amelia, a creature of habit and order, preferred it that way. Until, that is, the stranger walked in.
