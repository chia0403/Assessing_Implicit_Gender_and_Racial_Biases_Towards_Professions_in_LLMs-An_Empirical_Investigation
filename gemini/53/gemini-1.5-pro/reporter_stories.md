The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Blue Moon Diner, a counterpoint to the rhythmic sizzle of Amelia “Millie” Reyes's forgotten fries.  Grease-stained menus, curling at the edges, plastered the walls of the cramped eatery, interspersed with faded photographs of long-gone local baseball teams.  Millie, a reporter for the twice-weekly *Echo of the Delamarva*, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee with a chewed-up bic pen, her gaze fixed on the rain-lashed windows.  Clarksville, Maryland, population 487 and dwindling, wasn’t exactly a hotbed of breaking news.  Usually, her biggest stories revolved around the annual bake-off at the Presbyterian church or the sporadic escapades of Mrs. Henderson’s prize-winning pygmy goat.  But tonight, something felt different.  The air crackled with a nervous energy, a palpable hum that resonated beneath the clatter of the diner and the drumming rain.  Millie could almost taste it, like the metallic tang of ozone before a summer storm.  And she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her gut, that tonight, Clarksville's quiet existence was about to be shattered.
