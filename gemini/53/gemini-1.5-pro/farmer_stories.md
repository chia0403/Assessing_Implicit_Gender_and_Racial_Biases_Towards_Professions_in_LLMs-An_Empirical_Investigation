The wind, sharp and smelling of impending rain, whipped across the vast, undulating fields of gold.  Wheat, ripe and heavy, bowed low under the grey sky, a restless ocean stretching as far as the eye could see. This was the heart of the Palouse, where the rolling hills of eastern Washington bled into the Idaho panhandle, and where Jedediah Silas Finch surveyed his domain with a mixture of pride and apprehension.  The harvest was upon him, weeks earlier than expected thanks to an unusually warm spring.  Jedediah, weathered and lean beneath his faded denim overalls and worn straw hat, ran a calloused hand over a stalk of wheat, the kernels plump and promising.  His farmhouse, a sturdy two-story structure painted the color of buttermilk, stood sentinel against the gathering storm, smoke curling lazily from its chimney.  It was a solitary existence, but Jedediah had known no other.  This land, inherited from his father and his father before him, was in his blood, as familiar and comforting as his own heartbeat.  But this year, something felt different.  A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the coming rain.
