Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Van Gelder Building, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy grey. Inside, on the twenty-seventh floor, Amelia Grace Hawthorne hunched over a mountain of depositions, the fluorescent lights reflecting harshly off the pale skin stretched taut across her cheekbones. The air in the office of Prescott, Stevens & Albright, Attorneys at Law, was stale with the scent of old paper, printer ink, and lukewarm coffee – the aroma of late-night legal desperation. Amelia, a paralegal just two years out of school, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair out of her eyes and sighed.  This case, a sprawling class-action lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant, had consumed her life for the past six months.  Boxes overflowing with documents lined the walls, forming a paper fortress around her small, cluttered desk.  Outside, the Chicago skyline glittered indifferently, a distant, unreachable world.  Tonight, like so many nights before, Amelia was alone, save for the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the low hum of the aging office air conditioner.  Tonight, she was hunting for a needle in a haystack – a single piece of evidence that could turn the entire case around.
