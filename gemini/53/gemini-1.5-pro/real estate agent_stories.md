The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Grace Holloway's ankles, sending the hem of her camel-coloured coat swirling around her like a restless spirit.  She tugged her burgundy scarf tighter, tucking it into the collar, and wished for the hundredth time that she hadn't opted for style over practicality this morning.  The "charming fixer-upper" she was about to show, perched precariously on the bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, was charming primarily in its breathtaking, if somewhat windswept, location.  Salt spray hung in the air, coating everything with a fine, gritty film, and the dilapidated Victorian house, with its peeling paint and boarded-up windows, seemed to shudder against the gusts.  Seabrook, Massachusetts, was picturesque in the summer, a haven for tourists seeking quaint New England charm.  But in late autumn, with the tourist season long gone and the winter storms brewing, its beauty took on a harsher, more unforgiving edge.  And Amelia, clutching a folder thick with property details, felt a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the cold.
