The scent of coconut oil and burnt hair hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Eloise "Ellie" Cartwright like a second skin.  Ellie’s Salon, squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller’s parlor on the faded end of Magnolia Street in Charleston, South Carolina, was a riot of color.  Emerald green walls clashed happily with vibrant orange chairs, and framed photos of Ellie's satisfied customers, sporting gravity-defying updos and rainbow-hued streaks, lined the chipped plaster.  Outside, the humid July air hung heavy, promising a thunderstorm later. Inside, the whir of the ancient hairdryer fought a losing battle against the rhythmic drone of cicadas and the rhythmic snip-snip of Ellie's scissors as she transformed Mrs. Henderson's wispy gray bob into something resembling a silver cloud.  This Tuesday morning was, so far, shaping up to be much like any other. Little did Ellie know, a storm far more disruptive than the brewing meteorological one was about to blow through her salon doors.
