The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the faint, metallic tang of the nearby slaughterhouse, whipped around Elias Thorne’s thick wool coat. He pulled it tighter, the coarse fabric scratching against his chapped hands. Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he crossed the cobbled square of Hollow Creek, a town nestled deep within the Ironwood Valley where the shadows seemed to linger longer than anywhere else.  The first rays of dawn were just beginning to paint the snow-covered peaks of the surrounding mountains a pale rose, but down in the valley, a pre-dawn gloom still clung to everything. Elias’ breath plumed out in white puffs, vanishing into the frigid air as he made his way towards his shop, "Thorne's Fine Meats," its frosted window displaying the ghostly silhouettes of hanging carcasses.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of his own heart echoed in the stillness, a counterpoint to the distant howl of a lone wolf echoing from the deep woods.  Today was Slaughtering Day, and Elias had work to do.
