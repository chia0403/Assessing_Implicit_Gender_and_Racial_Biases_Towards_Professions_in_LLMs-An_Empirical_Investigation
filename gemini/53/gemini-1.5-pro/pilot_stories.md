The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Reyes’s flight jacket as she prepped the Cessna 206 for takeoff.  The sky above Denali National Park was a brutal canvas of bruised purple and gunmetal grey, the jagged peaks of the Alaska Range barely visible through the swirling snow.  It was late November, the cusp of the long polar night, and the air held the kind of bone-chilling cold that seeped into your soul no matter how many layers you wore.  Kantishna, the small cluster of buildings that served as a base camp for winter researchers, was a shrinking dot behind her.  Ace adjusted her headset, the fur-lined earpieces a welcome barrier against the icy wind, and double-checked the coordinates programmed into the GPS.  Her mission: deliver vital supplies to a remote meteorological station perched precariously on Mount Isto, a notoriously treacherous peak even in ideal conditions.  Today, ideal was a distant dream.
