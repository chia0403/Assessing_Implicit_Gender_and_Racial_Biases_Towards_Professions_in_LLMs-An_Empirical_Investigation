Barty, a man of simple pleasures – a warm meal, a good book, and the comforting routine of his nightly rounds – didn't understand half of what went on within these sterile walls. He just cleaned up after it.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A chill, deeper than the wind could explain, settled over him as he reached Lab 42, its door slightly ajar.
