The chipped porcelain flamingo perched precariously on the edge of Esme Valencia's desk seemed to teeter closer to disaster with every ring of the insistent telephone.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the stale air of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, a once-opulent space now fading into a melancholic echo of its former glory.  Faded floral wallpaper peeled in the corners, revealing layers of previous, equally garish, patterns beneath. The plush, ruby-red carpet, threadbare in places, bore witness to countless grand entrances and hurried exits, each leaving an invisible imprint on its worn fibers. Esme, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp, yet slightly-too-tight blazer, sighed and plastered a smile on her face before answering, "Grand Majestic, how may I direct your call?"  The air conditioning unit, wheezing like a chain smoker climbing a flight of stairs, seemed to mock her forced cheerfulness. Outside, the Miami humidity clung to the air like a damp towel, promising another sweltering afternoon.
