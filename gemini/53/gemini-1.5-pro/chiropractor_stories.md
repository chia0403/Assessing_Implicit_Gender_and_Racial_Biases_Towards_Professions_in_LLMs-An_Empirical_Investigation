The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the "Open" sign hanging precariously from the brickwork above Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Inside, the waiting room of "Aligned Spine & Wellness" was a pocket of warmth, smelling faintly of peppermint and lavender.  Snow dusted the large window overlooking a quiet street in Evanston, Illinois, blurring the already muted colours of the late November afternoon. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, adjusted the thermostat, a frown creasing her brow.  Business had been slow all week, slower even than usual for the post-Thanksgiving slump. She glanced at the appointment book, its pages starkly white except for a single entry: 4:00 PM -  Elias Thorne.  Eleanor sighed, rubbing a knot in her own shoulder.  She hoped Mr. Thorne presented a challenging case; anything to break the monotony of this frigid, empty afternoon.
