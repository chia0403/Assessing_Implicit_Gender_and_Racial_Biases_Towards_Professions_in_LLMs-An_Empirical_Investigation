The whirring of the stand mixer was a familiar lullaby to Eliza Jane Hawthorne.  Her small bakery, "Sugar & Bloom," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on Sycamore Street, was bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, catching the glitter sprayed across the half-finished tiered cake on her workbench.  Outside, the humid Charleston air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and impending rain, a familiar summer symphony. Inside, the air was thick with the sweet perfume of vanilla buttercream and the tang of lemon zest, a testament to Eliza Jane's current creation: a four-tiered masterpiece destined for a debutante ball.  Tonight, however, was less about elegant swirls and delicate sugar flowers and more about an unsettling quiet, a premonition clinging to the air like powdered sugar on a damp countertop.
