The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, clawing at the exposed skin of Captain Elias Vance as he surveyed the scene.  Broken glass crunched under his heavy boots, reflecting the flickering orange glow of the blaze engulfing the abandoned warehouse on South Wells Street.  Smoke, thick and acrid, billowed into the twilight sky, staining the first hesitant stars a sickly yellow. Chicago in January was a brutal mistress, and tonight, she was showing no mercy. Elias pulled his helmet lower, the heat already radiating outwards, a palpable force even from across the street.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful chorus growing louder with each passing second, echoing the frantic beat of his own heart. This wasn't just another fire; the intensity, the speed at which it spreadâ€¦ something felt wrong. Dangerously wrong.
