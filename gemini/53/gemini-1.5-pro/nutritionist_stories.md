The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Hibiscus Health Hub, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whirring of the dilapidated ceiling fan.  A sticky humidity clung to the air, thick enough to taste, despite the late October downpour. Drusilla Evangeline Cartwright, registered dietitian and owner of the aforementioned, less-than-glamorous establishment, sighed.  The mango tree outside her window, usually vibrant with ripening fruit, was bowed low under the deluge, its branches thrashing like drowning tentacles.  Located on the sleepy, sun-baked (usually) island of Avani in the Caribbean, the Hibiscus Health Hub was Drusillaâ€™s dream, her attempt to bring nutritional awareness to a community steeped in fried delights and sugary sodas. So far, however, the island's inhabitants seemed far more interested in rum punch than roasted pumpkin.  This Tuesday morning was proving no different. The waiting room was empty save for a lone gecko clinging to the peeling paint of a motivational poster proclaiming the benefits of kale.
