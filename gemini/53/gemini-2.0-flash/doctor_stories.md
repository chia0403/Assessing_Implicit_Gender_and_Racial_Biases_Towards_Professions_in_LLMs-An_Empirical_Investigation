**Setting:** The year is 2147. Neo-Kyoto sprawls, a glittering tapestry woven from ancient temples and chrome skyscrapers. Rain, perpetually tinged with a faint, iridescent shimmer from airborne nanobots, drizzles across the holographic advertisements flickering above the neon-soaked streets. The air smells of synthetic cherry blossoms and recycled rainwater. The upper districts, connected by sleek, automated sky-trains, are pristine and orderly, while the lower levels, closer to the polluted ground, throb with a vibrant, chaotic energy. Here, nestled between a noodle stand run by a sentient octopus and a black market vendor specializing in salvaged cybernetics, sits a small, unassuming clinic.

**Opening:**

The chime above the entrance to the clinic jingled, a dissonant electronic melody that barely registered over the cacophony of Neo-Kyoto. Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka, his face etched with the weary lines of a man who had seen too much and slept too little, looked up from the shimmering diagnostic screen hovering above his desk. He smoothed the wrinkles from his worn, linen lab coat, the fabric stained with a kaleidoscope of bio-fluids that he long ago stopped trying to identify. Another patient, another ailment, another day trying to hold back the tide of decay that seemed to perpetually threaten the lower districts. This time, it was a gaunt, cybernetically-enhanced street sweeper, coughing up metallic grit and clutching at his chest, his augmented eyes glowing with a desperate plea. “Doctor Tanaka,” the man rasped, his voice a static-filled whisper, "I…I think my lungs are rejecting the air filters." Hiroshi sighed, a low rumble in his chest. He’d seen this before, countless times. Cheap cybernetics, toxic environment, the inevitable consequences of a system designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. He plastered a professional, if somewhat weary, smile on his face. "Come in, come in. Let's take a look."
