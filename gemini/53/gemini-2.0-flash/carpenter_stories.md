Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a carpenter named...

**Story Opening:**

The sawdust clung to Elias Theodore Thorne like a second skin, dusted across the wrinkles carved into his face by a lifetime of sunshine and worry. He squinted at the late afternoon light slanting through the workshop window, illuminating the swirling motes of wood dust in the air. He paused, running a calloused thumb over the almost-complete carving of a wooden bird, a wren, resting on a branch of cherry blossoms. He’d been working on it for weeks, chipping away at the block of seasoned ash with a patience honed over forty years of shaping wood into dreams. It was a gift for Mrs. Henderson, his oldest customer and the closest thing he had to family in this quiet corner of the world. A sharp, persistent cough broke the silence, reminding him that the real world, and its insistent demands, waited just beyond the workshop door.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, isolated town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Havenwood is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, their grandparents, and probably their dogs. It’s a town sustained by a handful of small businesses: the general store, the post office, a diner serving up comfort food, and Elias Theodore Thorne's carpentry workshop, "Thorne's Handcrafted Goods." Elias’s workshop is a sprawling, ramshackle building on the edge of town, smelling perpetually of pine, oak, and the faintest hint of linseed oil. It’s filled to bursting with tools both old and new, projects in various states of completion, and enough wood shavings to bury a small child. Outside, a small, overgrown garden hints at a previous owner’s, or perhaps even Elias's, brief foray into a different kind of creative endeavor. The mountains loom in the distance, a constant, comforting presence, but also a reminder of the isolation that keeps Havenwood both beautiful and, at times, suffocating.
