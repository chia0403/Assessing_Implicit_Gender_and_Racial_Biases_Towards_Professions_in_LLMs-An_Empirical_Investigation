Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a main character who is a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun cast long, fractured shadows across the brightly coloured, mismatched furniture of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room. Located on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the gentrified neighborhood of Elmwood Park, the office was deliberately designed to feel more like a cozy living room than a clinical space. A bubbling water fountain tinkled in the corner, partially masking the street noise filtering through the slightly ajar window. The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a calming balm against the anxieties that often walked through the doorway.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, adjusted the reading glasses perched precariously on her nose and re-read the intake form in her hands. “Jameson Holt,” she murmured to herself, tapping a manicured nail against the slightly crumpled paper. “Late 20s, reports…chronic anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and a crippling fear of… pigeons?” Eleanor suppressed a small smile. Everyone had their thing. She had seen it all in her years as a counseling psychologist - from kleptomaniac clowns to agoraphobic astronauts. Still, a fear of pigeons was a new one.

The chime of the front doorbell echoed softly through the office. Eleanor straightened, took a deep breath, and reminded herself of the reason she loved her work - the potential to help someone, even if their struggles seemed, on the surface, utterly absurd. She placed the intake form back on her desk and stood up, smoothing the wrinkles from her floral print dress. "Showtime," she whispered to the potted peace lily beside her, and walked to greet her new patient.
