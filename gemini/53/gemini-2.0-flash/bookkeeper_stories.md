The fluorescent lights of "Accountable & Accurate, LLC" hummed with a predictable monotony, mirroring the life of Bethany Grace Abernathy. Bethany, at 32, lived and breathed spreadsheets. Her tiny, meticulously organized cubicle, nestled between Barry (who perpetually smelled of stale coffee and regret) and Carol (whose collection of cat-themed calendars threatened to spill onto Bethany's desk), was her sanctuary. Outside, the rain hammered against the grimy windows of the office building in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, painting blurry streaks across the cityscape. The grey sky seemed to mirror Bethany's mood; a dull, predictable overcast punctuated only by the sporadic, jarring flash of lightning - much like the occasional, unexpected expense report that threatened to throw her meticulously balanced books into chaos. This particular Tuesday, the storm outside seemed to be particularly angry, and so was the pile of receipts on her desk, threatening to bury her alive in a tidal wave of questionable lunch expenses and suspiciously vague "client entertainment" write-offs. It promised to be a long day.
