## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and disinfectant clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin. She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose and leaning back against the uncomfortable plastic chair. It was 7:48 AM, and the pre-dawn gloom still stubbornly resisted the valiant efforts of the fluorescent lights in the Meadowbrook Assisted Living Facility's occupational therapy room. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aging windows and promising a day of bitter, relentless rain. Inside, Amelia battled a creeping sense of dread. Mrs. Gable was due in ten minutes, and Amelia knew, deep in her weary bones, that today would be a particularly difficult one.

## Setting:

The occupational therapy room at Meadowbrook Assisted Living Facility was a study in well-intentioned, if slightly depressing, functionality. The walls were painted a pale, institutional green, adorned with motivational posters featuring geriatric figures participating in activities that seemed impossibly cheerful. A worn therapy table occupied the center of the room, surrounded by an array of equipment designed to aid in rehabilitation: resistance bands of varying strengths, weighted utensils, a hand-held massager, and a wobbly set of stairs leading to nowhere. A small, cluttered desk in the corner housed Amelia's overflowing paperwork, a half-eaten granola bar, and a ceramic mug perpetually stained with coffee rings. The room overlooked a small, neglected garden, now rendered bleak and grey by the relentless winter. Despite the best efforts of the maintenance staff, a pervasive air of institutional sadness permeated the space, a testament to the fragility and quiet struggles of its inhabitants.
