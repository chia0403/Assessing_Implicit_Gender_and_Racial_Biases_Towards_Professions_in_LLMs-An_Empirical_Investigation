## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** A cavernous, damp-smelling rehearsal room in the derelict Grand Majestic Theatre. Rusted fire escapes spiderweb outside the grimy windows, offering a glimpse of a smog-choked, post-industrial cityscape. Sunlight, what little manages to penetrate, paints dust motes dancing in the air like forgotten ghosts. The room itself is a testament to faded grandeur: peeling wallpaper the color of bruised plums, a tattered velvet curtain draped haphazardly across a makeshift stage, and the faint scent of mildew and old dreams. Scattered around are chipped folding chairs, stacks of yellowed scripts, and half-empty coffee cups littered with cigarette butts.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic thwack of a rubber-tipped cane against the floor was the only sound piercing the tense silence. Maximilian Bartholomew Thorne, a man whose reputation for both genius and tyranny preceded him like a herald, stalked the periphery of the makeshift stage. He paused, his piercing blue eyes, magnified by thick, round spectacles, fixed on the young woman struggling to hold back tears. His silver hair, a defiant mane against the ravages of age, was slightly disheveled, mirroring the chaotic energy that constantly emanated from him.

"Again, Miss Delacroix," he barked, his voice a gravelly rasp that echoed through the cavernous space. "Again! You are portraying Ophelia, not a wilting daffodil about to be trampled by a particularly aggressive badger! Where is the madness? Where is the descent into the abyss?"

He tapped his cane impatiently against the dusty floor. â€œI want to see the heartbreak that tears at the very fabric of her sanity, not a simpering damsel in distress! Now, from the top...and this time, *feel* something, damn you!" He punctuated the sentence with another sharp thwack, the sound reverberating through the decaying grandeur of the Grand Majestic Theatre, a sound as ominous as the fate Maximilian Thorne was about to unleash on them all.
