Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a forensic psychologist:

**Setting:**

The year is 2018. The location is the sprawling, labyrinthine Westgate Psychiatric Hospital, nestled on a remote, windswept hill overlooking the crumbling industrial town of Blackwood, Pennsylvania. Westgate is a place of echoing corridors, chipped paint, and the lingering scent of disinfectant trying to mask the deeper odors of fear and despair. Once a beacon of innovative mental healthcare, it's now a shadow of its former self, underfunded and overcrowded, holding the criminally insane, those deemed unfit to stand trial, and the forgotten casualties of a broken system. Outside, the grey Pennsylvania skies often mirror the gloom within its walls.

**Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of Westgate hummed a discordant melody as Dr. Eleanor Vance threaded her way through the ward. The air was thick with the oppressive silence broken only by the occasional mumbled rant or the rhythmic tapping of a patient against a padded cell door. Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun and her navy blazer a stark contrast to the faded floral wallpaper, hardly noticed anymore. After five years at Westgate, the ambiance had become a constant, a low thrum beneath the surface of her work.

She stopped outside cell block D, the infamous "Containment" wing. A cold dread, familiar but no less unsettling, settled in her stomach. This was where they kept the truly broken, the ones who had shattered into so many pieces they could barely be considered human anymore.

The correctional officer, a burly man named Miller, nodded curtly. "He's been…uncooperative today, Doctor. Refusing meds. Talking to himself. The usual."

Eleanor sighed, adjusted her glasses, and reached for the heavy steel door. "Thank you, Miller. Let me see what I can do."

Before she could insert the key, a raspy voice echoed from within the cell. "Doctor Vance…I’ve been waiting for you. I have a story to tell." The voice was devoid of warmth, laced with an unsettling eagerness that sent a chill down Eleanor's spine. She paused, her hand hovering over the lock. This wasn't going to be just the usual diagnostic session. This felt different. This felt like the beginning of something truly terrifying. The air in the corridor felt thick, charged with an unidentifiable emotion and Eleanor knew, without a doubt, that whatever story was about to unfold, it was going to change everything.
