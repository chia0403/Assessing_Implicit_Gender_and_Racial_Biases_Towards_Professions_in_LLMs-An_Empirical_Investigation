Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a pharmacist:

**Setting:**

The year is 1953. The place is Havenwood, a small, close-knit town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. Havenwood's main street, Oak Avenue, is lined with aging but well-maintained brick buildings. The air, usually thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke, often carries the faint, comforting aroma of Mrs. Gable's apple pies baking down the street.  Havenwood is a place where everyone knows everyone, where secrets simmer just below the surface, and where life moves at a slower, deliberate pace.  The town is largely untouched by the fast-changing world outside, holding onto its traditions and its distrust of anything or anyone "fancy."

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of Havenwood Pharmacy jingled, a cheerful counterpoint to the persistent ache in Elara Mae Buchanan's back.  She leaned heavily against the counter, massaging the small of her spine with a weary sigh.  It was nearly closing time, and the shadows were lengthening across Oak Avenue. Elara watched as a figure detached itself from the gloom and stepped inside.

The newcomer was a woman, bundled in a dark, shapeless coat that swallowed her frame. Her face was hidden by a wide-brimmed hat, and her movements held a nervous energy, like a caged bird desperate for escape.  Elara straightened, forcing a smile.  Even after ten years behind this counter, she still found herself instinctively trying to put people at ease.

"Evening," Elara said, her voice warm and inviting. "Can I help you with something?"

The woman hesitated, her gaze darting around the small, cluttered pharmacy.  The scent of tinctures and dried herbs hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had always grounded Elara. But tonight, it did little to dispel the rising sense of unease prickling at the back of her neck. The womanâ€™s silence stretched, amplifying the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Finally, she spoke, her voice a low, raspy whisper.

"I need something... for sleep."
