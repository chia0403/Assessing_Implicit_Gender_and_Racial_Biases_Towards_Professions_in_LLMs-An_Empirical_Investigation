The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled with the stubborn junction box on the lighthouse's lantern room balcony. Below, the churning grey of the North Sea gnawed at the base of the crumbling stone tower, a hungry beast kept at bay only by its own foamy spray. The wind, a constant, malevolent force on the Isle of Arranmore, ripped at his waterproof jacket, trying to pry him loose and toss him into the unforgiving depths. He swore under his breath, a string of colourful curses picked up from years working on fishing trawlers and equally temperamental electrical systems. Another wave crashed, sending a shudder through the lighthouse and a fine mist of icy water over him.

He squinted at the corroded wires, their colours faded and brittle from years of exposure to the elements. Elias Thorne, electrician extraordinaire and reluctant island resident, hated working on the Arranmore Lighthouse. It was a cursed place, or at least, that's what the locals whispered after one too many pints of Guinness at O'Malley's pub. And truth be told, after five years of fixing its constantly failing electrical system, Elias was starting to believe them.
