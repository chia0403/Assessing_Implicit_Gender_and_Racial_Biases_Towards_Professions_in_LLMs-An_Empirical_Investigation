The oppressive Miami heat clung to everything like a damp shroud, even at 10 PM. Manuel Rodriguez, his brow perpetually slick despite the air-conditioned blast of the lobby, adjusted the crimson lapel of his bellhop uniform. The Hotel Del Mar, a shimmering Art Deco behemoth that overlooked South Beach, hummed with a low, electric thrum. Its marble floors, polished to a blinding sheen, reflected the gaudy gleam of chandeliers dripping with crystal baubles that probably cost more than Manuel earned in a year.

He stood by the revolving door, a silent sentinel in his starched uniform, observing the parade of tanned bodies, expensive clothes, and vacant smiles flowing in and out. Tonight was particularly busy. A film festival was in town, and the Del Mar, with its reputation for impeccable service and discreet privacy, was the preferred haunt of celebrities and wannabes alike. Manuel, however, saw past the glamour. He saw the weary eyes behind the oversized sunglasses, the pinched expressions beneath the layers of makeup, the desperation clinging to the designer bags. He saw the cracks in the facade. He just never expected to find one that led to murder.
