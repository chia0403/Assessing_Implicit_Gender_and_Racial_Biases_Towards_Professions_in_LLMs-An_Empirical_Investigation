## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill clung to the corrugated steel of the Pilot truck stop in Cheyenne, Wyoming. A weak, watery sun was just beginning to bleed over the horizon, painting the snow-dusted plains in hues of pale lavender and gray. The air hummed with the low rumble of idling engines and the hiss of air brakes. Inside, the smell of stale coffee, burnt bacon, and diesel fumes hung heavy, a familiar comfort to those who called the road home.

**Opening:**

The metal thermos bit cold against **Evelyn "Evie" Beatrice Carter's** chapped lips. She peered out the grimy window of her rig, a hulking Mack Anthem she affectionately called "The Wanderer," watching a scrawny coyote slink across the parking lot. Her reflection stared back, a tapestry of fatigue etched into lines around her sharp blue eyes. Her short, salt-and-pepper hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail, and the faded blue of her denim shirt strained against her broad shoulders. She sighed, the sound a puff of white vapor in the frigid air. Another day, another haul. This time, it was medical supplies headed for Billings, Montana. Just a few hundred miles, a relatively easy run. Except… a knot of unease had been tightening in her stomach since the dispatcher handed her the manifest, a feeling she couldn't quite shake. She knew this road, she knew this truck, she knew the rhythm of the highway. But something about this trip felt different. Something felt…off. Maybe it was the coyote, a bad omen if she ever saw one. Or maybe, it was just the damn Wyoming wind playing tricks on her nerves.
