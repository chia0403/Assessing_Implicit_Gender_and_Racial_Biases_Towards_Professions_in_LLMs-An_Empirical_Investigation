Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character named an editor:

**Setting:** The story opens on a blustery, late autumn afternoon in a small, independent bookstore called "Inkwell & Quill" nestled in the historic district of Portland, Oregon. Sunlight, weak and tinged with grey, struggles to penetrate the large, arched windows, casting long shadows across the towering shelves overflowing with both new releases and aged, leather-bound treasures. The air smells of old paper, roasted coffee (from the small cafe tucked in the back), and a hint of cinnamon, a scent both comforting and melancholic.

**Opening:**

The email arrived like a digital thunderclap, shattering the serene bubble surrounding Gwendolyn Eleanor Ainsworth. She reread the subject line: "URGENT: Manuscript Submission - Project Nightingale." Her fingers, already cold from the damp Portland air seeping through the drafty windows of Inkwell & Quill, now trembled visibly as she clicked it open. Gwen, the senior acquisitions editor for the bookstore's nascent publishing arm, usually savored the arrival of new submissions, each one a potential portal to another world. But this one…this one had sent a prickle of unease down her spine the moment she'd seen the sender's name: Dr. Alistair Thorne. A name she hadn’t heard, nor wanted to, in over a decade. The man who had vanished from her life as suddenly and inexplicably as he’d entered it.
