## Story Opening:

The scent of overripe bananas hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the sterile lemon cleaner aroma that usually clung to the office. Cordelia Ainsworth, Registered Dietitian, wrinkled her nose as she unlocked the door to Nutrition Innovations, her small but fiercely independent practice. It was Monday morning, and judging by the state of the neglected fruit bowl on her reception desk, Martha, her part-time assistant, hadn't made it in yet. Again.

Cordelia sighed, a little puff of exasperation escaping her lips. Mondays were always chaotic, a whirlwind of weigh-ins, meal plans, and desperate pleas from clients who'd spent the weekend in a sugar-induced haze. But even by Monday standards, the air felt particularly thick with impending…something. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but a shiver traced its way down her spine as she flicked on the fluorescent lights, bathing the small office in a harsh, unforgiving glow.

## Setting:

**Location:** Nutrition Innovations is a small, independent dietetics practice located in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in a mid-sized city called Willow Creek.

**Description:** The office itself is squeezed into the ground floor of a converted Victorian house. It consists of a small reception area with a worn-out faux leather couch, a cluttered desk overflowing with pamphlets and appointment cards, and a small, windowless consultation room. The walls are painted a cheerful, but slightly dated, shade of sunflower yellow, and adorned with motivational posters featuring glistening fruits and vegetables. Despite Cordelia's best efforts, the overall impression is one of comfortable, but slightly cramped, homeliness, rather than sleek, modern professionalism.

**Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is typically warm and welcoming, intended to put clients at ease. Cordelia prides herself on creating a non-judgmental space where people can openly discuss their struggles with food and body image. However, today, the air feels heavy and unsettled, hinting at an underlying tension. The cheerful decor seems to clash with the palpable sense of unease Cordelia feels.
