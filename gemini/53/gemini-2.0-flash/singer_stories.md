The house smelled of burnt cinnamon and regret. Sunlight, thin and watery for a November morning in Nashville, seeped through the gauzy curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing a frantic jig in the still air. Amelia Rose Bellweather, better known as just "Amelia Rose" on marquees across the country, lay sprawled on the velvet chaise lounge, a half-empty bottle of cheap chardonnay precariously balanced on her chest.

The room itself was a chaotic testament to her life. Feather boas dripped from the ornate, Victorian-era chandelier, mingling with the trailing vines of a neglected pothos plant. Sheet music, crumpled and overflowing from a stack of mismatched teacups, lay scattered on the floor like fallen leaves. A sequined jumpsuit, half-on, half-off a mannequin in the corner, shimmered mockingly in the weak light. This was her sanctuary, her creative lair, and currently, her shame cave. She'd called this room "The Nightingale's Nest" when she'd first moved into the rambling, century-old house in East Nashville. Now, she suspected the nightingale was more of a grounded pigeon, covered in glitter and drowning in chardonnay.
