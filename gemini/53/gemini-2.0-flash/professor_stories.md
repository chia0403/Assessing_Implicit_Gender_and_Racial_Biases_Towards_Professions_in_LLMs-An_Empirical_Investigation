Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and the main character's full name and profession:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of decaying paper and ancient leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume to Professor Alistair Humphrey Ainsworth. He inhaled deeply, his fingers tracing the faded gold lettering on the spine of a particularly formidable-looking tome. "De Occulta Philosophia," it proclaimed, the title barely clinging to the worm-eaten binding. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune against the leaded glass windows of the Ainsworth family library, a sound Alistair barely registered. He was, as he so often was, lost in another time, another world, conjured by the written word.

A sudden, sharp crack shattered the silence, jolting him back to the present. He looked up, startled. A hairline fracture, thin as a spider's silk, had appeared across the upper pane of the window. Alistair frowned. This library, this entire ancestral estate of Blackwood Manor, was falling into disrepair. And with his dwindling academic funds, the upkeep had become a relentless, losing battle. But the broken window wasn’t what truly worried him. No, it was the almost imperceptible chill that seemed to seep into the room with the draft, a chill that had nothing to do with the blustery November wind. It felt… deliberate.

**Setting:**

*   **Location:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, isolated estate nestled on the windswept moors of Yorkshire, England. It has been the Ainsworth family home for generations, steeped in history and rumored to be haunted.
*   **Time:** Late November, dusk. The days are short, the nights are long, and a pervasive sense of gloom hangs over the countryside.
*   **Specific Setting:** The Ainsworth family library, a large, gothic room filled with towering bookshelves crammed with ancient texts, maps, and arcane artifacts. The air is thick with the smell of old paper and dust. A crackling fire struggles to keep the room warm, casting long, dancing shadows.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Professor Alistair Humphrey Ainsworth
*   **Profession:** Professor of Ancient History and Occult Studies at the (fictional) University of Northumbria.
*   **Brief Description:** A middle-aged man with thinning, silvering hair, perpetually ink-stained fingers, and a kind but absent-minded demeanor. He is more comfortable surrounded by books than people and possesses a deep knowledge of obscure historical events and esoteric lore. He is generally skeptical, but open to the possibility of things beyond the realm of scientific explanation.
