The insistent chirp of the alarm clock, designed to mimic a flock of particularly irritating baby birds, was the last thing Elara Beatrice Finch wanted to hear. Blearily, she smacked the snooze button, the neon pink numbers on the display mocking her. 6:30 AM. Again. Every single morning, the battle was the same. Elara groaned, burying her face in the threadbare patchwork quilt.

The setting was her apartment, a glorified shoebox perched precariously on the fifth floor of a pre-war building in Brooklyn. "Bohemian Chic," the real estate agent had called it, which Elara translated to "Needs a lot of work and smells vaguely of mothballs." The walls, painted a questionable shade of avocado green by the previous tenant, were plastered with sketches, mood boards, and half-finished designs. A wobbly drafting table, inherited from her grandfather, took up a significant portion of the limited space, currently buried under a mountain of Pantone swatches, Wacom tablets, and empty coffee cups. Sunlight, filtering weakly through the grime-coated window, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, a tiny, chaotic ballet performing just for her. This was Elara's kingdom, her sanctuary, her chaotic mess where she translated dreams into visually arresting realities. And right now, sheâ€™d rather be anywhere else.
