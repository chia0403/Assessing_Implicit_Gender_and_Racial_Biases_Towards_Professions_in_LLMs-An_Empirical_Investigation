Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on an interior decorator named Eleanor Vance:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The scent of lavender and freshly cut wood hung heavy in the air, a carefully curated aroma designed to soothe the frayed nerves of a woman teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Eleanor Vance, interior decorator extraordinaire and savior of aesthetically challenged souls, surveyed the sprawling, sun-drenched living room of "Seaview Manor" with a practiced eye, a tiny frown etching itself between her perfectly arched brows. The space, despite its potential, felt… wrong. Wrong in a way that whispered of missed opportunities and wasted potential.

Eleanor, dressed in her signature uniform of impeccably tailored linen trousers and a deceptively simple cashmere sweater, adjusted the silver-framed photograph of a ridiculously fluffy Samoyed puppy perched precariously on a faux-vintage coffee table. It was a deliberate distraction tactic. The dog was undeniably adorable, and even the grumpiest client couldn’t resist a fleeting smile. But today, her client was Mrs. Abigail Weatherby, a woman whose face could curdle milk at fifty paces, and the puppy's charm seemed utterly ineffective.

**Setting:**

The setting is the fictional seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, specifically in the Weatherby's summer residence, a grand but somewhat neglected Victorian mansion called "Seaview Manor." The house sits perched on a bluff overlooking the turbulent Atlantic Ocean, a location that should inspire serenity but, in its current state, feels oppressive and windswept. The interior, though spacious and boasting original architectural details like ornate crown molding and stained glass windows, is a mishmash of outdated furniture, clashing color schemes, and a general air of neglect. The overall aesthetic can be described as "Grandma chic gone wrong". Think faded floral wallpaper, heavy velvet drapes, and an unsettling collection of porcelain dolls staring blankly from dusty shelves. The contrast between the stunning natural beauty outside and the interior chaos is striking, and it's this dissonance that Eleanor is determined to resolve.
