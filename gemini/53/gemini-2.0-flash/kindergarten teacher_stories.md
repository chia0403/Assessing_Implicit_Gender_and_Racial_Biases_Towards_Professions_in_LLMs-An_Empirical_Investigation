The tiny yellow school bus, affectionately nicknamed "The Bumble," grumbled to a halt outside of Little Sprouts Academy, its brakes sighing like a tired bear. Miss Amelia Willowbrook, a beacon of sunshine in her sunflower-print dress, bounced off the bottom step, a chorus of "Bye, Miss Amelia!" echoing behind her.

Little Sprouts Academy wasn't your typical sterile, fluorescent-lit educational facility. Nestled on the edge of Willow Creek, a town perpetually stuck in the sepia-toned charm of a Norman Rockwell painting, it was a converted Victorian house bursting with color and controlled chaos. The porch boasted a flourishing herb garden, tended by the children themselves, and a swing set hung from the branches of a ancient oak tree in the backyard, its gnarled roots forming natural climbing structures. Inside, each room was themed around a different fairy tale, complete with hand-painted murals and child-sized furniture. The "Cinderella Classroom" had a miniature fireplace and a rug that looked suspiciously like a pumpkin carriage, while the "Hansel and Gretel Classroom" smelled faintly of gingerbread and pine needles.

Amelia, a whirlwind of perpetually messy auburn hair and an infectious giggle, adored it. She'd poured her heart and soul into making Little Sprouts a haven for her tiny charges, a place where they could learn and grow, explore their imaginations, and occasionally, glue glitter onto their noses. This morning, however, as she unlocked the front door, a familiar knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. It was "Bring Your Favorite Bug" day, and while she appreciated the educational opportunity, she couldn't help but dread the inevitable outbreak of shrieking, squirming insects, and the equally inevitable aftermath of escaped crickets and panicked parents. This was going to be a long day.
