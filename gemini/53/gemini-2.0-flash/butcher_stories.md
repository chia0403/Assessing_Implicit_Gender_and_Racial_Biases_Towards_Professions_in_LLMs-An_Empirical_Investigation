The morning sun, a weak, watery thing through the grimy windows of "O'Malley & Sons, Finest Cuts," barely penetrated the chill that clung to the tiles. Elias Bartholomew O'Malley, third generation butcher and inheritor of this meat-scented kingdom, shivered despite his thick, blood-spattered apron. He’d been up since 4:00 AM, wrestling a quarter of beef from the refrigerated truck and dragging it, protesting all the way, across the threshold.

The setting was Brighton, Massachusetts, specifically the Allston neighborhood, a grittier, more lived-in version of its polished neighbour, Brookline. O'Malley & Sons had been a fixture here since Elias's grandfather, Bartholomew the First, jumped off a ship from County Cork and, with a borrowed loan and a whole lot of blarney, convinced the local grocer to sell him a corner of his space. Now, almost a century later, it was a time capsule. The walls, once a vibrant emerald green, were now faded to a sickly, institutional hue, marred by the occasional greasy handprint. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, the earthy sweetness of aging beef, and a faint, persistent whiff of sawdust.

Elias ran a calloused hand over the gleaming blade of his cleaver. It was a family heirloom, forged in the fires of some long-forgotten German blacksmith, and sharper than a lawyer’s tongue. He eyed the beef with a practiced eye, estimating its weight, its marbling, its potential. This morning, however, his mind wasn’t on the prime cuts. He was thinking about the note, tucked safely in his breast pocket, a note that threatened to carve deeper than any cleaver ever could.
