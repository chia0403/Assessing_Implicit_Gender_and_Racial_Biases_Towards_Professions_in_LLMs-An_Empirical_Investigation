The flickering fluorescent light hummed a discordant tune above Ezekiel "Zeke" Bartholomew's head, a sound as familiar and unwelcome as the stale coffee aroma clinging to his faded blue jumpsuit. He stood at the edge of the abandoned basketball court, the squeak of his worn sneakers echoing in the cavernous space. Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy, arched windows, painting ghostly patterns on the worn hardwood floor.

The setting was the long-defunct gymnasium of the St. Jude's Academy for Boys, a boarding school shuttered thirty years ago after a string of… unfortunate incidents. Now, it was a repository of forgotten dreams and lingering echoes, purchased by the city for a song and left to rot, awaiting some mythical renovation that never seemed to arrive. Zeke, employed by the city's skeletal maintenance crew, was the gym's reluctant caretaker, charged with keeping the pigeons out and the graffiti at bay, a Sisyphean task he usually tackled with a mixture of boredom and quiet resentment. But tonight was different. Tonight, the air wasn't just thick with dust and decay, it was heavy with something… else. Something that made the hair on the back of Ezekiel Bartholomew's neck stand on end.
