## Story Opening:

The clatter of stainless steel echoed through the pristine kitchen, bouncing off the walls like a panicked heartbeat. Evelyn Penelope Hawthorne, RD, LD, leaned heavily against the countertop, her brow furrowed in concentration. Flour dusted her cheek like a premature wrinkle, a fitting testament to the disastrous state of affairs. Before her, a gelatinous, grey mass quivered precariously on a ceramic plate, vaguely resembling what was supposed to be a sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, and *delicious* birthday cake for her nephew, Leo.

She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Evelyn was a nutritionist, a beacon of healthy eating and mindful consumption in a world obsessed with processed garbage. She preached the gospel of leafy greens, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins with unwavering conviction. She could diagnose a nutrient deficiency from a single glance at someone’s skin and whip up a balanced meal plan in under five minutes. But baking? Baking was her nemesis. And Leo’s seventh birthday party was tomorrow.

This… this grey blob was her last hope.

## Setting:

Evelyn’s kitchen was the antithesis of the chaos unfolding on the countertop. Located in her meticulously renovated brownstone in the heart of Brooklyn Heights, it was a haven of clean lines and natural light. Sunlight streamed through the large, south-facing window, illuminating the gleaming white subway tile backsplash and the perfectly organized spice rack. Pots and pans, mostly unused save for steaming vegetables, hung neatly from a copper rack above the island. Everything had its place, and every place was impeccably clean. This dedication to order and cleanliness extended beyond the physical; it was a reflection of Evelyn’s deeply ingrained need for control, a control that seemed to slip through her fingers whenever a recipe involved more than three ingredients.
