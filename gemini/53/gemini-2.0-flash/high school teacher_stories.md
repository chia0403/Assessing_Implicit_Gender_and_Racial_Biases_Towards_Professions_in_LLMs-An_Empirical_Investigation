The humid June air hung thick in Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's small, cluttered classroom, clinging to the outdated textbooks and wilting posters of Edgar Allan Poe. Sweat prickled at the nape of her neck, threatening to ruin the meticulous chignon she'd spent twenty minutes crafting that morning. She fanned herself with a syllabus, the rustling paper doing little to alleviate the stifling heat emanating from the archaic radiator that inexplicably continued to hum.

This was the last day of summer school at Crestwood High, a sprawling brick monstrosity that looked more like a penitentiary than an educational institution. Crestwood was nestled in the heart of Harmony Creek, Ohio, a town where the most exciting event of the year was the annual Corn Festival. Eleanor loved Harmony Creek, despite its suffocating small-town atmosphere, precisely because it was so predictable. Predictable meant safe. And after what had happened… well, she appreciated safe more than anything.

The clock on the wall ticked with agonizing slowness, each second echoing the silent dread that had been building within Eleanor all day. It wasn't the prospect of grading the abysmal essays her summer school students had produced – though that was certainly a contributing factor. No, it was something else, a gnawing unease that refused to be dismissed, like a persistent cough in the back of her mind. Today, more than any other day this summer, Eleanor felt a pair of eyes on her, watching, waiting. And that thought, more than the heat, more than the bad essays, made the room feel like a slowly shrinking box.
