## Story Opening:

The aroma of stale goldfish crackers and lemon-scented disinfectant clung to the air like a persistent toddler, refusing to let go. Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, armed with a dustpan and a weary sigh, surveyed the landscape of destruction before her. Tiny plastic dinosaurs lay scattered like fallen soldiers, construction paper masterpieces were crumpled casualties of the afternoon’s art explosion, and a sticky puddle, likely grape juice, gleamed ominously near the climbing frame. This was Tuesday afternoon at Little Sprouts Daycare, and Eleanor, bless her patient soul, was the first line of defense against the chaos.

## Setting:

**Little Sprouts Daycare** is located in a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the fictional town of Meadow Creek, Ohio. The house, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, shade of daffodil yellow, has a large, fenced-in backyard with a jungle gym, a sandbox overflowing with brightly colored buckets and shovels, and a patch of well-trodden grass where the children play tag. Inside, the rooms are painted in calming pastels and decorated with child-friendly artwork – finger-painted masterpieces, handprint animals, and alphabet charts. The main room, known as the "Sunflower Room," is where the majority of the playtime and learning activities take place. It's a brightly lit space, even on cloudy days, and filled with the comforting, slightly chaotic energy of small children. Off the Sunflower Room is a smaller, quieter space called the "Butterfly Room" used for naps and quiet activities. A small kitchen, perpetually smelling of reheated chicken nuggets and apple sauce, is located at the back of the house. The overall feel is one of warmth, love, and a constant, low-level state of controlled pandemonium.
