The persistent drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of the Piggly Wiggly could only partially mask the static crackling from Agnes Eleanor Plumtree’s car radio. Agnes, known to absolutely no one as Eleanor, leaned further into her lukewarm cup of gas station coffee, its artificial vanilla scent doing little to combat the creeping dampness that clung to her sensible wool suit. It was a Tuesday, naturally. Tuesdays were invariably damp, dismal, and prone to faulty wiring.

The setting was Harmony Ridge, North Carolina, a town clinging precariously to the side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. "Clinging" described both the town's geography and its economy. Harmony Ridge boasted a single blinking traffic light, a diner famous (locally) for its fried okra, and a Main Street lined with shops selling antiques that had likely belonged to Agnes's grandmother. Agnes was Harmony Ridge’s only insurance agent, her office a cramped space above the town’s even more cramped barber shop, "Sharp Cuts & Close Shaves," where the scent of bay rum battled constantly with the musty smell of aged paperwork. Today, the paperwork, a teetering stack of flood insurance policies, threatened to topple onto the floor, mirroring Agnes’s own precarious emotional state. The rain, the radio static, the imminent collapse of her filing system… all harbingers, she feared, of another long, uneventful, and ultimately disappointing Tuesday in Harmony Ridge.
