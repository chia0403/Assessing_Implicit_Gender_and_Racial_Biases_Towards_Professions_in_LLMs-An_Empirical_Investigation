Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a journalist:

**Setting:** The biting February air whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging exposed skin like a thousand tiny needles. The Chicago skyline, a jagged silhouette against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky, looked less majestic and more like a fortress under siege. Deep inside the cavernous confines of the Chicago Tribune's newsroom, fluorescent lights hummed a dreary tune over the rhythmic clatter of keyboards.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Vance, a veteran investigative journalist with ink in her veins and cynicism in her soul, squinted at the grainy security footage flickering on her monitor. The timestamp confirmed her suspicions: 3:17 AM. A lone figure, cloaked in shadow, had slipped into the back entrance of the now-defunct Grand Ballroom, a once-glamorous haven for Chicago's elite that now stood crumbling and condemned on the city’s South Side. Eleanor ran a calloused finger over the “play” button again.  This was the third time in as many weeks the security cameras at the doomed Grand Ballroom had captured a person entering, and the cameras hadn’t captured them leaving.  The city was buzzing with whispers of a new development company coming in to build luxury condos, and that meant the derelict building was scheduled for demolition. Nobody was supposed to be inside. Certainly not at 3:17 in the morning. But Eleanor knew better than to trust appearances.  She knew that secrets had a way of clinging to old buildings, and they’d been calling her name ever since she’d first read the demolition notice last week. Something wasn't right. And Eleanor Vance had built her career on finding out exactly what that "something" was, even if it meant staring into the face of a Chicago winter and venturing into a crumbling ruin before sunrise.
