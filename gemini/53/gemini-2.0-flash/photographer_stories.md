## Story Opening:

The biting wind, thick with the smell of salt and something vaguely rotten, whipped around Elias Thorneâ€™s legs, threatening to send his tripod tumbling into the churning, grey sea. He cursed under his breath, tightening his grip on the camera and squinting through the viewfinder. He was losing the light, and the tide was definitely coming in.

Just visible through the swirling mist, perched precariously on the jagged edge of the cliff like a forgotten sentinel, was the old lighthouse. Its paint was peeling, the glass of its lantern fractured, and the metal support struts were rusted a sickly orange. It looked abandoned, almost haunted. But to Elias, it was perfect.

## Setting:

The setting is the bleak, windswept coastline of Northumbria, England. Specifically, a desolate stretch of cliffs known locally as "Dead Man's Point." The weather is perpetually harsh, with grey skies, strong winds, and a relentless, unforgiving sea. The cliffs are crumbling, dotted with gnarled, windswept trees and patches of tough, resilient heather. The most prominent feature is the aforementioned abandoned lighthouse, built in the late 19th century and now derelict. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation, loneliness, and decay.
