Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an income tax preparer named Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield:

**Setting:**

The setting is the quaintly chaotic office of "Butterfield Tax Solutions" in the even quainter town of Harmony Creek, Wisconsin. Harmony Creek boasts a population of approximately 3,700 souls, a prize-winning pumpkin at the annual Harvest Festival, and a deep-seated belief that taxes are a necessary evil best dealt with promptly and with a healthy dose of complaining.

Butterfield Tax Solutions is located above Millie's Diner, the aroma of freshly baked apple pie often seeping into the office, mixing uncomfortably with the scent of stale coffee and the faint metallic tang of toner. The office itself is a study in organized clutter. Stacks of manila folders threaten to topple from every surface, carefully labeled with names like "Johnson - Q3 Estimated Taxes," "Peterson - Farm Losses," and "Schmidt - Questionable Deductions." A vintage adding machine, a relic from Bart's grandfather's accounting days, sits proudly on a corner desk, though it's only used for sentimental value. Bart prefers his spreadsheet software, but the adding machine provides a comforting weight in a world of digital ephemerality. The walls are painted a cheerful (but faded) yellow, and a motivational poster featuring a picture of a smiling eagle soaring above a mountain range hangs slightly crookedly near the door. The overall impression is one of comfortable competence, even if it leans a little towards being overdue for a good dusting.

**Story Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield stared at the blinking cursor on his computer screen, the digital equivalent of a mocking sneer. April 14th. Twenty-three hours, fifteen minutes, and ticking. He’d already consumed three cups of Millie's Diner's notoriously strong coffee and felt like his eyeballs were vibrating. The phone rang, a jarring interruption to his late-night tax marathon.

"Butterfield Tax Solutions, Bart speaking," he answered, his voice a low, rumbling growl that he hoped didn’t betray his exhaustion.

"Bart? It's Agnes Plumtree." Agnes was a sweet, elderly woman with a penchant for knitting and a equally strong penchant for deducting every conceivable household expense as a business write-off.

Bart sighed inwardly. "Agnes, hello. Everything alright?"

"Oh, Bart, I'm in a terrible state! I just remembered... I forgot to tell you about the alpacas!"

Bart blinked. "The alpacas, Agnes?"

"Yes! You know, the ones I bought? For breeding? For the yarn, you see. It's a business, Bart, a burgeoning business! And I completely forgot to include their depreciation schedule. Can you still add them? It’s rather important, they eat a lot of hay, you know."

Bart pinched the bridge of his nose. Twenty-three hours until the tax deadline, and he was about to embark on a discussion about the depreciation of Agnes Plumtree’s alpaca herd. This was Harmony Creek, Wisconsin, at its finest. "Alright, Agnes," he said, forcing a weary smile into his voice. "Tell me everything…" He knew, deep down, this was just the beginning of a very, very long night.
