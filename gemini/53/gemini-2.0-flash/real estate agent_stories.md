The midday sun beat down on Amelia Jean Davies, real estate agent extraordinaire, reflecting off the freshly painted, mint-green shutters of the house she was currently trying to sell. Perspiration prickled at her hairline, threatening to dislodge the perfectly coiffed waves she'd spent a solid thirty minutes achieving that morning. She blotted her brow with a tissue, praying her carefully applied makeup wouldn't run before the prospective buyers, the perpetually frowning Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, arrived.

The setting was Harmony Creek, a picture-perfect little town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, where the local bakery offered discounts on Tuesdays, and where the only crime reported in the last decade was Mrs. Abernathy's prized petunia mysteriously disappearing from her front porch. Harmony Creek was, in Amelia's opinion, sickeningly wholesome.

Amelia's office, "Davies Realty: Making Dreams Come Home," was located right on Main Street, across from the charmingly antiquated Harmony Creek General Store. Her window display, currently featuring a vibrant collage of "Move-In Ready Homes," seemed to pulse with an unnatural optimism that always made Amelia feel a little guilty. After all, she knew the truth: Harmony Creek, while outwardly idyllic, held its own dark secrets, whispered in hushed tones over morning coffee at the diner. Secrets Amelia had learned the hard way, and which, ironically, made her the most successful, and some might say the most ruthless, real estate agent in the county.
