Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a massage therapist named Eliza Rose Hawthorne:

**Setting:** A Tuesday afternoon in late October. The setting sun casts long, golden shadows across the dusty, mismatched furniture of "The Healing Touch," Eliza Rose Hawthorne's massage studio. The studio occupies the second floor of a creaky Victorian building on the outskirts of Havenwood, a small, somewhat forgotten town nestled in the Appalachian foothills. The air smells faintly of clove cigarettes (Eliza's guilty pleasure, enjoyed only after her last client), lavender essential oil, and the lingering scent of the chicken pot pie from the diner downstairs.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Rose Hawthorne sighed, the sound a puff of warm air that barely disturbed the quiet hum of the vintage lava lamp in the corner. She rubbed the heel of her hand against the ache in her lower back – a familiar complaint, especially after a morning spent coaxing knots out of the shoulders of Mr. Abernathy, the perpetually tense owner of the Havenwood Hardware store. The appointment book lay open on the small, wrought-iron table beside her, its pages now blank. Another day, another dozen stressed-out souls seeking solace under her capable hands.

She glanced out the window at the skeletal branches of the oak trees lining the street. The air had that sharp, pre-winter bite that promised a long, cold season ahead.  A feeling of restlessness, a familiar itch under her skin, began to stir.  Havenwood, with its sleepy charm and predictable routine, felt like a comfortable, well-worn blanket suddenly starting to suffocate her. It had been five years since she'd arrived, seeking peace and a fresh start, but today, the peace felt a little too…quiet.  She longed for something more, something beyond the predictable aches and pains she kneaded away day after day. A flicker of movement caught her eye. A dark sedan, unfamiliar and out of place, was pulling up across the street, its tinted windows reflecting the dying light like a pair of secretive eyes. Eliza frowned, a knot tightening in her own shoulders. Something about that car felt…wrong.
