The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, a tangible presence clinging to everything like Spanish moss. It was 7:58 AM, and already the sun felt like a malevolent spotlight, baking the brick of Jackson Square in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Across the street, Cafe du Monde was a hazy swirl of powdered sugar and bleary-eyed tourists, but here, beneath the wrought-iron gate of St. Louis Cathedral, stood Ignatia "Iggy" Dubois, waiting.

Ignatia, with her name a flamboyant relic of her Creole heritage, smoothed down the vibrant parrot-print sundress that she considered her "tour guide uniform." She was a lean woman, somewhere in her late thirties, her face etched with the kind of knowing amusement that only years of navigating the city’s peculiar charm and bizarre underbelly could provide. Her dark hair, usually tamed into a pragmatic braid, had started to escape the confines, wisps curling around her temples in the oppressive heat.

She glanced at her watch, a vintage Omega inherited from her grandfather, another Dubois who’d spun tales of this city. Eight o'clock. Time to begin. She hoped, for her sanity, that this group would be less interested in vampires and more interested in history. Either way, she was ready. As always.
