Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a salesperson:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of "Office Oasis," a sprawling office supply superstore in suburban Omaha, hummed with the quiet energy of a slow Tuesday afternoon. Aisles stretched as far as the eye could see, crammed with everything from ergonomic chairs and reams of paper to novelty staplers shaped like miniature flamingos. The air hung thick with the scent of cheap cardboard and faintly scented printer ink.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman whose smile could sell ice to an Eskimo, was having a terrible day. Not just a bad day, but the kind of day where the universe seemed to be actively conspiring against her. First, the store's coffee machine had broken, leaving her caffeine-deprived and jittery. Then, Mrs. Henderson, a regular customer with a penchant for complaining about the price of paperclips, had spent a solid thirty minutes berating Beatrice about "corporate greed." And now, as she stood meticulously arranging a display of color-coded Post-it notes, she watched a teenager brazenly swipe a pack of gel pens and saunter towards the exit.

"Excuse me!" Beatrice called out, her voice losing a touch of its usual practiced sweetness. The teenager, sporting neon green hair and a pierced eyebrow, kept walking. Beatrice sighed. This was going to be a longer Tuesday than she anticipated. This month's target was looking ever more distant, like a mirage shimmering in the harsh office lighting. It was a job to Beatrice, a boring job, but it was one she needed to get back to selling.
