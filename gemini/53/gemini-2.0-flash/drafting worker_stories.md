Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a drafting worker as the main character:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Clara Petrocelli's cheeks as she wrestled her umbrella closed outside the old Crane & Sons ironworks. The sky was a bruised purple, threatening another November squall.  Amelia tugged her scarf tighter, the wool scratching uncomfortably against her neck.

It was 7:58 AM.  Two minutes to spare.

She hurried towards the towering, brick building, its blackened windows like vacant eyes staring out over Chicago.  The heavy scent of coal smoke and iron hung in the air, a constant, gritty reminder of the city's industrial heartbeat.  Inside, the air would be marginally warmer, but still thick with the smell of machine oil and blueprint paper.

Amelia navigated the maze of hallways, already bustling with workers in overalls and caps.  She nodded curtly to Mrs. Oleski, the stern-faced woman who guarded the time clock with the zeal of a Cerberus.  Punching in her card, Amelia felt the familiar thrum of anxiety that always accompanied the start of the workday.

She reached her small drafting table tucked away in the far corner of the Engineering Department.  It was a cramped space, barely enough room for her T-square, triangles, and meticulously sharpened pencils.  But it was *her* space.  Here, amidst the cacophony of the factory floor, Amelia could lose herself in the elegant lines of her drawings, the precision of her calculations.  Here, she could dream of designing something beautiful, something lasting, instead of just another cog in the ironworks machine.

Today's project:  Detailed schematics for a new hydraulic pump, commissioned by the burgeoning meatpacking industry.  Hardly glamorous, but it paid the bills. And perhaps, she thought, as she unrolled a fresh sheet of vellum, within the intricate design of a mundane machine, lay the seeds of something more.
