Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a Physician's Assistant:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, even inside the relatively modern confines of the Pointe Claire Community Clinic. Dr. LeBlanc’s ceiling fan whirred tirelessly, a desperate attempt to alleviate the oppressive heat, but it only succeeded in circulating the scent of antiseptic and simmering swamp gas. A low hum resonated from the waiting room, a blend of muffled coughs, children’s impatient squeals, and the rhythmic clicking of Mrs. Broussard’s rosary beads.

This was a Tuesday, which meant it was officially “Dr. LeBlanc’s headache day,” where the elderly doctor seemed to only be able to prescribe Tylenol and offer a smile. That meant most patients were delegated to **Genevieve “Gen” Marie Dubois**, a physician's assistant with a degree from LSU, a stubborn streak a mile wide, and a growing sense of unease about the persistent rash plaguing little Timmy Guidry. Gen stared at the blood sample Timmy's mother had brought in, a knot tightening in her stomach. The color was off, darker than it should be, and she felt a prickling instinct that this was more than just a heat rash, no matter what Dr. LeBlanc mumbled about the humidity.
