The sun, a molten yolk in the inky dawn, was just beginning to lick the edges of the cornfields when Silas Ebenezer Cartwright stepped out onto the porch of his weathered farmhouse. The air, thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth and ripening tomatoes, clung to him like a second skin. Silas, a man built like an oak, with hands calloused from years of wrestling with the land and a face permanently etched with the lines of sun and worry, stretched slowly, his joints popping a mournful symphony. He surveyed his farm, Cartwright Acres, a patchwork of green and brown that sprawled across the gently rolling hills of Harmony County, Missouri. The dew-kissed fields stretched out before him, a silent promise of bounty, but also a constant threat of unpredictable weather, pestilence, and market fluctuations. A lone hawk circled lazily overhead, its piercing cry a familiar soundtrack to Silas's solitary mornings. Today was Tuesday, market day in Harmony Creek, and Silas had a truckload of early-season watermelons he was hoping to unload for a decent price. This year had been particularly hard, and the success of today's sale could very well determine whether he'd be able to make the mortgage payment next month.
