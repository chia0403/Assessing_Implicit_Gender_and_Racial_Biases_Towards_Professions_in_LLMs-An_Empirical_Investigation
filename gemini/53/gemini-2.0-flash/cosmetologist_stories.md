## Story Opening:

The humid Louisiana air clung to Amara Josephine Dubois like a second skin as she unlocked the wrought-iron gate of "The Magnolia Bloom," her quaint salon nestled in the heart of New Orleans' Garden District.  The wrought iron, painted a delicate, almost ethereal white, was a constant battle against the creeping rust that thrived in the city's perpetual dampness, much like Amara felt some days, battling her own internal rust of self-doubt against the vibrant bloom she wanted to cultivate within herself.

The first rays of dawn were just beginning to paint the sky in shades of rose and violet, filtering through the sprawling magnolias that gave the salon its name. Their intoxicating scent, usually a comfort, felt heavy this morning, a sticky reminder of the day ahead. Amara sighed, the sound lost in the chirping of cicadas already hard at work.  Today was the day. The day she was supposed to recreate a vintage Hollywood glamour look for Madame Evangeline LaRue, New Orleans' grand dame of theatre, and the pressure felt like a corset two sizes too small. 

If Amara could pull this off – *truly* pull it off – it could be the break her tiny business desperately needed.  But one wrong curl, one misplaced lash, and she risked not only Madame LaRue’s displeasure, but the whispers that would surely follow, stifling The Magnolia Bloom before it ever truly blossomed.
