Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you:

**Story Opening:**

The overhead lights flickered, casting long, wavering shadows down the aisle of the 747. For a split second, Amelia Rose Davies thought the plane was losing power. Her heart stuttered, a familiar, unwelcome guest whenever turbulence dared to ruffle the smooth surface of her carefully constructed composure. But the lights steadied, and she released a slow, measured breath. 

"Just nerves, Davies," she muttered under her breath, adjusting the crisp line of her Air New Zealand scarf. Tonight's flight was already shaping up to be a doozy. A crying baby in 34B, a stag party fueled by cheap duty-free whiskey in row 42, and now, a persistent, unsettling feeling that something wasn't quite right. Amelia had flown this Auckland to Los Angeles route more times than she could count, but this felt different. Colder, somehow. Like a premonition hanging heavy in the recirculated air.

**Setting:**

The main cabin of an Air New Zealand 747-400, nicknamed "KororƒÅreka" (Sweet Auckland), soaring over the vast, inky expanse of the Pacific Ocean. It's a night flight, the cabin mostly dark save for the dim reading lights of a few insomniacs. The interior is a calming palette of teal and grey, with stylized Maori designs subtly woven into the seat fabric and bulkhead panels. The air is dry and faintly scented with the manufactured sweetness of the in-flight meals and the sterile tang of disinfectant. The gentle hum of the engines provides a constant, almost hypnotic backdrop to the murmur of sleeping passengers and the occasional call of a crew member. The atmosphere is a carefully curated illusion of comfort and safety, a fragile bubble suspended thousands of feet above the dark, unforgiving ocean.
