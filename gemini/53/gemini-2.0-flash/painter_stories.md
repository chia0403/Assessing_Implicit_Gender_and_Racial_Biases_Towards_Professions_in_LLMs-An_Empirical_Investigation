The salt spray kissed the weathered face of Elias Thorne, a man as craggy and stubborn as the coastline he was currently attempting to capture on canvas. He perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking Porthgwarra Cove in Cornwall, the wind a persistent, mischievous hand ruffling his already unruly grey hair. The air, thick with the tang of brine and the distant screech of gulls, vibrated with the raw energy of the Atlantic.

Elias, in his late sixties, was a painter of light and shadow, a pursuer of the ephemeral beauty he found in the crashing waves, the shifting sands, and the ever-changing skies. Today, the canvas was taunting him. The grey-green sea, normally a swirling, mesmerizing spectacle, felt flat and lifeless under a low, overcast sky. Heâ€™d been wrestling with it for hours, adding layers of ochre and indigo, only to scrape them back again in frustration. The tide was turning, slowly but relentlessly reclaiming the beach, inching closer to his precarious perch.
