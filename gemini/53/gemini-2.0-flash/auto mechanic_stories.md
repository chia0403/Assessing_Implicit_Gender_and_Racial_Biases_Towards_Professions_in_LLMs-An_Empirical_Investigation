Okay, here's a story opening, complete with a setting and the full name of our protagonist:

**Opening:**

The wrench slipped, and a curse erupted from under the hood of the ancient Ford pickup truck. "Son of a…" Evelyn Mae Johnson wrestled the stubborn bolt again, her brow furrowed in concentration. Grease smeared her cheekbone, a rogue streak of midnight black against her naturally fair skin.  She hated Thursdays. Thursdays always brought the clunkers, the basket cases, the vehicles that seemed to actively despise her, and this Ford was proving to be the worst of the bunch. The owner, a grizzled farmer named Mr. Abernathy, had assured her it just needed "a little tickle under the hood." Evelyn suspected that "little tickle" involved a complete engine rebuild.

**Setting:**

Evelyn’s Garage & Gas sat just off Highway 16, a ribbon of asphalt that bisected the rolling wheat fields of Havenwood, Kansas. It wasn’t much to look at: a squat, cinder block building painted a faded sky blue that was perpetually peeling, topped with a rusty sign that proudly (and somewhat ironically) proclaimed "QUALITY SERVICE SINCE 1978." A single, perpetually flickering fluorescent bulb buzzed inside the garage itself, casting a harsh, utilitarian glow over the oil-stained concrete floor and the crowded workbench laden with tools, spare parts, and half-empty coffee cups.  Outside, a graveyard of forgotten vehicles – rusted hulks of sedans, pickups, and the occasional tractor – served as a testament to Evelyn's skill (and her packrat tendencies). The ever-present scent of gasoline, oil, and WD-40 hung in the air, a pungent perfume that Evelyn had long since stopped noticing, but that assaulted the nostrils of anyone unfamiliar with the place. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the lot, painting everything in shades of gold and gray. The only sound, besides Evelyn's muttered curses and the occasional wrench clang, was the drone of cicadas in the nearby cornfields.
