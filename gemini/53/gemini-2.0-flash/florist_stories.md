**Setting:**

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and sweet with the scent of jasmine and decay. It was late July in New Orleans, and the heat pressed down on Royal Street like a suffocating velvet curtain. Tourists, already glistening with sweat, jostled along the narrow sidewalk, clutching beignets and snapping photos of wrought-iron balconies dripping with vibrant bougainvillea. Tucked between a voodoo shop overflowing with gris-gris bags and a bar blasting zydeco music was "Fleurs Sauvages," a tiny flower shop overflowing with a chaotic beauty that mirrored the city itself. Inside, ferns dripped from hanging baskets, orchids bloomed in improbable colors, and the air hummed with the faint buzz of a hidden air conditioner.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Fleurs Sauvages jingled, a discordant chime that barely registered over the swamp-tinged blues drifting from the radio. Eleanor Josephine "Ellie Jo" Dubois didn't even glance up. Kneeling amidst a tangle of thorny rose stems and discarded ribbons, she meticulously wired a single, perfect ruby-red rose onto a delicate silver band. Sweat beaded on her brow, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair to her forehead. This particular rose crown was for Madame Evangeline, the local tarot card reader, known for her flamboyant style and even more flamboyant clientele. Ellie Jo prided herself on creating pieces that spoke to the soul of the wearer, a talent honed since she was a child, learning the language of flowers at her grandmother's knee. Finally, she lifted the finished piece, turning it slowly in her hands. The rose glowed against the silver, a perfect symbol of passion and secrets. Satisfied, she set it carefully in a tissue-lined box just as the jingling bell heralded a new customer. This time, Ellie Jo straightened up, wiping her hands on her floral-print apron. "Bonjour," she said, her voice a melodious drawl. "How can Fleurs Sauvages bring a little sauvage into your day?"
