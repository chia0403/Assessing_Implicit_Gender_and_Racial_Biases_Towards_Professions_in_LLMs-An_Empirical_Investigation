The harsh fluorescent lights of the Speedy Mart hummed a monotonous tune, a tune Eileen Mallory had memorized down to the subtle crackle that preceded its inevitable burnout. Eileen sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It was a slow Tuesday night, the kind that made minutes feel like hours, and the only sounds punctuating the hum were the occasional rustle of a magazine page as she pretended to read and the rhythmic beep-beep-beep of her scanner as it tallied up another customerâ€™s purchase of lottery tickets and sugary sodas.

Eileen was perched behind register three, her throne in this fluorescent-lit kingdom of chips, beer, and desperation. The Speedy Mart itself was a squat, brick building situated on the edge of Harmony Creek, a small, almost aggressively charming town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Harmony Creek was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, where the annual "Apple Blossom Festival" was the social event of the year, and where gossip travelled faster than the creek during a spring flood. Tonight, however, the town seemed to be holding its breath, the only signs of life emanating from the neon glow of the Speedy Mart, a beacon in the quiet darkness.
