## Story Opening:

The biting wind, a constant companion in these northern forests, whipped at Ethan Alexander Blackwood's beard as he wrestled another log into submission. The chain of his saw whined a mournful song, echoing through the skeletal trees stripped bare by winter. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the snow, the brown stain stark against the pristine white. Another tree, felled, another scar on the landscape. He knew the arguments; he'd heard them all his life. Sustainability. Conservation. He saw the protesters, their faces contorted with righteous anger, chained to the gates of the logging yard. But Ethan just saw a way to provide for his family, a tradition passed down through generations, etched into his very bones. And tonight, his daughter, Lily, would need those bones to be strong.

## Setting:

The setting is the deep, unforgiving wilderness of northern Maine, bordering Canada. It's mid-winter, the air thick with the promise of more snow. The landscape is dominated by towering pines and spruces, their dark green needles providing a stark contrast to the dazzling white blanket covering the ground. The air is crisp and frigid, biting at any exposed skin. The logging camp is a cluster of rough-hewn cabins, smelling of woodsmoke and pine resin, clinging precariously to the edge of the forest. The nearest town, a small, struggling community named Harmony Falls, is a good hour's drive away on a treacherous, ice-covered road. The mood is one of isolation, resilience, and the constant battle against the elements.
