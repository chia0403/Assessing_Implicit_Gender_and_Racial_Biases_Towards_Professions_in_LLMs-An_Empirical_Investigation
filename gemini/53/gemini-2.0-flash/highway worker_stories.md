**Setting:** The biting February wind howled across the desolate expanse of Highway 16, just outside of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Snow, driven by the relentless wind, whipped horizontally, obscuring the already bleak landscape. The sun, a weak and watery disc, barely managed to penetrate the oppressive grey clouds. The skeletal branches of leafless poplars lining the highway rattled like old bones, a chilling soundtrack to the day. Patches of ice, slick and treacherous, clung stubbornly to the asphalt despite the constant application of salt. A single, battered orange snowplow, caked in grime and bearing the scars of countless winters, lumbered slowly along the westbound lane, its yellow strobe lights flashing a desperate warning against the monochrome backdrop.

**Opening:**

The frigid air bit at Angus McTavish's exposed cheeks as he wrestled the stubborn tow chain free from the undercarriage of the stalled semi. Angus McTavish, forty-seven years old, built like a brick shithouse and tougher than the prairie wheat that stubbornly poked its way through the cracked asphalt in the summer, grunted with the effort. His breath plumed out in frosty clouds, mingling with the diesel fumes that hung thick in the air. Damned thing was frozen solid, same as everything else out here. He swore under his breath, the words swallowed by the wind. This was his life, out here on the highway, battling the elements and patching up the broken bones of Saskatchewan's transportation arteries. A life he both loved and loathed in equal measure. He spat a stream of brown tobacco juice into the swirling snow, wiped his gloved hand across his already dirty face, and gave the chain one last, almighty yank. With a protesting groan of metal, it finally yielded. Just another day on the job. Just another stranded driver and another frozen hunk of metal standing between him and a warm cup of coffee back at the depot. But today, something felt different. Today, the wind seemed to carry a different kind of howl, a mournful whisper that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck. A feeling he hadn't experienced since... well, since that night ten years ago, down by Old Man Hemmings' farm. A feeling that something bad was coming.
