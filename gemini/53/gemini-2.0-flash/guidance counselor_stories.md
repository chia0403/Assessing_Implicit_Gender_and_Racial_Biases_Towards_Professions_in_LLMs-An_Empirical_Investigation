Okay, here's a story opening with a guidance counselor main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of her office, a familiar aroma that had become as comforting as her worn leather chair. Eleanor Vance, Head Guidance Counselor of Northwood High, watched the rain streak down the windowpanes, mirroring the turbulent emotions she’d become so adept at navigating. Today was shaping up to be a Monday of epic proportions. First, a screaming match between the theater director and the football coach over shared rehearsal space, followed by a weeping sophomore convinced she'd failed her algebra test and was doomed to a life of minimum wage, and now… a crumpled note slipped under her door summoning her to Principal Thompson's office "immediately." The "immediately" was underscored three times. Eleanor sighed, pushed back from her desk, and straightened her perpetually crooked glasses. Whatever crisis was brewing upstairs, she was bracing herself to be the calm in the center of its storm.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is **Northwood High School**, a public school situated in the fictional town of Oakhaven, a suburb just outside of a larger city. The school is fairly large, with a diverse student population and a generally positive academic reputation, though with its share of teenage drama and societal pressures. Eleanor's office is small but cozy, filled with motivational posters, college brochures, a meticulously organized file cabinet, and a collection of stress balls in various shapes and sizes. The hallway outside is typically bustling with the energy of students rushing to and from classes, punctuated by the echoing clang of lockers and snippets of conversations. Principal Thompson's office, by contrast, is a more sterile and imposing space, reflecting his more formal and authoritative personality. Oakhaven itself is a typical suburban town, with tree-lined streets, well-manicured lawns, and a sense of underlying conformity, but with an increasing diversity of viewpoints.
