The clatter of keyboards and the urgent hum of a thousand conversations washed over Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a tidal wave. He gripped his phone tighter, the sweat slick on the cheap plastic. It was 9:31 AM, one minute after the opening bell, and the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was already a symphony of organized chaos. He could practically taste the metallic tang of fear and greed in the air.

Bart's assigned desk, a crammed cubicle in the back of the Rosenblum, Stern & Hayes brokerage firm, felt miles away from the gleaming ticker displays and the sharp-suited titans he'd only ever glimpsed on CNBC. It was a space dominated by overflowing ashtrays (even though smoking was banned years ago), stained coffee mugs, and a pervasive scent of stale pizza and desperation. The faded beige carpet was worn thin, a testament to years of frantic pacing and nervous energy. From his vantage point, he could see snippets of the chaos – a trader slamming his phone down, a group huddled around a monitor, their faces illuminated by glowing charts, and the ceaseless, relentless flow of data scrolling across the screens like a digital waterfall.

He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing anxiety that had become his constant companion since he'd started six months ago. Today, though, felt different. Today felt… charged.
