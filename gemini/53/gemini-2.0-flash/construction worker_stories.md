The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like Spanish moss on an ancient oak. Sweat beaded on the brow of Silas "Si" Bartholomew, making his already sun-baked skin gleam like oiled leather. He adjusted his hard hat, the orange plastic offering little relief, and squinted at the skeletal framework of the future "Magnolia Estates" retirement community rising before him.

Dust swirled around his worn work boots, kicking up the scent of raw lumber and fresh concrete. The rhythmic clang of hammers echoed through the air, punctuated by the growl of a nearby excavator chewing through the red clay. He was twenty years into the construction game, and this sprawling development was just another job site, another paycheck. But something felt different today, a subtle unease humming beneath the usual cacophony. Maybe it was the unsettling stillness of the cicadas, their usual deafening drone strangely absent. Or maybe it was the unsettling glint of sunlight off something half-buried in the freshly turned earth at the far end of the site, near the old Oakhaven graveyard. Whatever it was, Silas Bartholomew had a feeling this wasnâ€™t going to be just another brick in the wall.
