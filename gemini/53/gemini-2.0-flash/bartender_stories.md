Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bartender named Bartholomew "Bart" Finch:

**Setting:**

The Rusty Mug Saloon squats low and wide on the corner of Bleecker and Sullivan in New York City's Greenwich Village. The neon sign, perpetually flickering, casts a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked sidewalk. Inside, the air hangs thick with the scent of stale beer, roasted peanuts, and regret. The walls are a patchwork quilt of faded band posters, vintage advertisements for cigarettes, and hand-drawn signs boasting daily specials like "Mystery Meat Monday" and "Two-for-One Tequila Tuesdays." Booths upholstered in cracked vinyl line the walls, each dimly lit by a single, flickering candle. A perpetually sticky, mahogany bar stretches the length of the room, its surface scarred with decades of spilled drinks and whispered secrets. The clientele is a motley crew of struggling artists, burnt-out academics, and the occasional tourist who wandered in looking for something authentic.

**Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Finch knew three things for sure: The rain outside was turning to sleet, the jukebox was about to launch into another rendition of "Piano Man" (courtesy of a particularly morose patron in booth three), and tonight was going to be a long one. He wiped down the already spotless bar with a practiced hand, his gaze sweeping over the familiar landscape of The Rusty Mug. His reflection stared back, a weary ghost in the polished wood. At thirty-seven, Bart felt older than the saloon itself. His dark hair, usually meticulously styled, was beginning to show a worrying sprinkling of grey at the temples. His eyes, normally bright and observant, held a permanent shadow of exhaustion. He'd poured enough drinks in this place to fill the Hudson River, heard enough sob stories to write a Tolstoy novel, and tonight, he suspected, was just the beginning of another chapter. A new face had just walked in, shaking the rain from their coat, and Bart had a feeling they were about to need more than just a drink.

I tried to make it atmospheric and give a glimpse of Bart's character and history within the setting. I hope you like it!
