The fluorescent lights of Sterling, Finch & Davenport hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Beatrice Eleanor Hargrove's Tuesday. It was 8:57 AM, three minutes before the officially-sanctioned start of the workday, and already the phone was ringing. Beatrice, her auburn hair neatly pinned into a chignon that defied gravity, reached for the receiver with a sigh that only she could hear. The weight of responsibility, of being the gatekeeper to Mr. Davenport's chaotic schedule and the first line of defense against a horde of demanding clients, pressed down on her shoulders.

Her desk, a sea of beige laminate in a cubicle farm that stretched as far as the eye could see, was meticulously organized. Three pens in varying shades of blue stood at attention in a porcelain cup shaped like a teacup pig. A single, framed photograph of her grandmother, a stern-faced woman with a surprisingly mischievous twinkle in her eye, stood guard over a stack of perfectly aligned legal pads. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside the large, grime-streaked window, the grey Seattle sky promised another day of relentless drizzle. Sterling, Finch & Davenport, a venerable law firm specializing in maritime law, was a place where dreams went to drown, and Beatrice Hargrove was right there, holding the life raft.
