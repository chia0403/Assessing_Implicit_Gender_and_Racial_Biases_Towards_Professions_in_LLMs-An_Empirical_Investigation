**Story Opening:**

The insistent buzz of the overhead fluorescent light felt like a tiny, malicious insect boring into Dr. Evelyn Grace Montgomery's skull. It was a fitting soundtrack, she thought grimly, to the slow-motion car crash that was her Tuesday afternoon. Her last patient, a young artist named Leo, had just stormed out, leaving a trail of crumpled tissues and accusations of her being "emotionally constipated." Evelyn sighed, pushing back from her desk, the leather chair groaning in protest. She could already feel the familiar tendrils of doubt creeping in, questioning her methods, her instincts, her very competence.

**Setting:**

Dr. Evelyn Grace Montgomery's office occupied a small, unassuming suite on the third floor of a brick building in the historic district of Salem, Massachusetts. The building itself, known as the Hawthorne Building, had once housed a printing press during the witch trial era, a fact Evelyn found both fascinating and occasionally unnerving. Her office was an attempt at creating a calming, neutral space. The walls were painted a muted sage green, chosen for its supposed ability to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. A plush, patterned rug in earthy tones covered the worn wooden floor, and a comfortable, overstuffed armchair sat opposite her desk, strategically placed for optimal patient comfort and perceived safety. The room was filled with carefully curated details: a small, bubbling fountain in the corner, a collection of calming landscape prints, and strategically placed plants, all designed to project an image of serene professionalism. However, the chipped paint on the window frame, the slightly mismatched furniture, and the ever-present hum of the fluorescent light hinted at the budgetary constraints of a solo practice in a town known more for its tourist attractions than its mental health services. The large window overlooked a narrow cobblestone street, usually bustling with tourists snapping photos of the Witch House, a constant reminder of the town's dark history, and a fitting backdrop to the dark stories that often unfolded within the walls of her office.
