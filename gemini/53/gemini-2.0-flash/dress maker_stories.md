Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on the character and her craft:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a fragrant shield against the persistent dampness that clung to the narrow Edinburgh street.  Eleanor Abigail Thorne, her fingers nimble as sparrows, deftly pinned a length of shimmering emerald silk to the muslin bodice.  The silk, heavier than gossamer but lighter than velvet, was a recent import from Lyon, destined to become a gown fit for a duchess, or at least someone pretending to be one.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aged panes of her workshop window.  A customer was due any minute, a nervous young woman set to be married, and Eleanor had to finish the intricate lace embellishment around the neckline.

But as she bent her head closer, squinting at the delicate floral pattern, a sharp, unexpected stab of pain shot through her left hand.  She gasped, dropping the pins with a clatter onto the wooden floor.  This wasn't a mere ache from long hours bent over her work; this was a cold, gnawing fire that threatened to consume her most valuable asset: her hands. The hands that breathed life into fabric, creating dreams with needle and thread.  And if she lost those hands, she lost everything.

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. Eleanor's dressmaking workshop is located on a quiet, cobbled street in the Old Town of Edinburgh, Scotland.  It's a small, cozy space tucked into the ground floor of a tall, narrow building, typical of the city's historic architecture.

*   **The Workshop:**  The front window, slightly bowed with age, displays a few of Eleanor's creations: a richly embroidered velvet cloak, a delicate lace shawl, and a mannequin draped in a half-finished gown.  Inside, bolts of fabric in every imaginable color and texture line the walls, stacked on shelves that reach the high ceiling.  Spools of thread, boxes of buttons, ribbons, beads, and all manner of embellishments overflow from drawers and containers. A large, sturdy worktable dominates the center of the room, covered in scraps of fabric, patterns, and tools of the trade: shears, needles, thimbles, and tracing wheels. A treadle sewing machine, oiled and well-used, stands in one corner, a testament to both tradition and progress.
*   **The Atmosphere:**  The air is filled with the comforting scents of fabric, beeswax polish used on the furniture, and the lingering fragrance of lavender sachets placed among the textiles to deter moths. The light is soft and diffused, filtering through the dusty windowpanes. Despite the sometimes harsh weather outside, the workshop is a haven of creativity and warmth.
*   **Eleanor's Living Space:**  A narrow, winding staircase at the back of the workshop leads to Eleanor's living quarters above. These consist of a small kitchen, a cozy bedroom, and a cramped sitting room. The decor is simple but elegant, reflecting Eleanor's refined taste and her love of beautiful things.

This setting provides a backdrop for Eleanor's character and profession, as well as hints at the potential challenges she might face in the story. The pain in her hand adds a layer of immediate conflict and introduces a potential threat to her livelihood.
