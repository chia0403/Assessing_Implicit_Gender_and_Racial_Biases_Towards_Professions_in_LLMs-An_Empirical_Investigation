The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised purple sky, beat down on Amelia “Milly” Rodriguez’s orange vest.  Sweat plastered the cheap fabric to her skin, and dust, kicked up by the passing eighteen-wheelers, clung to the dampness like a second skin.  Heat shimmered off the asphalt of Interstate 40, blurring the New Mexico landscape into a wavering mirage of ochre mesas and scrubby juniper. Mile marker 147. Another desolate stretch of highway between Albuquerque and nowhere.  A buzzard circled high above, a black speck against the vastness, its patient vigilance a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this land. Milly adjusted her hard hat and sighed, the sound swallowed by the ceaseless roar of the highway. Another day, another hundred miles of cracked pavement and endless horizon.
