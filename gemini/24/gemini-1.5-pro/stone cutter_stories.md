The biting wind whipped off the Tyrran Sea, carrying the scent of salt and something else, something acrid and metallic, that clung to the back of Elias Thorne's throat. He squinted, his grey eyes, the colour of the very stone he worked, tracing the jagged line of the cliffs that plummeted to the churning grey water below. Above him, the sky was a bruised purple, promising snow. Elias shifted his weight, the rough wool of his cloak scratching against the leather apron protecting his clothes from the dust that perpetually coated him.  His breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the half-finished statue that dominated his small, open-air workshop, perched precariously on the cliff edge. The workshop, little more than a wooden lean-to braced against the wind, was littered with tools: chisels, hammers, rasps, all worn smooth with years of use.  The village of Stonehaven, a cluster of grey stone houses clinging to the cliffs like barnacles, huddled below, its lights flickering faintly in the gathering gloom.  Today, Elias was carving an angel, her wings already unfurled, poised for flight, but the face, the crucial element, remained blank, a smooth expanse of white Tyrran marble waiting for his touch.  He knew what he needed to carve, the face he'd seen in his dreams, but his hand hesitated, the chisel hovering just above the stone.  There was something in that face, a sorrow, a knowing, that both compelled and terrified him.
