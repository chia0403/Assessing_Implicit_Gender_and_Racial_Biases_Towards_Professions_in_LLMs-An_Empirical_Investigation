The biting November wind whipped down Main Street, rattling the oversized, brightly colored plastic spine that hung outside Dr. Elias Thorne's practice.  Elias, pulling his threadbare tweed jacket tighter around himself, watched the spine sway precariously.  It creaked in protest with each gust, a sound that mirrored the aches in his own forty-year-old bones.  Oakhaven, Illinois, wasn't much to look at in the off-season.  The summer tourists, drawn by the promise of quaint antique shops and apple orchards, had long since retreated, leaving behind a skeleton crew of year-round residents and a pervasive sense of sleepy melancholy. Elias's clinic, "Thorne Chiropractic and Wellness," nestled between a dusty bookstore and a perpetually closed ice cream parlor, was usually quiet this time of year.  But today, something felt different. A strange, almost electric tension hung in the crisp air, as if Oakhaven itself was holding its breath in anticipation of… something.  Elias couldn't quite put his finger on it, but as he fumbled with the lock to his clinic door, a shiver ran down his spine – a shiver entirely unrelated to the cold.
