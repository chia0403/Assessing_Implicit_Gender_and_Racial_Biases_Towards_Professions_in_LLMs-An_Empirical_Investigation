The aroma of burnt sugar and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, clinging to the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven like a persistent cough.  Flakes of ash, remnants of the bakery fire that had consumed half the block three weeks prior, still drifted down from the skeletal remains of what had once been the pride of the town.  Eliza Jane Cartwright, her hands raw and chapped, stood amidst the rubble, her gaze fixed on the twisted metal that had once been her oven.  The "Cartwright Cakery," a name hand-painted by her grandfather on a sign now reduced to cinders, echoed only in her memory. Oakhaven, a small town nestled in the valley of the whispering pines, had always been a place of warmth and the comforting scent of freshly baked bread. Now, the only warmth came from the weak October sun, offering little solace in the face of such devastation.
