The neon "Open" sign buzzed intermittently, casting a flickering, lurid glow across the rain-slicked street. Inside "Nailed It," the air hung thick with the cloying scent of acetone and something vaguely floral.  Eliza Jane O’Malley, her name tag pinned precariously to her leopard-print smock, surveyed the empty salon with a sigh.  4:57 pm on a Tuesday.  Prime pampering time, usually. But tonight, the only company she had was the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large picture window and the mournful crooning of Billie Holiday on the radio.  Emerald Hills, the supposedly up-and-coming neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city, was proving to be less booming and more bust.  Eliza Jane tapped a perfectly manicured, scarlet-tipped finger against the counter, her mind already calculating how many more slow days she could afford before needing to dust off her old waitressing resume.  Then, the bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer.  Eliza Jane plastered on her brightest smile.  Maybe tonight wouldn’t be a total washout after all.
