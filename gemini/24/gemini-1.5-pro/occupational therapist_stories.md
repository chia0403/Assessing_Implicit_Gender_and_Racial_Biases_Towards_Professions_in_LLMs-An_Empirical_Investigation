The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she navigated the icy cobblestones of Wicklow Lane.  The quaint, crooked row houses of Port Blossom, Maine, were huddled together against the approaching storm, their windows glowing warmly against the slate-grey sky.  Amy pulled her thick wool coat tighter around herself, the scent of brine and woodsmoke clinging to the damp air.  Her destination, number 47, Mrs. O’Malley’s weather-beaten, two-story cottage, was nestled halfway down the lane, its front porch sagging under the weight of a dormant wisteria vine.  Amy, an occupational therapist at the local community clinic, had been visiting Mrs. O’Malley twice a week since her hip replacement surgery, helping the fiercely independent elderly woman regain her mobility and independence.  This particular afternoon, however, Amy felt a prickle of unease she couldn't quite explain.  The usually cheerful glow from Mrs. O’Malley's kitchen window was absent, and an unnatural stillness hung over the little cottage.
