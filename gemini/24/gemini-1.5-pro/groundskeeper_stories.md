The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the grounds of Eventide Manor.  Frost crunched beneath her sturdy work boots, the sound sharp against the otherwise hushed dawn.  Eventide, a sprawling Victorian edifice of gables, turrets, and stained glass, loomed against the bruised sky, its many windows dark and secretive.  Amy, bundled in a thick woolen coat and fingerless gloves, exhaled a plume of white breath, her gaze fixed on the sprawling rose garden, now a skeletal tangle of thorny branches.  Winter had arrived in the valley, clinging to the grounds with a glacial tenacity, and with it came the quiet, lonely work of preparing Eventide for its long slumber.  The air held a scent of woodsmoke and the earthy tang of impending snow, a familiar and comforting aroma that spoke of seasons changing and the enduring rhythm of the estate.  For generations, the Hawthornes had cared for Eventide's grounds, and Amy, the latest in a long line, carried the weight of that legacy on her capable shoulders.  But this winter felt different.  A strange unease, a prickly sensation at the back of her neck, had settled upon her with the first frost, a feeling that went deeper than the usual winter melancholy.
