The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  He adjusted his goggles, the world shifting from a blurry white expanse to a crisply defined landscape of jagged ice formations and wind-sculpted snowdrifts.

Inside, nestled amongst the complex machinery and sterile labs, lay the reason for Aris's self-imposed exile: Project Chimera, a clandestine research initiative shrouded in secrecy, its true purpose known only to a handful of individuals scattered across the globe.  Tonight, Aris believed, he was finally close to a breakthrough, a discovery that could rewrite everything humanity knew about the origins of life itself.
