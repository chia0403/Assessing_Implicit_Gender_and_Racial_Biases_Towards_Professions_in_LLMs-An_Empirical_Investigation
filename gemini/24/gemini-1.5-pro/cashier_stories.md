The fluorescent lights of the QuikStop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday night.  Outside, the Nevada desert stretched away from the lone gas station and convenience store like a rumpled, rust-colored blanket, the only interruption the thin ribbon of Highway 17 shimmering under a bruised, sunset sky.  Dust devils danced across the asphalt, occasionally swirling against the grimy glass doors, momentarily obscuring the view of the Joshua trees clawing at the horizon.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee, hot dogs rotating endlessly on greasy rollers, and the faintly chemical tang of cleaning fluid Amelia had just used to wipe down the counter.  Another tumbleweed bounced past the window, and Amelia sighed, pushing a loose strand of dark hair behind her ear.  This was hour five of her eight-hour shift, and the excitement had long since faded, leaving only the dull ache of boredom in its wake.
