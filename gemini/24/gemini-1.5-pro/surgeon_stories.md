The biting wind whipped off the East River, swirling grit and tattered plastic bags around Dr. Elias Thorne's ankles as he hurried toward Lenox Hill Hospital.

Only the rumble of garbage trucks and the distant clang of a subway train broke the relative silence. As he pushed through the revolving doors, the sterile, antiseptic scent of the hospital washed over him, a familiar and strangely comforting aroma that signified the beginning of another day, another battle fought against the fragility of the human body.
