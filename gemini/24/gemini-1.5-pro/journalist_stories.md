Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Chronicle's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Milly" Reyes.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered desks and overflowing ashtrays. Cigarette smoke, cheap coffee, and the faint scent of printer ink hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail Milly usually found comforting. Tonight, however, it felt suffocating.

The humidity clung to everything, just like the unsolved disappearance of local fisherman, Jacques LeBeau, clung to Milly's mind.  His empty boat had been found adrift two weeks ago, nets cast wide and teeming with untouched redfish, a scene that whispered of something far more sinister than a simple accident.  Milly, ever the bloodhound for a story, was determined to uncover the truth, even if it meant digging into the murky depths of Trinity City's underbelly.
