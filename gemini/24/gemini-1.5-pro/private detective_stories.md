Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, a staccato rhythm accompanying the mournful saxophone solo crackling from the battered radio perched precariously on a stack of dusty case files.  Silas himself, Silas Raymond Finch, Private Investigator, sat hunched over his desk, the weak light of a desk lamp illuminating the deepening lines etched into his face. His office, nestled above a laundromat on the less fashionable end of Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village,  smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a scent Silas had come to consider comforting in its familiarity.  It was a Tuesday night, October 27th, 1958, and the only thing colder than the autumn wind whistling through the ill-fitting window frame was the case file lying open before him. A missing person, a beautiful redhead named Delilah Hayes, vanished without a trace from a swanky Upper East Side apartment building.  Her photograph, clipped to the file, stared back at him with an unsettling serenity.  The retainer, a crumpled fifty-dollar bill tucked into the corner of the file, mocked him with its inadequacy.  This wasn't going to be easy.
