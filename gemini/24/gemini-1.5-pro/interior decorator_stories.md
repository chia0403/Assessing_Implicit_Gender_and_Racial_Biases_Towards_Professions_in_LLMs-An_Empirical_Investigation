The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Amelia Thorne as she wrestled a recalcitrant sample book of Italian silks out of her vintage Porsche 911.

The new owner, a reclusive tech billionaire named Silas Vane, had purchased the property sight unseen and given Amelia a brief so vague it bordered on abstract: "Make it feel… timeless."  Amelia, whose design philosophy revolved around blending classic elegance with modern sensibilities, felt a thrill of anticipation mixed with a healthy dose of trepidation. This wasn't just another country house renovation; it was a blank canvas demanding a masterpiece.
