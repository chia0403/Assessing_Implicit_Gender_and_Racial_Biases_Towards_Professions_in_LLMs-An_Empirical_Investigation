Dead leaves, the colour of bruised plums, skittered across the wide gravel driveway. Eventide, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a magnificent beast of a house, and Agnes, its sole housekeeper for the past fifteen years, its tireless, if slightly resentful, keeper.  Inside, the vast, echoing halls were warmed by only a few strategically placed coal fires, leaving pockets of lingering chill in the shadows.  A faint aroma of beeswax and lemon oil clung to the air, a testament to Agnes's meticulous efforts.  But today, even the familiar comfort of her routine couldn't quite dispel the uneasy feeling that clung to her like the damp sea air.  Mr. Silas Blackwood, the manor's eccentric owner, was due back from his annual archaeological expedition to Egypt any day, and his letters, growing increasingly erratic, had hinted at a discovery that would "change everything."
