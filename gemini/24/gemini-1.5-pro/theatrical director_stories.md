The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Cartwright as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of stale beer and impending snow clinging to the air.  Her crimson beret, perched precariously on her head, threatened to take flight with each gust.  The flickering neon sign of the "Kraken's Kiss", a dive bar masquerading as a theatre, cast a lurid green glow on the wet pavement.  Inside, Esme knew, chaos reigned. Tech week for her avant-garde interpretation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream", set in a post-apocalyptic laundromat, was proving to be even more disastrous than she'd anticipated. Puck, played by a perpetually stoned method actor named Kevin, had superglued himself to one of the washing machines, Titania was threatening to walk if she didn't get a bigger dressing room, and Oberon's prosthetic fairy wings had mysteriously vanished. Esme clutched the dog-eared script in her gloved hand, her breath puffing out white clouds in the frigid air.  This was it.  Opening night was just forty-eight hours away, and if she didn't pull a miracle out of her threadbare director's hat, the whole production, her reputation, and possibly her sanity, would go down in flames.
