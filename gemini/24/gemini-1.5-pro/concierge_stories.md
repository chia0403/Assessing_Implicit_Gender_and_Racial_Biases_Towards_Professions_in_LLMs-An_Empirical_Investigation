The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum.  Crystal chandeliers cast rainbows across the polished marble floor, reflecting in the highly-polished brass of the ornate elevator doors.  A fire crackled merrily in the immense fireplace, casting a warm glow on the plush velvet furniture where guests lounged, sipping champagne and speaking in hushed tones.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the tall windows, turning the Champs-Élysées into a shimmering river of light.  Inside, however, everything was serene, a perfectly orchestrated symphony of comfort and elegance.  This was Antoine Dubois’ domain, and he ruled it with a gentle, yet unwavering hand.  Antoine, whose full name was Antoine Claude Marcel Dubois,  was the Chief Concierge of the Grand Majestic, a position he held with a quiet pride and an almost preternatural ability to anticipate his guests' every need.  Tonight, however,  a subtle tension tightened his shoulders, a prickle of unease he couldn't quite place.  Something was different, something was…off.
