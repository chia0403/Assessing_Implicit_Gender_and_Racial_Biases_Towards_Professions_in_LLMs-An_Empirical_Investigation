Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her newest client. The room, usually a sanctuary of warm ochre walls, soft lighting, and carefully chosen artwork depicting serene landscapes, felt charged with a nervous energy. Outside, the late October wind howled through the ancient oaks that lined Sycamore Street in the quaint, historic town of Alder’s Bend, Pennsylvania.  Inside, a young man with eyes the colour of a stormy sea fidgeted on the plush velvet chaise lounge, his knuckles white as he gripped the embroidered throw pillow. Dr. Vance, her own hazel eyes reflecting a mixture of concern and professional calm, sat across from him in a wingback chair, the gentle crackle of the fire in the hearth the only sound besides the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  This was only their second session, and she had a feeling the storm within him was far from breaking.
