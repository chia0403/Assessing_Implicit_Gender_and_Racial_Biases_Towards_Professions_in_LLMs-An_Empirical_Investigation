The biting February wind whipped snow flurries against the large plate glass window of "Curl Up & Dye," frosting the hand-painted lavender and turquoise swirls. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of hairspray, ammonia, and the cinnamon-spiced coffee Amelia Grace Hawthorne perpetually brewed.  Amelia, her fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun secured with a chipped jade chopstick, hummed along to a vintage Motown track while meticulously snipping split ends from Mrs. Periwinkle’s blue-rinsed bob. Curl Up & Dye, nestled on the corner of Oak and Elm in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Vermont, was Amelia’s sanctuary, her kingdom of curls, colours, and comforting chatter.  It was a place where secrets were whispered beneath the whir of the hairdryer, and dreams were teased out alongside tangles. This particular Tuesday, however, held a different energy, a palpable shift in the normally placid atmosphere of Havenwood.  Amelia felt it like a static charge in the air, prickling her skin and making the fine hairs on her arms stand on end.
