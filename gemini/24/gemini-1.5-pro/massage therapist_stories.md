The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast stripes across Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s worn leather massage table. The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a thin veil against the faint whiff of chlorine emanating from the public pool next door.  Serenity Now was tucked into a small, sun-bleached strip mall in the sleepy beach town of Playa Luna, California.  It was a Tuesday, typically Amelia's slowest day, and the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock in the corner was the only sound besides the distant shrieks of children enjoying the last of the summer heat.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, sat perched on a stool behind her small reception desk, flipping through a well-worn copy of Gray’s Anatomy, waiting for her 4:00 appointment, a new client who'd booked online – a Mr. Silas Blackwood.
