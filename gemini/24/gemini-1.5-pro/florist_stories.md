The bell above the door to "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthington's shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and sweet with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Eliza Jane, her brow furrowed in concentration, was coaxing a cascade of blush-pink sweet peas to drape just so from a wrought-iron arch, destined for a wedding later that day.  Her shop, nestled between a historic bookshop and a praline emporium on Queen Street, was a riot of color and fragrance.  Sunbeams, filtered through the dusty panes of the large front window, illuminated buckets overflowing with hydrangeas the color of a summer sky, vibrant sunflowers with faces turned towards the light, and fragrant sprigs of lavender tied with twine.  Today, however, a shadow lingered in the usually bright corners of Petal & Stem, a subtle unease that had nothing to do with the approaching storm.
