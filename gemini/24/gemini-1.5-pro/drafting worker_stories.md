She preferred the crisp precision of her work – the way a perfect curve could flow into a sharp angle, the satisfying click of her Rotring pen – to the chaotic symphony of the city sprawling beneath her. This high above the street, the cars and pedestrians were reduced to miniature toys, their hurried lives a silent movie playing out against the backdrop of a grey, snow-dusted cityscape.  But today, something was different.  A tension, thick and palpable, hung in the air, far heavier than the usual Friday afternoon fatigue.
