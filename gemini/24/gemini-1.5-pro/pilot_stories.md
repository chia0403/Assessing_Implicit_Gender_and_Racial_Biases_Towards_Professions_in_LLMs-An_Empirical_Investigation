The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly yellow sunrise, reflected in the icy sheen of Lake Clark.  Frozen peaks, jagged and imposing, ringed the lake, their snow-capped summits kissed by the first hesitant rays of dawn.

This was no ordinary delivery run; a late-season blizzard was brewing, and the weather reports whispered of treacherous conditions.  She adjusted her fur-lined cap, a knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. The mountains, beautiful and unforgiving, held secrets, and today, they felt particularly ominous.
