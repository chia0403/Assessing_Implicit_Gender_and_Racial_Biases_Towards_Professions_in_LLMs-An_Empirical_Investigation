The biting wind whipped across the parched fields of Oklahoma, stinging Elara Mae Johnson's cheeks like icy needles. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, swirling the dry topsoil into miniature tornadoes that mocked her dwindling hopes.  Her farm, Johnson's Legacy, once a vibrant tapestry of green and gold, now lay under the oppressive weight of a relentless drought.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the hazy sky, beat down on the cracked earth, baking the last vestiges of moisture from the soil.  The skeletal remains of corn stalks rattled in the wind, a mournful chorus accompanying Elara as she surveyed the desolate expanse. A rusted weather vane atop the barn, shaped like a rooster, creaked in protest, its once-proud stance now slumped in defeat. This drought, the worst in a century, threatened to swallow Johnson's Legacy whole, and with it, generations of her family's blood, sweat, and tears.
