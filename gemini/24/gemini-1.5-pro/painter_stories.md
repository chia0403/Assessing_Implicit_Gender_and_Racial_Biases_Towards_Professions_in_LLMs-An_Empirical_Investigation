The salt spray kissed Aurelia Isabel Martell's cheek, a fine mist that clung to the wisps of hair escaping her loose braid.  The wind, a constant companion on the Isle of Skye, tugged at her canvas, threatening to rip it from the easel perched precariously on the cliff edge. Below, the turquoise waters of the Sound of Raasay churned against the jagged black rocks, a symphony of crashing waves and echoing cries of gulls. Aurelia, oblivious to the precariousness of her position, was lost in a world of cobalt and emerald, her brush dancing across the canvas, capturing the shifting light on the distant Cuillin mountains.  Her small cottage, a stone haven nestled amongst the heather-covered slopes further inland, was a distant thought.  Here, perched between sky and sea, with the raw beauty of the Highlands surrounding her, Aurelia felt closest to her muse.
