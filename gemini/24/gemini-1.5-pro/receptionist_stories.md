The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby cast a sickly yellow glow on Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez's perfectly applied lipstick.  It was 3:17 am, a time when even the ghosts of vaudeville stars that supposedly haunted the Majestic were presumably asleep. Outside, a relentless Detroit rain hammered against the ornate Art Deco windows, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the silence. Esme, perched on her high-backed stool behind the imposing mahogany reception desk, stifled a yawn, the scent of stale coffee clinging to her like a second skin. The lobby, a cavernous space of marble floors and faded velvet armchairs, was deserted except for a single wilting fern in a brass pot and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, a sound that amplified the oppressive loneliness of the hour.  The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of downtown, had fallen on hard times, its grandeur now a tarnished whisper of a bygone era.  And Esme, keeper of the keys and silent witness to its slow decline, felt much the same way.
