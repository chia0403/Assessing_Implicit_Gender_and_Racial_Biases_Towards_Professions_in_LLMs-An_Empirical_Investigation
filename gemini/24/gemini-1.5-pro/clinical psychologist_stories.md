The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the relentless drumming anxiety she sensed radiating from her new patient.  Her office, perched on the tenth floor of the Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles, usually offered a calming view of the city sprawl, a comforting tapestry of lights twinkling against the dusky sky. But tonight, the city was veiled in a thick, grey curtain of rain, reflecting the turbulent inner world Eleanor suspected resided within the man sitting across from her. The Bradbury's ornate ironwork, usually a source of whimsical charm, seemed to cast cage-like shadows across the room, further amplifying the sense of confinement.  He hadn't spoken a word since arriving, his hands clasped tightly together, his gaze fixed on a flickering gas lamp that cast dancing shadows across his gaunt face. Eleanor, her notepad resting unopened on her lap, waited patiently, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the soft tick-tock of the antique clock on the mantelpiece.  She knew, with an almost visceral certainty, that this session was going to be unlike any other.
