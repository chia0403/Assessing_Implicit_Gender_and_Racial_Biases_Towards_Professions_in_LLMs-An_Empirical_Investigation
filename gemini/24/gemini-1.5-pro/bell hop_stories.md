The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, admitting a gust of frigid January air and a flurry of snowflakes that immediately melted on the plush Persian carpet.  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, a bellhop of slight stature but considerable charm, shivered despite his crisp navy uniform and tugged his pillbox hat lower over his ears. The lobby, usually buzzing with the low hum of conversation and the clinking of champagne flutes, was strangely subdued. An unsettling quiet had fallen over the normally vibrant space, punctuated only by the crackling fire in the enormous stone hearth and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock that stood sentinel by the reception desk.  Shadows danced in the corners of the cavernous room, cast by the flickering gaslights that lined the walls, giving the ornate décor an almost sinister air.  Barty, a seasoned veteran of the Grand Majestic's eccentricities, felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine.  Something was different. Something was…off.
