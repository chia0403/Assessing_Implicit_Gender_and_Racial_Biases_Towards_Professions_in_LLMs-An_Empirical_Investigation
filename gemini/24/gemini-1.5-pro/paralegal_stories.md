The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Kressler law offices hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes' Tuesday night.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Philadelphia, blurring the city lights into a hazy, impressionistic painting.  Amelia, her chestnut hair pulled back in a messy bun, squinted at the dense contract on her monitor.  Clause 42, subsection C, paragraph 12 – legalese so convoluted it felt like it was actively trying to strangle her brain cells.  It was 8:17 pm, well past quitting time, and the only other signs of life in the cavernous office were the rhythmic tapping of her keyboard and the occasional gurgle of the ancient coffee machine in the breakroom.  This was the glamorous life of a paralegal, she thought wryly, as she reached for another lukewarm cup of the office’s perpetually stale brew. The case, a particularly nasty intellectual property dispute involving a stolen recipe for artisanal pickles, was proving more difficult than anyone anticipated. And Amelia, burdened with the task of sifting through mountains of evidence, was at the eye of the storm.  Tonight, she was determined to find the smoking gun, the one document that would prove Kressler & Kressler’s client, the pickle magnate, was the rightful owner of the briney gold.
