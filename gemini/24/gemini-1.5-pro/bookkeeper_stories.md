The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across Amelia Prudence Higgins's neat ledgers. Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of her small office, tucked away above Mr. Finch's Emporium of Exotic Teas and Spices in the cobbled, gas-lit alleyways of Lower Grimsworth. The year was 1888, a year of fog and whispers, a year that clung to the shadows like the damp clinging to the bricks outside. Amelia, with her wire-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on her nose and ink staining the tip of her index finger, meticulously recorded the week's transactions.  Cinnamon, cloves, and a hint of something unsettling, like burnt sugar, hung heavy in the air.  The bell above the shop door chimed, announcing a late customer, but the sound was quickly swallowed by a low rumble of thunder that seemed to shake the very foundations of the building.
