The rusty tang of brake dust mingled with the sweet scent of honeysuckle drifting in from the overgrown lot next door. Grease stained the concrete floor of Rosie's Auto Repair like abstract art, and the persistent California sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof, turning the small garage into a veritable oven.  Eleanor Vance, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her grease-smudged hand.  A wrench slipped from her grasp, clattering onto the engine block of a cherry-red '67 Mustang, the sound echoing in the otherwise quiet space. It was a Tuesday afternoon in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, the kind of afternoon where the only sounds were the buzz of cicadas and the occasional distant rumble of a tractor.  Eleanor, however, had a feeling this particular Tuesday was about to get a whole lot less sleepy.
