Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the usually crisp lines of the Seattle skyline.  The Space Needle, typically a beacon of futuristic optimism, was now a ghostly silhouette swallowed by the grey.  Elias, his dark hair still damp from his cycle commute, shivered despite the warmth radiating from the minimalist fireplace. He’d designed this penthouse himself, favouring clean lines and exposed concrete, a stark contrast to the tempestuous weather outside.  The apartment, perched atop the newly erected Zenith Tower – his latest architectural triumph – was supposed to be a sanctuary. Tonight, however, it felt more like a cage. A half-finished blueprint lay spread across the polished concrete floor, the plans for a revolutionary community centre in the city's historic Pioneer Square district.  But Elias couldn't focus.  His gaze kept drifting back to the blinking red light on his answering machine, a tiny pulse of anxiety in the otherwise sterile environment. He knew who the message was from. He just didn't want to hear it.
