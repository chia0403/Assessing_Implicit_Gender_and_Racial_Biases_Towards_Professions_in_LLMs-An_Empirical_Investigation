The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Springs, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Inside Harmony Drug, the air conditioning hummed a monotonous tune, battling the oppressive heat.  Eleanor Vance, PharmD, meticulously counted out metformin tablets, the rhythmic click of the counting tray a counterpoint to the desultory whir of the ceiling fan.  Harmony Springs boasted a population just shy of 1,000, and Eleanor knew most of them by name, their ailments, and their preferred brands of antacids.  It wasn't the glamorous life she'd envisioned after pharmacy school, but it was a life of quiet routine, punctuated by the occasional rattlesnake sighting and the even more occasional tourist passing through on their way to somewhere else.  This particular Tuesday, however, was about to shatter Harmony Springs' tranquility â€“ and Eleanor's along with it.  A black SUV, coated in the fine dust of the desert roads, pulled up outside, its darkened windows reflecting the distorted image of the pharmacy's faded green awning.
