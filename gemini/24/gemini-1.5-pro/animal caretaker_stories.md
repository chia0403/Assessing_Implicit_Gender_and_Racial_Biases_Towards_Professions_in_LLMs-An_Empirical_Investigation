The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Milly” Cartwright’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep mud towards the primate enclosure.  Frost crunched beneath her worn Wellington boots, and the sky above the rolling hills of the Yorkshire Wildlife Sanctuary was the colour of a bruised plum.  The sanctuary, nestled in a secluded valley carved by the River Rye, was Milly’s domain, her kingdom of squawks, roars, and rustling feathers.  This morning, however, a peculiar silence hung in the air, broken only by the mournful hoot of a tawny owl hidden deep in the nearby woods. It was a silence that prickled Milly’s skin and made the fine hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. Something was wrong.
