The fluorescent lights of the "Nourish to Flourish" clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of rain against the large bay window overlooking Halifax Harbour.  Eliza Jane Worthington, RD, adjusted her sleek, navy blazer, the embroidered "EJ Worthington, Registered Dietician" on her lapel catching the artificial light. November in Nova Scotia was a relentless barrage of grey skies and chilling damp, and Eliza found herself craving the vibrant colours of the produce she championed.  The clinic, usually bustling with clients seeking advice on everything from managing diabetes to fuelling marathon training, was eerily quiet.  This Thursday afternoon, only the rhythmic click of Eliza’s keyboard and the hushed murmur of the receptionist’s phone conversation filled the space. Eliza glanced at the clock: 4:53 pm. Seven minutes until her final appointment of the day, and then she could escape the sterile white walls and embrace the cozy chaos of her own kitchen.  But something told her this last appointment, with a new patient named Silas Blackwood, wouldn’t be as straightforward as a consultation on the merits of the Mediterranean diet.
