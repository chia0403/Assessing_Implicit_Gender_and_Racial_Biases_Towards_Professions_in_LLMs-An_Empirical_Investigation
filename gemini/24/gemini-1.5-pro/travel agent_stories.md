The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on a stack of brochures for all-inclusive Jamaican getaways, seemed to mock Amelia Grace Hawthorne.  Rain lashed against the window of her tiny travel agency, "Across the Pond Travel," mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The aroma of stale instant coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, lingering scent of coconut sunscreen â€“ a cruel reminder of the exotic locales she booked for others but rarely experienced herself. Greystone, Ohio, population 8,422, was a town where dreams went to retire, and Amelia, at the ripe old age of twenty-seven, felt like she was already joining them.  Outside, the neon sign of the "Greystone Diner" flickered intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked Main Street.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in November, the kind of day that made even the most vibrant travel posters look bleak.
