The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he trudged across the frost-covered cobblestones of Barrowhead Lane. His breath plumed out in ghostly puffs, momentarily obscuring the wrought-iron sign that swung above the weathered brick building: "Thorne Veterinary Clinic & Animal Sanctuary."  Barrowhead, a secluded village nestled deep within the Derbyshire Dales, was usually picturesque, a postcard of rolling hills and babbling brooks. But tonight, under the bruised, twilight sky and the threat of snow, it felt isolated, almost ominous.  The only sound besides the wind's mournful howl was the faint bleating of a lamb emanating from the barn behind the clinic. Elias quickened his pace, his shoulders hunched against the cold, a gnawing unease settling in his stomach.  It had been a strangely quiet day, too quiet.  And in Barrowhead, quiet rarely meant good.
