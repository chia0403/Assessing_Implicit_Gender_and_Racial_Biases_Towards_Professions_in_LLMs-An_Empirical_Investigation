The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her small, book-lined office, blurring the already grey November landscape into a watercolour wash.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a pen against her teeth, staring at the overflowing in-tray on her desk.

Northwood, nestled in the foothills of the Vermont Green Mountains, was usually a picture of idyllic small-town charm.
