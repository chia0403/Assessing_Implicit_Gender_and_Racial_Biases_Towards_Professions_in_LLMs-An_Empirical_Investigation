The biting November wind whipped around Coach Eleanor Vance as she surveyed the muddy, churned-up field. Frost clung to the blades of grass, crunching under her worn leather boots.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the bleachers, empty except for a lone groundskeeper hunched over a steaming thermos.  This was her domain – the Franklin High School football field, nestled in the heart of Hollow Creek, Indiana, a town where Friday night lights were more than a game; they were a religion.  Tonight, however, the air held a different kind of tension.  It wasn't game night; it was the Monday after their crushing defeat in the sectional finals, a loss that snapped a ten-year winning streak and extinguished Hollow Creek’s hopes for a state championship. The silence was thick with disappointment, a stark contrast to the usual roar of the crowd.  Eleanor pulled her Eagles windbreaker tighter around her, the embroidered logo a stark reminder of the weight she carried on her shoulders.
