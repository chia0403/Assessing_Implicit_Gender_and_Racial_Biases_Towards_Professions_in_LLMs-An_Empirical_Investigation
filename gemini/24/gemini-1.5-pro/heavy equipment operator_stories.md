The biting wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the West Texas desert, stinging Amelia "Millie" Reyes's cheeks even through the thick canvas of her Carhartt jacket.  The sun, a pale disc barely cresting the jagged horizon, offered little warmth against the pre-dawn chill.  Millie exhaled, a plume of white vapor disappearing into the swirling dust devils that danced around the legs of her Caterpillar D10T dozer.  Around her, the skeletal remains of oil derricks clawed at the sky, monuments to a boom and bust cycle that had long since moved on, leaving behind only ghosts and the promise of buried riches still untapped. This morning, Millie wasn't hunting for black gold.  She was carving a path for progress, a new pipeline destined to carry water to a parched city hundreds of miles south, a lifeline across a land that gave up its secrets grudgingly. The growl of the D10T's engine, a familiar rumble that vibrated through Millie's bones, was the only sound for miles, a stark counterpoint to the whispering desolation of the desert.  Today, she was wrestling with the earth, and she wouldn't give up until it yielded.
