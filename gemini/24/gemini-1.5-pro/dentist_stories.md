The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled lane, his black overcoat billowing behind him like a ravenâ€™s wing.  Gas lamps flickered weakly, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the slick, rain-washed stones of Port Blossom, Maine.  The salty tang of the sea hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that usually brought Elias a sense of calm.  Tonight, however, it only served to amplify the gnawing unease in his stomach.  Port Blossom, typically a picturesque haven of brightly painted clapboard houses and cheerful fishermen mending their nets, was shrouded in an almost palpable sense of dread.  The usual evening bustle was absent, replaced by a hushed stillness broken only by the mournful cry of gulls overhead and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore.  Elias clutched his leather satchel tighter, the instruments within clinking softly, a metallic counterpoint to the ominous silence. He had a late-night appointment, one he couldn't postpone, and the darkened windows of the houses he passed seemed to watch him with a silent, knowing gaze.
