The whir of the stand mixer was a comforting lullaby to Eliza Jane Worthington.  Her bakery, "Sugar & Spice," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on Magnolia Street in the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was her sanctuary.  The scent of vanilla bean and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, a sweet, warm hug against the persistent drizzle that tapped a melancholy rhythm against the large front window.  This morning, however, the usual tranquility was punctuated by an insistent buzzing from Eliza Jane's phone, lying face down amidst a scattering of sugar roses and fondant leaves.  It was 6:00 am, two hours before opening, and usually the only sound at this hour was the rhythmic whoosh of the ocean a few blocks away.  Something was definitely up.
