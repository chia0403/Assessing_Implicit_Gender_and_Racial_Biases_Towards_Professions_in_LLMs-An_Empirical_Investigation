The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the frost-covered quad of Ashwood Preparatory Academy.  Gargoyles perched on the gothic revival buildings seemed to leer down at her, their stone faces mirroring the grim set of her own. Dead leaves skittered across the flagstones, chased by the same gusts that tugged at the edges of Eleanor’s charcoal grey coat. Ashwood, nestled deep in the Connecticut woods, was a place of hushed privilege and old money, a world of manicured lawns and whispered secrets.  This morning, however, the usual serene façade was cracked. A police cruiser, lights flashing silently, sat parked outside the headmaster’s office, casting an unsettling blue glow across the ivy-covered walls.  Eleanor’s phone buzzed in her pocket.  It was the headmaster himself, his voice tight with barely suppressed panic.  “Eleanor, you need to get here immediately. It's… it's about Henry Croft.”
