The chipped paint on the sunflower mural in the Busy Bees classroom seemed to mock Amelia Rose Hawthorne.  Another Monday morning, another symphony of wails and runny noses. Sunshine, deceptively bright for October, streamed through the grimy windows of Happy Hearts Daycare, illuminating the swirling chaos within.  Plastic dinosaurs littered the worn carpet, a half-eaten banana lay squashed beneath a miniature table, and a lone, glittery sock clung precariously to the ceiling fan.  Amelia sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear and pasting on a smile that felt brittle even to her.  Today, like every day, she would navigate this miniature world of tantrums, sticky fingers, and the occasional triumphant declaration of potty training success.  Happy Hearts wasn't exactly the stepping stone to her dream of working with endangered sea turtles, but rent in the seaside town of Seabrook was unforgiving, and student loans were even less so.
