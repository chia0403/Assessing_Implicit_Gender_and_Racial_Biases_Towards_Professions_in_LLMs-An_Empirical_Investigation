The biting wind whipped off the Lake Michigan and down Clark Street, rattling the "Open" sign that hung precariously from the faded awning of Al's Barber Shop. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of talcum powder and bay rum, a comforting contrast to the February chill.  Elias "Al" Caponegro, a man whose name was far grander than his establishment, stood staring out the window, his hands tucked deep into the pockets of his starched white barber's coat.  The shop, a narrow sliver of a space wedged between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Polish bakery, had seen better days.  The linoleum floor was worn, revealing glimpses of the original hardwood beneath, and the once-vibrant red leather chairs were cracked and faded.  But it was Al's, and for forty-two years, it had been his sanctuary, his stage, and his confessional.  This Tuesday morning, however, the usual hum of clippers and easy banter was absent.  The only sound was the mournful wail of the wind, a sound that mirrored the unease churning in Al's gut.
