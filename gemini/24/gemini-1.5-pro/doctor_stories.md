The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery.  Salt spray clung to the glass, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  The surgery, nestled between a fishmonger's overflowing with the day's catch and a perpetually gloomy pub called The Mariner's Rest, was the only splash of colour on Grimhaven's otherwise grey high street.  Inside, a single lamp illuminated the waiting room, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames of the coal fire in the grate.  Elias, his stethoscope still warm from his last patient, rubbed his tired eyes and glanced at the clock.  5:58 pm.  Two minutes until he could officially close up shop and retreat to the relative warmth of his cottage overlooking the churning grey expanse that both sustained and menaced the small fishing village.
