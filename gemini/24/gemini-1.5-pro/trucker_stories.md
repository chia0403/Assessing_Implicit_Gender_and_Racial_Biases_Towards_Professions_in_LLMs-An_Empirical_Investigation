The Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, swirling tumbleweeds like ghostly ballerinas.  Inside the cab of his Peterbilt 389, Elias "Easy" Vance wrestled with a lukewarm bottle of Mountain Dew, the sticky sweetness doing little to quench his thirst.  The air conditioning unit, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy" by Easy, was wheezing its last breaths, adding a rhythmic groan to the low rumble of the engine.  Easy, his weathered face framed by greasy, salt-and-pepper curls, squinted at the endless stretch of road ahead. He was hauling a double-decker trailer full of frozen pizzas from Sacramento to St. Louis, a long, lonely haul that cut straight through the heart of the desolate Nevada desert.  The digital clock on the dash blinked 1:17 PM, reminding him that he was still a long way from his next scheduled stop in Ely, and even further from the steaming plate of chicken fried steak he'd been dreaming about since Reno.
