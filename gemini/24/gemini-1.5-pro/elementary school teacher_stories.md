The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill outside her classroom, jolted Amelia Grace Hawthorne from her grading stupor.  Rain streaked down the pane, blurring the already fading October light into a melancholy grey.  Inside Room 2B of Maplewood Elementary, the air hung thick with the lingering scent of construction paper paste and the faint ghost of peanut butter sandwiches. Desks, still slightly sticky from the afternoon's art project, sat in neat rows, awaiting the boisterous arrival of twenty-two second graders. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  Maplewood, nestled in the heart of the sleepy Vermont town of Willow Creek, was usually a picture of idyllic charm, but today, even the vibrant hues of the fall foliage seemed muted, swallowed by the pervasive drizzle. Something feltâ€¦off.
