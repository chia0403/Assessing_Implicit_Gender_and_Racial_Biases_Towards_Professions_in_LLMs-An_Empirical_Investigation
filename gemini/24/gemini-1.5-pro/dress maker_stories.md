The clatter of horse-drawn carriages against the cobblestones of Rue de la Paix was a constant rhythm in Élise Dubois’s life.  Her atelier, nestled between a perfumerie and a chocolatier, was a haven of calm amidst the Parisian bustle. Sunlight, filtered through the large front windows, illuminated bolts of silk, satin, and lace, casting shimmering rainbows across the polished wooden floor. Élise, her dark hair pulled back in a severe chignon that belied her youthful twenty-five years, meticulously pinned a length of emerald green velvet to a dress form.  The air hummed with the low whir of her treadle sewing machine, a comforting counterpoint to the city’s symphony of sounds.  It was the spring of 1888, a season of promise and renewal, but a shadow lingered over Paris, a whisper of unease that even the vibrant colours of Élise’s creations couldn’t quite dispel.
