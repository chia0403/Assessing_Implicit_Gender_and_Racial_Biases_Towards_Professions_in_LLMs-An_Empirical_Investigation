The salt-laced wind whipped Eleanor Vance's hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Her small cottage, perched precariously on the cliff edge of the tiny Orkney island of Eynhallow, creaked and groaned in protest against the relentless gale. Inside, a peat fire struggled to maintain its warmth against the encroaching chill, casting flickering shadows across the cluttered room.  Manuscripts, overflowing with Eleanor's spidery scrawl, lay scattered across every available surface – the worn wooden table, the threadbare armchair, even piled precariously on the narrow windowsill, threatening to take flight with the next gust.  Eynhallow, a mile long and half a mile wide, was home to only Eleanor, a handful of sheep, and the ghosts of long-dead monks, whose whispers she sometimes swore she could hear above the wind’s howl. It was the perfect place to escape, to write, to be utterly, blissfully alone. Or so she had thought.
