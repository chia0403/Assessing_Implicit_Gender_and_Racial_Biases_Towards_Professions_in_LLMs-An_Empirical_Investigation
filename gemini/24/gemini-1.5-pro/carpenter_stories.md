The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the loose panes of glass in his workshop window.  Salt spray hung in the air, a constant reminder of the sea's proximity to his small, weather-beaten cottage perched on the craggy cliffs of Skara Brae, Orkney. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of sawdust and beeswax, a familiar comfort against the harshness outside. Shavings curled around his worn boots like wood wool as Elias ran a calloused thumb along the smooth curve of a half-finished chair leg. The waning daylight, filtering through the grimy window, cast long shadows across the cluttered workbench, illuminating the array of hand tools – chisels, planes, and mallets – each worn smooth with years of faithful service.  A storm was brewing, both outside and within Elias, a restless energy that only the rhythm of his work could quell.
