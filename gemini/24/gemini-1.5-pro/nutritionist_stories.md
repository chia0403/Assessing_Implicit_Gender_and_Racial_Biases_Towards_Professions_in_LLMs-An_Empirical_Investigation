Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's small office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her.  The quaint, shingle-roofed building, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually closed antique shop in the seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually offered her a sense of calm.  But not today.  The aroma of cinnamon rolls, normally a welcome distraction, only served to amplify her anxiety.  Her usually pristine desk, adorned with a miniature Zen garden and a framed picture of her grinning with a group of pre-schoolers she'd taught healthy eating habits to, was now cluttered with files, each one a testament to the uphill battle she faced.  Port Blossom, with its love for fried clams and lobster rolls, was proving to be a tougher nut to crack than she'd anticipated.
