The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the otherwise silent backdrop of a Sunday afternoon. Elias, a Certified Public Accountant with a penchant for order and a quiet disdain for inclement weather, sat hunched over a mahogany desk cluttered with receipts, invoices, and half-empty coffee cups. His office, nestled in a converted Victorian townhouse on a quiet, tree-lined street in the historic district of Oakhaven, Massachusetts, usually exuded a comforting air of old-world charm. Today, however, the storm raging outside seemed to seep into the very foundations of the building, lending the room an unsettling chill. The only source of light, aside from the occasional flash of lightning, came from a banker's lamp casting a warm glow on the meticulously organized chaos of Elias's workspace. He pushed a stray lock of brown hair from his forehead, sighed, and adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, the faint squeak of the frames punctuating the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  He was close, so close, to unraveling the discrepancy in the Cartwright Corporation’s books, a discrepancy that had been plaguing him for weeks. But something felt…off. Something didn't quite add up.
