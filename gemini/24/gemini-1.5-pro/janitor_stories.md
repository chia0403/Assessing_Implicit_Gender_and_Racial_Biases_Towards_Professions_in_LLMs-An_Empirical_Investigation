The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Bio-Research Building hummed a lonely tune, reflecting off the polished linoleum floors.  It was 3:17 am, and Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his cleaning cart down the deserted hallway.  Outside, a relentless Seattle drizzle drummed against the panoramic windows, blurring the city lights into a shimmering, impressionistic canvas.  Zenith Bio-Research, a towering glass edifice dedicated to pushing the boundaries of human longevity, was a cathedral of science by day, a hollow, echoing shell by night.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, and a low hum, distinct from the usual electrical thrum of the building, vibrated beneath Elias's worn work boots.
