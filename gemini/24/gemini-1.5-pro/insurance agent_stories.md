The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, rainbow sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleaker Street.  Inside, condensation dripped from the windowpanes, blurring the view of the empty booths and the lone, hunched figure nursing a lukewarm coffee.  This was Elias Thorneâ€™s usual Tuesday night haunt. Not by choice, mind you.  Elias, full name Elias Percival Thorne, wasn't much of a diner man. He preferred the hushed elegance of the members-only club downtown, the kind with leather armchairs and single malt scotch served in crystal tumblers. But Bleaker Street was where the leads were, the kind of desperate, down-on-their-luck souls who needed what Elias sold:  a sliver of hope, thinly veiled as an insurance policy. Tonight, however, even hope seemed to be rationing itself.  The rain hammered against the window, mirroring the relentless drumming in Elias's head, a persistent reminder of the case that had been haunting him for weeks, the one that refused to fit neatly into the columns of his actuarial tables.
