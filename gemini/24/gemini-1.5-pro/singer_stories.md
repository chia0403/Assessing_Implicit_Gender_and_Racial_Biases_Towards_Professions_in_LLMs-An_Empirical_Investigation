Tonight, after years of singing in smoky backrooms and dimly lit pubs, Amelia was making her debut on a stage worthy of her dreams.  Outside, a winter storm raged, coating the streets of 1940s Chicago in a thick blanket of snow, but inside the Grand Majestic, a different kind of storm was brewing - a tempest of melody waiting to be unleashed.
