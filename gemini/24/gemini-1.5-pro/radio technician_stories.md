The generator, responsible for powering the island's vital radio beacon, sputtered erratically, its rhythmic chugging interspersed with ominous clicks and wheezes. Amy, her toolbox clanking at her side, squinted at the tangle of wires and dials, a frown creasing her brow.  This wasn't just a routine maintenance check. This was going to be a long night.
