The wail of the siren was a lullaby to Amelia “Amy” Rios.  It blended with the rhythmic thump of the windshield wipers battling the relentless Seattle downpour, a percussive accompaniment to the flashing crimson and gold lights slicing through the pre-dawn gloom. Inside the speeding Medic One unit, the air crackled with anticipation.  Amy, a seasoned Emergency Medical Technician with a decade of experience etched onto her face, gripped the metal bar above her head as they navigated the slick, treacherous curves of Aurora Avenue North.  The dispatcher’s voice, tinny and urgent over the radio, painted a grim picture: multi-vehicle collision, possible entrapment, unknown injuries.  Amy’s heart hammered against her ribs, not with fear, but with a familiar surge of adrenaline. The rain-slicked asphalt reflected the city lights, turning the world outside into a shimmering, distorted kaleidoscope.  The towering Space Needle, usually a beacon of hope, seemed to pierce the oppressive gray sky with a silent, anxious watch.  This was Seattle at its most unforgiving, and Amy Rios was about to face it head-on.
