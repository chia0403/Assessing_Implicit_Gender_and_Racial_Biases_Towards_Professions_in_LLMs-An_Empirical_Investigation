Rain lashed against the attic window of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's tiny Edinburgh flat, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Loose papers, victims of a recent and frantic search, swirled across the worn wooden floor like fallen autumn leaves.  Outside, the wind howled down the narrow wynds of the Old Town, a mournful soundtrack to Amelia's predicament.  The deadline for the "Definitive Guide to Scottish Folklore," a project two years in the making, loomed like a guillotine.  The problem wasn't a lack of material â€“ Amelia, as a meticulous editor with a passion bordering on obsession, had amassed enough stories, legends, and whispered myths to fill a library. No, the problem was the MacRieve chapter. It was blank.  Utterly, terrifyingly blank.  The MacRieves, a notoriously secretive clan with roots stretching back to the mists of Scottish prehistory, had proved immune to Amelia's charms, her persistent letters, her even more persistent phone calls. They remained silent, their history shrouded in a veil of whispers and rumour. And without the MacRieves, her definitive guide was anything but.
