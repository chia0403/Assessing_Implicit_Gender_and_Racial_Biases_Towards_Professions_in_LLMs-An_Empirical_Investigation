The chipped Formica tabletop, sticky with spilled syrup and the ghosts of a thousand coffee rings, reflected the flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner.  Rain lashed against the large plate-glass window, turning the Main Street of Harmony Creek, Indiana, into a shimmering, distorted canvas. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions and cheap coffee.  Eleanor Grace Holloway, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp, but slightly-too-large uniform, sighed and wiped down the counter with a practiced hand.  It was a slow Tuesday night, the kind where the only customers were the regulars: old Mr. Henderson nursing his black coffee and staring out at the downpour, and two teenage girls giggling over milkshakes in the corner booth.  Eleanor glanced at the clock.  10:47 pm.  Almost closing time.  Just another quiet night in a town where nothing much ever happened.  Or so she thought.
