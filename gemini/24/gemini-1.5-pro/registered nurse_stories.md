Fluorescent lights buzzed behind the frosted windows of the Emergency Room entrance, casting an eerie, sickly yellow glow against the pre-dawn gloom.

It was the kind of night that promised trouble, the kind that made the hairs on Amelia’s arms prickle with a nameless unease.  Tonight, she could almost taste the metallic tang of approaching snow in the air. And she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that tonight would be anything but ordinary.
