The rusted tailpipe of Mrs. Higgins' '78 Ford Pinto coughed a plume of grey smoke into the already hazy Detroit dawn.  Frost crunched under Beatrice "Bea" Kowalski's steel-toed boots as she trudged across the woman's overgrown lawn, a toolbox the size of a small dog clinking in her other hand.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust and something vaguely floral, hung heavy despite the biting November wind.  Bea, her breath fogging in front of her, adjusted the brim of her worn Detroit Tigers cap and peered up at the two-story Victorian house, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  The leaky faucet Mrs. Higgins had called about three days ago (and had probably been dripping for three months before that) was just the start of what Bea suspected would be a long and arduous morning.  This house, like so many others in this neglected corner of the Motor City, whispered stories of better days and harbored a network of plumbing as tangled and temperamental as the city's history.
