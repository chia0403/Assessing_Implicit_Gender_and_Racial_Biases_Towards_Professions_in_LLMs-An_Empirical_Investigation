The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks as he unlocked the door to his clinic. Thorne Physical Therapy, the neat, hand-painted sign proclaimed above the frosted glass.  Nestled between a bustling bakery and a stubbornly independent bookstore on Maple Street, the clinic was Elias's sanctuary, a haven of healing in the heart of the small, sleepy town of Havenwood, Vermont. Inside, the warm glow of the waiting room lamps cast long shadows across the worn, but comfortable, armchairs. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the lingering aroma of Elias's morning coffee, creating a strangely comforting atmosphere. He switched on the radio, a mellow jazz station his patients seemed to enjoy, and began the familiar ritual of preparing for the day.  His first appointment, a Mrs. Peterson with a persistent rotator cuff injury, was due in just fifteen minutes. Outside, the wind rustled the leaves in the ancient maple tree that gave the street its name, a gentle prelude to the flurry of activity Elias knew the day would bring.
