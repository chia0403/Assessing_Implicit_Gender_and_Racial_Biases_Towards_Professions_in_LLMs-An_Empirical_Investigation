This year, the cracks seemed deeper, the hum of the lights more insistent, and the apathy radiating from his students more pronounced.  This year, something feltâ€¦off.  He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but a sense of unease, like a low-frequency vibration, thrummed beneath the surface of Ashwood's placid facade.
