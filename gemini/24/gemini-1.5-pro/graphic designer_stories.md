The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's fiery red hair across her face as she hurried along Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts battling with the ever-present aroma of exhaust fumes.  Neon signs flickered to life in the twilight, casting a kaleidoscope of colours across the slick, rain-washed pavement.  Amy clutched her portfolio case tighter, its worn leather a comforting weight against her leg.  Above her, the windows of her tiny, rent-controlled apartment glowed a welcoming yellow, a beacon in the sprawling, frenetic heart of Greenwich Village. Tonight, Amy was late.  Not just fashionably late, but disastrously, potentially-career-endingly late.  The meeting with Julian Thorne, the notoriously demanding art director of Luxe Magazine, was scheduled for precisely 6:00 pm, and her vintage, stubbornly unreliable wristwatch currently screamed 5:58.  And Julian Thorne, Amy knew, didn't tolerate tardiness. Especially not from aspiring, albeit exceptionally talented, graphic designers.
