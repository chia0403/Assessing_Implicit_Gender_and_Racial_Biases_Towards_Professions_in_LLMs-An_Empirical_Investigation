The biting November wind whipped through the narrow streets of Port Blossom, Maine, carrying the scent of salt and decaying seaweed.  Inside the cozy, clapboard walls of the Seabrook Family Clinic, however, the air was thick with the aroma of antiseptic and brewing coffee.  Amelia Hayes, PA-C, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck and sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.  The clock on the wall read 5:45 am â€“ a ridiculously early hour for a Tuesday, even by small-town standards.  But a fishing boat had capsized just off the coast, and Amelia, along with Dr. Ellsworth, the town's only physician, were on standby for what promised to be a long and arduous day.  The rhythmic clang of the radiator filled the otherwise silent clinic, a metallic heartbeat in the pre-dawn stillness.
