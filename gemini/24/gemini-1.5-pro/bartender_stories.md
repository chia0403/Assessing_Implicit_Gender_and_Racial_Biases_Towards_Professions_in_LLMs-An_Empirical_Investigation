The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a sound that usually soothed Elias Thorne. Tonight, however, it felt like an angry drummer keeping time with the throbbing ache in his temple.  The Mug, nestled between a pawn shop and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the damp, cobbled alley known as Grimstone Lane, was Elias's domain.  He'd inherited it from his grandfather, a man of few words and fewer smiles, and had spent the last ten years turning it from a dimly lit den of iniquity into a respectable, if still somewhat shadowy, establishment.  The air, thick with the aroma of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and regret, was usually punctuated by the murmur of low conversations and the clinking of glasses.  Tonight, though, a tense silence hung heavy, broken only by the relentless downpour and the occasional nervous cough. Elias, wiping down the sticky mahogany bar top with a practiced hand, felt the weight of the silence pressing down on him like the storm clouds gathering over the crumbling rooftops of Port Blossom.  Something was brewing, and it wasn't just the coffee.
