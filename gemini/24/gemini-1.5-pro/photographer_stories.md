The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she leaned precariously over the railing of the ferry, her Canon EOS R5 clutched tight in her hand. The churning wake of the *MV Osprey* sliced through the inky pre-dawn waters of the Puget Sound, leaving a phosphorescent trail like a whispered secret in the darkness.  Amelia, bundled in a thick, grey fisherman's sweater against the biting November chill, ignored the rumble in her stomach and the gnawing anxiety that always preceded a new assignment.  She was headed to Orcas Island, the largest of the San Juan Islands, a place rumored to be both breathtakingly beautiful and unnervingly isolated. Her mission: to capture the essence of island life for a prestigious travel magazine â€“ a task that felt both exhilarating and daunting, especially given the island's reputation for fiercely protective locals and unpredictable weather.  The sky, a bruised canvas of deep purples and gunmetal grey, hinted at the latter. As the jagged silhouette of Mount Constitution, the island's highest peak, began to emerge from the gloom, Amelia raised her camera, her fingers already dancing over the familiar controls. This was it. Her chance to prove, once and for all, that she could capture the soul of a place, not just its pretty face.
