The biting wind whipped Amelia Cavendish's auburn hair across her face as she squinted at the swirling mist clinging to the jagged peaks of the Matterhorn.  Below, the village of Zermatt, nestled in the emerald valley, seemed almost lost in the grey shroud.  This was the "Valley of Whispers," a name she'd grown to loathe, given its tendency to shroud secrets and amplify anxieties.  Today, it was amplifying Amelia's own.  The scheduled "Alpine Mysteries" tour, her signature excursion, was now twenty minutes behind schedule, and the group of twelve tourists, a mix of seasoned hikers and nervous first-timers, were already murmuring their concerns.  Amelia, impeccably dressed in her waterproof hiking jacket and sturdy boots, took a deep breath, trying to calm the tremor in her hands.  This tour, this particular section of the Swiss Alps, felt unusually charged.  The air itself vibrated with a silent expectancy, almost palpable.  Each breath seemed to whisper a question, a tremor of unease that echoed in the valley itself.
