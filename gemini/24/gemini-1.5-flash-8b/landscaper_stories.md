Amelia, a landscaper with hands calloused from years of wrestling with unruly hedges and coaxing vibrant blooms from stubborn soil, adjusted her worn leather gloves. Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece of slate and stone, loomed before her, its many windows like dark eyes watching her every move.  She'd been tending to the overgrown rose garden for three hours now, the delicate thorns scratching her skin, the relentless wind threatening to tear at her makeshift barricade of burlap and wire.  This job was a special one, a legacy commission â€“ the Manor needed a new autumnal display, a fitting tribute to the recently departed Lord Blackwood.  This particular task, however, felt different, heavier.  A prickle of unease, uncharacteristic of the usually practical Amelia, ran down her spine.  Something, she knew, was not quite right.
