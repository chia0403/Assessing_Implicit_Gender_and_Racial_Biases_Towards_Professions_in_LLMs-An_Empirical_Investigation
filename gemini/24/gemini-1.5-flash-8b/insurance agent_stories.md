The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Blue Heron" diner, a rhythmic tattoo that echoed the frantic beat of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The greasy spoon, tucked away on a forgotten side street in the sprawling metropolis of Veridian, was, surprisingly, not full.  This was unusual for a Wednesday night, a night usually overflowing with the aroma of sizzling bacon and the murmur of late-shift workers.  Amelia, perched precariously on a stool beside a half-eaten plate of biscuits, stared out the grimy window, watching the deluge turn the already slick cobblestones into shimmering rivers.  Tonight, however, it wasn't the rain that worried her. It was the silence.  The eerie stillness that had descended upon the normally bustling diner, a silence heavier than the thick gravy clinging to the sides of her untouched plate.  Amelia, an insurance agent with the unassuming name of "Assured" Insurance, was on the verge of losing a client, a valuable client, a client who just happened to own the only vintage record store Veridian had left.  And tonight, she felt like the rain was trying to wash away not just the grime, but her career, too.
