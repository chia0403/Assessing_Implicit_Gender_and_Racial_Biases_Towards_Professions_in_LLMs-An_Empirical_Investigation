The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, a smell that Dr. Anya Petrova, registered dietitian and certified sports nutritionist, found disturbingly familiar.  She squinted, the afternoon sun glinting off the tiled rooftops of the ancient alleyway.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of foot traffic, radiated the heat.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the narrow passageway.  This was the heart of the bustling, vibrant, and utterly chaotic city of Zaria, a place where the rhythms of modern life pulsed alongside the slow, steady beat of centuries-old traditions.  Anya, with her meticulously planned schedule and precise meal plans, felt utterly disoriented.

This particular assignment, a food systems consultation in Zaria, had already challenged her meticulously organised mind.  The task, while noble in its goal – to assess local food security and promote healthy eating habits amidst the region’s rapidly changing climate – was far more complex than any theoretical model she had ever encountered.
