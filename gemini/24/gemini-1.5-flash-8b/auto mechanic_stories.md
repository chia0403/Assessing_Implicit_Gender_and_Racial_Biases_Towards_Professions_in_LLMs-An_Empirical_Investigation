The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty's Wrench & Wheel," clinging to the worn-out workbench, the chipped paint of the engine block, and the sweat beading on Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's brow.  The clang of a hammer against metal, the hiss of escaping compressed air, and the rhythmic whir of a stubborn starter motor filled the small, cluttered shop.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the gloom settling over the industrial district of Oakhaven.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, each drop a tiny percussionist in the symphony of the workshop.

Barty, a man whose face bore the unmistakable imprint of countless hours wrestling with the internal workings of machines, was hunched over a sputtering Ford pickup truck. Its engine coughed and sputtered like a dying man.  Barty, his fingers stained a deep, perpetual brown, felt the familiar sting of frustration.  This truck, a relic of a bygone era,  refused to cooperate.  It was a classic, a 1978 Ford Ranger, its owner a cantankerous old man named Silas, known for his legendary stubbornness.  Barty, despite his distaste for the particular challenge, felt a strange kinship with the truck.  Both were, in their own ways, relics of a simpler time.
