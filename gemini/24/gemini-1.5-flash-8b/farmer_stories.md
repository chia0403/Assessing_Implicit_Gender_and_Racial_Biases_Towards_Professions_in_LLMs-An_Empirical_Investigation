The biting wind whipped across the parched fields of the  Dustbowl, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the skeletal branches of the gnarled oak that marked the edge of his property.  Dust, the colour of burnt sienna, coated everything.  His weathered hands, calloused from years of tilling the unforgiving earth, tightened around the worn leather reins of his mule, Bess.  Elias, a man carved from the same stubborn sandstone that dotted the horizon, felt a familiar knot of despair tighten in his chest.  Another year, another harvest lost to the unrelenting drought.  This year, even the meagre corn stalks bowed their heads in surrender, their once vibrant green now a sickly yellow.  The sun beat down mercilessly, a relentless judge on this barren land.  Beyond his small, ramshackle farmhouse, the horizon stretched out into an endless expanse of desolation, a canvas painted in shades of grey and ochre.  The silence, broken only by the mournful creak of the wind through the withered grass, felt heavy, oppressive.
