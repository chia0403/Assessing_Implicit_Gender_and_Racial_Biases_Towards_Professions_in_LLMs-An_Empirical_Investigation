The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Solutions" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Carter's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the pristine, if slightly too-polished, mahogany desk.  A half-eaten granola bar lay abandoned beside a stack of architectural blueprints, their intricate lines mocking the mundane reality of her afternoon.  Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and a slightly too-perfect bob, tapped a pen against the surface.  Outside, the city – a cacophony of sirens and distant car horns – pressed against the polished glass of the high-rise, a stark contrast to the quiet, sterile environment within.  Today, however, was different. The quiet hum of the office was punctuated by a low, almost imperceptible, thrumming emanating from the far end of the sprawling open-plan office.  It was a sound Amy, with her years spent behind the reception desk, recognised. A sound that belonged to something... *different*.  A sound that whispered of secrets and mysteries lurking just beneath the surface of the otherwise predictable day. The thrumming grew stronger, accompanied by a faint, almost imperceptible, rhythmic *clicking*.  Amy’s breath hitched.  This wasn't just another day at Apex.
