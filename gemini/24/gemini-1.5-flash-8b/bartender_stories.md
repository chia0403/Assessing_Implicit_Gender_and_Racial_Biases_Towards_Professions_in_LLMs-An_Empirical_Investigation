The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "May" Blackwood, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air above her.  The bar, a cramped space crammed with worn booths and mismatched tables, smelled of stale beer, burnt sugar, and something faintly floral, like a wilting bouquet left too long in a forgotten corner.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that echoed the pounding headache thrumming in May's temples.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was a symphony of low murmurs, the clinking of glasses, and the distant rumble of a storm. May, a woman built of quiet strength and shadowed corners, expertly poured a whiskey neat, the amber liquid reflecting the strained light.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her small kingdom. For May, the Rusty Mug wasn't just a bar; it was a mirror, reflecting the city's hidden sorrows and whispered secrets, one drink at a time.
