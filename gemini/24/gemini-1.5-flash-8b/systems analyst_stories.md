The fluorescent hum of the server room was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  For Elias Thorne, Systems Analyst at GlobalCorp, the rhythmic whir of the cooling fans, the soft hiss of the hard drives, and the constant low-level glow of the monitor arrays were more comforting than any human voice.  He'd spent the last five years immersed in the digital heart of GlobalCorp, a sprawling corporation that seemed to breathe and pulse in the intricate dance of its networked systems.  His office, a small, sterile cubicle nestled amongst a forest of identical workstations, was his sanctuary, a place where the chaos of the outside world faded to a muted whisper.  Outside the steel-and-glass behemoth of GlobalCorp headquarters, the city of Neo-Veridia thrummed with life, a cacophony of honking cars, chattering pedestrians, and the siren song of the always-on digital advertising. But Elias, lost in the binary code and the ever-shifting algorithms, rarely ventured beyond the controlled environment of his workstation.  Today, however, a flicker of something akin to unease touched the periphery of his calm.  A strange error message, recurring with unsettling regularity, had begun to appear on the GlobalCorp intranet, a message that didn't quite fit the known parameters of the system.  It was a subtle deviation, a tiny crack in the perfectly functioning facade, but it was enough to push Elias from his familiar rhythm. The error message, a cryptic sequence of numbers and symbols, was humming a different tune in the symphony of the system, and Elias, ever the systems analyst, felt compelled to investigate.
