The biting wind, a tangible entity, whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees lining the desolate, grey expanse of the Forgotten Fields.  Dust devils, swirling eddies of grit and despair, danced across the cracked earth.  This wasn't the sun-drenched landscape of the Valley of Roses theyâ€™d trained for; this was a different kind of hell.  Lieutenant Commander Elias Thorne, his fire-resistant jacket a stark contrast to the monochrome landscape, stared out at the ominous plume of smoke rising from the smoldering ruins of the Blackwood Manor. The manor, once a symbol of grandeur, was now nothing more than a fractured husk, a monument to the relentless fire that had consumed it.

The Forgotten Fields, a vast, forgotten section of the sprawling city of Aethelgard, lay isolated from the bustling city centre.  Years of neglect had transformed fertile farmland into an arid wasteland, its once-vibrant colours bleached to a palette of muted greys and browns.  Sparse, stunted vegetation clung to the parched earth, offering little respite from the harsh sun or the relentless wind.  Elias, a seasoned fire fighter with years of experience battling blazes in the heart of Aethelgard, felt a chilling dread creep into his bones.  This fire was different. It burned with an unnatural intensity, a malevolent heart in the heart of the desolate manor. The reports spoke of strange noises, unnatural crackling, and an almost palpable sense of... presence.  Elias pressed his lips together, his gaze unwavering. This wasn't just a fire.  It was a mystery, and he was the one who had to solve it.
