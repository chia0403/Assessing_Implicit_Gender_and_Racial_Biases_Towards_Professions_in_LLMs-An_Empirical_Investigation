The biting wind whipped at the corrugated iron walls of the abandoned warehouse, rattling the dusty windows like skeletal fingers.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the corrugated metal, blurring the already dim interior into an oily, monochrome wash.  Inside, bathed in the flickering light of a single bare bulb hanging precariously from a rusted wire, sat Isolde "Izzy" Blackwood.  Izzy Blackwood, a woman whose face, etched with the relentless pressure of a thousand cinematic dreams and sleepless nights, was framed by the wild, unruly strands of her dark hair.  Forty-five years old, and looking twenty years older in the harsh fluorescent light of her makeshift film studio.

The setting was the forgotten heart of an industrial town,  Rustport, a place where the echoes of forgotten factories still whispered through empty streets and crumbling plazas.  Derelict buildings lined the perpetually overcast sky, their skeletal frames clawing at a perpetually grey sky.  Izzy had found the warehouse on a whim, lured by the promise of raw, unfiltered atmosphere. It was cheap, practically free, with a derelict set of machinery and a huge, empty space â€“ all perfect for her next project.  The city, steeped in the lingering scent of rust and damp earth, felt like the perfect canvas for the story she was about to paint.
