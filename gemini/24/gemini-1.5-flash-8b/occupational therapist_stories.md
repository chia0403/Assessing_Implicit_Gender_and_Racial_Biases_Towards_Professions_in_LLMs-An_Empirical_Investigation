The biting London wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks despite the thick wool.  Grey skies, perpetually draped over the city like a damp shroud, mirrored the mood settling over her.  October had arrived with a vengeance, and with it, a new patient, a young man named Leo, whose fractured life felt as brittle and fragile as the autumn leaves skittering across the cobblestones.

Amelia, Occupational Therapist at St. Jude's Rehabilitation Centre, surveyed the overflowing overflowing courtyard.  The chipped paint of the Victorian building, once vibrant, now resembled the muted palette of a faded watercolour.  The rhythmic clang of metal on metal from the workshop, a constant in the centreâ€™s bustling atmosphere, served as a soundtrack to her thoughts, a melancholic symphony accompanying the weight of her own anxieties.  She carried her worn leather satchel, a familiar companion on the countless journeys through her patient's lives. Inside, the usual assortment of brightly colored therapy aids, meticulously chosen for their potential to spark hope and re-ignite function, lay quietly awaiting their purpose.  Today, however, Amelia felt less hopeful and more apprehensive than usual.  Leo's case seemed particularly challenging, shrouded in a mystery that hinted at a darkness beyond the pale walls of the rehabilitation center.
