Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Anya Petrova's small, cluttered office, a rhythmic percussion that mirrored the frantic beating of her own heart.  The flickering fluorescent light cast long, dancing shadows across the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the scattered papers and half-filled coffee cups that littered her desk.  Anya, a counseling psychologist with a practiced calm demeanor usually reserved for navigating the turbulent waters of her clients' lives, felt utterly adrift.  The tempest wasn't external; it raged within her.

The setting was a modest, suburban practice nestled within a quiet strip mall on the outskirts of a sprawling city.  Empty parking lots and the faint hum of traffic suggested a quiet Monday morning, a stark contrast to the maelstrom churning in Anya's mind.  The office itself felt cramped, despite its size.  It was a space carefully curated to offer comfort and a safe haven, but today, the familiar scent of lavender and chamomile tea felt as alien as a foreign language.  Everything felt wrong.  Something was deeply amiss, yet she couldn't quite place it.  The rain, a relentless grey curtain against the pale morning sky, seemed to mirror the heavy fog of anxiety clouding her thoughts.
