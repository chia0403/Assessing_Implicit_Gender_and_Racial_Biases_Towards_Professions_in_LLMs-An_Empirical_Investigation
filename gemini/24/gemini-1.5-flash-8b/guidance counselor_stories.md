The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High guidance office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s life.  Paperclips, neatly arranged in a silver-toned tray, seemed to mock her frustration.  Outside, the crisp autumn air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and woodsmoke, was a stark contrast to the sterile beige walls and the perpetually overflowing recycling bins.  Amelia, a guidance counselor with a heart of gold and a soul perpetually yearning for something more, stared at the latest pile of student applications.  Each one a tiny, folded universe, each containing a future yet unwritten, and each, in its own way, a potential heartbreak waiting to happen.


Amelia Blackwood sighed, the sound barely audible above the whirring of the ancient ventilation system.  This was her 12th year at Northwood High, and the relentless cycle of whispered anxieties, worried parents, and the ever-present pressure to help these kids find their paths hadn't dimmed her resolve.  But the weight of it all was starting to feel like a suffocating blanket, a blanket she couldn't seem to shake off.  The small, cluttered office was a microcosm of the larger world she navigated, a place where the seemingly simple act of guiding a student could be an epic journey in itself.
