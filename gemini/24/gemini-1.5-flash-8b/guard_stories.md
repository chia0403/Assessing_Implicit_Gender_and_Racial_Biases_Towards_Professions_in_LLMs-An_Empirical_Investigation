The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's cloak around her, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  The ramparts of Aerilon Citadel, grey and jagged against the bruised twilight sky, offered little respite from the relentless assault of the elements.  Snow, thick and swirling, obscured the already limited view, making the surrounding peaks seem like jagged teeth in a monstrous jaw.  Below, the valley stretched out, a muted canvas of inky blackness punctuated by the occasional flickering light from a distant farmhouse.  Amelia, a seasoned guard of the Citadel, stood sentinel at the northwestern bastion, her breath fogging in the frigid air.  Her leather gauntlets, though thick, offered little warmth against the biting cold.  A chill deeper than the air snaked through her, a feeling that resonated with the unease prickling at the edges of her vigilance. The rhythmic clang of distant wind chimes, normally comforting, felt strangely discordant tonight.
