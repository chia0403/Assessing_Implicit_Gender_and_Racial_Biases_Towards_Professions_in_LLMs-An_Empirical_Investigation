The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's camera bag around her legs, stinging her cheeks and rattling the precious contents within.  Above, the jagged peaks of the Swiss Alps clawed at a bruised, overcast sky.  She shivered, pulling her thick wool scarf tighter around her face.  This was the third day of relentless snowfall, and the famed Matterhorn, usually a majestic silhouette against the azure, was now lost in a swirling, ethereal white.  The ethereal, however, was far from inspiring.  Amelia, renowned for her vibrant, almost luminescent portraits of the natural world, felt a gnawing sense of disappointment.  This harsh weather was stifling her creativity.  She'd come to Zermatt seeking the grandeur she craved, but all she found was the oppressive blankness of a winter wonderland gone wrong.  Each shutter click felt like a wasted breath, the resulting images merely reflecting the relentless gloom.

**Setting:** The picturesque, but currently unforgiving, village of Zermatt, nestled in the Swiss Alps, during a severe winter storm. The Matterhorn, the iconic mountain, was shrouded in a thick blanket of snow.
