The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Carter's instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of countless scraped knees and fractured front teeth, meticulously polished a patient's molars.  Outside, the city thrummed with a symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens.  Inside, the sterile, almost antiseptic, air hung heavy with the faint smell of antiseptic and the almost imperceptible scent of freshly brewed coffee, a constant companion in her workday.

Amelia Carter, a woman of 32 with a practical sense of style – always opting for comfortable trousers over anything too frilly, and reliably choosing a sensible navy blazer over a more flamboyant option – surveyed her patient, a middle-aged man named Mr. Henderson who was meticulously avoiding eye contact.  A faint tremor in his hand as he gripped the armrests of the chair was the only sign of the anxiety she could sense swirling around him like a low-hanging fog.

The small, but perfectly appointed office was tucked away on a bustling side street in the heart of a vibrant, yet often overlooked, neighborhood.  Tall brick buildings lining the street, each with stories etched into their facades by the wear and tear of time, stood in stark contrast to the sleek, modern apartment buildings springing up just beyond.  A small, but vibrant, local flower shop, its windows overflowing with blossoms, was situated across the street.  The aroma of jasmine and lilies mingled with the dentist's office's own peculiar perfume, creating a strangely comforting juxtaposition.
