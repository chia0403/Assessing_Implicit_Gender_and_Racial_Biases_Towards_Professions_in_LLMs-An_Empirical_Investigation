The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded pastel lavender, seemed to sigh with the afternoon sun streaming through the grimy windowpanes.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, reflecting off the scattered blocks and half-finished crayon drawings that littered the floor.  This was the sanctuary, or at least the designated play zone, of the "Little Sproutlings" daycare, a place perpetually teetering on the edge of chaos, a haven for the colourful chaos of three- and four-year-olds.  Inside this faded paradise, Amelia Rose Blackwood, a young woman with eyes that held both the quiet strength of a seasoned caregiver and the unbridled enthusiasm of a child herself, was meticulously cleaning up the aftermath of a particularly energetic water-table session.  Tiny splashes of watercolour dotted the pristine white floor tiles, alongside the predictable remnants of art projects gone awry:  a vibrant green dinosaur tail, a forlorn orange paint-splattered sock, and a bewildering array of half-eaten crackers, mysteriously adorned with glitter.
