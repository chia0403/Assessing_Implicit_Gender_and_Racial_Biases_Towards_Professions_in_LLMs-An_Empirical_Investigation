The fluorescent hum of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," was a constant, almost unbearable, thrumming.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the fifth-floor office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's keyboard.  Amy, a meticulous accountant with a penchant for perfectly organized spreadsheets and even more perfectly brewed Earl Grey, stared at the blinking cursor.  It was 2:17 AM, and the mountain of tax returns, the towering piles of invoices, the labyrinthine spreadsheets—all seemed to mock her with silent, judgmental stares.  The deadline loomed, an ominous black cloud gathering over the cityscape visible through the smudged window.  Her usual Friday night routine—a brisk walk through the park, followed by a quiet dinner and a good book—felt impossibly distant.  Amy was trapped, a cog in the machine of corporate accounting, and tonight, the machine was grinding.


The setting: A bustling, grey metropolis in the Northeastern United States.  The year is 2024.  The office, "Numbers & Nuggets," is a cramped, windowless space within a towering, imposing skyscraper, filled with the sterile, efficient, almost oppressive ambiance of modern corporate America.
