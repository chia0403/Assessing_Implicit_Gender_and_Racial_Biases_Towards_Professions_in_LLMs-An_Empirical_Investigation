The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson jacket around her as she crouched beside the crumpled figure on the pavement.  The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Hour Diner" cast an eerie, sickly yellow glow on the scene, highlighting the slick sheen of rain on the asphalt and the fractured shards of glass scattered around.  This was a Tuesday night, and already the city of Emberbrook, nestled between the jagged peaks of the Whispering Mountains, was threatening to swallow the night whole.  Amelia, a paramedic with the Emberbrook Emergency Response Unit, knew the familiar, chilling rhythm of the mountain city's nights.  Each one held a different kind of darkness, from the shadowed alleys where addicts huddled to the towering heights where climbers disappeared. Tonight, it was a broken leg and a shattered soul, hidden beneath a layer of fatigue and despair.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the faint scent of burnt coffee, hung heavy over the scene.  The diner, usually a beacon of late-night warmth and greasy satisfaction, was tonight nothing more than a backdrop to a nameless tragedy.
