The biting wind, a relentless rasp against Silas Blackwood's cheeks, whipped snow into stinging flakes.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the thick wool offering little solace against the encroaching chill.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and frost, hung heavy over the jagged peaks of the Ironclad Mountains.  Silas, a logger of legendary strength and resilience,  stood on a precarious ledge, the wind threatening to tear him from the granite face.  Below, the yawning chasm of the Raven's Gorge, black as a raven's wing, stretched out into the unforgiving wilderness.  His axe, a familiar weight in his calloused hand, seemed almost mocking in its silent strength.  

This was the heart of the Everglen region, a vast, untamed expanse of towering pines, glacial rivers, and treacherous mountain passes.  For generations, the Blackwood family had carved their existence from the very heart of the forest, felling trees for lumber, hunting for sustenance, and battling the merciless elements.  Silas, now in his late thirties, felt the weight of this legacy, the responsibility to both protect and exploit the land that had shaped him.  His weathered face, etched with the stories of countless storms and unforgiving winters, told of a man who had faced the wilderness and emerged, not unscathed, but hardened.  He was the last of his line; the woods were his kingdom, his sanctuary, his prison.
