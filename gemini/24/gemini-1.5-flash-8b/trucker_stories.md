The rusted sign, barely clinging to the crumbling metal post, proclaimed “Dusty Divide Rest Stop.”  Dust, the color of burnt sienna, coated everything – the cracked asphalt, the skeletal remains of picnic tables, even the chipped paint on the dilapidated outhouse.  The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, howled across the desolate plains of the American southwest, whipping dust devils into swirling eddies that danced around the lone, dilapidated truck stop.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of diesel exhaust and stale coffee.

He chewed on a thumbnail, his brow furrowed in thought, a faint furrow in his brow. Outside, the setting sun painted the sky with hues of bruised purple and fiery orange.
