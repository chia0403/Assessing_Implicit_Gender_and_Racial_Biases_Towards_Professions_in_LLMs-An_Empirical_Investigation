The biting November wind whipped Amelia Graystone's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled her battered, but beloved, vintage Jaguar into the narrow parking space outside "The Aligned Spine."  The scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar symphony of the Seattle autumn, mingled with the metallic tang of exhaust fumes.  Rain, a relentless curtain, threatened to deluge the already slick cobblestone streets of Ballard, reflecting the city lights into a dizzying, watery kaleidoscope.  Amelia, a chiropractor with a practice that had become more a refuge than a business, pushed open the heavy oak door, the sound echoing in the quiet interior.

Inside, the scent of lavender essential oil and freshly brewed coffee hung heavy, a stark contrast to the grey gloom outside.  Warm, amber light filtered through the tall, multi-paned windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Bookshelves overflowing with anatomy texts and holistic health manuals lined the walls, interspersed with framed vintage botanical illustrations.  A crackling fire in the hearth cast dancing shadows on the worn, leather-bound journal nestled beside it.  This was Amelia's sanctuary, a refuge from the relentless demands of modern medicine, a place where she could restore balance not just to bodies, but to souls.
