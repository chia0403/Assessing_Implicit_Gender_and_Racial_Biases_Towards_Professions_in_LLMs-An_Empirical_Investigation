The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, clung to the air, mingling with the faint scent of jasmine from the overflowing planters on Amelia Blackwood's doorstep.  Amelia, a baker with a heart as warm as her hearth oven, hummed a cheerful tune as she swept crumbs from the worn wooden floor of her tiny bakery, "The Golden Crust."  Situated in the heart of the cobbled alleyway, nestled between the towering, brick-faced buildings of Old Oakhaven, the bakery was a beacon of light and fragrant warmth in the otherwise shadowed and somewhat grimy lanes.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting a baker's dozen of golden loaves, dappled the counter and illuminated the intricate patterns carved into the wooden bread boards.  A persistent drizzle, characteristic of the autumnal season, pattered against the corrugated iron roof, adding a rhythmic counterpoint to Amelia's quiet morning routine.
