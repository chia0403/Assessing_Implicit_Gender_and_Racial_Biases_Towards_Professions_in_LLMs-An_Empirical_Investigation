The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale's face as she stepped onto the cracked pavement.  The air, thick with the smells of stale beer and frying onions, clung to her like a damp shroud.  Above, the sprawling cityscape of Neo-Veridia sprawled, a glittering tapestry of skyscrapers and neon-drenched avenues, starkly contrasting with the gritty, forgotten alleyway she now occupied.  Amelia, a singer with a voice like polished jade, adjusted the worn leather strap of her guitar case, the familiar weight a comforting presence in this unfamiliar place. Tonight, the Rusty Mug was her stage, a rough-hewn amphitheater for her melodies.  The rough-edged crowd, a motley collection of weary laborers and shadowy figures, were her audience, their moods as unpredictable as the city lights.  The rhythmic thump of a nearby construction site punctuated the rhythmic murmur of the night, providing a counterpoint to the music that swelled within Amelia.  She was a voice seeking its echo in the concrete jungle, a whispered song in a world of loud pronouncements.
