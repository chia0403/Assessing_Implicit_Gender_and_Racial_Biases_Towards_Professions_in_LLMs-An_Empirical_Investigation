The fluorescent lights of the "Rx All Day" pharmacy hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Cavendish's meticulously organized life.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the neatly stacked vials and bottles lining the shelves.  Amelia, a pharmacist with a name as precise as the measurements she took every morning, felt the familiar pressure of the day pressing down on her.  The scent of antiseptic and old paper hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the faint aroma of chamomile tea she brewed each afternoon, a tiny oasis in the bustling chaos.  She was meticulously labeling a new batch of antibiotic eye drops, her movements precise and unwavering, when the door burst open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadows.

The setting was a small, somewhat rundown pharmacy in the heart of a bustling, yet decaying, industrial district.  Steam rose from the nearby river, mingling with the exhaust fumes from passing trucks.  The neighborhood felt neglected, the brick buildings showing the wear of time and neglect.  The only signs of life beyond the pharmacy’s grimy exterior were the flickering neon signs of the greasy spoon diner across the street and the sporadic rumble of distant construction.  A stark contrast to Amelia’s meticulously ordered world, this was a place where the edges of society blurred and the forgotten often lingered.
