Rain hammered against the corrugated iron of the dilapidated shed, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Elias Thorne's chest.  He hunched lower, the weight of the rusted scaffold pressing against his shoulders, his calloused hands gripping the corroded metal with the strength of a vise.  Below, the town of Oakhaven sprawled out like a patchwork quilt of faded houses and overgrown gardens, a stark contrast to the bruised purple sky above.  The wind, a tangible entity, whipped around him, carrying the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a symphony of natureâ€™s raw power.  Elias, a roofer with the soul of a storm, was perched precariously on the apex of the Blackwood's dilapidated workshop, a forgotten relic of a bygone era nestled on the outskirts of town.  His task: to repair a hole the size of a dinner plate, a seemingly minor breach in the roof that threatened to bring the whole structure crashing down around the family.  But the Blackwood's stubborn refusal to invest in a proper repair, a refusal rooted in a deep-seated fear of change and cost, held a far greater threat than the storm outside.
