Professor Eleanor Vance-Ashworth, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest whisper of forgotten libraries and the scent of old paper, stared out the rain-streaked window of her cramped, but undeniably charming, office at the University of Eldoria.  The gothic architecture of the building, a testament to a bygone era of soaring ambitions and crumbling grandeur, seemed to sigh in harmony with the relentless drumming of the rain against the leaded glass.  Dampness clung to the air, mirroring the persistent weight of a problem that had been brewing in Eleanor's mind for weeks.  Outside, the ancient, moss-covered oak trees whispered secrets to the wind, secrets that, Eleanor suspected, held the key to a centuries-old mystery that threatened to unravel the very fabric of Eldoria's history.  Her research, usually focused on the obscure rituals of the 18th-century, had led her down a rabbit hole, a rabbit hole that plunged deep into the heart of the university's very foundations. And the rain, relentlessly insistent, only seemed to heighten the sense of dread, amplifying the whispers of the wind and the echoes of forgotten things.
