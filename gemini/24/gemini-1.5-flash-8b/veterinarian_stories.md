The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's long, auburn hair across her face as she knelt beside the trembling foal.  Dust devils danced across the cracked, sun-baked earth of the High Meadow pastures, swirling around the skeletal remains of a withered thistle.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and something acrid, something faintly metallic, hung heavy and still.  This wasn't the pristine, verdant valley Amelia was used to; the pastoral idyll of the Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic felt a world away. This was the desolate heart of the Whisperwind Highlands, a region renowned for its harsh beauty and even harsher secrets. Amelia, a veterinarian with gentle hands and a compassionate heart, was far from home, and far from the familiar rhythm of equine hooves on the clinic's gravel drive.  She was in the remote territory of the Whisperwind clan, a nomadic tribe deeply connected to the land and its creatures, and she was here at their request.  The foal, barely a week old, was weak and feverish.  The clan, weathered and stoic, watched her with grave eyes, their faces etched with the stories of the land.  It was a call to duty far beyond the routine vaccinations and spaying procedures Amelia was accustomed to, a call to a place where the line between the natural and the unnatural blurred, where the whispering winds held more than just the secrets of the valley.
