The scent of freshly cut lilies, a potent mix of beeswax and jasmine, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the high windows of Amelia Nightingale's design studio.  Amelia, a whirlwind of a woman with auburn hair the colour of burnt umber and eyes the shade of a stormy sea, paced the room, a crumpled sketchpad clutched in her hand.  The project, a sprawling, four-story Victorian mansion in the heart of the city's up-and-coming district, known as the "Golden Mile", was proving to be a formidable challenge.

The studio itself, tucked away on a quiet cobbled lane behind a bustling marketplace, was a testament to Amelia's personality: eclectic, vibrant, and bursting with life.  Vintage maps adorned the walls, juxtaposed with boldly painted abstract canvases.  Antique furniture, salvaged and repurposed, sat amidst sleek, modern pieces, creating an interplay of styles that reflected the eclectic tastes of her clientele.  A chipped porcelain teacup, overflowing with loose Earl Grey tea leaves, sat on a nearby desk, a familiar companion to the endless cups of tea and the tireless hours Amelia poured into her work.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, casting long shadows across the meticulously organized space, highlighting the careful arrangement of fabrics, swatches, and miniature architectural models.
