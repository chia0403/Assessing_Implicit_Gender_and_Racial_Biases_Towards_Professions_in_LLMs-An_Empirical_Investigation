The flickering neon sign of "Flushing Fitzwilliam" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Water, in a relentless, insistent drizzle, hammered against the corrugated iron walls, a constant, mournful soundtrack to the cityâ€™s nocturnal hum.  Inside the cramped, cluttered shop, Bartholomew "Barty" Fitzwilliam, a man whose pipe-fitting skills were only surpassed by the amount of grease permanently affixed to his overalls, stared into his chipped ceramic mug.  He traced the outline of a faded coffee stain, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic drip-drip-drip emanating from somewhere deep within the labyrinthine plumbing system of the Fitzwilliam Flats above was a familiar, yet frustrating, symphony.  Another call. Another potential plumbing disaster.


The Fitzwilliam Flats, a sprawling, dilapidated tenement built in the early 20th century, stood as a testament to a bygone era of grandeur now slowly decaying.  Its facade, once proud, was now marred by chipped paint, peeling plaster, and overflowing flower boxes spilling their contents onto the narrow sidewalks.  Inside, the apartments, though cramped and dimly lit, held their own peculiar charm.  Each one, however, whispered tales of plumbing woes, echoing down the corridors in the form of leaky faucets, gurgling drains, and the occasional, surprisingly loud, burst of water.  Barty knew this building intimately, every pipe, every drain, every hidden trap.  It was his kingdom, and his nemesis.
