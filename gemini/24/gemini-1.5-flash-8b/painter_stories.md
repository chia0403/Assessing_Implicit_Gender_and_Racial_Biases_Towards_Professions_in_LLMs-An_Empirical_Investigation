The chipped paint of the gallery walls, a faded symphony of blues and greens, seemed to whisper secrets to Elara Vance, a painter whose life was as vibrant as the canvases she scorned.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows of the "Lost Hues" gallery, illuminating the canvases of forgotten masters.  Elara, dressed in a faded indigo jumpsuit that clung to her thin frame, moved through the space with the quiet grace of a spirit.  Her fingers, stained with ochre and indigo, traced the edges of a newly acquired portrait â€“ a woman with eyes that held the weight of a thousand unspoken stories.  The gallery, a former church with high ceilings and echoing silence, felt more like a mausoleum than a haven for art.  Empty except for her, and the faint scent of old oil paints.  Elara was alone in the world of colour. Her only companions the dead.
