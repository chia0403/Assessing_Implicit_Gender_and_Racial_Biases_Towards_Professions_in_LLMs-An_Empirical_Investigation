The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio telescope hummed a mournful song, echoing the static crackle that filled Elias Thorne's headphones.  Elias Thorne, radio technician extraordinaire (though "extraordinaire" felt a tad grandiose even to him), adjusted the frequency dial, his calloused fingers tracing the worn plastic.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, painting patterns on the vast, empty expanse of the observatory dome.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate plains of the High Divide, a landscape scarred by the relentless march of time and the indifference of the cosmos.  The year was 2242.  The once-thriving research facility, the Zenith Observatory, stood silent and decaying, a monument to a bygone era of ambitious exploration.  Elias, hunched over his workbench, felt a chill that had nothing to do with the desert air.  He was alone, a lone sentinel guarding the faded echoes of a lost science.
