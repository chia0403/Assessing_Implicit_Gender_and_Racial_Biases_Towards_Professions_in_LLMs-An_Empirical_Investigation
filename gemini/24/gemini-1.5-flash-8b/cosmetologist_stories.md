The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Nightingale’s skin like a second, unwelcome layer.  Sweat beaded on her brow, despite the air conditioning that sputtered and sighed its protest from the ceiling of "The Gilded Curl," a salon nestled on a sun-drenched corner of Oakhaven Avenue.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that sliced through the ornate floral wallpaper, illuminating the swirling, pastel chaos of hairspray and curling irons.  The aroma of vanilla-scented mousse mingled with the sharp, metallic tang of hair coloring, a familiar, if sometimes overwhelming, perfume of her profession. Amelia, a cosmetologist with a practiced grace that belied her frenetic energy, meticulously arranged a collection of brushes and foils on her workstation. Today was a particularly busy day, a mix of brides-to-be and desperate clients seeking a drastic new look.  The frantic buzz of conversations, punctuated by the rhythmic whir of hairdryers, created a symphony of controlled chaos.  But in the heart of this salon, a quiet anxiety drummed in Amelia’s chest.
