The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's small clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the tempest brewing inside her.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered waiting room, punctuated by the rhythmic thump-thump of a metronome somewhere in the depths of the building.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with ten years of experience navigating the treacherous terrain of the human psyche, stared out the grimy window, the city lights blurring into a chaotic constellation beneath the angry sky.  It was a Wednesday evening, just another night in the quiet suburban town of Oakhaven, a place that, despite its placid exterior, held a dark undercurrent that seemed to seep into the very air.  Eleanorâ€™s cluttered office, nestled in the back of the building, was a testament to her eclectic approach to healing; framed prints of abstract art hung alongside motivational posters, piles of research papers were scattered on her desk next to half-empty mugs and a chipped teacup, testament to late nights and long sessions.  The scent of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion.  Tonight, however, the scent of something else, something acrid and unsettling, clung to the air.
