The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey, reflected Elara Blackwood's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the sprawling, ivy-choked manor.  The air, thick with the scent of aged wood and forgotten lilies, hung heavy with the unspoken weight of generations.  Elara, a housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past fifteen years, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just another day; this was the day the will was to be read.

**Setting:**

Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the misty Yorkshire moors.  The house, once a vibrant hub of aristocratic life, now stood silent and brooding, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the encroaching wilderness.  Tangled vines snaked up the stone walls, their emerald tendrils clinging to the decaying grandeur.  Inside, the echoing halls whispered tales of forgotten laughter and whispered secrets, a symphony of ghosts playing out in the vast, shadowed rooms.  The meticulously maintained, yet dusty, polished floors, servants' quarters, and vast drawing rooms all offered a tangible reminder of a bygone era.  The chill of the manor permeated even the warmest parts of the house.
