The fluorescent hum of the "Apex Research Institute" sliced through the stale air, a persistent, irritating buzz that echoed Elias Thorne's fatigue.  He was Elias Thorne, janitor extraordinaire – or, at least, that's what he told himself, a quiet chuckle bubbling in his chest as he pushed the gleaming, stainless-steel trolley down the sterile corridor.  Each day was a meticulous dance with the institutional silence, a ballet of mopping and scrubbing, sweeping and shining.  The institute's cold, white walls, lined with rows of humming computers and towering racks of experimental equipment, reflected his own quiet desperation.  Today, however, the silence was punctuated by a low, rhythmic *click-click-click* emanating from the far end of the corridor, a sound that felt…unnatural.  It was a sound Elias knew he shouldn't be investigating, but his curiosity, a stubborn weed in the barren landscape of his life, clawed its way to the surface.
