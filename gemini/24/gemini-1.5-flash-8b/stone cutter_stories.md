The biting wind whipped across the exposed hillside, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  Grey, slate-coloured clouds, thick and menacing, pressed down on the jagged peaks of the Whispering Mountains, mirroring the gloom that settled in Elara's heart.  High above, the jagged silhouette of the  Dragon's Tooth, a peak said to have been carved by a mythical beast, loomed. Below, nestled in the valley floor, lay the village of Oakhaven, a cluster of timber-framed houses huddled like frightened sheep.  Elara, her name a testament to her trade, could almost taste the metallic tang of the ancient stone quarries that marked the village's eastern edge.  She was a stone cutter, a whisperer of whispers in the stone, a sculptor of silent stories, and today, the stories whispered back to her were none too pleasant.
