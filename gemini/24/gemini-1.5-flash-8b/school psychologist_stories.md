The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a relentless drone that mirrored the anxieties swirling in Dr. Eleanor Vance's stomach.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the guidance counselor's office, mimicking the torrent of emotions flooding her.  Each drop, a tiny hammer blow against the already fragile peace of her day.  It was Tuesday, the day of the mandatory student check-ins, and the palpable tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.  The peeling paint on the walls, a faded shade of what she imagined had once been cheerful yellow, seemed to mock her efforts to create a haven in this otherwise chaotic space.  The smell of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air, a testament to the constant struggle played out within the halls of Northwood High.

**Setting:** The guidance counselor's office at Northwood High School, a large, but neglected public high school located in a struggling urban district.  The office, tucked away in a corner of the wing, was cramped and sparsely decorated, with a battered wooden desk, a few worn-out chairs, and a chipped ceramic mug perpetually filled with lukewarm coffee.  Outside, the oppressive urban landscape of grey concrete and towering apartment buildings loomed, a stark contrast to the supposed "safe space" meant for students and teachers alike.
