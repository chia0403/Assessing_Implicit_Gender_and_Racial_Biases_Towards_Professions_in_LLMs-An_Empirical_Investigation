The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy"  Carter's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the narrow, cobbled street.  The scent of pine needles, sharp and invigorating, mingled with the acrid smell of woodsmoke curling from the chimneys of the old Victorian houses that lined the street.  Leafy branches, skeletal and brittle against the pale grey sky, clawed at the flickering gaslight lamps.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a sharp eye for detail and a knack for finding the hidden gems of the city, felt the familiar thrill of anticipation.  This was Blackwood, a district steeped in history, where whispers of forgotten fortunes and eccentric residents still echoed through the shadowed alleyways.  She was here to view a property that, according to the listing, held the key to a piece of that very history â€“ a charming Victorian townhouse, rumored to have once housed a renowned author.
