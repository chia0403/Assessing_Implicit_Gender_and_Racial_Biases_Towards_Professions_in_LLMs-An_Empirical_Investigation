The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, a small comfort against the biting November wind rattling the single-paned windows of her attic studio.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy glass, danced in the air like tiny, forgotten melodies.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Prague groaned under the weight of a passing tram, its mournful clang echoing the hollow ache in Amelia’s chest.  The city, usually a vibrant tapestry of sound and colour, felt muted, mirroring the silence that had settled over her life since the rejection letter.  Her once-bright dreams of operatic stardom, once as clear as the crystal Bohemian glass adorning the dusty shelves, now seemed as fragile as those same goblets, threatening to shatter with a single careless touch.  The unfinished aria lay on the music stand before her, a testament to the ambition that was slowly, painfully, fading away.
