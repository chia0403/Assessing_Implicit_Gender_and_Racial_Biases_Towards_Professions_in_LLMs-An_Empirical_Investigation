The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandezâ€™s shoulders, turning the already shimmering turquoise water of the Cenote Azul into a dazzling, almost painful, spectacle.  Sweat trickled down her spine, clinging to the thin cotton of her  khaki shirt.  The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the scent of damp earth and blooming jasmine.  Amelia adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar, its plastic feeling sticky against her skin.  Thirty expectant faces, a kaleidoscope of sun-kissed skin and wide-eyed wonder, awaited her at the edge of the sinkhole, their hushed anticipation broken only by the chirping of unseen cicadas.  This was her tenth tour of the day, and Amelia, seasoned tour guide extraordinaire for Mayan Mysteries Expeditions, was already feeling the familiar thrum of adrenaline that accompanied each descent into the sacred depths of the cenote.
