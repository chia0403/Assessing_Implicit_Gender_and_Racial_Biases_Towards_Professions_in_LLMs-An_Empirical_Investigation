The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Tower hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Elias Thorne's mop bucket wheels.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the cyclical sweep of his mop and the pungent aroma of industrial-strength cleaner, navigated the deserted marble hallways at 3:00 AM.  The tower, a gleaming obsidian spire piercing the inky Chicago skyline, was a sleeping giant, its occupants tucked away in their opulent apartments, oblivious to the quiet diligence that kept their world polished and pristine.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, broken only by the distant, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* that seemed to emanate from the upper floors â€“ a sound that Elias, in his years of nocturnal toil, had never heard before.
