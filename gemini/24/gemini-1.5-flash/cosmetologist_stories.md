The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a strangely comforting combination that Amelia Hernandez, owner and operator of "Curl Up & Dye," had come to associate with the chaotic beauty of her life.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of her salon, blurring the neon glow of the "24-Hour Laundromat" across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  Inside, Amelia, perched on a stool behind the brightly lit styling station, was meticulously weaving a complex braid into a client's thick, mahogany-colored hair.  The rhythmic snip-snip of her shears punctuated the rhythmic drumming of the rain, a percussive counterpoint to the low hum of conversation emanating from the three other clients scattered throughout her small, but bustling, shop.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting hum felt charged with a different energy â€“ a nervous, almost electric buzz that even the calming lavender couldn't quite mask.
