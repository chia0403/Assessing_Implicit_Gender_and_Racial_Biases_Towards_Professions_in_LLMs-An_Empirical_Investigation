The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood perched on the scaffolding, the skeletal frame of the unfinished skyscraper a cage of steel against the bruised purple twilight.  Below, the city of Chicago roared – a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of construction – but up here, on the 72nd floor, only the wind held sway.  Amelia, a woman whose precision extended to the perfectly-placed strands of her auburn hair, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and the metallic tang of fresh weld, but something else lingered – a disquieting stillness that settled deep in her bones, a quiet discordance in the otherwise harmonious chaos of the city's relentless energy. The unfinished building, her magnum opus, the "Apex Tower," felt less like a monument to human ingenuity and more like a monument to a forgotten tragedy.
