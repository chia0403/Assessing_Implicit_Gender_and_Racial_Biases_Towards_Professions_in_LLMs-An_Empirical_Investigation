The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle bar cast a lurid, orange glow across Elara Vance's rain-streaked window.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Elara, a computer programmer whose caffeine intake rivaled that of a small espresso shop, hunched over her keyboard, the glow of the multiple monitors illuminating her tired face.  Empty energy drink cans littered her desk like fallen soldiers in a digital war. Outside, the city of Neo-Kyoto hummed with a chaotic energy â€“ a symphony of honking vehicles, chattering pedestrians, and the distant, rhythmic thrum of the Maglev train.  Inside, the only sound was the frantic click-clack of her keys as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn line of code, a deadline looming larger than a kaiju on the horizon.  The air hung thick with the scent of instant ramen and the faint, metallic tang of ozone from the city's perpetually overcast sky.
