The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Amelia “Amy” Stone’s bones as she wrestled the joystick of the monstrous Caterpillar D11T.  Dust, the ochre-red dust of the Arizona desert, swirled around the massive machine like a malevolent spirit, obscuring the already hazy midday sun.  Amy squinted, her brow furrowed in concentration as she guided the bulldozer’s blade across the unforgiving terrain, carving a precise path through the stubborn earth.  The air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blend of desert heat and the acrid smell of burnt engine oil.  Ahead, the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned mine stretched across the landscape like the bleached bones of some prehistoric beast, a stark reminder of the harshness of this land and the unforgiving nature of the work.  Today, Amy was carving a new path, literally and metaphorically, one that she hoped would lead to something more than endless miles of desert dust and the deafening roar of heavy machinery.
