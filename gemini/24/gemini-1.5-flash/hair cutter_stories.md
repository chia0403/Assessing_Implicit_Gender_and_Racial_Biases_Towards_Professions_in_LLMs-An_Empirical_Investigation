The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to "Shear Perfection," Aurelia "Rella" Nightingale's tiny salon nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually-empty storefront specializing in artisanal birdhouses.  Rella, perched on her worn leather barber's chair, its springs groaning a gentle protest under her weight, meticulously sharpened her shears.  Outside, the relentless London drizzle painted the cobblestones a glistening, oily black, mirroring the dark circles blossoming beneath her own tired eyes.  It was a Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Periwinkle's weekly appointment, and Rella already knew the old woman's predictable complaints about the dampness ruining her carefully-set wave. The rhythmic *snip, snip, snip* of her shears was the only sound louder than the steady, melancholic drumming of the rain against the windowpanes.
