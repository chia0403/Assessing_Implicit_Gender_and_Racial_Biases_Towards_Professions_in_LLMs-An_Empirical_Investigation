The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the seams of Dr. Aris Thorne’s parka.  He hunched deeper into his thermal gear, the icy breath misting before his goggles as he peered through the swirling snow.  The research station, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging precariously to the ice shelf like barnacles on a whale, was barely visible through the blizzard.  Inside, the warmth of the generator hummed a comforting, if slightly erratic, tune, a stark contrast to the brutal, unforgiving landscape that stretched for miles in every direction – a pristine, white expanse broken only by the jagged teeth of icebergs and the occasional, forlorn penguin.  Aris, a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey, had spent the last three months studying the Larsen C ice shelf, meticulously collecting data that might just hold the key to understanding the accelerating pace of global warming.  But tonight, the data felt secondary to the overwhelming sense of isolation and the unnerving feeling that something was… wrong.
