The biting November wind howled a mournful song across the desolate plains of Nebraska, rattling the windows of Earl "Dusty" Rhodes's battered Kenworth.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar and the color of burnt umber, swirled around the eighteen-wheeler's massive tires, obscuring the already fading light.  Dusty, his face weathered like ancient leather and etched with the map of a thousand lonely highways, gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles bone-white against the worn leather.  The CB radio crackled with static, a symphony of interference only broken by the occasional snippet of garbled conversation.  Ahead, the endless ribbon of Interstate 80 stretched towards a horizon swallowed by the encroaching darkness, promising nothing but miles and more miles of empty road.  The only other visible life was the occasional flicker of a distant farm house, tiny and vulnerable against the vastness of the land.  Tonight, even the stars seemed to shrink back, intimidated by the sheer, desolate beauty – and the potential danger – of the Nebraska night.
