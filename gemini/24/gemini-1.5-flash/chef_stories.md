The humid air hung heavy with the scent of roasting chiles and simmering spices, a fragrant curtain drawn across the chaotic heart of Mercado San Juan.  Chef Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez, sweat beading on her brow despite the pre-dawn chill, surveyed her domain with a critical eye.  Her stall, *La Cocina de Abuela*, a riot of vibrant colours and overflowing baskets, was already bustling with activity.  The rhythmic clang of knives against steel punctuated the lively chatter of early-morning shoppers haggling over plump tomatoes and fragrant herbs.  Izzy, with her flour-dusted apron and fiery red hair escaping its messy bun, moved through the throng with the effortless grace of a seasoned matador navigating a charging bull.  The worn wooden tables, usually laden with steaming bowls of her legendary pozole, were currently a battlefield of chopping boards, simmering pots, and meticulously arranged ingredients, all awaiting the day's culinary onslaught.
