The scent of Bay Rum and Old Spice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to the worn velvet of Barnaby "Barney" Butterfield's barber chair like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of Butterfield's Barbershop, illuminating the swirling clouds of hair clinging to the faded paisley wallpaper.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythm as predictable and steady as Barneyâ€™s own practiced hand wielding the clippers.  The shop itself, nestled on the crooked, cobbled lane of Bleak Street, felt like a time capsule, untouched by the modern world clamoring just beyond its threshold.  Even the chipped porcelain mugs on the shelf, holding the remnants of lukewarm tea, seemed to whisper stories of a bygone era.  Barney, a man whose silvered hair mirrored the dust motes dancing in the light, hummed a low, mournful tune as he meticulously cleaned his shears, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.
