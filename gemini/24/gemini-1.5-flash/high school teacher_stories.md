The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked sidewalk, the scent of damp leaves and exhaust fumes clinging to the air.  Overhead, the bruised purple sky threatened another downpour.  Mia, a veteran high school English teacher at Northwood High, tugged her worn wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her neck.  Northwood, a sprawling brick building that had seen better decades, loomed before her, its gothic architecture looking particularly imposing under the gloomy sky. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos that usually filled the hallways – the chaotic symphony of slamming lockers, chattering students, and the occasional shriek of a frustrated teenager.  Tonight, however, an unnatural quiet hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Mia’s heels echoing on the polished linoleum.  The annual fundraising gala was about to begin, and while Mia was looking forward to the potential for some much-needed funds for the struggling drama department, the eerily quiet atmosphere felt…off.
