The relentless August sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning the sweat on his brow to a glistening river that traced a path down his sun-weathered face.  He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, the scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass clinging to his skin.  Around him, the sprawling estate of the Vandergelt family sprawled like a slumbering green beast, its manicured lawns and meticulously sculpted hedges a testament to Elias's meticulous work.  High above, the towering oaks whispered secrets in the afternoon breeze, their leaves a shimmering canopy against the azure sky.  This wasn’t just any job; it was the Vandergelt estate, the jewel of Ashwood County, and Elias, owner of Thorne’s Turf and Trim, was entrusted with its breathtaking beauty.  Today, however, the air held a tension thicker than the humid haze hanging low over the meticulously pruned boxwoods. Something felt…off.
