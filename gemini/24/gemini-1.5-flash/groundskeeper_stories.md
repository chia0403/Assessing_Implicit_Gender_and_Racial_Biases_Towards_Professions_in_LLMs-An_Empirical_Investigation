The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a shroud, clinging damply to Elias Thorne's thick, wool trousers as he began his rounds.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the rhythmic sweep of a scythe and the earthy scent of freshly turned soil, wasn't easily fazed.  But even he felt a prickle of unease this morning, a disquiet deeper than the usual pre-dawn chill that settled over the sprawling estate.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and shadowed turrets, loomed over him, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the creeping light.  The air, usually filled with the cheerful chirping of birds, was unnervingly still, heavy with an almost palpable sense of foreboding.  This was no ordinary autumn morning at Blackwood.
