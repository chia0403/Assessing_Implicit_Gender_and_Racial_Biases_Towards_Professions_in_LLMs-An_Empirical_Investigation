The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez's own heartbeat.  It was a sound she’d become intimately familiar with over the past five years, a soundtrack to countless pricks, pokes, and the occasional, unexpected, squirt of blood.  Today, however, the usual calm of her morning routine was shattered.  The usual pre-dawn quiet, punctuated only by the gentle whir of the centrifuge, was replaced by a frantic buzz – a flurry of activity that Amelia, despite her years of experience, couldn't quite decipher.  A storm was brewing, and it wasn't the usual rush of patients before clinic hours.  This felt… different.  This felt ominous.
