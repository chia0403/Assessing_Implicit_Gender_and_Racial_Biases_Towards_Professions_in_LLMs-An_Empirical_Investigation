The fluorescent hum of the office was a constant, dull thrumming in the background of Aurelia Grace Hawthorne's life.  Aurelia, or Auri as only a handful of people dared to call her, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the mahogany desk, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the incessant clatter of the city outside the panoramic window of her 37th-floor office.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the cityscape into a hazy watercolour of greys and muted blues, mirroring the bleakness Aurelia felt settling in her stomach.  The air, thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, felt suffocating.  Her meticulously organised desk, a testament to years of unwavering efficiency, suddenly seemed like a prison, each perfectly aligned document a brick in the wall surrounding her.  This wasn't just another Monday; today, something was different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker even than the recycled aroma of the office's air freshener.
