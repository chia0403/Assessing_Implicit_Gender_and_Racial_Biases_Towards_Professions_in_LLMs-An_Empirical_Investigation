The recycled air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of cheap perfume and stale coffee, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  Sera, a veteran flight attendant for Transatlantic Airways, adjusted the tiny, perfectly-placed pearl earring dangling from her left lobe, a nervous tic she hadn't been able to break in her ten years on the job.  The pre-flight bustle of Flight 747 to Rio de Janeiro hummed around her like a disgruntled beehive.  Overhead, the fluorescent lights of Gate 42 buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the scuffed linoleum floor and the anxious faces of the waiting passengers.  Outside, the pre-dawn London sky was a bruised purple, the faintest hint of sunrise bleeding through the smog. This was the start of another long, potentially chaotic, and almost certainly eventful transatlantic flight.
