The humid air hung heavy, a thick, perfumed blanket woven with the scent of jasmine and decay.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, maddening rhythm against the backdrop of the city's low hum, a counterpoint to the rhythmic slap-slap-slap of Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s worn leather sandals on the cracked pavement.  Amy, a seasoned reporter for the *Manila Chronicle*, adjusted the strap of her worn canvas satchel, its contents – a battered notebook, a half-eaten mango, and a pen perpetually threatening to leak – shifting with each step.  She navigated the labyrinthine streets of Intramuros, the ancient walled city of Manila, its crumbling Spanish colonial architecture a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos spilling from its gates.  The setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows, painting the crumbling walls in hues of orange and purple, a beautiful backdrop to what Amy suspected would be a very ugly story.
