The chipped mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s hands, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the icy dread that had settled in her gut.  Rain lashed against the attic windowpanes of her rambling Victorian house, each gust a mournful sigh echoing the emptiness she felt.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the swirling currents of air, mimicking the chaotic thoughts swarming her mind.  Amelia, a writer of gothic suspense novels renowned for their chillingly realistic settings, found herself staring at the blank page on her ancient typewriter, the stark white a mocking reflection of the creative drought that had gripped her for the past three months.  The scent of damp wood and decaying paper hung heavy in the air, a fitting aroma for a woman wrestling with a story that refused to be born.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, a sound that usually fueled her imagination now only served to amplify her self-doubt.  This attic, her sanctuary, her creative wellspring, felt instead like a suffocating tomb.
