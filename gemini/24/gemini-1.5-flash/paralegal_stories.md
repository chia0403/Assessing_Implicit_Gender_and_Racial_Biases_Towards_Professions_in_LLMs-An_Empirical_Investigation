The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Hernandez’s crisp white blouse, a tiny testament to the dilapidated charm of her Brooklyn brownstone office building.  It was a charm Amelia, a paralegal at the considerably less charming firm of Stern, Goldstein & Zuckerman, appreciated far less than the exorbitant rent it commanded.  The August heat hung heavy and humid, clinging to her like the scent of stale coffee and desperation that permeated the cramped office.  Sweat beaded on her forehead as she wrestled with a recalcitrant scanner, the whirring of its innards a mocking counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keyboard, where a mountain of legal documents – divorce decrees, bankruptcy filings, the occasional heart-wrenching plea for mercy – awaited her attention.  The flickering fluorescent lights above hummed a discordant tune to the city's relentless soundtrack of sirens and shouting.  This, Amelia thought, was her life.  Or at least, it was her Tuesday.
