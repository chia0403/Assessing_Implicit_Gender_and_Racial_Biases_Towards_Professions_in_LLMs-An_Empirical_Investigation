The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the icy breath of Mount Denali ghosting across the frosted windscreen.  Below, the Chugach Mountains sprawled like a rumpled, snow-covered blanket, their jagged peaks disappearing into a swirling maelstrom of clouds that threatened to swallow the tiny aircraft whole.  Evie gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather, her gaze fixed on the barely-visible ribbon of the Talkeetna River snaking its way through the valley far below.  The radio crackled with static, a frustrating counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engine â€“ a sound that, despite the treacherous conditions, still held a familiar and comforting pulse. This wasn't just a flight; it was a dance with death, a ballet performed on the razor's edge of survival, something Evie had grown accustomed to, but never quite mastered.
