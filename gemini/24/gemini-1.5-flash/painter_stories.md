The salt spray stung Elias Thorne’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He stood perched on the jagged rocks of Cove’s End, the wind whipping his already wind-chapped lips raw.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a hesitant dawn, mirrored the turbulent canvas he held in his hands – a half-finished oil painting depicting the ferocious beauty of the storm that had ravaged the coast just hours before.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cries of gulls, a melancholic symphony that seemed to echo the turmoil within Elias himself.  He hadn't touched a brush in weeks, the creative well dried up, leaving behind only a parched landscape of frustration.  But the raw power of the storm, the untamed fury of the sea crashing against the cliffs, had finally broken through the dam, stirring something within him, a desperate need to capture the ephemeral essence of chaos before it faded completely.  Cove's End, a remote village clinging precariously to the edge of the world, was as much a character in his life as it was a breathtaking subject for his art.
