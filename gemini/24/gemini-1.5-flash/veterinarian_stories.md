The biting November wind whipped across the desolate moorland, stinging Dr. Eleanor Vance’s cheeks as she wrestled the reluctant sheep back into its makeshift pen.  The air tasted of salt and peat, a familiar tang that usually soothed her, but tonight, it only served to amplify the growing unease gnawing at her.  The remote veterinary clinic, nestled precariously between craggy cliffs and the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, usually offered a welcome solitude.  Tonight, however, the solitude felt oppressive, a heavy blanket woven from the howling wind and the unsettling silence that punctuated the bleating of the distressed animal.  Eleanor, her thick wool coat barely offering respite from the cold, pulled her breath deep into her lungs, the frigid air burning its way down to her very core.  The flickering gaslight in the clinic’s single window offered little comfort against the encroaching darkness, and the storm promised a long, lonely night.
