The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that Amelia Hernandez, owner and sole operator of "Wanderlust & Co.," considered her signature scent.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall, arched windows of her quaint, Victorian-era shop nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina.  Outside, horse-drawn carriages clattered past, their rhythmic clip-clop a counterpoint to the gentle hum of Amelia's ancient typewriter, its keys clicking out a detailed itinerary for a client bound for the hidden beaches of the Amalfi Coast.  The shop itself was a chaotic haven of travel brochures – some faded and brittle with age, others crisp and new – overflowing map cases, and a globe so worn the paint was almost entirely rubbed away from the continents most frequently traveled.  Amelia, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun and a perpetually curious glint in her emerald eyes, was the perfect conductor of this whimsical orchestra of wanderlust.
