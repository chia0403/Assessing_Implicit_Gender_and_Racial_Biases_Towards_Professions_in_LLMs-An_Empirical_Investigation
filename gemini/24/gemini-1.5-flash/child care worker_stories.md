The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Maple Street, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth stinging her nostrils.  Loose leaves, the colour of burnt umber and decaying gold, skittered across the pavement in frantic, swirling dances.  Amelia pulled her worn scarf tighter, the thin wool offering little protection against the chill that seemed to seep from the very bones of the old Victorian houses lining the street.  She clutched a battered canvas bag overflowing with brightly coloured felt, promising the usual chaotic yet comforting symphony of giggles and crayons that awaited her at Sunnyside Daycare.  The imposing silhouette of Sunnyside, a rambling, two-story building with chipped paint and a slightly sagging porch, loomed ahead, a haven of warmth and – hopefully – order in the face of the encroaching winter storm.
