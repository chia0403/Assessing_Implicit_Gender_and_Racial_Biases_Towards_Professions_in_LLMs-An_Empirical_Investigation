The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks as he unlocked the bakery doors, the wrought-iron groaning a mournful protest against the rusty hinges.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest breath of air, danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows of "The Golden Crust," a bakery as old as the cobbled street it occupied.  This wasn't just any street; it was Bleecker Lane, tucked away in the heart of a historic, if somewhat dilapidated, district of Charleston, South Carolina. The air, still thick with the lingering scent of jasmine and damp earth, already hinted at the humid Charleston day to come, a day that promised to be as sweet and sticky as the pecan pralines Elias was planning to bake.  The aroma of yeast and sugar, however, would quickly dominate, transforming the quiet lane into a haven of comforting warmth.
