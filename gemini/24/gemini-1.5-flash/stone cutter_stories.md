The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Silas Blackwoodâ€™s hammer.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, grime-coated window high in the north wall, danced in the shafts of pale winter sunlight.  Silas, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by years spent wrestling with unforgiving stone, paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet earth and crushed quartz, a familiar perfume in the heart of the Blackwood quarry, nestled deep within the shadow of the brooding, mist-shrouded peaks of the Greystone Mountains.  For generations, the Blackwoods had hewn stone from these very slopes, shaping the raw material into the very foundations of the kingdom.  But today, Silas felt a tremor in his bones, a feeling deeper than the usual aches and pains that came with his trade; a premonition as cold and hard as the granite itself.
