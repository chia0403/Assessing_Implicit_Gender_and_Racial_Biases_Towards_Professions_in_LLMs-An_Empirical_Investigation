The brass nameplate gleamed under the low, amber light of the Grand Excelsior Hotel lobby:  *Seraphina "Sera" Moreau, Concierge*.  Sera, however, was not admiring her own meticulously polished reflection. Instead, she was hunched over a miniature Eiffel Tower, meticulously picking minuscule flecks of glitter from its base with tweezers.  The miniature monument, a coveted prize in the hotel's annual Easter egg hunt, was currently residing on her desk, a casualty of a particularly enthusiastic six-year-old named Timmy Fitzwilliam.  The scent of lilies and freshly brewed coffee battled with the faint metallic tang of blood, a less pleasant souvenir from Timmy's less-than-graceful exit â€“ a minor nosebleed, thankfully.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the vast windowpanes, blurring the city lights into a shimmering, impressionistic painting.  The Grand Excelsior, a timeless jewel nestled on the Rue de Rivoli, hummed with a quiet elegance that belied the chaos often brewing behind its polished facade.  Tonight, that chaos threatened to boil over.
