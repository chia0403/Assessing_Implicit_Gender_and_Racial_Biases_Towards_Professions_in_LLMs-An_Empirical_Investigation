The wind, a rabid terrier nipping at the heels of a dying sun, howled a mournful tune across the slate-grey rooftops of Grimsborough.  Rain, thick and greasy as engine oil, plastered Elias Thorne’s already-grimy work overalls to his wiry frame.  Below, the city hummed a discordant symphony of sirens, car horns, and distant shouting, a soundtrack to his lonely perch atop the gothic spire of St. Jude’s Cathedral.  Elias, a man whose life was as weathered and worn as the shingles under his calloused fingertips, gripped the rusted metal flashing, the wind threatening to rip him from his precarious position.  The biting spray stung his eyes, blurring the already-dusk-hazed cityscape into a watercolour painting of grays and muted blues. This wasn't just a job; it was a dance with gravity, a nightly tango with the elements, and tonight, Elias felt the rhythm was off.
