The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Rel" Hawthorne, who perched on a worn velvet stool amidst a chaotic symphony of silks, satins, and shimmering threads.  Her small shop, "Threads of Time," nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient port city of Porthaven, was a haven of forgotten elegance. Sunlight, fractured by the leaded glass of the tall, arched windows, dappled the rich mahogany worktables and spilled onto bolts of fabric stacked high to the ceiling, their colors ranging from the deepest midnight blue to the palest blush pink.  The rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock, a constant companion, punctuated the quiet hum of Rel's sewing machine, a sturdy Singer that had seen better days but still purred with reliable efficiency.  Outside, the salty tang of the sea mingled with the cries of gulls, a constant reminder of Porthaven's bustling waterfront life, a world Rel mostly observed from behind her shop window, lost in the intricate dance of needle and thread.
