The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Cartwright’s salon, “Shear Genius,” could conjure.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes of the converted Victorian storefront, each drop a tiny percussion beat against the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Mia’s shears.  Inside, the salon was a comforting chaos – a kaleidoscope of vibrant hair colours reflected in the mirrored walls, the low hum of conversation punctuated by the whir of the hairdryer, and the clinking of glass from the overflowing candy dish perched precariously on the counter.  Outside, the cobblestones of Willow Creek, Oregon, glistened under the relentless downpour, mirroring the sheen Mia was painstakingly crafting into her client’s auburn locks.
