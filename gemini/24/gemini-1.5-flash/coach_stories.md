The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the Northwood High School football field.  The last leaves clung precariously to the bare branches of the ancient oak trees lining the perimeter, their shadows stretching long and skeletal across the muddied turf.  A half-frozen puddle reflected the bruised purple of the twilight sky, mirroring the ache in Amy’s own shoulders from a day spent hauling equipment and wrestling with recalcitrant teenagers. The air hung thick with the damp scent of decaying vegetation and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a lingering reminder of a particularly brutal scrimmage earlier that afternoon.  Northwood, a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the Appalachian foothills, had seen better days, and its football team, currently on a losing streak that threatened to extend into the next decade, reflected that perfectly.  Tonight, however, Amy felt a flicker of something akin to hope, a fragile ember in the gathering gloom. The upcoming game against their rivals, Crestwood, was a make-or-break moment, not just for the team, but perhaps for her own career.
