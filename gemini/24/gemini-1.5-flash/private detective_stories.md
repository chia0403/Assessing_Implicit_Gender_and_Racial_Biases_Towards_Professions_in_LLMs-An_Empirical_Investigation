The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing ache behind his eyes.  He hadn't slept properly in three days, the cheap coffee and stronger bourbon a poor substitute for rest.  The air hung thick and sour with the smell of stale cigarette smoke, damp wool, and something vaguely floral – probably the wilting lilies he'd forgotten to throw out.  Jack, a man whose trench coat seemed permanently damp and whose face bore the roadmap of a hard life lived mostly in the shadows of Los Angeles's underbelly, sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the flickering neon sign of the "Golden Dragon" laundromat casting a sickly yellow glow across the room. Outside, the city groaned, a symphony of sirens and distant shouts swallowed by the incessant downpour. This was his office, his domain – a cramped, cluttered space above a failing bakery on the wrong side of Sunset Boulevard, where the darkness clung to the alleyways like a second skin.  The case file, a crumpled mess of photographs and handwritten notes, lay open before him, promising more sleepless nights and a journey into a world far murkier than the Los Angeles rain.
