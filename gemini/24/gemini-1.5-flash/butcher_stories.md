The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of sawdust, blood, and something subtly sweet â€“ perhaps the apples Mr. Fitzwilliam kept on the counter to mask the more pungent aromas.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's domain, Butterfield's Best Cuts, a butcher shop nestled on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the sprawling, windswept moors.  Barty, a man built like a seasoned oak tree with hands that could fell a bullock and a gaze as sharp as a cleaver, surveyed his kingdom.  The shop, a low-ceilinged affair with walls lined with gleaming hooks and slabs of glistening meat, felt less like a place of commerce and more like a sacred space, a temple dedicated to the art of the perfect cut.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  It wasn't the weather that troubled him, not this time.  It was the letter.  A thick, black-edged envelope that sat, unopened, on the blood-stained butcher's block.
