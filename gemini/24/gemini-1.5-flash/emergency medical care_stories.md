The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy stretcher door shut.  The ambulance, its siren still faintly humming, rocked gently on the uneven cobblestones of the old San Francisco wharf.  Rain, a relentless San Francisco drizzle, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin.  The pungent aroma of salt and fish fought with the metallic tang of blood â€“ a familiar cocktail for Amy, a veteran paramedic with the San Francisco Emergency Medical Services.  Across from her, EMT Marco Reyes meticulously checked the vitals of their patient, a young fisherman with a gash above his eye that was slowly but stubbornly oozing blood.  The flickering neon sign of a nearby seafood restaurant cast a lurid, orange glow on the scene, illuminating the rain-slicked alleyway that served as their makeshift emergency room.  Tonight, the city's beauty was masked by a brutal, unforgiving reality.
