The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's otherwise silent existence behind the chipped Formica counter.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda â€“ a familiar perfume of late-night shifts.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful song, rattling the already-loose window panes and spitting icy rain against the grimy glass.  Amelia, her tired eyes shielded by thick-rimmed glasses, scanned a bag of suspiciously lumpy potato chips, the rhythmic beep of the scanner a counterpoint to the howling wind.  It was 2:17 AM, and Amelia was profoundly wishing she was anywhere but here.
