The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge down the narrow cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, rattling the loose panes in the windows of the crooked, half-timbered houses.  Rain, icy and relentless, lashed against the worn brick of  27 Crooked Lane, plastering Amelia “Millie” Cartwright’s already damp overalls tighter to her frame.  Millie, a plumber with hands as rough as bark and eyes as sharp as a chisel,  shivered less from the cold and more from a premonition of trouble. The call had come in late, a frantic whisper on the other end of the line, and the address – 27 Crooked Lane – was notorious, even in a town as steeped in eccentric history as Oakhaven.  The flickering gaslight at the end of the lane cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like the ancient pipes she suspected lay hidden beneath the cobblestones.
