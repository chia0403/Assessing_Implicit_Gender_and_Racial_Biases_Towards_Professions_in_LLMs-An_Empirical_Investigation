The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s Third Grade” sign flaked onto the dusty windowsill, mirroring the slow, inevitable crumbling of Eleanor’s carefully constructed composure.  It was the last day before summer break, a day usually brimming with giddy anticipation and the sweet scent of impending freedom.  But this year, a thick, cloying humidity hung in the air, mirroring the oppressive weight in Eleanor’s chest.  The normally vibrant classroom of brightly coloured posters and student artwork felt muted, the usual cheerful chaos replaced by a tense, almost silent expectancy.  Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on the brick walls of Oakwood Elementary, baking the playground into a shimmering expanse of heat haze.  Even the usually boisterous cries of children at recess were subdued, replaced by a listless shuffling of small feet and the occasional, weary sigh.  Today, however, wasn't about the usual end-of-year excitement; a shadow, dark and undefined, had fallen over Oakwood Elementary, and it rested heavily on Eleanor Vance's shoulders.
