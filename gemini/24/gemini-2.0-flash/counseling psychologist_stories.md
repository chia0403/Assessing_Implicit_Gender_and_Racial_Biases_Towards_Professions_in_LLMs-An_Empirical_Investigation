Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:**

The Pacific Northwest Counseling Center occupies a renovated Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in Bellingham, Washington. The building, painted a soft sage green with creamy white trim, exudes a sense of calm and gentle stability. Inside, worn but comfortable armchairs are arranged around a fireplace in the waiting room, which is subtly perfumed with the scent of lavender and beeswax. The walls are adorned with calming landscapes and abstract art – nothing too jarring or stimulating. Eleanor, in particular, has made sure that her office includes a comfortable couch, a tapestry that she brought back from a trip to Guatemala, and a tea kettle with a variety of herbal teas, a comforting routine for her and her patients to share.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Rosalie Finch stared out the rain-streaked window of her office, the rhythmic drumming a soothing counterpoint to the internal tempest brewing within her. The November sky was a bruised purple, mirroring the way she felt after her last session. Mrs. Henderson, bless her heart, was convinced her neighbor was poisoning her petunias. Eleanor had spent the better part of an hour gently guiding her towards less… florid… explanations, all while battling the nagging feeling that her own life was becoming increasingly absurd.

She took a slow sip of chamomile tea, the warm liquid doing little to thaw the chill that had settled in her bones. It wasn't just Mrs. Henderson. It was the constant barrage of anxiety, grief, and existential dread she absorbed day in and day out. A therapist, she knew, was meant to be a container, not a sponge, but lately, Eleanor felt saturated, waterlogged, on the verge of overflowing. And tonight, she had a new patient coming in, a referral from Dr. Hayes. All Eleanor knew was their name: Mr. Silas Blackwood.
