The biting wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth as she wrestled her Land Rover through the mud-slicked track. The skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawed at the sky, their gnarled fingers a stark reminder of the harsh realities this corner of Dartmoor held in its grip. Rain, relentless and unforgiving, hammered against the windscreen, blurring the already indistinct landscape into a watercolour wash of greys and browns.

Eleanor was heading, as she did most days, towards the village of Grimstone, a cluster of stone cottages huddled together as if seeking solace from the desolate moor. Grimstone wasn't truly a village, more a scattering of hardy souls clinging to a way of life that modernity had largely bypassed. There was no proper shop, no functioning pub, and certainly no other doctor foolish enough to set up a practice. Just Eleanor, her well-worn medical bag, and a deep, abiding sense of duty to the people who called this unforgiving land home. Tonight, she was called to Old Man Hemlock’s cottage – the man was having trouble breathing again. Eleanor braced herself. The track was getting worse, and the old man’s cottage was the furthest dwelling on the moor, perched precariously on the edge of a boggy field. This wasn't just a job, she knew; it was a lifeline. And the storm was only getting worse.
