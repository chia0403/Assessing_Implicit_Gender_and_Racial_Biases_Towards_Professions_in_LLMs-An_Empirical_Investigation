Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The low hum of the fluorescent lights was a constant companion to Elara Vashti Novak, a sound as familiar as the rhythmic scrape of her mechanical pencil against vellum. Outside, the December wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aged windowpanes of the Novak & Sons Architectural Drafting Firm. Inside, however, a fragile warmth clung to the air, a mixture of stale coffee, the faint scent of ammonia from the blueprint machine, and the comforting buzz of busy work. Elara didn't notice the wind, not really. Her world, at this moment, existed entirely within the intricate lines of the blueprint spread before her – a proposed renovation of the old Blackwood Manor, a commission that could keep the firm afloat for another year.

She adjusted her spectacles, the wire frames pressing against the bridge of her nose, and squinted at the faded original blueprints. The manor was a beautiful, brooding monstrosity, all gothic arches and dizzying turrets, a relic of a bygone era. But time, and neglect, had taken their toll. The current owner, some reclusive millionaire with more money than sense, wanted to restore it to its former glory. Which meant Elara had to translate his vague pronouncements and even vaguer sketches into something workable, something safe, something…possible.

A shiver ran down her spine, and it wasn't from the draft coming from the window. Something about the Blackwood Manor felt…wrong.

**Setting:**

The setting is primarily within the **Novak & Sons Architectural Drafting Firm**, located in the fictional town of **Havenwood, Massachusetts**, in the year **1962**.

**More specifically:**

*   **The Firm:** Novak & Sons is a small, family-run business, passed down through generations of Novaks. It occupies the second floor of a creaky, brick building on Havenwood's Main Street, above a dusty antique shop. The office is cramped, with three drafting tables crammed together, each lit by a gooseneck lamp. The walls are covered in framed architectural renderings, showcasing past projects of varying degrees of success. There's a small break room with a perpetually brewing coffee pot and a collection of mismatched mugs. The air is perpetually thick with the smell of paper, ink, and the aforementioned coffee.

*   **Havenwood, Massachusetts:** A quaint, but slightly isolated New England town with a rich history and a lingering sense of the past. It's the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else's business, and where old money and old grudges tend to linger. The Blackwood Manor, located on a secluded hilltop overlooking the town, is a significant landmark, both admired and feared by the local residents. Havenwood is surrounded by dense forests, which add to the town's secluded and somewhat mysterious atmosphere.

*   **Time Period (1962):** The early 1960s setting is important. The technology used in drafting is primarily manual, relying on pencils, t-squares, and blueprint machines. This era adds a layer of historical context, influencing Elara's work and the societal norms of the time.
