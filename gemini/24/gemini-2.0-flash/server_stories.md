Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a server as the main character:

**Setting:** The Rusty Spoon Diner, a classic American diner nestled on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Iowa. It's 5:47 AM on a Tuesday. The air smells faintly of stale coffee and frying bacon, fighting a losing battle against the lingering scent of yesterday's spilled cherry pie. Sunlight, weak and watery, barely manages to seep through the grimy windows. Chrome glistens dully on the counter stools and vinyl booths are cracked in places, revealing glimpses of faded red underneath.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Mae Johnson hummed a tune under her breath that she only half-recognized, likely a relic from her grandmother's record collection. She wiped down the sticky counter at the Rusty Spoon Diner for the fourth time that morning, her movements efficient and practiced. The sun, or what passed for it this early, cast long shadows across the checkered linoleum floor. Outside, Harmony Creek was just beginning to stir; inside, she was queen of her domain, at least until old man Henderson lumbered in for his usual stack of pancakes and complaints about the weather.

Eliza Mae took a sip of the lukewarm coffee she'd brewed almost an hour ago, grimacing slightly. It was a Tuesday, which meant a slow drip of regulars and a relentless stream of truckers stopping for a quick bite before hitting the highway again. Not her favorite, but it paid the bills. She glanced at the chipped clock above the griddle. Another thirteen minutes until her shift officially started, and she could finally swap her worn-out sneakers for the less-worn-out ones in her locker.

She sighed, a puff of warm air condensing momentarily in the chilly diner air. Tuesdays. At least they were predictable. And predictability, Eliza Mae thought, was a comfort she could always count on in Harmony Creek.
