## Story Opening:

The clatter of Mildred Agnes Plum's mechanical keyboard was the soundtrack to her Monday mornings, a rhythmic punctuation mark in the symphony of fluorescent hum and distant city sirens. Today, however, the usual efficiency was replaced by a nervous staccato. Her fingers hovered over the "File" button, hesitating like a child before a cold pool. Mr. Bartholomew Finch, her notoriously unpredictable boss, had summoned her to his office at 9:00 sharp, a summons delivered with the chilling brevity of a telegram. "See me. Immed." That cryptic message, coupled with the strange hush that had fallen over the usually boisterous advertising firm, Finch & Featherstone, sent a shiver of unease down Mildred's spine. What could possibly be so urgent, so secretive, that required her presence before even the smell of freshly brewed coffee had permeated the air?

## Setting:

The year is 1957. Finch & Featherstone occupies the 17th floor of the Deco Tower in downtown Chicago, a towering monument of steel and ambition. Polished brass and gleaming walnut paneling speak to a bygone era of prosperity and unwavering confidence in the American dream. The air hangs thick with the aroma of expensive tobacco and Old Spice aftershave. Mildred's office, a small, rectangular space carved out of the larger secretarial pool, is a testament to organized efficiency. Every pencil is sharpened to a perfect point, every file meticulously labeled in her neat cursive. A small vase holds a single, vibrant red carnation, a splash of color against the muted tones of beige and grey that dominate the office. The window, offering a dizzying view of the city sprawling below, is perpetually grimy, a constant reminder of the grit and grime that fueled the engine of progress. The overall ambiance is one of controlled chaos, a bustling hive of creativity buzzing just beneath a veneer of polished professionalism.
