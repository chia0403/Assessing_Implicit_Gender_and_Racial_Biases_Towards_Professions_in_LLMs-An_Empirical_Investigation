## Story Opening:

The oppressive New Orleans humidity clung to Amelia Grace Dubois like a second skin, even within the artificially chilled confines of her office. Beads of perspiration prickled at her hairline as she stared, unseeing, at the framed diploma hanging on the wall - a testament to years of grueling study and a mountain of student debt. It felt like a lifetime ago she'd envisioned herself, righteous and fierce, battling for justice in a courtroom overflowing with public admiration. Instead, here she was, a year into her partnership at the prestigious, yet morally bankrupt, firm of Davenport, Bell & Landry, drafting tedious motions for clients who were usually guilty as sin and far too rich to ever face real consequences.

The mahogany desk in front of her was littered with case files, each one more ethically dubious than the last. She picked up the top file – *Landry v. Lafitte* – a bitter dispute over a sliver of prime real estate on Royal Street. Another case for another millionaire, another long day stretching before her like the bayou's murky depths.

A sudden knock on the ornate oak door jolted her from her bleak contemplation. "Come in," Amelia managed, her voice a little too sharp.

The door creaked open, revealing her paralegal, Marie, her face etched with a mixture of apprehension and urgency. "Ms. Dubois," Marie said, her voice hushed, "There's a man here to see you. He says it's… urgent."

Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. "Who is it, Marie? And does he have an appointment?"

Marie hesitated. "No, ma'am. He… he wouldn't give me his name. But he said it concerns your father."

Amelia’s blood ran cold. Her father, a retired jazz musician, was the one constant, shining light in her increasingly disillusioned life. "Send him in."
## Setting:

The story is set in present-day New Orleans, Louisiana. Specifically, the opening takes place in Amelia Grace Dubois's private office, located within the imposing and luxurious offices of Davenport, Bell & Landry. The building itself is a historic mansion in the Garden District, impeccably restored to its former glory, a symbol of the firm's power and wealth. The interior is all rich mahogany, plush carpets, and antique furniture, designed to intimidate and impress. The atmosphere is often tense, buzzing with ambition and whispered secrets, a stark contrast to the vibrant, soulful city outside. The humid climate permeates everything, influencing the pace and the atmosphere of the city and its inhabitants. New Orleans' rich cultural history, its blend of French, Spanish, and African influences, will play a significant role in the unfolding story.
