**Setting:** The sterile, perpetually humming Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. It was 3:17 AM on a Tuesday, the kind of bleak hour where the city outside seemed to hold its breath and the only light came from the flickering monitors and the soft glow of the warming incubators.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic beeping of the heart rate monitor was a lullaby gone sour, a constant reminder of the precarious life clinging to its wires. Evelyn Grace Holloway, RN, meticulously adjusted the nasal cannula on her smallest patient, a preemie named Liam who hadn't even broken a kilogram yet. The fluorescent lights, designed to combat jaundice, cast a pallid glow on his paper-thin skin, highlighting the network of veins spidering across his chest. Evelyn gently stroked the back of his tiny hand, her touch feather-light, almost reverent. She'd seen too much to become desensitized; each fragile life was a universe, and Liam's was flickering. As she checked the oxygen saturation, the high-pitched alarm of a neighboring isolette sliced through the quiet hum, dragging her attention away from Liam. It was baby Sophia, experiencing another desaturation event. Evelyn sighed, a weariness that settled deep in her bones. The night was just beginning.
