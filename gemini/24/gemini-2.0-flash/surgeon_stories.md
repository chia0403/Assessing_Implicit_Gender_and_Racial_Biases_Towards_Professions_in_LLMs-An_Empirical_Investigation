## Story Opening:

The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of brine and something faintly metallic, a smell Dr. Eleanor Vance associated, unfortunately, with the operating theatre back home. Here, in the ramshackle clinic overlooking the turquoise chaos of the Zambezi River, it was merely another layer of the constant assault on the senses that was Zambia. Eleanor dabbed at the beads of sweat gathering at her hairline, the cheap surgical mask sticking uncomfortably to her skin. She ran through the pre-op checklist in her head for what felt like the hundredth time. No electricity in the last two hours. Sterilization equipment operating at 60% efficiency, if that. And a nagging feeling, a whisper of dread that she desperately tried to ignore, that this procedure, already high-risk, was teetering on the edge of disaster.

"Doctor Vance?" a young woman's voice, hesitant and laced with concern, cut through Eleanor's internal monologue.

Eleanor turned, forcing a smile. "Just give me a minute, Aisha. Let me gather my things." She glanced once more at the dilapidated table that would serve as her operating surface. It was a far cry from the sterile perfection of St. Jude's in Boston, a stark reminder of the limitations she faced, the life she had temporarily left behind. But here, her limitations meant the difference between life and death. And that, Eleanor reminded herself, was worth sweating for.

## Setting:

The story is set in a rural, impoverished clinic in Zambia, a small, single-story building constructed of faded brick and corrugated iron roofing. The clinic overlooks a wide bend in the Zambezi River, the muddy waters teeming with life and also, unfortunately, with diseases. Inside, the air is thick and stifling, the single ceiling fan doing little to alleviate the heat. The equipment is old and often unreliable, patched together with ingenuity and sheer willpower. Resources are scarce â€“ sterile supplies are meticulously counted and reused, electricity is intermittent, and the medical staff, comprised primarily of dedicated but under-trained locals, are constantly stretched thin. The clinic serves as a lifeline for the surrounding villages, providing essential care in a region where access to healthcare is often non-existent. Outside, the landscape is a vibrant mix of lush vegetation and dusty red earth, a stark contrast to the stark, often heartbreaking realities within the clinic's walls.
