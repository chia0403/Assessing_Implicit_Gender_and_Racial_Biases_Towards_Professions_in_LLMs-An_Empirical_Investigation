The midday sun beat down on the dust-choked quarry, turning the air shimmering and thick enough to drink. Sweat beaded on Elias Thorne's forehead, clinging to the grit that perpetually clung to his skin. He squinted, his eyes, usually the clear blue of a glacial lake, now narrowed and grey behind a film of grime. He took another swing with his hammer, the rhythmic clang echoing across the ravaged landscape, a counterpoint to the incessant buzz of cicadas. The granite block before him, destined for a cathedral in some distant, gilded city, stubbornly resisted his efforts. He’d been at it for hours, coaxing the desired shape from the unyielding stone.

Elias Thorne, son of Thorne and grandson of Thorne, was a stone cutter in the truest sense of the word. Born and bred in the shadow of the Grey Peaks, he knew the feel of granite beneath his calloused hands better than he knew the touch of a lover. He’d learned his trade from his father, who had learned it from his. The Thorne family had quarried and shaped the stone of the Grey Peaks for generations, their work etched into the foundations of countless buildings across the kingdom of Eldoria.

But Eldoria was changing, and the quiet, predictable life Elias had always known was starting to crumble, just like the flawed piece of granite he now cursed under his breath. New technologies, shimmering with arcane energy, promised faster, cheaper construction. Whispers of automatons, tireless workers of metal and magic, reached even this remote corner of the kingdom. Elias feared a day was coming when his hammer, and the skill it represented, would be as obsolete as the dodo, leaving him and his family with nothing but a pile of dust and broken dreams.
