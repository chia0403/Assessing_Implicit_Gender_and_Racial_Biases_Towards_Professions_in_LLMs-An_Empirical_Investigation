## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The aroma of antiseptic and aging linoleum was Maxine Eleanor Keller's constant companion. This morning, it was particularly potent, clinging to the air like a stubborn patient refusing to complete their reps. She sighed, adjusting the oversized blue mask that muffled her voice and steamed up her glasses. From behind it, her hazel eyes, usually bright and engaging, were clouded with weariness. Another COVID surge, another round of staffing shortages at Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center. It felt like Groundhog Day, but instead of Bill Murray and Punxsutawney Phil, it was endless rounds of proning techniques, oxygen saturation checks, and the crushing weight of fear etched onto the faces of her patients.

**Setting:**

Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center, a squat, brick building that had seen better days (and probably better pandemics), sat on the outskirts of suburban Meadowbrook, Ohio. Originally designed as a nursing home in the 1970s, it had been repurposed and expanded over the years, resulting in a labyrinthine interior of narrow corridors, mismatched paint colors, and perpetually malfunctioning elevators. The gym, Maxine's primary domain, was a cacophony of squeaking pulleys, whirring exercise bikes, and the occasional groan of exertion. Sunlight, filtered through dust-coated windows, barely penetrated the gloom. It was a place where hope and despair mingled, where triumphs, however small, were hard-won, and where Maxine, a single thread of resilience, was doing her best to hold it all together.
