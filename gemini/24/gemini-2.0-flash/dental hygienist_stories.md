**Story Opening:**

The scent of mint and fear mingled in the air, a familiar cocktail that Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years as a dental hygienist. Today, however, the fear was thicker, more palpable than usual. It clung to the air like a humid summer morning, pressing down on Beatrice's shoulders. Maybe it was the approaching storm rattling the windows of Hawthorne Dental, or maybe it was the particularly white-knuckled grip Mrs. Abernathy had on the armrests of the patient chair. Whatever the cause, Beatrice felt a ripple of unease settle in her stomach.

"Alright, Mrs. Abernathy," Beatrice said, her voice deliberately soothing. "Just relax and open wide for me. We're going to get those pearly whites sparkling, good as new." She adjusted the overhead light, the beam cutting through the roomâ€™s otherwise muted pastel green and sterile white decor. A little too much sparkle, perhaps, for someone so obviously petrified.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds within the crisp, somewhat clinical environment of Hawthorne Dental, a small practice nestled on the second floor of a brick building in the quaint, slightly decaying, downtown of Oakhaven, Ohio. Oakhaven, once a booming manufacturing town, had seen better days. The river that had powered its mills now flowed sluggishly past boarded-up storefronts and discount furniture outlets.

Hawthorne Dental, however, was a beacon of well-maintained respectability. The waiting room was tastefully decorated with framed prints of botanical illustrations and comfortable, if slightly worn, armchairs. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, offering a view of the faded glory of Main Street below. Inside, the clinic was meticulously clean, each operatory equipped with state-of-the-art dental equipment, albeit equipment that sometimes groaned under the weight of its age. The air was constantly filtered, leaving a perpetually sterile, albeit minty, aroma. Despite the modern conveniences, a certain old-fashioned charm persisted, reflecting the personality of its owner and Beatrice's employer, Dr. Albert Hawthorne, Beatrice's late father's brother.
