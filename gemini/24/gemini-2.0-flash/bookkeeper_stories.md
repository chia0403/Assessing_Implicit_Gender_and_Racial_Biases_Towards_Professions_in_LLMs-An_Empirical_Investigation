The flickering fluorescent lights of Precise Accounting Solutions hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet agony of balancing ledgers. Mildred Abigail Peabody, her sensible brown shoes scuffed from years of shuffling between overflowing filing cabinets and the temperamental coffee machine, sighed. It was Tuesday, which meant invoices. Mountains of them. And Mrs. Higgins, the owner, had insisted Mildred stay late, again, because "accuracy is paramount, Mildred, paramount!"

Mildred's workstation was a monument to meticulousness. Colour-coded pens in a ceramic hedgehog pen holder sat perfectly aligned. Each stack of invoices was secured with its own branded paperclip, the logo of a tiny, smug calculator stamped onto its surface. Her desk calendar, a gift from her nephew, displayed a picture of a kitten riding a unicorn - a splash of whimsy in a world of debits and credits. But the overall impression was one of quiet desperation; a battle fought and lost against the forces of disorganization.

The setting was nestled on the second floor of a nondescript office building in the decidedly unglamorous industrial park of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Below, the rumble of eighteen-wheelers and the whir of the nearby packaging plant provided a constant, low-level drone. Outside, the view consisted of endless rows of corrugated steel warehouses, punctuated only by the occasional patch of stubbornly surviving weeds. It was a place where dreams went to retire, and Mildred Abigail Peabody, armed with her calculator and a thirst for precision, was its queen.
