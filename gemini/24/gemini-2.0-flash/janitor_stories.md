Bertram, a man who preferred the quiet rustle of old books to the glittering clamor of champagne flutes, was the hotel's resident night janitor. The setting was 3:17 AM, Tuesday, in the hotel's opulent, yet eerily silent, ballroom. Crystal chandeliers, dusted and gleaming thanks to Bertram's meticulous efforts, hung like frozen waterfalls above a polished dance floor that hadn't felt a shoe's scrape since the previous Saturday's charity gala. Bertram, armed with his trusty mop and a bucket of pine-scented cleaner, was making his rounds, meticulously erasing the remnants of laughter and spilled canap√©s from the previous night's revelry. The silence, usually a balm to Bertram's introverted soul, felt heavy tonight, a tangible pressure in the air that made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.
