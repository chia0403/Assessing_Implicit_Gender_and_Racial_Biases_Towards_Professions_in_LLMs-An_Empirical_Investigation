The rain hammered against the windows of the Willow Creek Senior Living Facility, a steady, insistent drumming that mirrored the restless energy bubbling inside Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth. It was late, almost eight o'clock, and the fluorescent lights of the therapy room hummed with a monotonous buzz that did little to soothe her frayed nerves. Beatrice, a woman built more for sunshine and vibrant watercolors than sterile linoleum and institutional beige, was staring intently at the latest addition to her caseload: a hand-drawn portrait of a rather grumpy-looking bulldog taped to the wall. Beside it, a collection of mismatched buttons spilled out of a plastic bin, a forlorn rainbow against the dull background.

Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of perpetually overcast Oregon, wasn't a bad place. The staff, for the most part, were dedicated, and the residents, despite their varying degrees of physical and cognitive limitations, each possessed a flicker of personality that Beatrice desperately sought to ignite. But the sheer volume of need, the constant parade of broken bodies and fading minds, often left Beatrice feeling like she was bailing out a leaky ship with a teacup. Tonight, the bulldog portrait and the scattered buttons were her next challenge - a starting point in unlocking something, anything, within the withdrawn shell of a new resident, Mr. Henderson.
