## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The unrelenting, fluorescent hum of the North Chicago Mall food court was a soundtrack to Amelia Isabella Rossi's impending doom. It was 3:15 PM on a Tuesday in mid-January, a purgatory between lunch rush and after-school hangouts. The faux-marble tables gleamed, untouched except for the occasional lingering crumb. Outside, a grey sky threatened more snow, promising to bury the already sparse foot traffic.

**Opening:** Amelia Isabella Rossi, Senior Sales Representative for "Heavenly Comfort" – a company specializing in memory foam mattresses and adjustable bed frames – plastered a professional smile on her face, despite the churning anxiety in her stomach. She straightened the display stand, ensuring the tiny, plush mattress samples were perfectly aligned. Today was a particularly critical day; Regional Manager Brenda was supposed to be arriving any minute for a surprise performance review. Amelia hadn't made a sale in five days. Five agonizing, soul-crushing days of polite nods, weary sighs, and the overwhelming scent of Sbarro pizza clinging to her polyester suit. If Brenda didn’t see some serious numbers, Amelia was pretty sure she’d be trading in her "Heavenly Comfort" nametag for a hairnet at the Orange Julius stand across the way. And frankly, the thought of blending strawberries for the rest of her life was only slightly less terrifying than facing Brenda right now. She checked her reflection in the polished chrome of the stand, adjusted her scarf, and muttered a silent prayer to the patron saint of struggling salespeople. "Please, San Generico, just one sale. Just one damn adjustable bed."
