Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a logger main character:

**Setting:**

The biting wind snaked through the towering pines of the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, hemlock needles, and the faint, metallic tang of snow on the horizon. The year was 1978, and the last vestiges of summer were clinging desperately to the lower slopes. The trees, giants clad in green and grey, cast long shadows that danced with the shifting clouds overhead. Nestled deep within the forest, beside a rushing, glacial-fed stream called "Salmon's Leap," stood a small, weathered logging camp. A collection of rough-hewn cabins, a generator shed, and a central mess hall buzzed with activity as the logging crew prepared for another day battling the wilderness.

**Story Opening:**

The shriek of the two-man saw cut through the dawn chorus like a rusty knife. Bartholomew "Bart" O’Malley, a man built like an oak himself, spat a stream of chewing tobacco into the undergrowth. He wiped his brow with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. Bart glanced over at his partner, a wiry, young Tlingit man named David Kaa, who was already adjusting the saw's tension. "Another beauty day in paradise, wouldn't you say, David?" Bart's voice, rough as bark, carried over the rushing water of Salmon's Leap.

David grunted in response, his dark eyes fixed on the task at hand. The silence stretched, broken only by the drone of the distant generator and the rustling leaves. Bart knew David wasn't one for idle chatter, especially before the first cup of coffee had burned its way down his throat. But the silence didn't bother Bart. He’d spent enough time in the forest to understand its language – the creak of branches, the whisper of wind, the warning call of a raven. It was a language he understood far better than most human tongues. He took another chaw of his tobacco, already steeling himself for the day's work. This old-growth Spruce was stubborn and hard, it might take the whole day to topple.
