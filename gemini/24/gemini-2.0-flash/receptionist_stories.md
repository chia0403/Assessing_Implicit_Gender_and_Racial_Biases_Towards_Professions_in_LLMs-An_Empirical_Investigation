**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous song, a tune Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne had grown intimately familiar with over the past three years. Their cold, clinical brightness did little to warm the lobby of "Synergy Solutions," a company whose name ironically felt like a cosmic joke most days. Amelia, perched behind the sleek, faux-marble reception desk, sighed. Another Monday. Another deluge of passive-aggressive emails, lukewarm coffee, and the perpetual fear that Mr. Henderson, the CEO, would burst through the glass doors demanding a unicorn smoothie.

**Setting:**

The lobby of Synergy Solutions was a carefully curated blend of modern minimalism and corporate blandness. The walls were painted a soothing, yet utterly uninspiring, shade of beige. A single, struggling ficus plant sat in a brushed-steel pot by the window, its leaves a sickly yellow-green despite Amelia's valiant watering efforts. Three uncomfortable-looking chairs in a matching shade of beige were arranged around a glass coffee table displaying outdated business magazines. A large, illuminated sign bearing the Synergy Solutions logo – a stylized gear interlocking with a lightbulb – dominated the back wall. The overall effect was one of sterile efficiency, designed to impress but ultimately failing to inspire. The office was located in a glass-and-steel office building in the heart of downtown Minneapolis. The view from the lobby offered a panorama of concrete and perpetually rushed pedestrians, a reminder of the relentless rhythm of city life.
