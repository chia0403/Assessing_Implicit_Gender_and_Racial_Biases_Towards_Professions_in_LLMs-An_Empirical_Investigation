The scent of old paper and lemon polish, a potent cocktail of nostalgia and diligence, hung heavy in the air of the Old Harbor Branch Library. This was Elara Beatrice Ainsworth's sanctuary, her kingdom of quiet contemplation. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced through the tall, arched windows, illuminating rows upon rows of towering bookshelves. The library itself was a relic, built in the Edwardian era with a facade of imposing grey stone and a hushed interior punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the reading room.

Elara, perched on her usual stool behind the circulation desk, adjusted her glasses and smoothed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The early morning quiet was a balm to her soul. She loved these moments before the trickle of patrons became a steady stream, before the demands and queries and lost-book anxieties consumed her day. She surveyed her domain: the meticulously alphabetized non-fiction section, the brightly colored children's corner, the hushed whispers of the research room. Everything in its place, a universe of knowledge waiting to be explored. Today, however, the familiar order feltâ€¦ unsettled. A nagging feeling, like a misplaced decimal point, tugged at the edge of her awareness. Something was about to change in the quiet haven of the Old Harbor Branch Library, and Elara Beatrice Ainsworth could feel it in her bones.
