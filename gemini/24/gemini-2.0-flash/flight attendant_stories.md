## The Setting:

**A cramped, galley kitchen at the rear of a Boeing 777-300ER, somewhere over the vast, shimmering expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The air hums with the low thrum of the engines and vibrates with the clatter of meal carts being hastily prepared. Dim, fluorescent lights cast a sterile glow on the stainless steel surfaces, reflecting the harried faces of the crew. Outside, the relentless blue stretches to the horizon, offering a breathtaking, yet ultimately isolating, view. Scattered throughout the galley are half-eaten crew meals, discarded beverage napkins, and the lingering scent of reheated lasagna and jet fuel.**

## The Story Opening:

**Penelope Rosewater O’Malley swore silently under her breath as she wrestled with the recalcitrant latch on the beverage cart. Flight 407 from Los Angeles to Sydney was only three hours in, and she was already battling a malfunctioning cart, a crying baby in row 42, and a passenger who insisted on ordering his tomato juice with a ludicrous amount of Worcestershire sauce. "Bloody Mary mix, then," she'd finally snapped, handing him a pre-mixed can just to shut him up. Now, as she jiggled the latch again, she could feel a headache blooming behind her eyes, a familiar harbinger of another long-haul flight pushing her limits. Penelope had always dreamed of seeing the world, of soaring above the clouds, but the reality of cramped spaces, demanding passengers, and lukewarm coffee was beginning to eclipse the romantic vision she'd once held. As the latch finally gave way with a protesting screech, she caught her reflection in the polished metal – tired eyes, a smudge of rogue mascara under one, and a forced smile plastered on her face. “Just another twelve hours, Penelope,” she muttered to herself, adjusting her perfectly positioned scarf. “Just another twelve hours.”**
