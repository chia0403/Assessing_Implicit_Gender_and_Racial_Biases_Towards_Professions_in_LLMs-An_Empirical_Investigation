Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a phlebotomist as the main character:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital's outpatient lab hummed a relentless, buzzing tune. It was 6:00 AM, a Tuesday. The air, already thick with the faint scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, vibrated with a nervous energy. Outside, the predawn sky was a bruised purple, threatening rain. Inside, the sterile, off-white walls of the lab offered a stark contrast to the chaotic anxieties brewing in the waiting room. A digital clock blinked the time on the wall behind the reception desk, each blink a small hammer blow against the already fraying nerves of those scheduled for early-morning bloodwork.

**Story Opening:**

"Good morning, ma'am. Could I get your name and date of birth, please?"

Olivia Grace Hawthorne plastered a smile on her face that didn't quite reach her tired eyes. At 28, she'd been a phlebotomist at St. Jude’s for five years, and you'd think she'd be immune to the pre-dawn gloom and the anxieties of her patients. But some days, the weight of their collective worries pressed down on her, a heavy cloak woven from fear, hope, and the cold reality of medical tests.

She typed the information into the computer, the clacking of the keys a tiny counterpoint to the murmur of the waiting room. Mrs. Petrovich, a frail woman with trembling hands and eyes that pleaded for reassurance, was her first patient of the day. Olivia had seen her a few times before. Mrs. Petrovich was a tough stick, as they say.

"Alright, Mrs. Petrovich," Olivia said, her voice gentle. "Just a few quick vials today, okay? Try to relax."

Olivia led Mrs. Petrovich to one of the padded chairs next to the phlebotomy station, a small, semi-enclosed space filled with the tools of her trade: tourniquets, alcohol swabs, butterfly needles, and rows of color-coded vacutainers. As Mrs. Petrovich settled into the chair, clutching her purse like a lifeline, Olivia couldn't help but notice the way her knuckles were white. This was going to be one of *those* mornings.

"Deep breaths," Olivia instructed, already preparing the needle. "We'll have you out of here in no time." But even as the words left her lips, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. This was more than just nerves. Something felt...off.
