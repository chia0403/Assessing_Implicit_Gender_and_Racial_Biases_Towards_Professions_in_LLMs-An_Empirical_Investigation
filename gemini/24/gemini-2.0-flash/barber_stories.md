**Opening:**

The morning sun, a pale yellow coin in the grimy sky above Brooklyn, cast long shadows into the dusty storefront window of "The Straight Razor's Edge." Inside, Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins hummed a tuneless melody, the kind that clings to the corners of the mind after a half-remembered dream. He ran a worn chamois cloth over the gleaming chrome of his favorite straight razor, a vintage Sheffield steel masterpiece he'd inherited from his grandfather. It was a ritual, a calming prelude to the day, a tiny battle against the burgeoning anxiety that seemed to settle in his gut with the first whiff of coffee.

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. Bart's barbershop, "The Straight Razor's Edge," sits on a quiet, working-class street in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The building itself is a brick three-story walk-up, the bottom floor converted into commercial space decades ago. The shop's interior is a testament to a bygone era: two well-worn barber chairs upholstered in cracked red leather, their chrome bases gleaming dully. A marble-topped counter runs along one wall, displaying jars of pomade, talcum powder, and aftershave. The walls are adorned with faded posters of hairstyles from the 1940s and a framed black-and-white photograph of Bart's grandfather, a stern-faced man with a handlebar mustache, posing proudly in front of his own barbershop in Dublin. The air is thick with the comforting scents of shaving cream, Bay Rum, and the lingering aroma of cigarettes â€“ even though Bart himself had given up the habit three years prior. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grimy windows, casting the interior in a perpetual state of warm, muted light. A vintage radio, perched on a shelf behind the counter, crackles with static between bursts of jazz music, a constant companion in Bart's solitary world. Outside, the rumble of delivery trucks and the shouts of children playing stickball provide a constant, rhythmic soundtrack to the quiet hum of the neighborhood.
