The insistent chirping of her phone sliced through the idyllic quiet of Amelia Rose Thornton's meticulously organized home office. Sunlight streamed through the sheer linen curtains, illuminating a world map hanging on the wall, dotted with tiny flags marking destinations she'd either visited or meticulously researched. The scent of lavender from a diffuser mingled with the subtle aroma of freshly brewed chamomile tea – her morning ritual to ward off the anxieties that were becoming increasingly common in the ever-changing travel industry. 

Amelia sighed, pushing aside a brochure showcasing the dazzling fjords of Norway. Another email, most likely a cancellation or a frantic plea for rebooking due to some unforeseen global event. With a practiced flick of her wrist, she silenced the alarm and reached for the sleek, silver device. It wasn't an email. It was a message, from an unknown number, accompanied by a blurred photograph of a crumbling sandstone building. The caption simply read: "Find me. Marrakech."

Marrakech. A city Amelia had dreamed of visiting since she was a child, lured by tales of exotic spice markets and ancient palaces. A knot tightened in her stomach. This wasn't just another client with a travel mishap. This felt… different.
