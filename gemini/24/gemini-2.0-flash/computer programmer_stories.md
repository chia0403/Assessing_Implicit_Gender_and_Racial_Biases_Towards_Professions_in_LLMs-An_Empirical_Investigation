The flickering neon sign of "Greasy Spoon Diner - Open 24/7" hummed a discordant lullaby into the pre-dawn air. It was 3:17 AM, and the only other souls inhabiting booth number six were a half-eaten stack of pancakes drowning in syrup and the lingering ghosts of regret. Across from this sugary massacre sat Evelyn Grace Holloway, her eyes glued to the code scrolling across the cracked screen of her ancient, but beloved, ThinkPad.

The diner, situated on the edge of San Francisco's SoMa district, was a sanctuary of sorts. During the day, it was a bustling hive of tech bros and weary construction workers. At night, it was a haven for the insomniacs, the lost, and the desperate, all united by a craving for bottomless coffee and a brief respite from the city's relentless pulse. Tonight, Evelyn belonged firmly in the "desperate" category. Deadline pressure had escalated into a full-blown panic attack fueled by lukewarm coffee and the nagging suspicion that her entire career hung precariously on this one project: a revolutionary AI designed to manage the city's increasingly strained public transportation system. If she failed, more than just her reputation was on the line. San Francisco would be plunged into gridlock, a chaotic symphony of honking horns and frustrated commuters, and Evelyn Grace Holloway would be the conductor.
