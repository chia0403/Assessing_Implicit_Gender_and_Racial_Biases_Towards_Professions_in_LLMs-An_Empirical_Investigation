**Story Opening:**

The scent of freshly turned earth and cut grass was as familiar to Theodore Alistair Finch as the lines etched into his own weathered hands. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of pale rose and bruised purple, a spectacle lost on most. But Theodore, on his early rounds, noticed. He always noticed. Today, however, the beauty was muted, overshadowed by the persistent, unsettling prickle at the back of his neck.

He paused, his hand still resting on the handle of his well-worn lawnmower, and scanned the grounds. The dew-kissed lawns of Oakhaven Manor stretched before him, impossibly green and manicured, a testament to his tireless efforts. Beyond the lawns, the ancient oaks stood sentinel, their gnarled branches reaching towards the heavens like skeletal fingers. Everything seemed perfectly normal. Birds chirped their morning chorus, a gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, and the grand, gothic architecture of the manor house loomed silently in the distance, its many windows like watchful eyes. Yet, Theodore couldn't shake the feeling of being observed.

He sighed, blaming it on too much strong coffee the night before. He was a groundskeeper, not a ghost hunter. Still, Oakhaven Manor had its share of local legends, whispers of tragic love affairs, hidden treasures, and restless spirits. Nonsense, of course. Theodore Alistair Finch believed in what he could see, touch, and prune.

He started the mower, the low rumble a familiar comfort. He'd spent the last twenty years tending to these grounds, nursing them through droughts and storms, coaxing beauty from stubborn soil. He knew every inch of Oakhaven, every root and stone. Whatever was making him uneasy, he told himself, he could handle it. After all, what could possibly go wrong at Oakhaven Manor today?

**Setting:**

*   **Location:** Oakhaven Manor, a sprawling estate located in the heart of the English countryside, about an hour's drive from the nearest major city.
*   **Time:** Early morning, around 5:30 AM, late spring.
*   **Atmosphere:** A blend of picturesque beauty and subtle unease. The grounds are meticulously maintained, creating a sense of order and tranquility, but the ancient architecture and the estate's history hint at something darker lurking beneath the surface. The air is crisp and clean, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth. There is a sense of isolation and stillness, broken only by the sounds of nature and the hum of Theodore's machinery.
*   **Oakhaven Manor Details**: Gothic Revival architecture. Tall, imposing structure with multiple wings, towers, and arched windows. Surrounded by extensive gardens, woodlands, and manicured lawns. Built on a site with a history dating back centuries.
