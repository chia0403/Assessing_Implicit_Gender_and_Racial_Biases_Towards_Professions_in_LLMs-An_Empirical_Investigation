The June sun was a relentless hammer on the back of Daniel Alistair Finch's neck as he wrestled a particularly stubborn azalea bush out of its pot. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth, a perfume that usually invigorated him but today felt suffocating. He tugged, grunted, and finally, with a wet, sucking pop, the root ball surrendered.

Daniel wiped his brow with the back of his dirt-streaked glove, leaving a muddy smear that did little to improve his already harried appearance. He was knee-deep in the manicured chaos of Mrs. Eleanor Pemberton's prize-winning rose garden in the affluent suburb of Oak Haven, Connecticut. Oak Haven was the kind of place where hydrangeas bloomed in a perfectly orchestrated symphony of blues and pinks, where lawns were manicured with the precision of a golf course, and where gossip spread faster than crabgrass.
