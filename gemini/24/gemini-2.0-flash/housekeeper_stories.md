The chipped porcelain teacup rattled in Maria Elena Rodriguez's hand, the faint tremor betraying a morning anxiety she usually kept buried deeper than the dust bunnies under the grand piano. Outside, the Pacific Ocean roared a defiant song against the cliffs of Monterey, but inside the opulent Victorian house, the air was thick with an unsettling silence. It wasnâ€™t just the usual absence of its inhabitants, the enigmatic and rarely-seen Mr. Silas Thorne and his equally elusive daughter, Eliza. This silence hummed, a low, discordant note vibrating through the very floorboards.

Maria Elena, for fifteen years the steadfast keeper of Thorne Manor, knew this house like the back of her hand. She knew which floorboard creaked under pressure, which window latch stuck in humid weather, and which portrait's eyes followed you as you walked past. And she knew that something was terribly, irrevocably wrong. The unsettling feeling had started yesterday, with the appearance of an unfamiliar car parked in the circular driveway, a sleek black vehicle that didn't belong amidst the vintage charm of the Thorne family's collection. Now, as the sun struggled to pierce the heavy fog swirling around the gothic turrets and gabled roofs, Maria Elena couldn't shake the premonition that the carefully curated tranquility of Thorne Manor was about to be shattered.
