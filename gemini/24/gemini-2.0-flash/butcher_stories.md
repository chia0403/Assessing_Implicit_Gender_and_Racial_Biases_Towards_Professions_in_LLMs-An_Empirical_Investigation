## Story Opening:

The morning mist clung to the cobblestones outside Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's butcher shop, "The Daily Grind," like a damp, unwelcome guest. The scent of sawdust and brine, usually so comforting to Barty, was swallowed whole by the oppressive fog, leaving a void that amplified the rhythmic thwack-thwack-thwacking of his cleaver. He worked with a practiced efficiency, separating a side of beef into manageable cuts. His face, usually ruddy with exertion, was pale, etched with the fatigue of a restless night. Barty hadnâ€™t slept well since Old Man Hemlock had been found facedown in the mud beside the Blackwood River, a gruesome sight even for someone accustomed to the sight of parted flesh.

## Setting:

The scene unfolds in the fictional town of Oakhaven, nestled in a valley perpetually shadowed by the brooding peaks of the Blackwood Mountains. Oakhaven is a town steeped in tradition, where the turning of the seasons dictates the rhythm of life. The buildings are predominantly built of dark grey stone, their roofs sloped sharply to shed the relentless rain. The Blackwood River, a churning, icy torrent, snakes its way through the town, separating the more prosperous uptown from the poorer, grittier dockside area where "The Daily Grind" stands. Barty's shop is small, but well-maintained, the front window meticulously cleaned and displaying a tempting array of sausages, hams, and roasts. Inside, the walls are lined with gleaming white tiles, the air thick with the pungent aroma of cured meats. The counter, worn smooth by years of use, bears the scars of countless chops and slices. It's a place of honest work, a cornerstone of the Oakhaven community, and Barty Finch, with his strong hands and quiet demeanor, is a fixture of that corner of the world.
