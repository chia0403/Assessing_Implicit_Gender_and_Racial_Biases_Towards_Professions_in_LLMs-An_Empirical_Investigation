The aroma of burnt oat milk hung thick in the air, a casualty of Amelia Rose Sterling’s attempt to multi-task between writing a perfectly worded article on the gut microbiome for *Modern Wellness* magazine and brewing her morning beverage. Amelia, head dietician at the prestigious Silver Spire Wellness Center and a stickler for routine, groaned. This was not how her Tuesday was supposed to start.

The Silver Spire Wellness Center, perched on the 47th floor of a gleaming skyscraper overlooking downtown Chicago, was a sanctuary of clean lines, muted greys, and the soft, repetitive hum of air purifiers. From Amelia’s corner office, nestled between the yoga studio and the aromatherapy treatment rooms, the city sprawled out like a miniature, chaotic diorama. She could see the shimmering expanse of Lake Michigan, its surface disturbed by tiny, industrious tugboats, and the endless ribbon of traffic snaking along Lakeshore Drive.

Her office, ironically, was the most cluttered space in the entire building. Bookshelves groaned under the weight of nutrition textbooks, research papers, and dog-eared cookbooks. Stacks of patient files teetered precariously on her desk, threatening to spill onto the floor where various half-dead succulents languished, victims of Amelia’s less-than-green thumb. A framed diploma from Johns Hopkins sat askew on the wall, a silent testament to the years she'd dedicated to mastering the science of food.

Despite the mess, the office was undeniably *hers*. It was a comfortable haven in a world obsessed with perfection, a place where Amelia Rose Sterling could be herself – a brilliant, slightly frazzled dietician, who secretly preferred a cheesy pizza to kale smoothies any day of the week. And today, a cheesy pizza sounded particularly appealing. Especially after cleaning up the burnt oat milk.
