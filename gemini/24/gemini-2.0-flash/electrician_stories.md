The acrid smell of ozone and burnt plastic clung to the air like a stubborn ghost. Amelia Grace Harding, her brow furrowed in concentration, carefully stripped the last inch of insulation from a frayed wire with her teeth. Damn things were always like this in the old Clocktower Theater, a temperamental beast of a building that demanded constant attention. The theater sat squat and proud in the heart of Havenwood, a town clinging to the side of the Appalachian Mountains like a tenacious vine. Havenwood was a place where time seemed to slow to a crawl, where gossip spread faster than wildfire, and where the annual Apple Butter Festival was considered the social event of the year. Amelia, however, didn’t care much for apple butter or gossip. She cared about circuits, amperage, and the satisfying click of a properly grounded wire.

The Clocktower itself was a relic, a Victorian monstrosity of ornate carvings and peeling paint. Its grand ballroom, now used for town meetings and the occasional wedding reception, boasted a crystal chandelier that Amelia swore was held together more by dust and hope than actual engineering. Tonight, though, the focus wasn't on shimmering lights or happy couples. Tonight was dress rehearsal for the Havenwood Players' rendition of "Our Town," and the stage lights, predictably, had decided to throw a tantrum. Amelia had been crawling around in the cramped, dusty space above the stage for the past three hours, battling cobwebs the size of dinner plates and wires that looked like they’d been gnawed on by rats. Sweat beaded on her forehead, and the gritty dust coated her denim overalls, but Amelia was determined to conquer this electrical gremlin before curtain call. This theater, with all its quirks and flaws, was Havenwood’s heart, and Amelia Grace Harding wasn’t about to let its light go out.
