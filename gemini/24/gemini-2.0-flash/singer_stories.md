The scent of spilled beer, stale cigarettes, and desperation clung to the air of O'Malley's Pub like a second skin. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the neon shamrock that sputtered intermittently above the door. Inside, a handful of regulars nursed their pints, their faces illuminated by the flickering candlelight on sticky, scarred tables. It wasn’t the kind of place that usually housed dreams, but tonight, buried beneath the low hum of conversation and the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet, was a single, fragile one.

On the tiny, makeshift stage, bathed in the sickly yellow glow of a single spotlight, stood Seraphina Beatrice Nightingale. She clutched the microphone stand, her knuckles white. Her throat felt tight, constricted by a nervousness that always seemed to bloom just before she had to open her mouth and unleash the power she knew lay within. Her dress, a simple black number she'd found at a vintage store, suddenly felt too short, too tight, too… much. This wasn't the Carnegie Hall she dreamed of, but it was a stage, and it was all she had. Tonight, in this dilapidated Irish pub in the heart of a rain-swept Boston, Seraphina was going to sing her heart out, and maybe, just maybe, someone would finally hear it.
