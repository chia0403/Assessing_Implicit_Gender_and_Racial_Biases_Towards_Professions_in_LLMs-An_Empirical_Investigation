Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a firefighter:

**Story Opening:**

The screech of the alarm, a high-pitched banshee wail, sliced through the thick, humid Louisiana air and jolted Evangeline "Eva" Broussard awake. She swore, a colorful Cajun curse that would have made her grandmother blush, and swung her legs over the edge of the cot. The red digits of the clock on the wall of the bunkroom glared back at her: 3:17 AM. Three-seventeen in the damn morning. Just when she'd finally managed to drift off after a particularly grueling shift battling a brush fire that threatened to engulf half of St. Martin Parish.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the fire station of the St. Martin Parish Fire Department, Station 12, located in the small, rural town of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. The station is a modest, single-story building, built of red brick and showing its age.  The walls are painted a practical, if uninspiring, pale green.

Inside, the station is a mix of organized chaos. The bunkroom is cramped, housing six cots, each with a small locker at its head. A worn, leather recliner sits in a corner, its armrests stained with coffee and smelling faintly of smoke. Outside the bunkroom, a small, functional kitchen opens onto a larger common area dominated by a heavy oak table where the crew plays cards, eats meals, and occasionally argues over the merits of different brands of hot sauce.

The air hangs thick and heavy, saturated with the scent of diesel, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering aroma of burning wood.  Outside, the humid Louisiana night presses close, a blanket of darkness punctuated only by the blinking red lights of the radio tower and the chirping of crickets. The sounds of the bayou, the distant croaking of frogs and the rustling of unseen creatures, are a constant, subtle reminder of the wild, untamed landscape that surrounds them.
