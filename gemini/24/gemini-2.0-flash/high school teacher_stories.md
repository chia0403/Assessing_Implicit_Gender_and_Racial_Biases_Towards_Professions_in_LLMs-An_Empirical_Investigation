## Story Opening:

The stale, lemon-scented air of room 204 hung heavy as Ms. Eleanor Abigail Finch surveyed the battlefield before her. A confetti storm of crumpled paper airplanes littered the linoleum floor, a testament to the free-period anarchy that had just concluded. Two weeks. Two weeks until summer vacation. Two weeks until she could escape the relentless tide of hormones, apathy, and the persistent, soul-crushing scent of adolescent desperation that clung to the hallways of Northwood High.

Eleanor sighed, a sound barely audible above the rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights. She pinched the bridge of her nose, the familiar ache settling in behind her eyes. She loved teaching English Literature, truly, but some days it felt like she was trying to sculpt marble with a rubber chicken. Today, judging by the debris field, had been one of those days. She reached for the broom tucked in the corner, the worn bristles her only allies in this Sisyphean task.

The metallic clang of the bell sliced through the relative quiet, signaling the start of seventh period: Advanced Placement Literature. Ah, the blessed relief of students who actually *wanted* to be there. At least, that's what she told herself.

## Setting:

**Northwood High School, a sprawling, brick-and-mortar testament to 1970s educational architecture.** The school is located in the fictional suburb of Crestwood, nestled just outside a bustling city. Crestwood is a town known for its manicured lawns, meticulously planned cul-de-sacs, and the unspoken pressure to conform. Northwood reflects this atmosphere, a mix of striving for academic excellence and a subtle undercurrent of social anxiety. The interior is characterized by long, echoing hallways, drab beige walls punctuated by the occasional faded motivational poster, and classrooms furnished with worn, mismatched desks. The teachers' lounge, a dimly lit sanctuary filled with the aroma of stale coffee and quiet desperation, is Eleanor's refuge. Outside, a sprawling sports field provides a backdrop for Friday night football games and the collective hopes of the town.
