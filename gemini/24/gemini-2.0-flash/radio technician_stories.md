## Story Opening:

The hum of the tubes was Elias Thorne's lullaby. He knew it intimately, the subtle variances that spoke of healthy power flow, a capacitor on its last legs, or the faintest whisper of interference from somewhere beyond the pine-covered peaks. He breathed it in, a comforting mechanical incense that masked the lingering scent of pine cleaner and stale coffee that clung to everything in the control room.

Elias adjusted the tuning knob of the vintage Collins receiver, his gnarled fingers moving with a practiced grace that belied their age. Static crackled, a chaotic symphony of electromagnetic noise punctuated by the occasional bleed-through of a distant, garbled broadcast. He frowned, his brow furrowing beneath his thinning grey hair. Something felt…off. Not broken, exactly, but…*wrong*. The static felt heavier tonight, denser, almost like it was trying to *say* something. He knew it was probably just the weather, a freak atmospheric event, but a prickle of unease danced on the back of his neck, a familiar warning that he'd learned to heed over his forty years as a radio technician.

He reached for his battered, thermos, the metal lukewarm against his palm. Just a little caffeine to sharpen the focus. He needed to pinpoint the source of the anomalous static before it interfered with the nightly broadcast of "Tales of the Old West" - the lifeblood of KWVA, the last bastion of analog radio in the forgotten corner of the Redwood National Park.

## Setting:

KWVA, 104.3 FM, was a relic, a time capsule tucked away in the small, unincorporated community of Whispering Pines, California. The station occupied a single-story, cinderblock building perched precariously on a hillside overlooking the town. The exterior was painted a faded, almost ghostly white, the paint peeling in places, revealing the grey block beneath. A rusty antenna tower, a skeletal giant, stood sentry behind the building, its red warning light blinking intermittently against the inky blackness of the night sky.

Inside, the control room was a cramped, cluttered space, a testament to years of accumulated equipment and neglect. Wires snaked across the floor, disappearing behind dusty consoles and racks overflowing with vacuum tubes, amplifiers, and signal generators. A wall map of California, dotted with faded pushpins marking other radio stations, hung crookedly above Elias's workbench. The only concession to modernity was a small, sputtering space heater that battled valiantly, but ultimately unsuccessfully, against the damp chill that permeated the Redwood forest. The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone, dust, and the faint, metallic tang of electricity. It was a lonely place, a place where the past clung stubbornly to the present, a place perfectly suited for the strange and unsettling things that Elias Thorne was about to encounter.
