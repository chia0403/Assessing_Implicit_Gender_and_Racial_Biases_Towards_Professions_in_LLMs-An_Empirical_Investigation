## Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless, rhythmic drumming against the frosted glass of the window, a soundtrack perfectly suited to Eleanor Rose Ainsworth's mood. Another Friday night, another mountain of documents to sift through, another lukewarm cup of gas station coffee that tasted suspiciously of burnt plastic. Outside, the neon glow of the "Law Offices of Stern, Blumenthal & Finch" sign bled into the downpour, a blurry promise that felt increasingly hollow. Eleanor leaned back in her creaky chair, the pleather groaning in protest, and pinched the bridge of her nose. It was going to be a long night. This was her penance, she supposed, for dreaming of a world beyond meticulously organizing evidence and chasing down missing signatures. This was life as a paralegal, and tonight, it felt crushingly small. The file she was currently wrestling with - "Estate of Arthur Finch, deceased" - lay open before her, a tapestry of convoluted legalese and simmering family resentments. It seemed even in death, Arthur Finch was still causing chaos. Eleanor sighed. Maybe she should just order a pizza. Extra cheese. And hope Mr. Blumenthal didn’t call her again to yell about billable hours.

## Setting:

The Law Offices of Stern, Blumenthal & Finch occupied the third floor of a nondescript office building in downtown Bridgeport, Connecticut. The building itself was a drab, rectangular block constructed in the 1970s, its beige brick facade perpetually stained with grime. The office's décor was a mix of outdated and functional: threadbare carpeting in a shade of sickly green, fluorescent lighting that flickered intermittently, and mismatched furniture seemingly scavenged from various yard sales and estate clearances (fitting, given the firm's focus on estate law). Eleanor's tiny, windowless cubicle was crammed between Mr. Blumenthal's corner office, which boasted a mahogany desk and a view of the harbor (however bleak), and the perpetually buzzing copy machine. She'd attempted to personalize it with a few framed prints of Monet paintings she’d found on clearance at a local art supply store, but they only served to highlight the overall dreariness of the space. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, dust, and the faint, lingering odor of legal document sealant. Overall, it was a place where hope went to die, one meticulously filed document at a time.
