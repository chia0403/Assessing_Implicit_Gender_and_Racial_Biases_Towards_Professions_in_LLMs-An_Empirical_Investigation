## Story Opening and Setting

**Story Opening:**

The stench hit Amelia Rose Harding like a physical blow, a wave of rotting fish and stale beer that threatened to knock her off her feet. She coughed, pulling the scarf higher over her nose, but it did little to filter the pervasive reek. This was it. The infamous Fish Market district of Saoirse City, a labyrinth of shadowed alleys and crumbling warehouses where whispers about the city's underbelly thrummed louder than the distant cries of gulls.

**Setting:**

The scene is set in the fictional city of Saoirse City, a sprawling metropolis clinging to the jagged coastline of the North Atlantic. Think a blend of Dublin's grit and Reykjavik's stark beauty, overlaid with a modern sheen that barely disguises the decay underneath. Specifically, we are in the Fish Market district, a place where the city's glittering skyscrapers seem miles away.

*   **Atmosphere:** Bleak and industrial, perpetually damp with sea mist and the spray of waves crashing against the nearby docks. The air is thick with the smells of fish, brine, and decay.
*   **Architecture:** Predominantly consists of dilapidated brick warehouses, many with boarded-up windows and crumbling facades. Narrow alleys, choked with garbage and debris, crisscross the area, casting long, oppressive shadows. Iron fire escapes cling precariously to the sides of buildings.
*   **Time:** Early evening, around 6 PM. The sky is overcast, casting a grey light that accentuates the grime and decay. The streetlights are just beginning to flicker on, casting pools of weak yellow light that barely penetrate the gloom.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Amelia Rose Harding
*   **Occupation:** Investigative Reporter for the "Saoirse Standard," a reputable but struggling local newspaper.
