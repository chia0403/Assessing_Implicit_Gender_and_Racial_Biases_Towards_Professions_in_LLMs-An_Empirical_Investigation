Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a bellhop named Archibald Finch:

**Setting:**

The Grand Astoria Hotel, Chicago, Illinois. The year is 1932. The Astoria stands as a monument to a bygone era of opulence, despite the creeping tendrils of the Great Depression. Its lobby is a dizzying spectacle of polished marble floors, towering fluted columns, and glittering chandeliers that seem to hold back the very shadows. The air hums with the muffled sounds of hushed conversations, the clatter of ice in glasses, and the faint strains of a jazz trio playing in the Palm Court lounge. The uniforms worn by the staff, though meticulously maintained, show subtle signs of wear and tear, hinting at the financial strain even this bastion of luxury is under.

**Story Opening:**

Archibald Finch, every crisp, perfect curl of his auburn hair plastered meticulously in place, adjusted the brim of his pillbox hat. He hated that hat. It scratched. But rules were rules at the Grand Astoria, and Mr. Henderson, the head bellhop, had eyes everywhere. Besides, a few scratches were nothing compared to the alternative – being unemployed in 1932 Chicago.

He stood at his post near the revolving doors, a silent sentinel in his perfectly tailored uniform, a cart laden with luggage beside him. The smell of Mrs. Van Derlyn’s potent perfume, a cloying concoction of gardenias and something vaguely animalistic, still clung to the air from her departure earlier that morning. Archibald wrinkled his nose subtly. He preferred the scent of the faintly citrus-scented polish used on the lobby’s marble floors; it spoke of cleanliness and order, two qualities Archibald held in the highest esteem.

The revolving doors spun, and a figure emerged, silhouetted against the harsh midday sun. As they stepped into the lobby's cool embrace, Archibald’s practiced eye took in every detail: the worn leather valise, the threadbare but meticulously pressed suit, the nervous tremor in the man's hand as he adjusted his spectacles. This wasn’t one of the Astoria’s usual clientele. This man radiated a different kind of desperation, a quiet, hungry desperation that Archibald had seen far too much of lately.

He forced a smile, the practiced smile that had earned him countless generous tips (and several unwanted propositions from lonely, bored socialites). "Welcome to the Grand Astoria, sir. May I assist you with your luggage?"
