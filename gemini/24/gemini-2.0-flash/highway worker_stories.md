Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a highway worker named Bernadette "Bernie" Kowalski:

**Story Opening:**

The groan of the asphalt under Bernadette Kowalski's heavy work boots was as familiar as the ache in her lower back. Five a.m. and the sky was still stubbornly clinging to shades of indigo, grudgingly giving way to the first, watery light. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes, settled heavy in Bernie's lungs. She tightened her grip on her coffee thermos, the warmth a small comfort against the morning chill, and squinted down the long, dark ribbon of Interstate 80 West.

Another day, another ten-mile stretch of rumble strips to repair. Bernie sighed, a puff of steam momentarily clouding the air. She loved the solitude of the open road, the rhythmic clang of her tools, the satisfaction of a job well done. But the creeping unease she'd been carrying for the past few weeks was starting to erode even her most deeply ingrained work ethic. It wasn't the monotony, or the danger of speeding semi-trucks, or even the occasional stray jackrabbit that dared to cross her path. It was…something else. Something she couldn’t quite put her finger on, but felt like a low, persistent hum in the pit of her stomach.

Last night’s dream had been particularly unsettling – a vast, empty highway under a sky that bled crimson, and the distinct feeling of being watched. Shaking her head, Bernie told herself it was just fatigue and too much late-night TV. She took a long swig of her lukewarm coffee and flipped on the flashing amber lights of her Department of Transportation truck. Time to get to work. Ignore the feeling. Just focus on the task at hand. Fix the rumble strips. Survive the day.

**Setting:**

The story is set in rural **Wyoming**, primarily along a remote stretch of **Interstate 80 West** in the south-central part of the state. The landscape is characterized by:

*   **Vast, Open Plains:** Rolling hills covered in sagebrush and sparse grasslands stretching to the horizon. The sky is immense and often dramatic, with spectacular sunrises and sunsets.
*   **Harsh Weather:** The area experiences extreme temperature variations, with scorching summers and brutally cold winters. Sudden snowstorms and fierce winds are common, even in the shoulder seasons.
*   **Small Towns:** Scattered along the Interstate are tiny, isolated towns, remnants of the railroad and ranching era. They're often struggling economically, with a palpable sense of history and resilience.
*   **Sparse Population:** Long stretches of highway pass through virtually uninhabited areas, contributing to a feeling of isolation and solitude.
*   **Highway Infrastructure:** The visual landscape is dominated by the Interstate itself: the asphalt ribbon, the concrete bridges, the overpasses, the guardrails, and the ever-present Department of Transportation signs and equipment. These elements create a stark contrast between the modern infrastructure and the raw, untamed natural environment.

This setting emphasizes the isolation and the potential for unsettling occurrences, and the contrast between the modern highway and the older ways of life of the area.
