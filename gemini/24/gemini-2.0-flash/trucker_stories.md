The biting wind whipped snow against the chrome grill of the eighteen-wheeler, blurring the already desolate landscape into a shimmering, white purgatory. Inside the cab, the air was thick with the aroma of stale coffee and the lingering scent of pine air freshener, a desperate attempt to mask the grime ingrained into every crevice. **Margaret Elizabeth Kowalski**, known as "Maggie" to everyone who knew her, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Outside, the thermometer on the dashboard read a chilling -18 degrees Fahrenheit.

Margaret was hauling a load of Christmas trees from a small plantation near Bangor, Maine, all the way to a bustling lot in Chicago. It was December 22nd, and the pressure was on. Families needed their trees, and Maggie needed the money. She was deep into the heart of **Northern Maine**, a vast, unforgiving expanse of snow-covered forests and frozen lakes, where the only sign of civilization for miles was the occasional weathered farmhouse and the lonely hum of the power lines strung along Route 9. This time of year, the road became a treacherous ribbon of black ice, a constant reminder of the power of nature. This particular stretch, known as "Dead Man's Curve" by the truckers who regularly braved it, was her immediate concern. Legends whispered of trucks disappearing without a trace, swallowed by the snowdrifts or sent careening into the icy abyss of the nearby Moosehead Lake. Margaret just prayed her luck, and her skill, would hold out for another few hundred miles.
