The scent of cedar and pine hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. It was the smell of his life, the smell of generations past, the smell of the Thorne & Sons carpentry workshop, even though his father, God rest his soul, had passed on years ago and it was just Elias running the show now. Dust motes danced in the shafts of morning sunlight that sliced through the grimy windows of the workshop, illuminating the orderly chaos within. Tools hung neatly on the wall - chisels gleamed, saws stood sentinel, and planes lay waiting to smooth the roughest wood. Outside, the sleepy town of Oakhaven stirred to life, the rumble of the milk truck a familiar counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping that had already begun echoing from Elias's workbench. He hummed a low, tuneless melody as he examined a piece of cherry wood, his weathered hands running over the smooth, unblemished surface. Today, he was building a rocking horse for little Maisie Abernathy, and he wanted it to be perfect.
