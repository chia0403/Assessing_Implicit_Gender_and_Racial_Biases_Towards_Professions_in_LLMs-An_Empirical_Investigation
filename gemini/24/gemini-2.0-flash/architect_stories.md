The insistent chime of the doorbell cut through the delicate strains of Vivaldi. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, architect extraordinaire, sighed, placing her delicate porcelain teacup precisely back on its saucer. Outside, a ferocious February wind howled around the jutting angles of her own meticulously designed modernist home, a stark contrast to the cozy, fire-lit warmth within. She frowned. She rarely had unannounced visitors, and even more rarely ones who disregarded the prominent sign politely requesting scheduled appointments only.

Eleanor's house, perched precariously on the clifftop overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Sea near Whitby, England, was a testament to her minimalist aesthetic. Constructed of sleek concrete and expanses of glass, it appeared, from the outside, almost aggressively unwelcoming, daring the harsh elements to challenge its stoic beauty. Inside, however, the space was softened by carefully chosen textures: thick wool rugs, the warmth of exposed cedarwood, and a collection of handcrafted ceramics. It was a sanctuary, a place where she could escape the clamor of the city and lose herself in the geometry of her designs. But now, this tranquility was threatened by the persistent ringing.

With a final, exasperated sigh, Eleanor straightened her charcoal grey cashmere sweater, adjusted the tortoiseshell glasses perched on her nose, and headed towards the imposing oak front door. Whoever was outside, braving the gale, must have a very compelling reason. Or, she suspected with a grimace, be utterly clueless about boundaries.
