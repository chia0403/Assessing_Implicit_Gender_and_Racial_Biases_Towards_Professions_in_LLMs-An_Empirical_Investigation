**Story Opening:**

The scent of dust and desperation hung heavy in the air of the Grand Majestic Theatre.  Antoinette Beaumont, Director, paced the cracked linoleum backstage, the rhythmic click of her vintage Cuban heels echoing in the cavernous space.  She gripped a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee, its contents swirling with the nervous energy that had become her constant companion.  Opening night was only hours away, and instead of the triumphant pre-show buzz she craved, a miasma of impending doom clung to everything â€“ the moth-eaten velvet curtains, the precariously balanced prop swords, even the weary sighs of her stage manager.

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Theatre, a relic from the Golden Age of Vaudeville, stood proudly (if a little pathetically) on the less-than-glamorous edge of downtown. Once a jewel box of entertainment, it had slowly succumbed to the ravages of time and changing tastes. The ornate plasterwork was crumbling, revealing the building's bare bones beneath layers of peeling paint. The plush velvet seats, though faded and worn, still hinted at a bygone era of glamour.  The backstage area was a chaotic labyrinth of forgotten props, tangled cables, and haphazardly stacked scenery flats.  The air always carried a faint, musty smell, a combination of old wood, lingering stage makeup, and the ghosts of a thousand forgotten performances. The only signs of modernity were the flickering fluorescent lights struggling to illuminate the space and the digital soundboard, a clunky incongruity amidst the antique charm.  The theatre was Antoinette's sanctuary, her obsession, and her perpetual headache, all rolled into one glorious, decaying package.
