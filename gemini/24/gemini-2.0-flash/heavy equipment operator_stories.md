The dust swirled around Jedediah "Jed" Benjamin Cartwright's boots, the orange fine as powdered rust. He spat, the gritty taste coating his tongue even before the wind whipped it back into his face. It was just another Tuesday on the Baja Desert Reclamation Project, another day fighting the insatiable sprawl of the desert.

Jedediah wasn't one for poetic musings, but sometimes, out here on the edge of civilization, staring at the shimmering heat haze distorting the horizon, you couldn't help but feel the weight of the world on your shoulders. And in his case, the weight of a fully-loaded Komatsu D375A bulldozer.

The setting was a vast, almost lunar landscape in Baja California, Mexico, about fifty miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. Cracked earth stretched as far as the eye could see, punctuated by scrubby mesquite and skeletal cacti. The "Baja Desert Reclamation Project" was a controversial effort spearheaded by a wealthy Californian philanthropist who believed he could re-terraform the arid land into arable farmland using advanced irrigation and soil stabilization techniques. Jed, along with a ragtag crew of local workers and grizzled veterans, were the muscle behind the dream. They were the ones leveling dunes, carving out canals, and taming the wild, unforgiving landscape.

The midday sun beat down mercilessly on the cab of the D375A, turning it into a metal oven. Jedediah, a man built like the bulldozer itself, with calloused hands and a sun-leathered face etched with years of hard labor, wiped the sweat from his brow with a dirt-stained rag. He adjusted his worn baseball cap, bearing the faded logo of a long-defunct mining company. He knew this land was tough, unforgiving. But Jedediah Cartwright was tougher. And right now, he had a mountain of sand to move.
