## The Whispering Stones

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Thorne had seen ghosts flirt with the sunrise a hundred times from this very spot. The golden light, fracturing over the jagged peaks of the Mournful Mountains, painted the weathered headstones in hues of amber and ochre, making the silent city hum with a spectral warmth. Usually, she found it comforting, a gentle reminder that even death could be beautiful. But today, the air felt heavy, thick with a silence that pressed against her eardrums and sent a shiver crawling down her spine. Something was different.

She adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, pulling it tighter across her tweed jacket. "Okay, folks, let's gather round," she called out, her voice echoing slightly in the crisp morning air. "Welcome to Greywood Cemetery, and to the Ghostly Whispers Tour!"

**Setting:**

Greywood Cemetery was not your average graveyard. Perched precariously on the edge of the Mournful Mountains, overlooking the sprawling town of Hollow Creek, it was a labyrinth of crumbling mausoleums, overgrown with ivy and shrouded in mist that rarely lifted completely. Headstones, some dating back to the town's founding in the 17th century, leaned at odd angles, their inscriptions worn smooth by wind and rain. The air was always damp, carrying the scent of pine needles, damp earth, and something else... something akin to ozone, as if static electricity crackled just beneath the surface.

Hollow Creek itself was a town steeped in history, lore, and a healthy dose of superstition. Known for its unexplained occurrences and alleged paranormal activity, it was a haven for ghost hunters, folklore enthusiasts, and, of course, tourists seeking a thrill. The cemetery, the oldest and largest in the region, was Greywood's crown jewel of creepiness, drawing visitors from all over the world.
