## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, shearing off the head of the bolt with a sickening *ping*. Amelia “Amy” Rosewood sighed, a puff of white breath clouding in the frigid air of the garage. “Damn it all to hell,” she muttered, throwing the wrench onto the floor with a clang that echoed amongst the towering stacks of tires.

The radio, tuned to a classic rock station, cranked out a distorted rendition of “Born to Be Wild,” a fitting soundtrack for the kind of Monday she was having. Amelia wiped a greasy smudge from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a dark streak against her already grime-covered skin. This was the third stripped bolt she’d encountered on this cursed 1967 Ford Mustang, and her patience, like the ancient car, was running on fumes. 

She stared at the mess, a gnawing frustration building in her chest. This wasn't just a car; it was a symbol. A symbol of everything that was broken, everything that needed fixing, both inside and outside this godforsaken town.

## Setting:

Amelia's Garage, a converted barn on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Montana, was a testament to both her mechanical skill and her stubborn independence. The exterior, weathered and painted a faded shade of crimson, looked ready to collapse under the weight of the Montana snow that clung to its eaves. A hand-painted sign, barely legible, proclaimed “Amelia's Garage: We Can Fix Anything… Eventually.”

Inside, organized chaos reigned. Tools hung from pegboards lining the walls, each meticulously placed and instantly accessible to Amelia’s experienced hands. Spare parts, from rusty carburetors to glistening chrome bumpers, cluttered shelves and stacked in bins. The concrete floor was stained with oil and grease, a roadmap of countless repairs. A vintage pin-up calendar hung above the workbench, offering a splash of color in the otherwise utilitarian space.

The air perpetually smelled of motor oil, gasoline, and the faint sweetness of antifreeze. The only sources of heat were a kerosene heater in the corner and the wood-burning stove by the door, both fighting a losing battle against the Montana winter. Outside, the desolate landscape stretched out to the jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains, a stark contrast to the cluttered warmth of Amelia's sanctuary. It was a place of hard work, quiet contemplation, and the comforting rhythm of wrench on metal – a place where Amelia Rosewood could finally breathe.
