## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air in the guidance counselor's office at Northwood High was perpetually lukewarm, smelling faintly of printer ink and the lingering anxieties of teenagers. Outside, the first week of October was throwing a riot of crimson and gold against the brick facade, but inside, under the harsh fluorescent lights, the vibe was more…beige. Beige carpet, beige walls, beige hopes sometimes.

**Opening:**

"Alright, let's see…" Ms. Eleanor Vance, Guidance Counselor, peered over her half-moon reading glasses at the file in front of her. The name scrawled across the top in a rebellious, thick black marker read "Skylar 'Edge' Edgewood." Eleanor sighed. Skylar Edgewood. Not a good sign. Not when the accompanying photo showed a shock of neon green hair and a permanent sneer. Skylar was notorious for truancy, disruptive behavior, and a general disdain for anything remotely resembling authority. Eleanor had been dreading this meeting all morning. She adjusted her sensible cardigan, took a sip of her lukewarm, beige tea, and braced herself. "Showtime."
