## Story Opening:

Professor Eleanor Ainsworth prided herself on punctuality, a trait at odds with the ancient, creaking edifice that housed the Department of Archaeology at the University of Blackwood. This morning, however, even her carefully regimented routine was thwarted. A gaggle of undergraduates, eyes wide with a mixture of terror and morbid fascination, blocked the corridor leading to her office, craning their necks to peer into Professor Davenport's room. Davenport, a man whose eccentric theories were only surpassed by his talent for misplacing research grants, was usually in before sunrise, meticulously dusting his collection of chipped Roman pottery. His absence, combined with the hushed whispers of "blood" and "amulet," painted a disquieting picture.

Eleanor, a woman who preferred her archaeological finds safely entombed in display cases, pushed her way through the crowd. "Out of the way, please," she announced, her voice a crisp blade cutting through the nervous chatter. "Someone tell me what's happening, and be quick about it. I have a nine o'clock lecture on the Bronze Age to prepare."
## Setting:

The University of Blackwood, nestled in the remote, windswept hills of Northumberland, England, felt more like a haunted castle than a place of higher learning. Its gothic architecture, complete with gargoyles, crumbling battlements, and drafty corridors, seemed to actively discourage modernity. The Archaeology Department, specifically, occupied the oldest wing, a labyrinth of dimly lit offices, dusty lecture halls, and perpetually cold laboratories. The air perpetually hung thick with the scent of old paper, damp stone, and the faint, earthy odor of ancient soil. Each room held a chaotic jumble of artifacts, from meticulously cataloged pottery shards to forgotten boxes filled with unidentified bones, a testament to the department's long and occasionally haphazard history. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick stone walls and leaded windows, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to whisper secrets from centuries past. The only truly modern element was the flickering fluorescent light overhead, which hummed a discordant counterpoint to the ancient whispers.
