The midday sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of the outback veterinary clinic, turning the air inside a stifling, oven-like heat. Outside, the dust swirled in miniature tornadoes across the barren landscape, coating everything in a fine layer of ochre. Eleanor Beatrice Davies, DVM, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of mud from the birthing gloves she still wore. The air hung thick with the smell of disinfectant, livestock, and the faint, lingering sweetness of eucalyptus.

Eleanor, a woman built more for comfort than speed, with kind eyes framed by wiry red curls perpetually escaping their bun, surveyed the chaos around her. A bleating lamb, recently orphaned, was nuzzling her leg, desperate for attention. Anxious sheep dogs yelped and pawed at the mesh of the kennels lining one wall, eager for their daily walk. And in the corner, nestled in a makeshift bed of old towels and straw, lay Daisy, a Border Collie with a complicated pregnancy that had nearly ended in tragedy.

Eleanor’s clinic, aptly named “Outback Paws,” was more than just a job; it was her life. It was a lifeline for the scattered farming families and nomadic station workers of the vast, unforgiving Australian outback. She was their go-to for everything from de-worming prize-winning bulls to stitching up mangled joeys. And today, she was exhausted, but strangely content, knowing she’d once again managed to cheat death by a whisker.
