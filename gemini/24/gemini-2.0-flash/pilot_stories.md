The incessant hum of the Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp engine vibrated through Amelia Iris “Amy” Holbrook’s bones, a familiar lullaby against the biting Alaskan wind. Above, the bruised dawn sky bled from a deep violet to a watery pink, painting the snow-capped peaks of the Chugach Mountains in fleeting hues of gold and rose. Below, the frozen expanse of the Knik Arm stretched like a crumpled sheet of tin foil, reflecting the nascent light.

Amy gripped the joystick of her de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, the "Snow Goose," its aging metal groaning in protest against the cold. Her breath fogged the cockpit window, momentarily obscuring the already treacherous view. She swiped at it with a gloved hand, her knuckles raw and red despite the thick wool lining. It was 6:00 AM, another predawn start from the bustling, ramshackle floatplane base just outside of Anchorage. 

The setting was a stark, beautiful, and unforgiving Alaska in the mid-1950s, a frontier carved from ice and wilderness. This wasn’t the romanticized, gold-rush Alaska of history books. This was the Alaska of hardscrabble living, where the only law was survival and the only lifeline between remote communities was the skill and grit of pilots like Amy Holbrook. Here, the Snow Goose wasn't just a plane; it was a lifeline, a delivery truck, and often, a guardian angel to the isolated settlements scattered across the vast, frozen landscape. And Amy Holbrook, with her steely gaze and a map of Alaska etched into her soul, was about to face one of her toughest challenges yet.
