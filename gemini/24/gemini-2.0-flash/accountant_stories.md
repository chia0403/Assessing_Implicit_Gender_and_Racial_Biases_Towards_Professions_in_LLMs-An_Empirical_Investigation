## The Story Opening

The fluorescent lights of Pruitt, Davies & Finch hummed a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic tapping of keyboards all around him. Edgar Alistair Humphrey, Senior Accountant, adjusted his tie, a striped affair he’d picked up at a charity shop last year, and exhaled slowly. He’d been staring at the spreadsheet for two hours, the numbers blurring before his eyes like a poorly rendered impressionist painting. There was a discrepancy, a nasty little gremlin in the balance sheet that stubbornly refused to be exorcised. $3,274.82. It wasn't a huge sum, not on the scale of Pruitt, Davies & Finch, but it was enough to keep him awake at night. And Edgar Alistair Humphrey valued his sleep. Sleep, and the meticulous order he strove to impose on the chaotic world.

He reached for his mug, the one with the slightly chipped handle and the fading picture of a grumpy cat that perfectly mirrored his own mood. The coffee was lukewarm and bitter, a testament to its age. Just like his enthusiasm for reconciling expense reports.

He was about to dive back into the digital labyrinth when the intercom buzzed. “Edgar, Mr. Finch would like to see you in his office. Immediately.”

Edgar felt a cold knot tighten in his stomach. Mr. Finch didn't "like to see" anyone "immediately" unless something was terribly, terribly wrong. The missing $3,274.82 suddenly felt like a monstrous, looming threat. He cleared his throat, smoothed his tie again, and prepared for the worst.

## The Setting

**Pruitt, Davies & Finch** occupied the 27th and 28th floors of the Zenith Tower, a glass and steel monolith that dominated the downtown skyline of **Portland, Oregon**. From Edgar's cramped office, nestled amongst a warren of identical cubicles on the 27th floor, he had a partial view of the Willamette River, perpetually churning and reflecting the overcast sky. The view, however, was usually obscured by a layer of office grime on the window and a stack of invoices threatening to topple over.

The office itself was a symphony of beige and grey, a color palette designed to induce a state of bland conformity. Rows of desks, each adorned with a standard-issue computer, a phone, and a collection of personal trinkets that subtly betrayed the individuality stifled beneath the corporate facade, stretched as far as the eye could see. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee, recycled paper, and the faint, underlying scent of desperation that clung to the walls like a stubborn stain.

Mr. Finch's office, on the 28th floor, was a different beast entirely. It was a lavish space, decorated with mahogany furniture, expensive artwork, and a panoramic view of the city. It spoke of power and success, a stark contrast to the cramped and utilitarian world Edgar inhabited. It was a world that Edgar, despite his twenty years of loyal service, could only dream of. And a world that, he suspected, was about to come crashing down on him.
