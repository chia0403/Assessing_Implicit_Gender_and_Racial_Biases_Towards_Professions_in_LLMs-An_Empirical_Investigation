The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach color, bled through the gauzy linen drapes, painting stripes across the otherwise sterile white expanse of the Holmwood Manor ballroom. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, armed with a notepad and the harried sigh she reserved for particularly challenging clients, surveyed the cavernous space. Holmwood Manor, a monument to Victorian excess and questionable taste, was perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the tempestuous Cornish coast. It belonged to the recently widowed Lady Beatrice Holmwood, a woman whose pronouncements were as sharp as the sea air and whose expectations were, to put it mildly, astronomical.

Amelia, a purveyor of understated elegance in a world often demanding glitz, found herself increasingly wondering how sheâ€™d landed this particular commission. Holmwood Manor was less a home and more a mausoleum, filled with dark wood, velvet upholstery in shades of decaying plum, and enough dusty taxidermied birds to populate a small aviary. Lady Beatrice, a devotee of all things historically accurate (and apparently, painfully uncomfortable), wanted the ballroom restored to its "original splendor," which, according to Amelia's research, involved an unsettling amount of gold leaf and at least one painting featuring a naked cherub brandishing a slightly menacing trident.

Amelia shifted, the faint scent of lavender, her signature perfume, struggling against the overpowering mustiness of the manor. She could almost hear the ghosts of lavish parties past whispering from the shadowed corners, disapproving of her modern sensibilities. This, she thought, was going to be a long and very, very expensive project.
