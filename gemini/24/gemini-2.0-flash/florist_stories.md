Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a florist main character:

**Opening:**

The scent of hyacinth and regret hung heavy in the air of "Petals & Prose."  Cecelia Marie Dubois inhaled deeply, the floral fragrance doing little to soothe the knot in her stomach.  It was Valentine's Day eve, the florist's equivalent of the Apocalypse, and unlike everyone else in town preparing for romance, Cecelia felt utterly, irrevocably alone.  She snipped a thorny rose stem with more force than necessary, the sharp snap echoing in the otherwise silent shop.  Two years. Two years since *he* had walked into Petals & Prose, his eyes the colour of the summer sky. Two years, that she had not seen him. She took a seat by the window. The clock on the wall seemed to mock her, ticking away the precious moments until the morning's frantic rush. Cecelia sighed, watching the snow fall gently outside, painting the world in shades of white and gray, much like the landscape of her own heart.

**Setting:**

"Petals & Prose" is a small, charming flower shop nestled on a cobblestone street in the historic district of Havenwood, a picturesque town in the Hudson Valley. The shop is housed in a two-story building with a faded brick facade, a wide window displaying a rotating selection of vibrant floral arrangements. Inside, the air is perpetually filled with the sweet fragrance of blossoms and the earthy scent of potting soil. Antique wooden shelves line the walls, overflowing with vases of all shapes and sizes, gardening tools, and whimsical decorations.  A cozy reading nook, complete with a worn armchair and a small library of classic novels, sits in the back corner, a testament to Cecelia's love for both flowers and literature.  The shop's aesthetic is deliberately romantic and slightly bohemian, reflecting Cecelia's own personality: a blend of practicality and a deep-seated yearning for beauty and connection. The overall atmosphere is comforting and inviting, a haven from the bustling world outside.
