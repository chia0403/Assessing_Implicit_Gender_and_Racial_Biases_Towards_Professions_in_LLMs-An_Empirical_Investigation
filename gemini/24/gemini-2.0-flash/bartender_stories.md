Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character who's a bartender:

**Setting:** The Rusty Mug is a dive bar tucked away on the grimy edge of New Orleans' French Quarter. The neon sign flickers intermittently, casting a sickly green glow across peeling paint and a window plastered with flyers for local bands you've never heard of. Inside, the air hangs thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and a lingering hint of regret. A ceiling fan, missing two blades, spins sluggishly overhead, offering little relief from the Louisiana humidity. The booths are ripped and patched with duct tape, the wooden bar worn smooth by countless elbows and spilled drinks, and the jukebox is a temperamental beast that favors blues and zydeco music played at ear-splitting volumes.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic *thunk* of a lemon being sliced punctuated the low hum of conversation. Antoine Moreau, the owner, sole employee, and general fixer-upper of the Rusty Mug, didn't bother looking up. He knew the drill. Another Tuesday night, another collection of regulars nursing their sorrows and drowning their bad decisions in cheap whiskey. He’d seen it all a thousand times before. From brawls over misplaced wallets to tearful confessions of unrequited love, the Rusty Mug was a confessional booth disguised as a drinking establishment.

Tonight, a particularly despondent-looking tourist, face flushed the color of a ripe crawfish, sat hunched over the bar, clutching a half-empty glass of something sickly sweet. Antoine wiped down the counter, his movements economical and practiced, not wanting to make eye contact. The less he knew, the less he had to care. But then, a raspy voice cut through the din, "Hey, barkeep. Another one of those… uh… 'Hurricane' things. Make it strong, yeah?"

Antoine sighed inwardly. Strong usually meant expensive, which this guy clearly couldn't afford. But a tip was a tip. He glanced up, finally making eye contact with the tourist. The man's eyes were bloodshot and desperate. Antoine knew that look. He'd seen it staring back at him in the mirror more than once. Maybe tonight, just maybe, he'd do more than just pour a drink.
