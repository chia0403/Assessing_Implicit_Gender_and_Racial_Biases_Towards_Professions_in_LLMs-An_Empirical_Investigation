The scent of stale milk and lavender wipes hung heavy in the air of the "Tiny Treasures" daycare. It was Tuesday, and already, the day felt a week old. Outside, the mid-October sun was painting the leaves in fiery hues of orange and red, a breathtaking spectacle lost on the cacophony within. Leo Maxwell, a child care worker with a perpetually rumpled brow and a saint's patience, squeezed through a throng of toddlers vying for his attention. He was navigating a minefield of sticky fingers, mismatched socks, and demands for "Mr. Bear" which, naturally, was currently residing on the roof of the jungle gym.

Tiny Treasures, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, was a place of perpetual organized chaos. It consisted of two large, brightly colored rooms: one designated for infants and crawlers, the other for the slightly more independent (and considerably louder) preschool group. A small, fenced-in playground lay just beyond the sliding glass doors, its plastic slides gleaming under the autumn sun. Leo loved Willow Creek, a town where everybody knew your name and the local bakery always had his favorite blueberry scones ready on Tuesday mornings. He just wasnâ€™t always sure he loved the sheer volume of energy radiating from its youngest citizens.
