## The Stone Lullaby

**Setting:** The city of Aethelgard was built into the side of the Whispering Peaks, a spine of jagged granite that pierced the eternally grey sky. Buildings clung to the rock face like tenacious vines, their slate roofs slick with perpetual drizzle. Ladders of rope and rickety wooden staircases were the main thoroughfares, connecting the various levels and districts. At the very peak, shrouded in mist and legend, stood the Citadel, a fortress of unparalleled size and grim beauty that housed the Royal Family and their elite guard. The air, even in the lower reaches, was thin and carried a constant, mournful wind that seemed to whisper secrets from the mountains themselves.

**Story Opening:**

Sergeant Lysander Thorne, his breath puffing out in white clouds, tightened the clasp on his gorget. The damp chill of the Whispering Peaks seeped into his bones, a familiar discomfort he’d long grown accustomed to. He leaned against the rough-hewn stone wall, his gaze sweeping across the narrow pathway that wound its way up to the Citadel’s main gate. The duty was monotonous, a stone lullaby played on repeat, but vigilance was paramount. One lapse in concentration could mean the difference between Aethelgard’s safety and its utter destruction. After all, legends whispered of things that stirred in the mountain's heart, things far older and far more dangerous than any bandit or invading army. He shifted, the weight of his halberd a constant reassurance, and cursed the unending drizzle that turned his leather gloves slick. Another hour before the shift changed. Another hour to stand sentinel against the grey. And tonight, the whispers in the wind seemed louder, more urgent, than he remembered. A bad omen, perhaps. Or maybe just the creeping madness that came with guarding the gate of a city built on secrets and stone.
