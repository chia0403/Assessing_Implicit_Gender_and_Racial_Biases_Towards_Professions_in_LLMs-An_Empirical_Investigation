The pre-dawn chill clung to the asphalt like a shroud, biting at Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's exposed cheeks.  The low hum of the approaching sunrise, a hesitant promise of warmth, did little to dispel the icy grip on the desolate expanse of Interstate 80.  She adjusted the faded fluorescent orange vest, the reflective strips catching the last vestiges of the fading night sky, and surveyed the scene before her.  A patchwork quilt of cracked pavement, shimmering with the first glimmers of frost, stretched out under the muted grey light.  This was her domain, this stretch of highway â€“ a long, lonely ribbon slicing through the heartland of Nebraska, a landscape as vast and unforgiving as the work itself.  The lone, skeletal trees along the shoulder stood as silent sentinels, their branches reaching out like arthritic fingers.  Milly, at 28, felt oddly connected to them, to the silence, to the unwavering rhythm of the wind whispering through the barren fields. This was her Tuesday, and her usual two-man crew was nowhere to be seen. The foreman's truck was still parked, a silent sentinel in the pre-dawn gloom.
