The biting wind whipped Amelia Josephine Finch's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees, clawing at a bruised, pewter sky, mirrored the skeletal fingers gripping the worn leather of her satchel.  She pulled her scarf tighter around her neck, the wool offering little solace against the October chill that seeped into the very marrow of her bones.  The deserted, cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, normally buzzing with the rhythmic clatter of carts and the cheerful cries of vendors, were eerily quiet.  A thick layer of fallen leaves muffled the sound of her boots as she trudged along the uneven pathway, each step a deliberate, measured movement.  The small, ivy-covered clinic, nestled between the crumbling town hall and the whispering, centuries-old graveyard, loomed before her, a silent sentinel against the encroaching twilight.  Amelia, a physician's assistant at the clinic, was its lone caretaker for the evening, the only human soul in a landscape that seemed to hold its breath.
