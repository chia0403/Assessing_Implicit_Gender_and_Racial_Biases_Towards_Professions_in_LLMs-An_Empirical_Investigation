The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant, low thrumming against Dr. Aris Thorne's eardrums, was almost a comforting presence.  He adjusted the focus on the holographic projection, the swirling nebulae of data points flickering with a hypnotic rhythm.  Tonight, the data from the Kepler-186f analysis was more crucial than ever.  The lab, nestled within the sprawling, glass-and-steel behemoth of the Icarus Institute for Extraterrestrial Research, offered an almost eerie silence.  The only sounds besides the hum were the rhythmic clicks of his keyboard and the faint hiss of the specialized cooling systems required to maintain the delicate quantum entanglement arrays.  Outside, the city of Nova Alexandria stretched into the inky night sky, a glittering tapestry of lights reflecting in the polished surfaces of the labâ€™s vast windows.  The crisp air, usually vibrant with the city's energy, felt heavy and still, as if held captive by the looming presence of the research building.  A single, flickering neon sign outside read:  "Seek Truth.  Embrace Discovery."
