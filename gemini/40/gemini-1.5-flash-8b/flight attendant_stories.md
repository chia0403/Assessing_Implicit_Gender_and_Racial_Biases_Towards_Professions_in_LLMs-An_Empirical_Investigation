The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the shimmering turquoise expanse of the Caribbean Sea.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy of palm trees lining the runway at Barbadosâ€™ Grantley Adams International Airport, beat down on Amelia Rodriguez, a flight attendant for the prestigious Aerolineas del Sol.  Her name tag, gleaming with polished silver lettering, felt oddly insignificant against the backdrop of this vibrant, chaotic paradise.  Today, the usual pre-flight bustle, the murmur of announcements and the insistent click-clack of rolling luggage, felt amplified, charged with an unseen tension.  It wasn't just the heat; a subtle, almost palpable unease settled over the terminal.  A low hum of whispered conversation followed Amelia as she navigated the throng of departing passengers, their faces a mix of excitement and apprehension.  The midday sun, a cruel artist, painted the scene in hues of dazzling gold and brooding shadow.  The scent of salt air mingled with the perfume of exotic blooms.  This was Barbados, paradise on Earth...and Amelia felt a sudden, chilling unease creeping into her bones. She knew, deep down, something was off.
