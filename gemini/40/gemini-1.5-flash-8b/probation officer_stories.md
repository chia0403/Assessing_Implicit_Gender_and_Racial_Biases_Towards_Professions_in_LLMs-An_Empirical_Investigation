Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythmic thud of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's frustration.  The fluorescent lights flickered, casting an eerie yellow glow on the cluttered desk, papers piled high like a miniature avalanche.  Amy, a probation officer with five years under her belt and a weary heart, stared at the latest report for sixteen-year-old Leo Vargas.  The report, scrawled in a childish, almost desperate, scrawl, detailed another infraction –  failure to attend anger management classes.  It was the same pattern, a frustrating cycle of promises broken, and opportunities missed.

The office, located in the heart of a sprawling, post-industrial city, felt suffocating.  Tall, decaying brick buildings loomed around the perimeter, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the grey, perpetually overcast sky.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and damp earth, clung to the bone, mirroring the heavy atmosphere in Amy's chest.  Outside, the rhythmic pulse of the city – the screech of brakes, the rumble of trucks, the distant wail of a siren – was a constant, unyielding backdrop to her life.  The city, vast and unforgiving, seemed to hold its breath, waiting to see if Amy would succeed in her mission to help Leo navigate the treacherous currents of a life threatened by its own undertow.
