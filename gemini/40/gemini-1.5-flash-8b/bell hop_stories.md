The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky beige by years of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, reflected the flickering gaslight above.  Dust motes danced in the scant illumination, painting swirling patterns on the already-tarnished brass fixtures of the Grand Astor Hotel.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop with a perpetually surprised expression and hands that seemed perpetually too small for his surprisingly large frame, sighed.  Another night, another room full of lost luggage, another whispered complaint about the 'excruciatingly slow service' of the hotel's staff.  The scent of lavender, faint but persistent, clung to the air, a strangely comforting aroma in the oppressive humidity of the summer night.  Barty, clad in his starched, slightly too-tight uniform, ran a hand through his unruly brown hair.  The Grand Astor, a monument to faded grandeur, was a place of whispers and shadows, secrets and forgotten dreams.  Tonight, however, Barty felt a tremor of something more than just the usual nocturnal anxieties.  A premonition, perhaps.  Or maybe just the ever-present weight of the hotel's history pressing down on him.
