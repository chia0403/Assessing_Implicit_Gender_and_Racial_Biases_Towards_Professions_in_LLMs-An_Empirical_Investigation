The chipped paint of the cab, the faded, sunflower-yellow of the "Ace Trucking" logo, seemed to mock the relentless grey of the Montana sky.  Dust, thick as a fog, coated everything – the dashboard, the cracked leather seats, even the faded paisley print clinging stubbornly to the passenger-side window.  It was a landscape of muted tones, punctuated only by the occasional skeletal silhouette of a lone pine.  Miles and miles of nothing stretched before Amelia "Dottie" Dubois, her 18-wheeler, the "Dusty Rose," its engine a low, guttural rumble, snaking its way through the winding mountain pass.  Dottie, her face etched with the familiar lines of a life lived on the road, adjusted the worn leather strap of her oversized trucker’s hat, the brim shielding her tired eyes from the relentless wind.  The radio crackled with static, a soundtrack to the endless expanse.  She squinted at the flickering digital readout, the map of the highway a barely visible grey line against the overcast.  The cargo hold, laden with crates of vintage musical instruments, promised a quiet rumble in the back, a contrast to the chaotic symphony of her own thoughts.  Today, though, the thoughts were more like a mournful dirge, the song of a lost love echoing in the metal and glass of her solitary domain.
