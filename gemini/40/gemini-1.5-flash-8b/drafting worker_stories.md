The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, mirroring the swirling, frustrating thoughts in his mind.  He stared at the sprawling blueprint spread across his drafting table, a tangled web of lines and symbols representing a proposed skyscraper â€“ a monument to human ambition, and a source of endless frustration for Elias.  He traced the intricate curves of a steel beam with his mechanical pencil, the graphite leaving a faint, almost invisible mark on the paper.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, acrid tang of printer toner.  Elias, a drafting worker for the prestigious architectural firm of Sterling & Finch, was perpetually on the verge of a breakdown, his meticulously drawn lines reflecting the internal chaos he couldn't contain.

The drafting room itself was a testament to the relentless march of progress.  Long, narrow tables stretched into the distance, each laden with blueprints, compasses, and the ghosts of countless designs.  A low, almost imperceptible groan emanated from the floorboards, a sound swallowed by the ceaseless whirring of fans and the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards from the neighboring cubicle section.  Sunlight, fractured and feeble, pierced the grime-coated windows, painting the room in muted shades of grey and muted yellow.  Elias worked in the back row, the gloom deepening as the sun dipped below the horizon, mirroring the growing darkness in his soul.
