The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electric Fix-It" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a relentless sheet, hammered against the corrugated iron walls, mirroring the frantic drumming in Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam's ears.  She gripped the worn leather strap of her toolbox, the familiar weight a comforting anchor in the storm. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and damp earth, a potent cocktail that only a truly grimy, late-night alley could conjure.  Amelia, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, swore under her breath as another surge of static crackled through her tools.

The building itself, a gaunt, skeletal structure of brick and mortar, seemed to lean into the storm, its windows like empty eyes staring blankly towards the churning sky.  The rhythmic drip-drip-drip from the roof was the only soundtrack to her meticulous work, the city outside a muted roar of wind and rain.
