The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Transistor" cast an oily sheen across the rain-slicked alley.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of solder and stale coffee.  Elias Thorne, Radio Technician Extraordinaire, hunched over a tangle of wires, his brow furrowed in concentration.  A cracked, vintage radio, its wooden cabinet scratched and scarred, lay before him, its internal mechanisms a chaotic symphony of buzzing relays and clicking capacitors.  The rhythmic thump of a nearby construction site punctuated the rhythmic whirring of the ancient device.  Elias, with his grease-stained overalls and prematurely graying hair, was lost in the intricate dance of electrons, wrestling with a particularly stubborn static interference.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, echoing the frantic pulse of his own heartbeat.

The year was 1987.  The city of Zenith, nestled in the heart of the fictional state of Aethelgard, was a sprawling metropolis of towering steel structures and shadowy alleys.  Neon signs advertised everything from "Guaranteed Atomic Hairpieces" to "Psychic Readings by Moonlight."  Elias worked in the city's most forgotten corner, a pocket of pre-digital technology nestled between a dilapidated warehouse and a crumbling parking garage.  The Rusty Transistor was a relic, a last bastion of hand-crafted radio repair in a city consumed by the relentless march of transistors and integrated circuits.
