The biting wind whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of Blackwood Common, rattling the flimsy sign that proclaimed, "Beware the Whispering Woods."  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, plastered the cobblestones of the village of Oakhaven to a slick, treacherous sheen.  Detective Inspector Alistair Finch, his trench coat a useless shield against the onslaught, shivered, pulling his thick wool scarf tighter around his face.  The faint scent of pine needles and something acrid, something almostâ€¦ metallic, clung to the air. This wasn't just another routine missing persons case; this felt wrong, deeply wrong.

Oakhaven, nestled in the shadowed valley between the towering peaks of the Blackwood Mountains, was a place of whispers and legends, a place where the veil between the seen and unseen seemed perilously thin.  Even the oldest residents had stories about strange occurrences in the Whispering Woods, tales of unsettling apparitions and unsettling disappearances.  Detective Inspector Alistair Finch, however, was a man of logic, of cold, hard facts.  He refused to believe in the supernatural, but the unsettling details of this particular case were pushing him towards a new, uncomfortable understanding.  The latest victim, a renowned botanist named Dr. Elara Blackwood, had vanished from her secluded cottage on the edge of the Whispering Woods, leaving behind only a trail of unanswered questions and an unsettlingly calm demeanor from her distraught family.
