The chipped paint on the door of "Scissors & Souls" was a faded, bruised purple, a colour Amelia Thistlewick, owner and sole stylist, found oddly comforting.  It matched the tangled, unruly strands of auburn hair that seemed to perpetually escape the grasp of her carefully crafted clientele.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the ancient city of Veridian, was a tiny haven of quiet buzz.  The aroma of lavender shampoo mingled with the faint, earthy scent of the old stone building, a scent Amelia had come to associate with sanctuary.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate latticework of the tall, ivy-covered building across the street, dappled the worn linoleum floor, illuminating a swirl of shimmering foils and discarded bobby pins.  Today, the air thrummed with a low, anticipatory hum, a familiar melody before a busy Saturday morning.  Amelia, dressed in her signature black tunic and faded denim jacket, meticulously trimmed a lock of a customer's hair, her nimble fingers working with the practiced grace of a seasoned surgeon.  The bell above the door jingled, signaling a new arrival.  A young woman, with eyes the colour of the summer sky and hair like spun moonlight, stood hesitating at the entrance.
