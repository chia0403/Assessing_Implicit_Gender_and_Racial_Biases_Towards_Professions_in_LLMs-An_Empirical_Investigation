The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, a symphony of yeasty tang and toasted flour, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the bakery walls and the threadbare curtains of "The Golden Crust."  Rain hammered a relentless tattoo against the corrugated iron roof, mirroring the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's movements.  She, a baker with hands like polished mahogany and eyes the colour of warm honey,  was a whirlwind of flour-dusted aprons and swift, practiced gestures. The small bakery, tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast city of Ashwood, was, in its own understated way, a sanctuary.  A haven from the grey skies and the relentless grind of the city's clockwork heart.  A place where the simple act of baking bread became a form of alchemy, transforming the mundane into the extraordinary.
