The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and simmering spices.  Rain hammered against the chipped awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's thoughts.  Amelia, a woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hands that seemed permanently stained a rich mahogany, expertly poured a stout into a chipped mug.  The rhythmic clinking of glass on counter, a familiar soundtrack to her life, offered little solace. Tonight, the usual murmur of conversation felt like a cacophony.


Setting: A dimly lit, slightly greasy, but cozy, Irish pub in a rain-swept medieval district of a bustling, but surprisingly forgotten, European city.  The city, filled with gothic architecture and hidden courtyards, felt as though it had been swallowed by time, holding its own unique beauty against the backdrop of modern life, leaving the feeling that a certain magic existed in the air.  The city also held a palpable undercurrent of secrets and whispered histories, something the low hum of conversation in The Rusty Mug only seemed to heighten.
