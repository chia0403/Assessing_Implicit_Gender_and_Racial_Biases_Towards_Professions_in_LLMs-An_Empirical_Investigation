Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated school building, a relentless drumming that mirrored the pounding headache throbbing behind Amelia Hawthorne's eyes.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and stale coffee, hung heavy in the otherwise deserted teacher's lounge.  Amelia, a history teacher at the perpetually underfunded Northwood High, stared blankly at the chipped Formica table, the faded floral pattern barely discernible beneath a layer of dust.  Her worn copy of "A History of the World in 6 Glasses" lay open, its pages dog-eared and filled with cryptic annotations, almost as if whispering secrets she couldn't quite grasp.  The only other occupant of the room was a lone, ancient, electric typewriter humming softly, as if keeping a silent vigil over the forgotten dreams of countless students who had come before.  Northwood High was a place where history felt like a forgotten dream, a distant echo in a building that was itself crumbling around the edges.  Amelia, with her perpetually rumpled dress, weary eyes, and a soul heavy with the weight of unmet expectations, was the sole custodian of this dusty, decaying monument to the past.
