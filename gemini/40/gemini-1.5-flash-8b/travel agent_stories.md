Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The meticulously organized folders, each representing a meticulously crafted dream vacation, lay scattered across her mahogany desk.  A half-eaten croissant, a testament to a missed breakfast, sat forlornly beside a stack of urgent emails, their flashing subject lines demanding immediate attention. Amy, a travel agent with a reputation for conjuring exotic escapes and whispering tales of faraway lands, felt utterly stranded.  Her own dream, a much-anticipated trip to the Galapagos Islands, was now a distant, shimmering mirage, a casualty of a sudden, devastating storm that had swept through her personal life.  

The office, nestled on the third floor of a grand Victorian building in the heart of London, exuded a deceptive calm.  Sunlight, fractured by the relentless rain, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows.  The air, thick with the scent of old paper and damp wool, carried the whisper of distant traffic and the rhythmic clatter of the city.  The hum of the nearby Tube was a constant, low thrumming, a soundtrack to Amy's inner turmoil. A single, flickering fluorescent light hung above her desk, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her helplessness.
