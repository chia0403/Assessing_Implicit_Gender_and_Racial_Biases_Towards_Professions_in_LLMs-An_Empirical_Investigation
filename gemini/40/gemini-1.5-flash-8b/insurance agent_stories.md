The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Secure Futures" insurance agency hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's mounting frustration.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the relentless drumming of paperwork on her desk.  Amelia, a meticulously organized woman with a perpetually exasperated frown, stared at a stack of claims forms, each one a tiny, agonizingly detailed tragedy.  A dog-eared copy of "The Art of the Unlikely Settlement" lay open beside them, a pathetic attempt at solace in the face of the unrelenting deluge of misfortune.  The small, cramped office, crammed with filing cabinets overflowing with past tragedies, was a testament to the relentless, often irrational, nature of human suffering. The musty smell of aged paper and despair hung heavy in the air.  The city, a concrete jungle outside the window, was a blur of grey and rain.  Outside, the rhythmic beat of the city's relentless pulse, and the rhythmic thumping of raindrops continued; inside, only the hum of fluorescent lights and the exasperated sigh of a young insurance agent.
