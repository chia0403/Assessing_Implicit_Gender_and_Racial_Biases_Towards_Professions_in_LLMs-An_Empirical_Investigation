The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Guaranteed!" warehouse hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of pallets being shuffled and the distant, amplified voice of a motivational speaker, promising boundless riches to anyone who sold enough.  This was Amelia Blackwood's world.  Amelia, 27, with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that had seen better days, was navigating the labyrinthine aisles of the massive warehouse, a sea of overflowing shelves and towering stacks of various, mostly-useless, products.  Her worn-out sneakers squeaked on the linoleum floor as she checked off items on her meticulously organized clipboard, each tick representing a sale or, more often, a missed connection. Today's goal?  Three hundred 'Miracle-Shine' cleaning cloths.  A seemingly simple task, but in this particular corner of the retail universe, success was a mirage, and Amelia felt the relentless pressure of the sales quotas like a vise around her chest.

The warehouse, a sprawling concrete behemoth, was a paradox of order and chaos.  Rows of identical shelves housed everything from exotic pet food to self-folding laundry baskets, from high-tech gardening tools to glow-in-the-dark socks. The air itself seemed thick with the scent of cheap plastic, pine-scented air freshener, and something indefinably synthetic.  Huge windows, overlooking a desolate industrial park, offered glimpses of a sky that was usually a dull gray, but today, was tinged with an unusual, almost unsettling, orange. A faint, persistent hum, like a restless machine, emanated from the depths of the warehouse. Amelia tried not to let it affect her focus, but a growing unease, unlike any other day, settled in her stomach.
