The scent of lavender and something subtly metallic clung to the air in Anya Petrova's salon, "The Gilded Shear."  Sunlight, filtered through the ornate stained-glass windows depicting mythical creatures, painted the salon in shifting hues of gold and amethyst.  A symphony of gentle buzzing from the hairdryers and the soft murmur of client conversations mingled with the rhythmic click-clack of Anya's manicured nails as she meticulously trimmed a particularly unruly section of auburn hair.  Anya, a cosmetologist with a sharp eye for detail and a touch as light as a feather, was a master of her craft, her movements as precise and predictable as the turning of a well-oiled machine.  Today, however, a tremor of something unseen, something unspoken, disturbed the usual rhythm.  It began with a single, almost imperceptible, shift in the light filtering through the stained glass, a sudden chill in the air, and a strange stillness that settled over the room.  The murmur of voices quieted.
