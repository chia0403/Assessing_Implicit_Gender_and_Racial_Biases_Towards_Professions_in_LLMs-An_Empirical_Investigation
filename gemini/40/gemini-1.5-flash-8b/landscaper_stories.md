The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the glass panes of the little greenhouse where Elias Thorne, meticulously pruned a bonsai.  Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire, or perhaps just a man desperately clinging to a sliver of sanity in the face of relentless, encroaching grey,  had been tending to his prize specimens for over two hours.  The air inside was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, sickly sweet aroma of the rare orchids nestled amongst the miniature trees.  Outside, the world was a swirling, monochrome landscape of rain-slicked asphalt and grey, overcast skies.  Spring, as it often did in the treacherous climes of the Northwind Valley, felt like it was deliberately hiding.

The Northwind Valley wasn't known for its welcoming embrace.  Nestled between the jagged peaks of the Whispering Mountains and a perpetually windswept sea, the valley felt perpetually on the edge of something.  Its beauty, when it dared to show itself, was savage, a dramatic dance of towering pines, cascading waterfalls, and glacial rivers that carved paths through the landscape like restless arteries.  But beneath the stunning facade, a raw, untamed energy pulsed.  A simmering unease, whispered on the wind, resonated through the valley, a feeling that something was just *waiting*.
