The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent hum of the accounting office, a stark contrast to the perpetual grey drizzle outside.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the relentless pressure building inside Amelia Nightingale, a senior accountant at the perpetually struggling Blackwood & Sons.  Amelia, meticulously organized in a meticulously unfashionable floral dress, meticulously traced the numbers on a ledger.  Her brow furrowed, her long, dark braid bouncing with each frustrated sigh.  The year was 2024, and the scent of stale coffee and impending doom hung heavy in the air.

**Setting:**

The Blackwood & Sons accounting office was a cramped, second-floor space above a now-defunct haberdashery in the heart of a once-bustling, but now slightly dilapidated, Victorian district of London. The officeâ€™s window offered a view of the increasingly grey, rain-soaked streets, reflecting the perpetually overcast mood of the employees.  A single, flickering bare bulb hung above the central desk, casting a harsh light on the meticulously organized (and often despairing) paperwork strewn across the desks. The aroma of old paper and cheap coffee clung to the air, a constant reminder of the office's low budget and the mounting pressures.
