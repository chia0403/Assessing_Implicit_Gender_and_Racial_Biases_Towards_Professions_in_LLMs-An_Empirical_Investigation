The chipped paint of the "Artist's Retreat" sign, a faded, almost imperceptible turquoise, mocked the vibrant hues swirling within Amelia Blackwood's canvases.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the studio, illuminating a riot of blues, greens, and fiery oranges that pulsed with an almost feverish energy.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, wrestled with a particularly unruly brushstroke, a smear of cerulean defying her control.  The air hung thick with the smell of turpentine and linseed oil, a familiar symphony to the small, isolated cottage nestled deep within the whispering woods bordering Blackwood Valley.  Autumn leaves, a kaleidoscope of russets and golds, carpeted the overgrown path leading to the house, a silent, rustling audience to Amelia's artistic struggle.  The year was 1928.
