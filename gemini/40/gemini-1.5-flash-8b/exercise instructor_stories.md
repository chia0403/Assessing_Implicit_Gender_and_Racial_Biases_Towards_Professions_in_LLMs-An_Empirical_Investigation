The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending storm.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Sweat Equity" fitness center, a cacophony that mirrored the insistent thump-thump-thump of Amelia Hawthorne's heart.  Amelia, a petite woman with eyes the colour of a summer sky and a perpetually sun-kissed complexion, surveyed the overflowing Zumba class.  Twenty-eight bodies, a kaleidoscope of sweat-slicked fabrics and determined expressions, were moving with a ferocious rhythm.  This wasn't just exercise; it was a ritual, a shared experience that transcended language and background.  Amelia, her own sweat glistening, felt the familiar thrum of adrenaline mix with the anxiety gnawing at her.  Tonight was different. Tonight, the rain felt more like a deluge of unspoken pressures, of expectations, of secrets.  Today's class felt heavier than usual, her usual pep replaced by a simmering unease.
