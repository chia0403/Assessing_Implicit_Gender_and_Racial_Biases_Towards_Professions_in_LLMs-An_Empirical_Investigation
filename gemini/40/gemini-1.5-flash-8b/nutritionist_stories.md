The biting November wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf tighter around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Below, the cobblestone streets of the old Quarter snaked down towards the port, a maelstrom of grey and churning water.  The aroma of salt and fish, usually invigorating, felt heavy, almost oppressive, today.  Amelia, a registered dietitian with a penchant for meticulously planned meals and perfectly portioned servings, found herself acutely aware of the stark contrast between the carefully curated balance in her own life and the chaotic energy surging around her.

Setting:  A chilly November afternoon in the Old Quarter of a coastal city in Brittany, France.  Narrow, winding streets, lined with ancient stone buildings, clustered around a bustling harbor. The air is thick with the salty tang of the sea and the earthy scent of the surrounding countryside.  Amelia, in her early 30s, with her bright, inquisitive eyes and a perpetually organized tote bag, stands at the edge of a crowded marketplace.  The vibrant colours of fresh produce, the lively chatter of vendors, and the incessant honking of delivery carts are a stark counterpoint to the quiet contemplation swirling in her mind.
