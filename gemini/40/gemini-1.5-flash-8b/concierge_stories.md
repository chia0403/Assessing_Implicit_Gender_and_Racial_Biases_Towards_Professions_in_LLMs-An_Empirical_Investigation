The flickering neon sign of the "Grand Zenith Hotel" cast a sickly green glow on Amelia Petrova's impeccably pressed uniform.  Rain hammered against the polished terracotta tiles of the hotel's entrance, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic pace of the city outside.  Inside, the Grand Zenith, a monument to opulent decadence, was a hushed sanctuary from the storm.  Amelia, concierge extraordinaire, stood sentinel at the front desk, her perfectly sculpted eyebrows raised slightly as she surveyed the nearly empty lobby.  Only the muted hum of the air conditioning and the occasional hushed whisper from the staff moving about their tasks broke the silence.  Tonight, the city seemed to have surrendered to the tempest, leaving the hotel, and Amelia, to its own quiet drama.
