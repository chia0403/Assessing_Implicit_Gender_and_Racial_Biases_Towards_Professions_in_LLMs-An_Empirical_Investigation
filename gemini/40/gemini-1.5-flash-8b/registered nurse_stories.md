The fluorescent hum of the emergency room, a constant, low-thrumming soundtrack to Amelia Stone's life, grated on her nerves.  It wasn't the noise itself, but the *expectation* it held – the unspoken, palpable pressure of lives hanging precariously in the balance.  Tonight, the pressure felt particularly thick.  The air, usually a charged mix of antiseptic and fear, was heavy with the scent of burnt sugar and something acrid, almost metallic.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Jude's Hospital, adjusted the lamp over the gurney, the pale, bruised face of a young man beneath it catching the flickering light.  His name tag read, "Liam O'Connell."  The room was a whirlwind of activity—doctors in scrubs, hushed whispers, the rhythmic beep of heart monitors, the frantic clatter of medical equipment – a frantic dance of life and death played out under the unforgiving glare of the overhead lights.  Amelia, however, felt a different kind of pressure, a subtle tightening in her chest, an unease that had nothing to do with the emergency room's usual chaos. It was personal. Something about Liam's face, the way the light caught the faintest hint of a scar under his eye, felt… familiar.  This was no ordinary case of trauma.
