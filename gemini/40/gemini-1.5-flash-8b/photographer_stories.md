The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks.  Rain, a relentless curtain, obscured the already muted hues of the abandoned Victorian mansion,  "Grey Gables," as locals whispered it was known.  Amelia, a photographer with a penchant for the melancholic beauty of decay, adjusted her battered Leica, the metal cold against her gloved hand.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something indefinably floral, hung heavy, a suffocating shroud around the crumbling edifice.  She’d been drawn to Grey Gables like a moth to a flickering flame – the stories whispered about its former inhabitants, the faded grandeur, the palpable sense of history echoing in the empty rooms.  Today, she hoped to capture more than just the derelict architecture; she hoped to unearth the ghosts within.

Grey Gables stood on a hill overlooking the sprawling, industrial city of Ashwood.  The city, a concrete jungle of towering factories and choked waterways, was a stark contrast to the overgrown, ivy-clad mansion.  A network of narrow, cobbled streets, lined with decaying shop fronts and flickering gaslights, wound their way to the mansion’s imposing entrance.  A single, almost skeletal, oak tree, twisted and gnarled by the relentless weather, stood sentinel at the property’s gate.  Amelia felt a frisson of trepidation, not only for the potential dangers of exploring the decrepit house, but for the mystery it held, a mystery that promised to be as captivating as it was terrifying.
