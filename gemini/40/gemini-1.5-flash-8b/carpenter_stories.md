The biting wind whipped through the gaps in the dilapidated scaffolding surrounding the cathedral, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the loose boards he held.  He hunched further into his worn leather apron, the scent of damp stone and aged wood filling his lungs.  Below, the cobbled streets of Eldoria were a swirling tapestry of grey and brown, the dim light of the setting sun barely penetrating the gloom.  Dust motes danced in the last rays, illuminating the intricate carvings of the cathedral's facade, figures of saints and gargoyles, silent sentinels against the encroaching night. Elias, a carpenter of renown (though not wealth) in this forgotten corner of the kingdom, was tasked with the monumental, almost impossible, job of reinforcing the north spire.  The cathedral, a symbol of Eldoria's faded grandeur, was groaning under the weight of time and neglect.  Heâ€™d been at it for weeks, each day a relentless struggle against the elements and the crumbling stone. The cathedral was his obsession, his refuge, and today, he felt closer to its tormented spirit than ever before.
