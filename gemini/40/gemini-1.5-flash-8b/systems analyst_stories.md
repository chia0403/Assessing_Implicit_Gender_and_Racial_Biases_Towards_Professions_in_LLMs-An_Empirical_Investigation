The fluorescent hum of the server room, a low, persistent thrum that vibrated through Amelia Petrova's bones, was almost a comforting presence.  Tonight, it was a symphony of impending doom.  Rows upon rows of gleaming metal cabinets, each a miniature universe of whirring fans and blinking lights, held the digital lifeblood of the entire city.  Amelia, a systems analyst for MetroNet, the colossal communications network underpinning the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Veridia, felt the weight of that responsibility pressing down on her like a physical force.  It was almost 2 AM, and the usual quiet hum was punctuated by a series of erratic beeps, escalating from low, almost imperceptible chirps to a rapid, insistent staccato.  Red lights flashed across the control panel, each one a digital exclamation point demanding immediate attention.
