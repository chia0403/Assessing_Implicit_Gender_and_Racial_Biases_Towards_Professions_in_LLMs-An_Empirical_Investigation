Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Eagle's Nest" law firm, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Blackwood's head.  The tiny, cluttered office, smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation, was illuminated only by the harsh glare of a single fluorescent bulb.

Outside, the city roared, a concrete jungle drowning in a deluge.  The year was 2042, and the towering skyscrapers of Neo-Manhattan pierced the grey sky, their chrome facades reflecting the relentless downpour.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and impending doom, hung heavy over the city, a foreshadowing of the trials she was about to face.
