The biting wind, a razor-sharp shard of winter, whipped across the exposed slopes of the Silvan Mountains.  Dust, kicked up by the relentless gusts, stung Elias Thornewood's eyes, blurring the already-dim light filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines that clung desperately to the rocky face.  He squinted, his breath fogging in the frigid air, and adjusted the leather strap that held his hammer, its familiar weight a comforting presence in the howling wilderness.  Elias, a stone cutter of unparalleled skill, was alone, once more, carving a niche into the mountainside.  This particular rock face, a vein of obsidian shimmering with inner fire, had captured his imagination for months, a silent challenge whispered into the wind.  The mountain itself seemed to hold its breath, watching him, a colossal, indifferent guardian.

His workshop, if one could call it that, was a simple alcove carved into the mountain, barely large enough to accommodate his tools and himself.  Rough-hewn timber, salvaged from felled trees, served as supports for a rudimentary workbench and a fire pit that struggled against the persistent chill.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint echo of hammering, a rhythmic pulse that spoke of his dedication to the craft.  Elias was a creature of the mountains, as much a part of their stony heart as the eagles that soared above him.  This was his kingdom, his sanctuary, his prison.
