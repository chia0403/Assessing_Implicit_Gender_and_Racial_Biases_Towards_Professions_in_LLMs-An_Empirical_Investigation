Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Hope Haven" sheltered workshop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whirring of the sewing machine and the muted clanging of metal on metal.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, Occupational Therapist, adjusted her glasses, the lenses reflecting the flickering fluorescent lights.  Hope Haven, a small, community-based workshop for individuals with varying abilities, was a far cry from the gleaming, modern rehab facility where she'd spent the first years of her career. Yet, here, amidst the familiar smells of sawdust and fabric softener, Amy found a different kind of fulfillment.

The setting was a small, sun-dappled town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  The air, usually crisp and clean, hung heavy with the pre-storm dampness.  The town itself, once bustling with industry, now relied heavily on tourism and small businesses, its economic pulse a little slower than the rhythm of the nearby river.  Hope Haven, tucked away on a quiet side street, was a testament to the community's continued support for its residents.   The building, while charmingly weathered, held a quiet dignity, a testament to the dedication of the volunteers and staff who toiled within its walls.  Amy, with her neatly pressed uniform and practical boots, felt oddly at home amongst the familiar chaos.
