The flickering neon sign of "Mr. Fix-It Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a persistent, unwelcome guest, seeped from beneath the crumbling brickwork, pooling in a small, stagnant puddle near the entrance.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, a man whose weathered hands seemed to have absorbed the grime of countless leaky pipes and clogged drains, hunched over a busted porcelain throne.  The porcelain, a sickly shade of faded turquoise, mocked the faint glimmer of hope in Barty's eyes.  He'd been at it for three hours, wrestling with a stubborn clog that had defied every known plumbing trick in his arsenal.  The faint, metallic tang of copper filled the air, mingling with the stench of mildew and despair.  Outside, the rhythm of the city – the honking of taxis, the clatter of garbage trucks, the distant wail of a siren – hammered against the walls, a relentless reminder of the world waiting patiently, while Barty was trapped in this subterranean purgatory.  Barty sighed, a sound like rusty hinges protesting.  He needed a miracle.
