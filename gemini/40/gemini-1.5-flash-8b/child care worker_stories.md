The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" preschool hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's day.  Dust motes danced in the relentless beams, illuminating the chaotic scene of toddlers constructing towers of colourful blocks, preschoolers meticulously colouring pictures of fantastical creatures, and a tiny, determined girl named Lily trying to wrestle a purple dinosaur into a plastic swimming pool. Amelia, a child care worker with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the secret of countless scraped knees and happy squeals, surveyed the scene.  The air was thick with the sweet smell of crayons and the faint, almost imperceptible, scent of baby powder.  Today, however, something was different.  A preternaturally quiet hum permeated the air, a silence that felt heavier than the usual chatter.  It hung in the air like a forgotten promise, a hush that seemed to press down on Amelia, drawing her attention to the tiny, almost imperceptible tremble in the corner of the room, where a group of four-year-olds huddled around a chipped, porcelain doll.
