The fluorescent lights of the Hawthorne Middle School gymnasium hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Amy" Sterling's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of stale pizza and teenage angst, hung heavy, mirroring the weight in her chest.  It was Tuesday, a day she'd dreaded since the Principal, Mr. Henderson, had summoned her to this very room â€“ a room usually echoing with boisterous cheers and the clatter of basketballs, now silent except for the occasional, stifled sniffle.  Today, it held the potential for a crisis.

Amy, a school psychologist with five years under her belt and a doctorate in developmental psychology, stood poised, her polished black shoes reflecting the harsh overhead lights. Her neatly-pressed beige cardigan and sensible trousers seemed incongruous in this cavernous space, a stark contrast to the chaotic energy she sensed emanating from the students clustered in the corners, hushed and withdrawn.  She knew, instinctively, that the quiet wasn't peace. It was anticipation, charged and heavy with unspoken anxieties.  The gymnasium walls, painted a sterile, cheerful yellow, felt suffocating now. The muted sounds of hushed whispers and shifting feet carried on the stale air, a symphony of unspoken fears.  The air crackled with unspoken anxieties, like a static-laden radio signal.
