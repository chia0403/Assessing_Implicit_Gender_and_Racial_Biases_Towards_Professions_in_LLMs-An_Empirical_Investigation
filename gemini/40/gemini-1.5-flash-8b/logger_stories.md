The biting wind, a relentless rasp against Silas Blackwood's weathered face, whipped snow into stinging flakes.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the coarse wool offering little solace against the encroaching chill.  The timberline, a jagged, frosted scar on the mountainside, was his kingdom, his workshop, and his prison.  Silas, a seasoned logger with eyes the colour of old pinewood and hands calloused to the point of bone, surveyed the towering firs that clung precariously to the mountain.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending winter, hummed with a silent, almost palpable tension.  It was the kind of day that spoke of storms brewing, both on the mountain and within the heart of a man.

Setting:

The remote, snow-dusted peaks of the Cascade Mountains, in the northern region of the Pacific Northwest.  A jagged, rugged landscape of towering evergreens, cascading waterfalls, and hidden, shadowed valleys.  The Blackwood family had lived and worked these woods for generations, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the forest, their history etched into the very heartwood of the ancient trees.  Silasâ€™s small cabin, a weathered structure clinging precariously to the mountainside, was his sanctuary, but also a symbol of isolation, a testament to the lonely existence of a logger in a vast and unforgiving wilderness.  The silence, punctuated only by the snapping of branches and the distant howl of a wolf, was almost palpable.
