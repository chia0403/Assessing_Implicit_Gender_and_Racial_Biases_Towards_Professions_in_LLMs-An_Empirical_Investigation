The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Dusty Rose" diner, a rhythmic counterpoint to the clatter of Amelia "Ace" Stone's chipped porcelain coffee mug.  Rain-slicked streets reflected the neon glow of the diner's sign, casting an eerie luminescence over the otherwise deserted back alleys of Ashwood.  Ace, a private investigator with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a reputation as sharp as broken glass, stirred her lukewarm coffee.  Her worn leather trench coat, a testament to countless nights spent chasing shadows, hung heavy on her frame.  Across the greasy table, a half-eaten plate of pancakes sat untouched, a silent companion to the mounting unease in her stomach.

The setting: Ashwood, a sprawling, forgotten industrial town clinging to the outskirts of the rust belt.  Grey skies, perpetually overcast, seemed to reflect the melancholic spirit of the place.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light filtering through the grimy windows, clinging to the chipped paint and faded posters plastered across the walls of the diner.  This particular diner, the sole beacon of activity in this forgotten corner, was the meeting point for whispered secrets and hushed conversations.  Ace, with her keen eye for detail and her knack for finding the hidden threads in complex mysteries, had been summoned here by a client whose identity was as cryptic as the town's history.
