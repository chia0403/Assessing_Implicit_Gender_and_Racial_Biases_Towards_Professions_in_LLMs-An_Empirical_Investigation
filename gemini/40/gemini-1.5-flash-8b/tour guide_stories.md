The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  Below, the cobbled streets of Prague snaked their way through a landscape of towering, fairytale architecture.  A shiver, not just from the chill, but from a profound unease, ran down her spine.  Today, her meticulously planned tour of the Old Town Square – a tour she’d led hundreds of times – felt different.  Something was off.  The air hung thick with a palpable, almost tangible sense of foreboding, a whisper of history stirring in the shadows.  The usual chatter of tourists, the melodic strains of street musicians, the rhythmic clinking of trams – all seemed muted, strangely distant.


Amelia, a thirty-five-year-old tour guide with eyes the colour of polished mahogany and a voice that could soothe a storm, adjusted her satchel.  She surveyed the Square, a vast expanse of ancient stone, packed with tourists – mostly oblivious to the growing sense of unease that clung to her like damp wool.  Today's group, a boisterous throng from Japan, were currently glued to their cameras, their excited chatter lost in the almost-silent hum of the impending tension.  Her company logo, a small, intricately carved golden raven, felt oddly heavy on her breast pocket.
