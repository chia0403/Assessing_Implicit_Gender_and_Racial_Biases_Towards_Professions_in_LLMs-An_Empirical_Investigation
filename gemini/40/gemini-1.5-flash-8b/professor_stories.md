Professor Eleanor Vance-Ashworth, a woman whose spectacles perpetually magnified the faintest glimmer of dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun, adjusted her tweed jacket.  The scent of aged parchment and decaying oak hung heavy in the air of the Radcliffe Manuscript Room, a space consecrated to the whispers of forgotten centuries.  Sunlight, fractured by stained-glass windows depicting biblical scenes, painted the room in a kaleidoscope of colours, illuminating the towering shelves laden with leather-bound volumes, their spines embossed with cryptic symbols and faded gold lettering.  Eleanor, with her hawk-like gaze and a scholar’s quiet confidence, felt a familiar thrill, a sense of ancient power residing within the very walls of the room.  This wasn’t just a library; it was a portal.  Today, however, the portal seemed… different.  A strange, almost musical hum resonated beneath her feet, a sound that vibrated not only through the stone floor but through the very essence of the manuscripts themselves.
