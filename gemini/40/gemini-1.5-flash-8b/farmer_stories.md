The biting wind whipped across the parched earth, carrying with it the mournful cries of gulls circling the skeletal remains of last year's wheat stalks.  Barnaby "Barn" Hemlock, weathered and lean like the ancient oaks that dotted his smallholding, squinted at the bruised, barren fields.  Dust devils danced across the cracked topsoil, mirroring the turmoil in his gut.  It was the first true drought of his lifetime, and the relentless sun beat down on the parched land as relentlessly as it beat down on his spirit.  

Setting: The Hemlock Farm, nestled in a sun-baked valley of the Western Great Plains, a stark contrast to the verdant hillsides that once surrounded it.  Dust, the colour of rust and burnt umber, coated everything: the tractor, the weathered farmhouse, even the chipped paint on the outhouse.  The air hung heavy and still, punctuated only by the distant rumble of a distant thunderstorm, a phantom promise that never seemed to reach the valley.  The few, struggling, thirsty weeds that dared to peek through the cracked earth whispered tales of the past, of richer, more bountiful times.
