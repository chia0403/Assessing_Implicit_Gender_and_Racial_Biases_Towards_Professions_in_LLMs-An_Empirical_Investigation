The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia “Amy” Carmichael's instruments.  Amy, a dental hygienist with hands as steady as a hummingbird's wings, meticulously polished a patient's molars. The patient, a middle-aged woman with worried eyes, sighed softly.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of city life – car horns, sirens, distant construction – blurred into a white noise that Amy ignored, shielding herself in the sterile, almost antiseptic silence of the dentist's office.  It was a Tuesday, a day like any other in the bustling metropolis of New Alexandria.

The office, tucked away on a narrow street lined with brick buildings and overflowing with the scent of roasted coffee from the nearby bakery, was a study in muted colours.  Creamy walls, dove-grey countertops, and the ever-present, slightly antiseptic tang of bleach.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, cast a pale yellow glow on the gleaming instruments and the meticulously organized drawers.  This wasn't a luxurious practice; it was a place where people came for care, not for a glamorous experience.  A small framed print of a blossoming cherry blossom tree, a relic from a previous patient, hung above the reception desk, a silent promise of renewal in the midst of the daily grind.
