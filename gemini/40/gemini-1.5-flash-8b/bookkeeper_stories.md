The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Tally Ho" accounting office hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated only by the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Butterfield's fingers on the worn keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a scene of cluttered desks, overflowing coffee mugs, and the faint, almost comforting aroma of stale coffee and desperation.  Amelia, a woman whose practicality was as etched into her face as the lines around her eyes, hunched over a spreadsheet, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The year was 1987.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and something vaguely chemical, like old paper and unwashed bodies.  Outside, the city of Zenith thrummed with its own relentless energy, a cacophony of honking taxis and sirens, oblivious to the quiet struggle within the tiny office tucked away on the second floor of a crumbling skyscraper. Amelia, with her sensible beige pantsuit and perfectly-combed, dark brown hair, was its silent heart.
