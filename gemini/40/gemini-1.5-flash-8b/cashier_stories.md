The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Penelope Featherstone's life.  The tiny, cluttered store, a beige monolith on the corner of Elm and Pine, smelled faintly of stale coffee and old paper.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window, illuminating a half-eaten bag of potato chips resting precariously on a shelf of expired candy. Amelia, a cashier with eyes the colour of faded amethyst, watched the chipped paint on the checkout counter, a miniature battlefield of receipts and crumpled coupons.  Today, as always, the rhythm of the store was her rhythm â€“ the rhythmic *click* of the cash register, the muffled murmurs of customers, the insistent *ding* of the bell above the door.  She was, in short, utterly, wonderfully, and inexplicably, stuck.
