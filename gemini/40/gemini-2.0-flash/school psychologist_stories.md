## The Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed like a trapped hive of bees, a sound Dr. Eleanor Anne Vance had come to associate with chronic stress headaches and the faint, metallic tang of impending panic attacks. Outside, a torrential downpour hammered against the windowpanes of her cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her own chest. It was Friday afternoon, the tail end of a week that had already felt a month long, and she was officially out of Kleenex. 

Eleanor rubbed her temples, the bridge of her nose aching from hours of squinting at standardized test results and deciphering cryptic doodles from kids who'd rather be anywhere but sitting across from her. The "Be Kind" poster above her head, peeling slightly at the corner, felt mocking. Lately, kindness seemed in short supply, especially in the hallowed halls of Northwood, and especially for her.

A sharp rap on the door startled her. "Come in," she managed to croak, her voice raspy from overuse.

Mrs. Gable, the school secretary, a woman whose perpetual good cheer usually grated on Eleanor's nerves, poked her head in, her face uncharacteristically serious. "Dr. Vance," she said, her voice low, "Principal Davies needs to see you. Immediately."

Eleanorâ€™s stomach clenched. Immediately. That was never good.

## The Setting:

**Northwood High School**, located in the affluent, albeit increasingly disillusioned, suburban town of Oakhaven, Connecticut. The school building itself is a sprawling brick edifice, a relic of the 1970s with recent (and questionable) additions that seem to clash with the original architecture. 

The general atmosphere is one of high achievement and intense pressure. College prep is practically a religion, and extracurricular activities are seen as stepping stones, not genuine interests. Beneath the polished veneer of academic excellence lies a simmering undercurrent of anxiety, competition, and a surprising amount of loneliness.

**Dr. Eleanor Vance's Office:** A small, windowless room located on the quieter side of the building, near the art rooms and the notoriously underfunded music department. Eleanor has tried to personalize the space with potted plants (mostly withered from neglect), a collection of quirky coffee mugs, and artwork created by her students. However, the overwhelming impression is still one of institutional blandness. The walls are painted a generic beige, the furniture is functional but uninspired, and the air always seems slightly stale, carrying the faint scent of disinfectant and adolescent angst.
