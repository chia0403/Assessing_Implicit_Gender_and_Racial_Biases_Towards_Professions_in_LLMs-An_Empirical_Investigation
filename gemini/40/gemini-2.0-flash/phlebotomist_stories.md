Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a phlebotomist:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of the "QuickCare Urgent Clinic" buzzed with a relentless, irritating hum, a sound that had burrowed its way into the marrow of Amelia Rose Davies' bones. It was 6:15 AM, the pre-dawn darkness still clinging stubbornly to the edges of the windows, and the clinic was already buzzing with a low, anxious energy. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and desperation. Empty chairs lined the waiting room, soon to be filled with coughing children, bleary-eyed parents, and individuals carrying a myriad of minor and not-so-minor ailments. The walls, painted a sterile, vaguely calming shade of pale green, were adorned with posters promoting flu shots and healthy eating habits â€“ ironic, given the stressed-out state of everyone who worked here. Behind the reception desk, a lone receptionist, her hair pulled back in a tight bun, already looked defeated.

**Opening:**

Amelia Rose Davies meticulously sharpened the bevel of a butterfly needle, the rhythmic scrape a small act of defiance against the morning's encroaching chaos. She preferred the older, manual sharpeners, the control it gave her soothing. It was a tiny ritual, a way to center herself before plunging into the daily symphony of poking, prodding, and occasionally, placating patients terrified of needles. Even after five years as a phlebotomist, the fear in their eyes never quite lost its sting.  Today, a particularly long list of lab orders was pinned to her workstation, courtesy of Dr. Hemmings, who had a habit of scheduling more tests than were strictly necessary, in Amelia's opinion. She sighed, a small puff of air that stirred a stray strand of her auburn hair. "Another day, another ten vials of Type A, desperately-avoiding-life's-complications blood," she muttered under her breath, the dark humor her only shield against the daily grind. Just as she finished sharpening the needle, a harried voice crackled over the intercom. "Amelia, patient in room three needs a STAT CBC and CMP. Says he feels like he's 'dying'." Amelia rolled her eyes, the morning had officially begun.
