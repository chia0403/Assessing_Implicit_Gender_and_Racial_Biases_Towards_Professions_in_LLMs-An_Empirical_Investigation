## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The shimmering, almost painfully bright, atrium of the "Starlight Technologies" headquarters, a behemoth of glass and steel that dominated the Seattle skyline. It was early, just shy of 4:00 AM, and the pre-dawn gloom outside was subtly reflected in the polished chrome sculptures that dotted the space. Futuristic, minimalist benches sat empty, reflecting the artificial starlight cast by strategically placed uplights.

**Story Opening:**

The hum of the floor buffer was a lonely counterpoint to the city's distant rumble. **Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins**, hunched over his machine, sighed a cloud of coffee-scented breath into the cool air. He hated this atrium. It was all gleaming surfaces and impossible angles, designed to impress investors and potential employees with the company's cutting-edge image. But to Bart, it was just a gigantic, echoing dust magnet. He knew, with a weariness that settled deep in his bones, that no matter how meticulously he buffed, there would still be a faint layer of micro-dust clinging to every surface by the time the first sleek-suited executives arrived, fresh from their West Coast modern homes and ready to conquer the digital world. He just hoped they wouldn't notice. Again.
