## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging the cheeks of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins as he unlocked the heavy padlock on the door of Higgins & Sons Butchers. It was 4:30 AM, a time of day only sea gulls, fishing trawlers, and purveyors of fresh meat were privy to. He shuffled inside, the scent of sawdust, cured meats, and faintly metallic tang a comforting embrace after the icy assault outside. Bart flipped the single fluorescent light switch, bathing the small shop in a stark, unforgiving glow that revealed every speck of dust and smear on the tiled floor.

## Setting:

The Higgins & Sons Butchers shop clung to the edge of the harbor in the small, perpetually windswept fishing town of Port Abernathy, Scotland. The shop itself was small, a single room dominated by a long, gleaming stainless steel counter. Behind it, a vast array of knives hung on a magnetic strip, each meticulously cleaned and sharpened. A walk-in freezer hummed menacingly in the back, its door plastered with faded posters advertising local farm festivals and the annual haggis-hurling competition.

The walls were painted a pale, institutional green, and framed photographs adorned them: Bart as a chubby-cheeked boy, proudly holding a prize-winning rabbit; his father, a gruff but kind-eyed man, gutting a salmon with practiced ease; and a sepia-toned portrait of his grandfather, the founder of Higgins & Sons, looking stern and resolute. The air was thick with the history of the Higgins family, a history inextricably linked to the town and the meat that nourished it. Port Abernathy relied on its fishermen and farmers, and Higgins & Sons relied on them both.
