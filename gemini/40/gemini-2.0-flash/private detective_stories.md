The stale coffee fumes clinging to the air of my office were doing a piss-poor job of masking the scent of desperation that'd seeped into every crack and crevice of the room. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a bluesy lament against the boarded-up windows, mirroring the mournful tune playing in my gut. Another rent check bounced, another client vanished into thin air, another day closer to joining the pigeons on the fire escape for a meal.

I swirled the dregs of my coffee, watching the murky liquid cling to the chipped ceramic of my lucky "World's Greatest Grandpa" mug – a cruel joke considering my estranged relationship with my own family. The buzzer to my office door hadn't sung in days. Business was dryer than a politician's promise.

Then, a knock.

Not the hesitant, timid rap of a bill collector, but a firm, authoritative thump that vibrated right through the floorboards. I straightened my tie, the one I reserved for funerals and potential clients, and plastered on a smile that felt about as authentic as a three-dollar bill.

"Come in," I rasped, my voice rusty from disuse.

The door swung inward, revealing a figure silhouetted against the dim hallway light. As the figure stepped inside, casting long, dramatic shadows across the room, I knew my luck – for better or worse – was about to change.

My name is **Arthur Reginald Blackwood**, and I'm a private detective. Or, at least, I like to think I am.
