Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an occupational therapist:

**Setting:** The story opens on a crisp autumn morning in the bustling outpatient rehabilitation clinic of St. Jude's Hospital in downtown Chicago. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the stainless steel of the parallel bars. The scent of disinfectant mingled with the sweeter aroma of the pumpkin spice candles burning at the reception desk – a feeble attempt to combat the institutional smell. The clinic was alive with the quiet hum of activity: therapists guiding patients through exercises, the rhythmic whir of a stationary bike, and the muted chatter of conversations held in hushed tones. Colorful motivational posters adorned the walls, offering platitudes about perseverance and recovery, a subtle encouragement to the patients fighting their way back to independence.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor “Ellie” Marie Vance took a deep breath, the scent of pumpkin spice doing little to soothe the knot forming in her stomach. At 32, with her bright, almost unnaturally sunny disposition, she looked too young to be an occupational therapist with nearly a decade of experience. She checked her reflection in the polished glass of the hand therapy table, smoothing down a stray strand of her auburn hair. Despite the outward appearance of composure, a quiet anxiety gnawed at her. Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter recovering from a stroke, was waiting. He was a tough case, progress slow and frustrating for both of them. Today, he was supposed to attempt buttoning his shirt independently – a small, almost insignificant victory for most, but a monumental hurdle for him. Ellie knew that his success, or failure, rested heavily on her ability to break down the task, to coax and encourage without patronizing. Today wasn't just about buttons; it was about dignity. And Ellie, more than anything, wanted to give him back his. But some days, the weight of that responsibility felt crushing. As she approached the treatment bay, she plastered on her signature smile, the one that reached her eyes and crinkled the corners. "Good morning, Mr. Henderson! Ready to tackle those buttons?"
