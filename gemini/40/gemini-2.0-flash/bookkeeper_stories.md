## Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Bartholomew Finch, a man whose life was as meticulously balanced as his ledger sheets, squinted at the flickering fluorescent light above his desk. It had been buzzing with a frantic energy for weeks, a tiny, maddening rebellion against the order he so desperately craved. He tapped his pen against the meticulously aligned columns of numbers, a low, rhythmic tick that barely registered above the murmur of the air conditioner and the occasional sigh of a colleague. Today, however, the tick felt like a drumbeat of impending doom. Mrs. Higgins, the owner of "Higgins' Haberdashery & Notions," was due any minute, and Bartholomew knew, with the icy certainty of a well-balanced budget, that she was bringing a box overflowing with receipts held together by nothing but wishful thinking and the faint scent of lavender.

**Setting:**

Bartholomew Finch's office was located in a nondescript, beige-walled building on the outskirts of a small, forgettable town called Harmony Creek, Ohio. "Precise Accounting, LLC" occupied the ground floor, sharing the space with a discount tax preparation service and a perpetually out-of-order vending machine that dispensed lukewarm soda and stale pretzels. Bartholomew's workspace was his sanctuary, a meticulously organized haven in the chaotic sea of financial instability that he navigated daily. His desk was a fortress of order: a perfectly aligned calendar, a pen holder filled with precisely sharpened pencils, and stacks of manila folders labeled with crisp, black lettering. The only decorations were a framed picture of his late cat, Mittens, perched regally on a stack of financial journals, and a small, plastic calculator perpetually set to two decimal places. A faint scent of lemon polish hung in the air, a testament to Bartholomew's relentless battle against dust and disorder. Outside his window, the view was equally unremarkable: a parking lot shimmering under the midday sun and the distant, hazy outline of the Harmony Creek water tower, proudly proclaiming the town's motto: "Where Life is Simple, and Finances are... Manageable."
