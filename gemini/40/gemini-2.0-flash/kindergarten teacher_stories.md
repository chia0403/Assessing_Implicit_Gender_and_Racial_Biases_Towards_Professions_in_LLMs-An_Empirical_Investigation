The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Penelope Iris Hawthorne's kindergarten classroom buzzed, a sound she'd long ago learned to tune out, much like the incessant chatter of twenty-three five-year-olds. It was Tuesday morning at Sunflower Sunshine Academy, a cheerfully named private school nestled in the heart of Maple Creek, a town known more for its antique shops and artisanal cheese than its progressive educational practices. Penelope, however, was determined to bring a little progressive spirit into her corner of the institution.

Her brightly painted classroom, adorned with construction paper flowers and lopsided clay animals, was usually a beacon of controlled chaos, but this Tuesday felt different. An undercurrent of nervous energy, thick as finger paint, permeated the air. The culprit? "Show and Tell" day. Or, as Penelope privately referred to it, "The Day Mommy and Daddy Decide to Overcompensate with an Unnecessary and Often Bragging-Rights-Fueled Display of Family Affluence."
