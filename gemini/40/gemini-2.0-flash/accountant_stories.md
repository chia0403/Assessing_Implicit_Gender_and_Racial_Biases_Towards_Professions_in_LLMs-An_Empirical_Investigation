The hum of the fluorescent lights in cubicle C-47 seemed to vibrate right through Amelia Christine Davies’ molars. Another Thursday afternoon, another mountain of receipts threatening to bury her alive. Outside, the Seattle drizzle whispered against the office windows, a soothing counterpoint to the inner turmoil that gnawed at her. Amelia hated Thursdays. They were the day before Friday, technically close to the weekend, but still so stubbornly entrenched in the drudgery of the working week that they felt almost spiteful.

The setting was the fifth floor of "Pinnacle Investments," a gleaming glass and steel tower overlooking Elliott Bay. From Amelia’s cubicle, if she craned her neck and fought past the sea of beige fabric dividers, she could just glimpse a sliver of the ferries chugging back and forth, a tantalizing reminder of life beyond spreadsheets and fiscal years. The air in the office was perpetually thick with the scent of stale coffee and the low murmur of phone conversations and keyboard clicks. It was a sterile, beige-on-beige purgatory, a stark contrast to Amelia’s vibrant, though currently suppressed, personality. The walls were adorned with generic motivational posters featuring soaring eagles and triumphant slogans, slogans that mocked her increasingly desperate longing for something more than balancing debits and credits. This was her life, for now, and Amelia Christine Davies, Accountant Extraordinaire (or, as she preferred, mildly competent and deeply unfulfilled), was starting to feel decidedly unbalanced.
