Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a physician's assistant as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic clung to the humid air of the Elmswood Clinic, a familiar comfort to Anya Petrova. But today, it couldn't quite mask the undercurrent of anxiety that thrummed through the small, beige-walled examination room. Anya, a physician's assistant with five years under her belt, adjusted the paper gown crinkling under Mrs. Henderson's fidgeting hands. The elderly woman's face was etched with worry lines deeper than Anya had ever seen.

"Dr. Mallory will be in shortly, Mrs. Henderson," Anya said, forcing a reassuring smile. "He just got held up with an emergency over at the rehab center. He wanted me to get your vitals and ask about any changes since your last visit. Just the usual song and dance, nothing to worry about."

Mrs. Henderson's hand, gnarled and speckled with age spots, tightened on Anya's. "It's this cough, Anya. It just won't quit. And lately, I've beenâ€¦ tired. Bone tired, like I haven't slept in a week."

Anya gently unwrapped Mrs. Henderson's hand and picked up the blood pressure cuff. "We'll get it figured out, Mrs. Henderson. Just breathe easy for me." As she pumped the cuff, she couldn't shake the unsettling feeling in her gut. This wasn't just an ordinary cough. Something deeper was going on, and Anya knew, with a growing dread, that whatever it was, it was likely to be something they wouldn't like.

**Setting:**

*   **Elmswood Clinic:** A small, privately owned medical clinic located in the quiet, suburban town of Elmswood, Massachusetts. It caters primarily to the town's aging population, offering general check-ups, vaccinations, and basic medical care. The clinic itself is housed in a converted two-story house, painted a bland beige with a small, overgrown garden in the front. The interior is clean but dated, with worn carpeting, generic artwork, and the persistent smell of disinfectant.

*   **Anya's Role:** Anya is a vital part of the Elmswood Clinic, acting as Dr. Mallory's right hand. She handles a variety of tasks, from taking patient histories and administering vaccinations to assisting with minor procedures and managing the clinic's administrative duties. She's known for her empathy, her sharp mind, and her dedication to her patients, making her a beloved figure in the community.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these elements.
