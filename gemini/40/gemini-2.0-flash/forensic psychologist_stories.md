Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a forensic psychologist main character:

**Story Opening:**

The stale air of the interview room hung heavy, thick with unspoken accusations and the faint, lingering scent of cheap disinfectant. Dr. Evelyn Reed, her face etched with a weariness that belied her relatively young age of thirty-eight, adjusted the microphone clipped to the collar of her crisp white blouse. Across the steel table, Silas Thorne, a hulking figure with eyes that shifted like mercury, stared back at her with a chilling indifference. He hadn't spoken a word in the past hour, only occasionally twisting the paperclip he'd swiped from the table into increasingly grotesque shapes.

"Mr. Thorne," Evelyn began, her voice calm and measured, a practiced counterpoint to the frantic thrumming in her chest. "We've been over this. The more forthcoming you are, the better we can understand… the circumstances."

Thorne chuckled, a low rumble that vibrated the very air. "Circumstances? You mean the 'circumstances' that left a little girl lying face down in the creek? Don't insult me, Doc. You know exactly what this is."

Evelyn took a deep breath, ignoring the way his words pricked at her skin. It was a game they both played, a dance on the edge of truth and deception. "I'm trying to understand your motivations, Mr. Thorne. What led you to…" She paused, choosing her words with excruciating care. "To that point."

He finally looked at her, a flicker of something unreadable dancing in his eyes. "Maybe," he said, his voice a barely audible whisper, "you should try harder."

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in and around **Nashville, Tennessee.** More specifically, key locations include:

*   **The Nashville County Detention Center:** A modern, maximum-security facility with sterile, utilitarian interview rooms, and holding cells. This is where Dr. Reed conducts many of her assessments and interviews.
*   **The Forensic Psychology Unit of Nashville General Hospital:** Dr. Reed's primary office is located within this unit. It's a somewhat chaotic space, filled with files, case studies, and the lingering emotional residue of countless troubled minds.
*   **The Criminal Courts Building in downtown Nashville:** A grand, imposing structure where trials take place, and where Dr. Reed often testifies as an expert witness.
*   **Dr. Reed's Victorian-era house in the historic Germantown neighborhood:** This provides a contrast to her professional life. It's filled with antique furniture, overflowing bookshelves, and a small, meticulously tended garden that serves as her sanctuary.
*   **Various crime scenes and locations relevant to ongoing investigations.**
*   **Less frequently, locations related to Nashville's music scene, as Dr. Reed occasionally uses live music events to unwind.**

The story takes place in **the present day.**
