The fluorescent lights of the Archibald Finch & Son law firm hummed a monotonous, pre-dawn tune, a soundtrack familiar to Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth. At 5:30 AM, she was usually the only soul stirring within the glass and steel behemoth on the 32nd floor, besides the occasional security guard making their rounds. Beatrice, however, found a certain serenity in the quiet solitude.

The setting was quintessential law firm: meticulously organized, oppressively beige, and saturated with the lingering scent of expensive mahogany polish. The air hung heavy with the ghosts of legal battles fought and won (or lost) within its walls. Her small desk, nestled in a corner just outside the formidable office of Mr. Archibald Finch Jr. himself, was a tiny island of controlled chaos in this sea of order. A half-finished crossword puzzle lay beside a stack of files, balanced precariously on a chipped ceramic mug filled with lukewarm coffee. Today, however, even the comforting familiarity of her morning routine felt unsettling. A knot of anxiety tightened in Beatrice's stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite shake as she unlocked her computer and waited for the sluggish system to boot up.
