## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, mirroring the dreary afternoon rainfall lashing against the window. Beatrice Eleanor Fairbanks stared blankly at the computer screen, the vibrant image of a turquoise lagoon in Bora Bora doing little to pierce her current mood. A client had just hung up, screaming about bed bugs and inedible buffet food at a "luxury" resort she had personally recommended. Beatrice sighed, the familiar sting of failure settling in her stomach. This wasnâ€™t the romantic, globe-trotting career she had dreamed of. This was damage control, endless apologies, and the sinking feeling that she was slowly becoming the human equivalent of a hold music loop.  Maybe it was time to finally take that leap of faith, the one she'd been meticulously planning in her head for the last five years. Maybe it was time for Beatrice Eleanor Fairbanks to finally book a trip...for herself.

**Setting:**

Beatrice works at "Globetrotter Getaways," a modestly sized travel agency located in a strip mall in the unassuming suburban town of Willow Creek, Ohio. The office itself is a testament to the fluctuating state of the travel industry. Once brightly decorated with posters of exotic locales and overflowing with brochures, it now feels cramped and slightly faded. The walls are painted a cheerful, but slightly peeling, sunshine yellow. Four cluttered desks face each other, separated by low, fabric-covered partitions. Beatrice's desk is a particularly organized chaos, featuring stacks of travel guides, overflowing inboxes, and a half-eaten bag of pretzels permanently residing next to her computer monitor. The back room houses a barely functional coffee machine, a perpetually jammed printer, and a dusty collection of outdated luggage samples. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet desperation, punctuated by the occasional ringing phone and the weary sighs of its employees.
