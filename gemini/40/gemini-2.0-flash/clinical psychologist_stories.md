## Story Opening:

The scent of old paper and simmering anxiety hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s small, book-lined office. Rain hammered against the windowpane, mirroring the relentless rhythm of her own thoughts. Eleanor shifted in her well-worn leather chair, the springs groaning in protest. She knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that her next patient was going to be a challenge. Mr. Silas Blackwood’s intake forms were a sparse, unsettling haiku of vagueness and implied violence. Occupation: “Independent Researcher.” Reason for seeking therapy: “Persistent disquiet.” Referral Source: “Confidential.” Eleanor hated “confidential.” It always meant trouble. The clock on the wall ticked with the steady, unforgiving cadence of impending doom. She took a deep breath, smoothed the wrinkles from her floral print dress, and reminded herself: *I’m a professional. I’m here to help. Everyone deserves a chance.* Even Mr. Silas Blackwood.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance’s practice was located on the second floor of a Victorian-era house in the historic district of Blackwood Hollow, Maine. The house, once a grand family estate, had been subdivided into several offices, each retaining vestiges of its former glory. Eleanor’s office was a cozy, if slightly cramped, space overlooking the overgrown garden. Books lined the walls, reaching from the floor to the high, ornate ceiling, a comforting bulwark against the anxieties that often permeated the room. A Persian rug, faded with age, covered the creaky wooden floor. The room was lit by a Tiffany-style lamp on a mahogany desk and the flickering glow of a small, electric fireplace. Despite the attempts at warmth and serenity, the persistent chill of the Maine autumn clung to the air, seeping in through the drafty windows, a constant reminder of the town's shadowed history and the secrets it held within. Outside, Blackwood Hollow itself was a picture postcard of New England charm gone slightly askew. The picturesque town square, the clapboard houses with their carefully tended gardens, the ancient cemetery overlooking the harbor - all were tinged with a sense of isolation and a pervasive, almost tangible, melancholy. It was a town where the past clung fiercely to the present, and where whispers of the supernatural were often mistaken for the howling of the wind.
