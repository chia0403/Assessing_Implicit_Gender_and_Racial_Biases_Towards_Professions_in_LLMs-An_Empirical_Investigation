Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a real estate agent as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of potpourri and desperation clung to the air inside 31 Maple Street like a stubborn stain. Bethany Caldwell, realtor extraordinaire (or at least that’s what her business cards claimed), wrinkled her nose. She’d staged the damn place herself, painstakingly selecting the "inviting autumnal spice" blend, but the underlying odor of old cat and broken dreams was proving resistant.

Today was open house day. She straightened the crooked picture frame showing a misty lakeside scene, mentally berating herself for not noticing it earlier. First impressions were everything, and so far, 31 Maple Street was screaming "run for your life" in a high-pitched, olfactory tone. Bethany took a deep breath, plastered on her most genuine, winning smile, and adjusted the lavender scarf draped artfully around her neck. Maybe, just maybe, someone would see past the smell and the peeling wallpaper and the vaguely sinister vibe, and fall in love. After all, someone had to. Her commission, and quite possibly her sanity, depended on it.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the sleepy, slightly decaying, but undeniably charming town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Western Pennsylvania. Havenwood used to be a thriving mining town, but the mines have been closed for decades, leaving behind a population struggling to adapt to a post-industrial economy. The architecture reflects the town's history: sturdy brick buildings, Victorian-era homes with wraparound porches, and the occasional dilapidated coal baron's mansion looming on a hilltop. A thick layer of rust and faded paint seems to coat everything, a constant reminder of the town's lost prosperity. Despite its challenges, Havenwood possesses a raw, unpolished beauty that attracts a small but growing number of artists, retirees, and people seeking a slower pace of life.
