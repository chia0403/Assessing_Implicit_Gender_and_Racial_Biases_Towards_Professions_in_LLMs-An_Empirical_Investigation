The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color bleeding into the steel-grey Atlantic, cast long, skeletal shadows from the weathered fishing boats bobbing in the harbor. The air, thick with the scent of salt and brine, clung to the rough-hewn granite of Port Isaac, painting everything in a melancholic light. This was the light that Elara Vivian Thorne lived for.

She stood on the crumbling seawall, a half-finished sketchpad clutched in her left hand, the sea wind whipping strands of her auburn hair across her face. A charcoal pencil was gripped tightly between her teeth, leaving a smudged mark of graphite on her lower lip. Elara, as she did most days, was trying to capture the essence of this ancient Cornish village before it was swallowed whole by the encroaching tide of tourism and time. The roar of the waves, punctuated by the mournful cries of gulls, was the soundtrack to her life; the backdrop to her art.

This particular sketch was meant to capture the jagged, almost defiant angle of Mrs. Treleven's cottage, perched precariously on the cliff edge. It was a stubborn, tenacious little building, much like the woman who lived within its faded blue walls, and Elara felt a kinship with it. She wanted to immortalize its resilience, its weathered beauty, before another storm or a careless developer swept it away, leaving only a glossy postcard in its place. Elara Vivian Thorne, artist and reluctant documentarian of a dying way of life, had her work cut out for her.
