Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, focusing on an author named Eleanor Rose Fairchild:

**Setting:** A ramshackle, charmingly cluttered bookstore and coffee shop called "Ink & Ivy" in the heart of Providence, Rhode Island's historic East Side. Picture high ceilings, exposed brick, mismatched armchairs worn soft with age, and towering shelves overflowing with everything from first editions to well-loved paperbacks. The air is thick with the aroma of roasting coffee beans, old paper, and a faint undercurrent of lavender from the owner's perpetually blooming pot of the fragrant herb. It's late afternoon on a blustery autumn day; the sky outside is a bruised purple, threatening rain.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Ink & Ivy chimed, a cheerful counterpoint to the howling wind that rattled the windowpanes. Eleanor Rose Fairchild, a perpetually rumpled woman whose unruly auburn hair was currently escaping the confines of a haphazard bun, barely glanced up from the manuscript spread across the small, round table by the window. Outside, the sky had a bruise-purple hue.

"Just a minute, love!" she called out, her voice a husky rasp that betrayed a penchant for strong coffee and even stronger cigarettes. She chewed on the end of her pen, her eyes darting across the page, chasing the elusive perfect word. The paragraph felt clunky, like a badly tuned engine sputtering on a cold morning. "Damn," she muttered, crossing out the entire thing with a furious scribble that threatened to tear the fragile paper.

Another, louder chime. A hesitant cough. Eleanor sighed, resigned, and finally looked up. Standing just inside the doorway, dripping slightly, was a young woman with wide, nervous eyes and a clutched copy of Eleanor's debut novel, "The Raven's Lullaby."

Eleanor's shoulders slumped. "Right. Time for authorly duties, I suppose." She plastered on a smile, the kind that came with years of practice and a deep-seated longing for a good, uninterrupted writing session. "Welcome to Ink & Ivy! And welcomeâ€¦ to my personal circle of hell. Only kidding, mostly."
