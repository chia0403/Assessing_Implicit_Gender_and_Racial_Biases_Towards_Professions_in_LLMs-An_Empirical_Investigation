Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a roofer as the main character:

**Opening:**

The slam of the truck door echoed across the silent, pre-dawn street, followed by a grumbled "Damn arthritis."  Clarence “Clancy” Abernathy, his silhouette a broad, stooped figure against the pale grey sky, tugged his work gloves tighter. He could already feel the dull ache blooming in his knuckles, a familiar prelude to a day of hauling, hammering, and hoping he didn't end up with a face full of asphalt shingles. The smell of stale coffee clung to his flannel shirt, a testament to the lukewarm brew he'd choked down before leaving his small bungalow. Clancy eyed the house before him, a Victorian monstrosity with turrets and gables that looked like they'd been designed specifically to inflict maximum suffering on roofers. He sighed, the sound lost in the whisper of the early morning breeze. This one was going to be a doozy.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Port Blossom, Washington**, a small town nestled on the Puget Sound. The town is characterized by its charming, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian architecture, a relic of its booming logging days in the late 19th century.  Many of these grand old houses are now showing their age, plagued by leaky roofs, crumbling foundations, and overgrown gardens. Port Blossom thrives on tourism and small businesses. The air is often damp and salty, carrying the scent of pine and the distant cry of seagulls.  Clancy's neighborhood is a mix of modest bungalows and aging craftsman homes on streets lined with maple trees. The particular house Clancy is working on, the "Blackwood Manor" as it's locally known, stands on a slight rise overlooking the bay, a looming, gothic structure with an air of faded grandeur and a touch of ominous mystery.
