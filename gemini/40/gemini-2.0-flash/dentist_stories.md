The fluorescent lights of his practice hummed a relentless, almost maddening tune. Dr. Theodore Alistair Finch, D.D.S., meticulously polished a stainless steel dental pick, the rhythmic scrape against the metal echoing in the otherwise silent room. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawn of Willow Creek Retirement Home, painting the red-brick building in hues of orange and fading gold. The air hung thick with the sweet scent of honeysuckle and the faint, medicinal tang of disinfectant that always permeated the halls of Willow Creek.

Theodore hated Wednesdays. Wednesdays were Willow Creek days, and Willow Creek, with its chorus of dentures clattering in water glasses and whispered reminiscences of forgotten wars, always left him feeling strangely… diminished. He much preferred his regular clientele, the soccer moms and the junior executives who cared (or pretended to care) about achieving the perfect, pearly-white smile.

He glanced at the appointment book, a neat row of names scribbled beneath the heading: "Willow Creek - Wednesday Afternoon." Mrs. Beatrice Higgins. Mr. Arthur Peabody. And, dreaded above all others, Mrs. Agnes Plumtree, whose gums bled at the mere mention of a toothbrush.

Theodore sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the lights. He wasn’t just a dentist; he was a caregiver, a confidante, sometimes even a reluctant historian to this aging population. But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation, a disquiet he couldn't quite place, settled in the pit of his stomach. It wasn't just the usual dread of Agnes Plumtree's aggressive gums. It was something else, lurking beneath the surface of the day, like a particularly stubborn piece of tartar. And Theodore, a man who prided himself on his meticulous attention to detail, knew that he couldn’t ignore it.
