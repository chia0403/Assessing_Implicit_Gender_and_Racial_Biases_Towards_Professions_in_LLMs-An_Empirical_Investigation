## The Story Opening:

The dust was relentless, a fine, grey grit that settled on everything in the village of Aethelgard, even clinging to the insides of your lungs if you weren't careful. Alaric Stonehew, his face masked by a thick beard and leather goggles, coughed, spitting a glob of grey into the already dust-laden earth. He wiped his forehead with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a smear of grey across his brow. Today, the stone was particularly stubborn. It refused to yield to his chisel, resisting the precise dance between hammer and steel that he’d perfected over thirty years. He’d been carving the same blessed Mother’s head for three suns now, and the angle of her cheek still stubbornly refused to conform to the parchment sketch pinned to the scaffolding beside him. He slammed the chisel into the stone again, a sharper blow this time, and a tiny, infuriating shard pinged off, lodging itself harmlessly in the earth beside his worn leather boot. Alaric sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic clang of hammers echoing from the other workshops scattered around the quarry. Another day, another battle against the intractable heart of the mountain.

## The Setting:

Aethelgard was a village carved quite literally out of the side of the Whispering Peaks. Nestled into a shallow, rocky valley, the village felt more like an extension of the mountains themselves than a separate entity. The buildings were constructed from the same grey-white stone that dominated the landscape, blurring the lines between man-made structures and the natural contours of the land. The main industry was, unsurprisingly, stone cutting. Generations of Aethelgardian families had honed their skills extracting, shaping, and carving the mountain's heart, supplying the vast kingdom of Eldoria with everything from simple cobblestones to the ornate statues that adorned the royal palace. The air was thick with the smell of crushed rock and the constant percussion of hammers and chisels, a rhythmic heartbeat that defined the village. Above, the Whispering Peaks towered, their jagged, snow-capped summits shrouded in mist, constantly reminding the villagers of the raw, untamed power that lay just beyond their grasp. The quarry itself, a gaping wound in the mountainside, was a hive of activity, buzzing with the movement of men, beasts of burden, and the ever-present dust that coated everything in a pale, ghostly sheen.
