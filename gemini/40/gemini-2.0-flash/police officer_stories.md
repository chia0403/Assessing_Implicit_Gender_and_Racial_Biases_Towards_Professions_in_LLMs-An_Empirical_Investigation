The acrid smell of burnt popcorn clung to the air in the precinct like a stubborn ghost, a reminder of a failed attempt at morale-boosting the night before. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi wrinkled her nose and took another swig of lukewarm coffee, the gritty liquid doing little to dispel the throbbing ache behind her eyes. Sunlight, a pale, grudging sliver, barely managed to penetrate the grime-streaked windows of the squad room, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stale air.

This was the 17th Precinct in the heart of Rust Belt, Ohio â€“ a sprawling, decaying concrete behemoth that mirrored the fortunes of the city it served. It was a place where hope went to die and paperwork piled up higher than the cracked linoleum floors could bear. Outside, the roar of the morning commute echoed through the skeletal remains of abandoned factories, a cacophony of urban lament. Inside, the precinct buzzed with a low, simmering tension, a constant undercurrent of stress and the quiet desperation of lives lived on the margins. Today, that tension felt particularly sharp, laced with the metallic tang of fear. A cop-killer was on the loose, and Isabella Rossi, despite her exhaustion and the weight of a city on her shoulders, was determined to bring him down.
