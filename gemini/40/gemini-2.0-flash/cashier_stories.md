## The Opening

The hum of the refrigerated dairy case was Amelia Iris Campbell's white noise, a constant, low drone that both soothed and irritated her. She scanned a carton of almond milk, the barcode beeping a satisfying confirmation against the background symphony of late-afternoon grocery store sounds: the clatter of carts, the muffled announcements overhead, and the occasional, surprisingly loud crunch of a toddler biting into an apple. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, was fiddling with her coupon book again, muttering something about "these newfangled QR codes." Amelia smiled patiently, another day, another dollar, another reason to dream of escaping the fluorescent glow of "Good Foods Grocer" in the quaint, but undeniably stagnant, town of Havenwood, Maine.

## The Setting

Havenwood was nestled in a postcard-perfect valley, surrounded by rolling hills that burst with color in the autumn and a blanket of white in the winter. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, where the annual Pumpkin Festival was the social event of the year, and where the biggest gossip revolved around whose petunia bed was flourishing the best. "Good Foods Grocer" was, in many ways, the heart of Havenwood. Located on Main Street, right across from the town hall and next to Mrs. Gable's "Knick-Knack Nook," it was the go-to spot for everything from fresh produce and organic quinoa to locally-sourced maple syrup and the weekly lottery tickets. The store itself was impeccably clean, brightly lit, and smelled perpetually of freshly baked bread thanks to Mr. Abernathy, the resident baker, who took an almost maniacal pride in his sourdough starter. It was a comfortable, predictable, and undeniably boring place to spend your days â€“ exactly the reason Amelia was determined to leave.
