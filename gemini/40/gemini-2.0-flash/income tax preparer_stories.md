## Story Opening:

The harsh fluorescent light of the office hummed, casting a sterile glow across the calculator graveyard that littered Edgar Allan Blackwood's desk. Edgar, a man whose name ironically evoked the macabre while his life was tragically mundane, sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. It was April 14th, the day before the beast that was Tax Day devoured the last shreds of his sanity. Outside, a spring breeze whispered promises of blooming tulips and longer evenings. Inside, Edgar was buried under a mountain of W-2s, 1099s, and the gnawing anxiety that he'd somehow missed a decimal point somewhere that would unleash the wrath of the IRS upon one of his hapless clients.

## Setting:

Edgar's office, nestled above "Brenda's Blissful Bagels" in a strip mall in suburban Parsippany, New Jersey, was a study in organized chaos. The walls, painted a sickly shade of beige that had been trendy sometime in the early 90s, were adorned with motivational posters featuring eagles soaring against sunsets and platitudes about "reaching your full potential." The reality of Edgar's daily grind, however, was far removed from such lofty aspirations. His desk was a monument to paperwork, stacked precariously high with files categorized by client name and level of tax-related neurosis. A chipped ceramic mug, perpetually stained with coffee residue, sat beside a half-eaten box of day-old Dunkin' Donuts, the sugary scent battling with the faint aroma of Brenda's everything bagels from downstairs. The overall impression was one of quiet desperation, the kind that only weeks spent wrestling with tax codes could breed.
