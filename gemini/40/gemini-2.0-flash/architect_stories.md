The incessant drumming of rain against the panoramic windows was almost enough to drown out the insistent ringing of the antique telephone on her desk. Almost. Eleanor Rose Ashton sighed, pushing aside the meticulously drafted blueprints for the new community center in Oakhaven, and reached for the receiver.

The setting was Eleanor's studio, a converted loft space in the heart of Portland's Pearl District. Sunlight, when it deigned to break through the perpetually overcast skies, flooded the room, illuminating the exposed brick walls, the polished concrete floor, and the towering stacks of architectural journals and blueprints. Today, however, the light was muted, filtered through the grey deluge.

Her drafting table, a vast expanse of reclaimed wood, dominated one end of the loft. Scattered across its surface were pencils, erasers, and a clutter of models, from a miniature Victorian dollhouse to a sleek, modern skyscraper. A comfortable armchair, upholstered in worn leather, sat near a floor-to-ceiling bookcase overflowing with titles on architecture, history, and art. The air smelled faintly of ink, sawdust, and the earthy aroma of the potted ferns that cascaded from hanging baskets near the windows. It was a space where creativity flourished, a sanctuary that reflected Eleanor's sharp intellect and unwavering passion for design.
