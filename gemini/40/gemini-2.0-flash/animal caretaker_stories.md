The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of damp earth, overripe fruit, and a distinct hint of… well, elephant. Persephone Willowbrook sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She tightened the knot on her worn canvas apron, its pockets already bulging with carrots and assorted animal crackers. The sun, a hazy orange ball, was just beginning to peek over the corrugated iron roofs of the animal enclosures.

Persephone worked at the "Eden's Breath Conservation and Rehabilitation Center," a sprawling, somewhat haphazard sanctuary tucked away in the lush hills of rural Costa Rica. It wasn't a zoo, exactly. More a halfway house for injured, orphaned, or rescued animals – a place where monkeys learned to swing again, sloths practiced their leisurely climbs, and the occasional jaguar recuperated after a run-in with a logging truck.

Eden's Breath was more than just a job to Persephone. It was a calling. She’d abandoned a promising career in London's banking sector to be surrounded by the wild, untamed beauty of the jungle and the even wilder personalities of its inhabitants. This morning, however, the air felt different. Less peaceful, more… expectant. A nervous flutter settled in Persephone's stomach as she made her way towards the enclosure housing the sanctuary's most recent arrival: Raja, a grumpy old Indian elephant rescued from a defunct circus. He hadn't eaten properly in days, and Persephone had a feeling today would be a test of wills. A test she was determined to pass.
