## Story Opening:

The hum of the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine was a lullaby to Amelia Grace "Gracie" Harding. It was a song of power, of freedom, a counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety that always seemed to fester in the pit of her stomach before a drop. Tonight, that anxiety was a screeching banshee. Gracie adjusted her goggles, the thick leather warm against her skin, and squinted through the rain-streaked windscreen. Below, the English Channel churned, a tempestuous grey beast threatening to swallow her whole.

"Five minutes, Gracie," crackled the voice of Flight Sergeant Miller over the radio, his usual jovial tone muted by static and the impending peril. "Remember the brief. Precise drop. Godspeed."

Gracie swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry. Precise drop. Easier said than done, flying a C-47 Skytrain loaded with paratroopers into the heart of occupied France, on a night so thick even the stars seemed to be hiding. She gripped the yoke tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. This was her first operational jump, and the thought of the young men she carried, their lives entrusted to her steady hand, weighed heavier than the fuel tanks. 

This wasn't like practicing over the peaceful cornfields of Kansas. This was war. And tonight, Amelia Grace Harding was finally in the thick of it.

## Setting:

The year is 1944. The place is the interior of a C-47 Skytrain, flying low and fast over the English Channel on a rain-soaked night in June. The air inside the plane is thick with the smell of engine oil, sweat, and the nervous anticipation of the paratroopers packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the benches. A single red light illuminates the cabin, casting long, flickering shadows that dance across their faces. The roar of the engines makes conversation nearly impossible, adding to the oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the radio and the occasional nervous cough. The plane shudders violently as it hits pockets of turbulence, a constant reminder of the inherent danger of their mission.
