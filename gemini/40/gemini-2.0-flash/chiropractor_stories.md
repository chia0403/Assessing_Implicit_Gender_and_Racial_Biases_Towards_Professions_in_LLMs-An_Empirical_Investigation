The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, a blanket woven from the scent of salt, sunscreen, and something indefinablyâ€¦rotten. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, D.C., leaned against the chipped paint of her clinic sign, the neon "Ainsworth Chiropractic: Find Your Spine's Peace" buzzing a dissonant tune in the oppressive stillness. She pushed a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear, the gesture as automatic as the familiar pop of a vertebra. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon in Port St. Lucie, slower than usual, which, frankly, was saying something. The only movement came from a lone seagull perched precariously on the roof, its sharp cry echoing across the empty parking lot. Inside, the scent of eucalyptus oil and the gentle hum of the traction table were a comforting counterpoint to the simmering heat outside. Even the ever-present ticking of the grandfather clock she'd inherited from her grandmother seemed to drag with the lazy rhythm of the day. Eleanor sighed, the weight of bills and the ghost of her grandmother's expectations settling heavily on her shoulders. Maybe today was just destined to be a day for practicing her golf swing.
