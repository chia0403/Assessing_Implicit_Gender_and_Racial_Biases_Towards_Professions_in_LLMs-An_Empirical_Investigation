## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The story opens on a crisp October afternoon in the sprawling, gothic library of St. Augustine's College, Oxford. The air hangs thick with the scent of aged paper, beeswax polish, and a faint undercurrent of mustiness. Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the lives of Augustine and Aquinas, casts jewel-toned patterns across the towering bookshelves. The rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner provides a steady, almost hypnotic, counterpoint to the rustle of pages being turned.

**Story Opening:**

Professor Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman whose face bore the delicate tracery of time and scholarship, perched precariously on a rolling ladder, her silver hair escaping its neat bun in unruly tendrils. Her fingers, stained with ink and powdered with chalk, traced the faded gilt lettering on a particularly ancient-looking tome. "Ah, there you are," she murmured, a triumphant gleam in her pale blue eyes. She carefully dislodged the book, its leather spine cracking in protest, and tucked it under her arm. It was a first edition of Ptolemy's *Almagest*, and she suspected it held the key to unraveling a particularly baffling inconsistency in the college's astronomical records. Little did Professor Ainsworth know, this seemingly insignificant discovery would soon plunge her into a mystery far older and more dangerous than she could ever have imagined. The whispers in the library, usually attributed to drafts or the creaking of old wood, seemed to be growing louder... and they were whispering her name.
