The desert wind whipped at the edges of Martha Isabella Rodriguez's worn, wide-brimmed hat, tugging it like a playful ghost. The grit stung her cheeks, adding another layer to the perpetual tan etched onto her face. She spat, the gritty moisture swallowed by the parched air before it even hit the ground. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling columns of burnt orange against the endless expanse of faded blue sky.

The setting was the Mojave Desert, a particularly desolate stretch of it about seventy miles east of Barstow, California. The air hung thick with the scent of sagebrush and diesel. The sun, already a malevolent glare, promised another day of infernal heat. The only signs of civilization were the skeletal remains of an old mining town, a cluster of rusted-out shacks and wind-battered headframes, and the massive, partially-constructed solar array that Martha and her crew were slowly, painstakingly, bringing to life.

This wasn't Martha's first desert project. She'd spent years wrestling the earth, shaping it to the will of architects and engineers, from pipeline construction in Texas to highway expansions in Arizona. But this one... this one felt different. The silence was deeper, the isolation more profound. And something about the land itself, the way it seemed to resist every intrusion, prickled the back of her neck.
