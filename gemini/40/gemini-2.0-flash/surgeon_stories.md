Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the main character's full name and profession:

**Opening:**

The pre-dawn light, a bruised plum color against the city skyline, did little to settle Dr. Eleanor Vivian Sterling's churning stomach. She stared out of her fifteenth-floor apartment window, the glass cool against her forehead, and tried to ignore the insistent tremor in her hands. Below, the relentless pulse of New York City was already beginning to quicken, a mechanical heartbeat that resonated right up into her sterile, minimalist space. She closed her eyes, took a deliberate breath, and released it slowly. Today was the day. Today, she operated on Mayor Thompson.

**Setting:**

The story begins in New York City, specifically in Dr. Sterling's modern, high-rise apartment overlooking the East River. The setting shifts later to the prestigious (and fictional) St. Jude's Hospital in Manhattan. The hospital is known for its cutting-edge medical technology and a roster of world-renowned surgeons, Eleanor among them. It has a cold, polished feel, with gleaming steel surfaces and the ever-present scent of antiseptic, a place where lives are routinely saved and where the pressure to perform is crushing.
