**Opening:**

The scent of aged paper and chamomile tea, Amelia Rosencrantz's two constant companions, hung heavy in the air as she navigated the labyrinthine stacks of the Blackwood Library. A single, dusty ray of afternoon sun, bold enough to penetrate the stained-glass windows, illuminated the swirling motes of dust dancing around her. It was a quiet Tuesday, mercifully free of noisy school groups, which meant Amelia could finally tackle the mystery of the perpetually mis-shelved "Occult and Obscure Texts" section. She hummed a tuneless melody, pushing her spectacles higher up her nose with a knuckle, her gloved hand tracing the spines of leather-bound volumes.

**Setting:**

The Blackwood Library, perched precariously on the bluffs overlooking the churning waters of the Blackwood River in the quaint, perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts, was a relic of a bygone era. Built in 1888 by the eccentric industrialist, Elias Blackwood, it was a gothic masterpiece of gargoyles, vaulted ceilings, and shadowy corners that seemed to swallow light whole. Each of the three floors housed a vast and eclectic collection, ranging from canonical literature to obscure historical treatises, donated (or, as local whispers suggested, acquired through less-than-legal means) by Mr. Blackwood himself. The library was rumored to be haunted, not by malevolent spirits, but by the lingering presence of the Blackwood family, their secrets woven into the very fabric of the building. Amelia, who had inherited the position of Head Librarian from her grandmother, felt a deep connection to the library, viewing it not just as a place of books, but as a living entity, breathing with the stories it held within.
