Okay, here's a story opening and setting for an exercise instructor:

**Setting:**

The humid air hung heavy in the small, sun-drenched yoga studio, "Sunrise Serenity," located in a bustling, rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of Asheville, North Carolina. Large windows, overlooking a narrow street lined with trendy coffee shops and quirky boutiques, were fogged with the morning's collective sweat. The scent of lavender essential oil struggled to compete with the underlying aroma of damp rubber mats and exertion. Sunlight streamed through the blinds, creating stripes of light and shadow across the floor where twenty-odd bodies were contorted into varying degrees of Tree Pose.

**Story Opening:**

Genevieve "Gen" Eleanor Hawthorne plastered a bright, encouraging smile on her face, despite the twinge in her lower back and the nagging anxiety about paying rent. She was in the middle of her "Sunrise Flow" yoga class, and it was, predictably, not going smoothly. Mrs. Abernathy was wobbling precariously, her face the color of a beet; young, tattooed Liam looked like he might actually fall asleep in his tree; and Sarah from the bakery was staring blankly into space, probably dreaming of croissants.

"Remember," Gen called out, her voice amplified by the studio's sound system, "Root down through your standing foot, find your drishti, and breathe into the pose. Think tall, think strong, think...zen!"

Easy for her to say, Gen thought, as she effortlessly transitioned into a perfectly balanced Tree Pose. Her life felt anything but zen. The studio was perpetually on the verge of bankruptcy, her ex-boyfriend was now engaged to her best friend, and the only thing more flexible than her spine was her budget. But this was her happy place, her sanctuary and these sweaty, occasionally uncoordinated people were her responsibility. Gen needed to keep Sunrise Serenity afloat, even if it meant faking a little zen, because it was more than a business to her - it was hope, wrapped in a yoga mat.
