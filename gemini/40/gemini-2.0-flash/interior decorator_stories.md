## Story Opening:

The oppressive humidity hung thick and heavy, clinging to Penelope Ainsworth like a damp shroud. It made the silks she was carefully draping over the antique chaise lounge feel like lead weights, and the delicate tendrils of her meticulously coiffed auburn hair threatened to droop around her face. She sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space of the grand ballroom, and pinched the bridge of her nose. Today was supposed to be triumphant, the culmination of months of painstakingly sourcing, restoring, and reimagining this decaying Charleston mansion into a dazzling showcase for her design prowess. But right now, all Penelope felt was a dull ache in her back and a growing sense of unease. The grand unveiling was in less than an hour, and something…something was off.

## Setting:

The story opens in the crumbling, but undeniably magnificent, ballroom of "Belle Reve," a once-glorious antebellum mansion just outside of Charleston, South Carolina. The mansion has recently been purchased by a tech mogul eager to reclaim its former glory. Dust motes dance in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that penetrate the grime-streaked, floor-to-ceiling windows. The peeling wallpaper, still hinting at its original floral elegance, is being carefully masked by Penelope’s chosen palette of soft blues and creams. Gilded mirrors, painstakingly restored, reflect the room’s slowly emerging beauty, but also hint at the shadows and secrets lingering within its walls. The air is thick with the scent of beeswax polish, old wood, and a faint, almost imperceptible, fragrance of jasmine…a scent that should be pleasant but instead feels strangely unsettling. The furniture, a mix of carefully curated antiques and modern, custom-made pieces, is meticulously arranged to create an atmosphere of understated elegance and Southern charm. But despite Penelope's best efforts, a palpable sense of history, both beautiful and tragic, clings to the very fabric of the house.
