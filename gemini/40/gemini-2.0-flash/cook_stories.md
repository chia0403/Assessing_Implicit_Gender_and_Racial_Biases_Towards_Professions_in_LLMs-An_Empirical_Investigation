The thick, greasy smell of frying onions hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything - Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s apron, her hair, even the lines etched around her tired eyes. It was a familiar smell, a comforting smell, the smell of survival. But tonight, it did little to soothe the knot in her stomach.

Amelia, better known as “Rose” to the regulars, stood amidst the controlled chaos of the “Greasy Spoon Diner,” perched precariously on the edge of Harmony Ridge, West Virginia. The diner, a chrome-plated beacon of late-night sustenance, was wedged between the deserted Harmony Ridge truck stop and a sprawling, overgrown field where fireflies blinked like misplaced stars. Inside, faded vinyl booths lined the perimeter, reflecting the neon glow of the "Eat Here!" sign flickering in the window. The air was thick with the chatter of truckers, lonely travelers, and the occasional insomniac, all united by their hunger and the need for a cheap, hearty meal. Rose, the heart and soul of the Greasy Spoon, had been serving up her famous gravy and biscuits, perfectly-crisped hash browns, and bottomless cups of coffee for over twenty years, each order a carefully crafted act of culinary kindness.

But tonight wasn't just another night at the Spoon. Tonight, something felt different. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of the diner. Rose, usually a master of compartmentalization, couldn't shake the feeling that something - or someone - was about to walk through that squeaky screen door and change everything. And judging by the gnawing in her gut, it wasn't going to be for the better.
