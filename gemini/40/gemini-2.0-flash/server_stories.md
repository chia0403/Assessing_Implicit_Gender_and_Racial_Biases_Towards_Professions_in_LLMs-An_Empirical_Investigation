The aroma of burnt sugar and simmering sage clung to the air inside "The Wandering Wren," a bistro nestled on a cobblestone street in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. Gas lamps flickered, casting dancing shadows on the exposed brick walls adorned with quirky, avian-themed art. Outside, the humid evening air buzzed with the lazy hum of cicadas and the distant clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages carrying tourists eager for ghost stories and pecan pie.

Inside, however, the atmosphere was one of controlled chaos. Waiters darted between tables laden with shrimp and grits and sweet tea, their movements a practiced ballet of efficiency. At the heart of this ballet was *Genevieve Eleanor Dubois*, a server with a smile as bright as the Georgia sun and a memory as sharp as a chef's knife.
