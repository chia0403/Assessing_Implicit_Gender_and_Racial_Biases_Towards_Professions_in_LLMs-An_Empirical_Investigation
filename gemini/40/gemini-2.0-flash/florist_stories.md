Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a florist named Eliza Willowbrook:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the vibrant chaos of "Willowbrook Blooms," Eliza Willowbrook's tiny flower shop nestled on a cobblestone street in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. Sunlight streams through the shop's large, arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air thick with the heady scent of lilies, roses, and damp earth. Bouquets in various stages of completion sit perched on the worn wooden counter. Strings of fairy lights twinkle haphazardly, adding a touch of whimsy to the slightly cluttered space. Outside, the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages and the murmur of tourists create a constant, soothing backdrop to the shop's fragrant interior.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Willowbrook wiped a smudge of pollen from her cheek with the back of her hand, leaving a faint yellow streak on her skin. It was almost noon on a Tuesday, and the lunch rush was just starting. The chime above the door tinkled, and she glanced up, expecting to see Mrs. Abernathy needing her weekly orchids or maybe young Thomas Henderson, nervously picking out a rose for his sweetheart. Instead, a man stood silhouetted in the doorway, his broad shoulders practically filling the frame. He wore a dark, well-tailored suit that seemed out of place amidst the delicate beauty of Willowbrook Blooms, and an even darker expression. Elizaâ€™s heart skipped a beat, a prickle of unease running down her spine. He wasn't here for flowers, she could tell. This was something else entirely.
