Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a concierge named Genevieve Eleanor Dubois:

**Setting:** The opulent Grand Belle Epoque Hotel, nestled in the heart of Vienna, Austria. Imagine a building dripping with rococo flourishes, its facade the color of aged champagne. Inside, chandeliers cascade like frozen waterfalls, illuminating marble floors polished to a blinding sheen. The air hums with the murmur of multilingual conversations, the clinking of crystal, and the subtle strains of a live string quartet, often playing a waltz near the main staircase. It's early October, just as the crisp Viennese air begins to hint at the coming winter, and the city is alive with the buzz of the Wiener Wiesn and early Christmas market preparations.

**Opening:**

Genevieve Eleanor Dubois smoothed a non-existent wrinkle from the lapel of her impeccably tailored navy blue suit. The Grand Belle Epoque Hotel, her domain, pulsed with the pre-dinner rush. A gaggle of American tourists, sporting matching lederhosen, were arguing loudly about the merits of Sachertorte versus Esterh√°zy torte. A fur-draped Russian oligarch, his face a stoic mask, was impatiently tapping his gold-plated pen against the marble countertop. And, as if on cue, Madame Moreau, the renowned opera singer, swept through the revolving doors, trailing a cloud of expensive perfume and a beleaguered poodle the size of a teacup.

Genevieve, however, felt a prickle of unease beneath her carefully constructed calm. It wasn't the usual chaos of the Belle Epoque; it was something more subtle, a dissonance in the symphony of pampered luxury she orchestrated daily. Perhaps it was the strange, almost imperceptible shadow that seemed to cling to the elderly gentleman with the piercing blue eyes who had checked in just this morning, claiming to be a retired clockmaker from Geneva. Or perhaps it was the coded message she'd overheard during a hushed phone conversation in the hotel's ornate phone booths.

Whatever it was, Genevieve knew, with the certainty that came from years of observing the comings and goings of the elite, that the tranquil facade of the Grand Belle Epoque was about to be shattered. And she, Genevieve Eleanor Dubois, Concierge Extraordinaire, was about to find herself caught in the middle.
