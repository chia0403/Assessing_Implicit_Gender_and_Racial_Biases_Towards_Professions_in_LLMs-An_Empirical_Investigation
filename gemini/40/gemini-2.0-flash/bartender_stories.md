## Story Opening:

The rhythmic swish and thud of the cocktail shaker was the only sound that cut through the low hum of conversation and clinking glasses.  Elijah "Eli" Maxwell, every practiced movement a testament to years behind the stick, shook the concoction with the focus of a surgeon. He could practically taste the balance of the rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and aromatic bitters in his mind; a Manhattan, perfectly chilled and exquisitely crafted. Tonight, however, the familiar ritual offered little comfort.  His usual focus felt muddied, his hands heavier than they should be. The tip jar sat woefully empty, mocking his efforts, and a nagging worry chewed at the back of his mind, a persistent static against the smooth jazz drifting from the bar's sound system. He strained the drink into a chilled coupe glass, added a brandied cherry, and slid it towards Mrs. Gable, a regular who always ordered the same thing and always tipped poorly.  Tonight, even her familiar face felt grating. Something was off, and Eli had a sinking feeling it wasn't just the lack of business.

## Setting:

"The Gilded Lily" was nestled in the heart of the historic district of Oakhaven, a small, coastal town in Maine.  Its exterior, with its polished mahogany door and discreet brass plaque, hinted at the understated elegance within. The interior was bathed in warm, amber light emanating from antique sconces and carefully placed table lamps. The walls were a deep, rich crimson, adorned with framed vintage advertisements and botanical prints.  A long, intricately carved mahogany bar dominated the space, its surface gleaming from years of careful polishing. Behind the bar, shelves stretched to the high ceiling, displaying an impressive array of bottles, from rare single-malt scotches to obscure herbal liqueurs. The air was thick with the aroma of aged wood, citrus, and a hint of sea salt from the nearby harbor.  Velvet booths lined one wall, offering intimate seating for couples and small groups, while a scattering of smaller tables and bar stools provided a more communal atmosphere.  The Gilded Lily was known for its expertly crafted cocktails, its sophisticated ambiance, and its clientele of discerning locals and wealthy summer tourists. It was, in short, Eli's sanctuary, his livelihood, and tonight, a source of growing unease.
