## Story Opening:

The biting January wind clawed at the exposed skin around Dr. Elara Vivian Sterling's eyes as she wrestled the ambulance doors open. Sleet, like tiny needles, stung her cheeks, a brutal welcome back to the streets of Chicago. The dispatch call still vibrated in her ears: "Unresponsive male, possible overdose, corner of Wilson and Clifton, heavy pedestrian traffic." Translation: a chaotic scene, a struggling patient, and a clock ticking down the seconds.

She took a deep breath, the frigid air burning in her lungs, and plunged into the swirling mess. The flashing lights painted the scene in strobing red and blue: a huddle of onlookers, the muffled sobs of a woman clinging to a lamppost, and a young man sprawled awkwardly on the frozen pavement, his face a disturbing shade of grey.
