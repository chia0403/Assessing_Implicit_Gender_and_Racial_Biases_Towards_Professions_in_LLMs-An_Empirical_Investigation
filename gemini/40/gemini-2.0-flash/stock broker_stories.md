The roar of the closing bell was still ringing in Walter Charlesworthâ€™s ears, a sound that usually sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, even after twenty years in the trenches of Wall Street. Tonight, though, it felt more like a mournful dirge. He slumped back in his high-backed, leather chair, the panoramic view of Manhattan shimmering outside his forty-seventh floor office window failing to lift his spirits.

Walter's office at Monarch Capital was a temple of understated wealth. The walls were a calming shade of slate grey, adorned with framed prints of vintage stock certificates and a single, imposing oil painting depicting a bull charging. A custom-built mahogany desk, large enough to land a small plane on, dominated the room, littered with half-empty coffee cups and stacks of market reports that seemed to multiply overnight. Outside, the city lights twinkled like a scattered constellation, a constant reminder of the fortunes made and lost within its concrete canyons. Tonight, however, the city felt cold and indifferent, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in Walter's stomach. He knew the market was unpredictable, a beast that could turn on you in an instant, but tonight, the beast felt especially hungry, and he was starting to feel like its next meal.
