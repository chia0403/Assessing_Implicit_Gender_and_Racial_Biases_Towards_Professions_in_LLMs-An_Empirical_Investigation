The biting wind, smelling of brine and damp wood, whipped at Elias Thorne's beard as he squinted across the storm-tossed harbor. Rain hammered against the tarpaulin stretched tautly over his small workshop on the edge of Port Dusk, turning the canvas into a resonating drum. Inside, however, the air hummed with a different kind of energy. Sawdust motes danced in the single, flickering lamplight, illuminated by the rhythmic rasp of Elias's hand plane against a length of seasoned oak.

Port Dusk was a hard place, clinging to the rocky coastline of the Kingdom of Atheria like a barnacle to a ship's hull. It was a town built on the bones of forgotten fishing boats and the stubborn grit of its inhabitants. Houses, painted in faded hues of ochre and seafoam, huddled together, their foundations threatened by the encroaching tide. The salty tang of the sea permeated everything, clinging to clothes, stinging the eyes, and seeping into the very grain of the wood Elias worked with.

He was shaping the oak into the bow of a small fishing vessel, a commission from old Widow Crowley, whose late husband, Bartholomew, had lost his own boat to the relentless ocean only last winter. Elias knew he couldn't replicate Bartholomew's luck or skill on the water, but he could give Widow Crowley a sturdy, seaworthy craft, a vessel that wouldn't fail her in the unforgiving embrace of the Atherian Sea. He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that this wasn't just carpentry; it was offering a piece of hope in a town desperately short of it.
