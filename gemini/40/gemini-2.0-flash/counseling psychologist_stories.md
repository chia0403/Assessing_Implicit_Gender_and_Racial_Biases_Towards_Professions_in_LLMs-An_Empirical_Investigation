The rain, a relentless drumbeat on the skylight, mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest. She hated Tuesdays. Tuesdays meant back-to-back sessions with her most emotionally demanding clients, and this particular Tuesday was proving to be a doozy. Eleanor sighed, pushing back from her antique mahogany desk, its surface cluttered with case files and half-empty mugs of herbal tea. Outside, the London sky was a bruised purple, promising a deluge that would likely trap her at the clinic for hours.

Her office, located on the second floor of a converted Georgian townhouse in Bloomsbury, was carefully curated to project an aura of calm and quiet competence. Soft grey walls, accented with framed prints of botanical studies, were meant to soothe. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair, covered in a muted floral pattern, invited clients to relax and open up. Even the faint scent of lavender, wafting from a diffuser tucked behind a stack of Freud's collected works, was a calculated attempt to create a safe and nurturing space.

But today, even the carefully constructed tranquility felt strained, a fragile dam holding back a torrent of her own anxieties. She glanced at the clock. Three minutes until her next client. She took a deep breath, straightened the slightly askew cushion on the armchair, and plastered on her professional smile, the one that said, "I'm here, I'm listening, and everything will be alright." It was a mask she wore well, but underneath, Eleanor Vance felt the familiar tug of exhaustion, a weary reminder that even healers need healing. The question was, who would heal her?
