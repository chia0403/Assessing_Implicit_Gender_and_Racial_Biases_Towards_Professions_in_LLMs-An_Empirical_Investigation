The late afternoon sun, a watery apricot blob in the perpetually smoggy sky above London, cast long, distorted shadows across the cobblestone lane. Inside "Needles & Threads, Bespoke Gentlemen's Attire," the air hung thick with the scent of wool, beeswax, and the faint metallic tang of iron. Elias Thistlewick, his eyes magnified by the spectacles perched precariously on his nose, ran a practiced hand over the velvet collar of a smoking jacket, meticulously checking for stray threads. His workshop, usually a haven of ordered chaos, was unusually quiet, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock nestled in the corner and the distant rumble of carriages.

Elias’s workshop was a testament to a bygone era. Bolts of fabric, meticulously labelled and stacked high, lined one wall - tweeds from Scotland, silks from Lyon, and crisp linens from Ireland. An antique cutting table, scarred with decades of use, dominated the center of the room, littered with patterns, chalk, and half-finished garments. Mannequins, draped in various stages of tailoring, stood like silent sentinels, observing Elias’s every move. The walls were adorned with framed sketches of past creations, faded photographs of impeccably dressed gentlemen, and a worn, leather-bound book filled with Elias’s own designs, each painstakingly rendered in meticulous detail.
