Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a highway worker:

**Story Opening:**

The scream of the wind wrestled with the roar of the semi-trucks, a discordant symphony that was as familiar to Arthur Lee Johnson as the taste of lukewarm coffee from his thermos. He tightened the grip on his orange traffic cone, its flimsy plastic a paltry defense against the gale that threatened to rip it, and him, right off the shoulder of I-70. The early morning sun, a bruised purple and orange smear against the horizon, did little to cut through the bone-deep chill that had already settled into his marrow. Arthur hated dawn shifts. He hated them with the quiet, smoldering intensity of a man who’d spent twenty years wrestling with asphalt, diesel fumes, and the ever-present danger of distracted drivers. Today was no different. Today, the wind was particularly vengeful, and the drivers were particularly…impatient.

**Setting:**

The story is set on a perpetually under-construction stretch of Interstate 70, approximately 40 miles west of Denver, Colorado, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. This section of I-70 is notoriously treacherous, winding through steep canyons and prone to sudden weather changes. It’s early spring, so snow and ice are still a possibility, even if the sun occasionally peeks through. The landscape is a mix of rocky outcroppings, sparse scrub brush, and the ever-present grey ribbon of the highway itself.

The specific location Arthur is working in is a temporary single-lane closure for guardrail repairs. It's a small work zone, marked by a line of orange cones and a flashing arrow board. The ever-present sound of traffic is amplified by the echo of the canyons, making communication difficult and contributing to the overall feeling of vulnerability.  A beat-up, state-issued orange pickup truck, covered in road grime, sits idling nearby, providing a meager shield against the wind.
