The biting wind whipped around Abigail "Abby" Finch's ankles, even through the thick wool socks she swore by. She cursed under her breath, adjusting the collar of her overly-enthusiastic fuchsia coat - a "power color," her boss, Brenda, had insisted. Abby suspected Brenda just had a thing for fuchsia.

She stood on the cracked, salt-stained pavement in front of "McKinley & Sons, Family Butchers Since 1923," a relic of a time when handshakes and knowing your butcher by name were still a thing. Now, McKinley & Sons was clinging to existence, a stubborn weed in the manicured lawn of the gleaming supermarket that had sprung up across Elm Street last year.

The interior was even more depressing. Sawdust coated the linoleum floor, a pungent smell of aged meat hung heavy in the air, and the fluorescent lights buzzed with a dispirited hum. Mr. McKinley, a man whose apron looked like it had seen better days, stood behind the counter, his face etched with a deep weariness that mirrored the shop itself.

Abby Finch, regional sales representative for "EverFresh Food Solutions," took a deep breath and plastered a smile on her face. Time to sell the unsellable.
