The fluorescent lights of the break room hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the anxiety buzzing beneath Amelia Hayes’ perfectly ironed lab coat. Amelia, Dr. Amelia Hayes, Registered Dietician and scourge of hospital-baked lasagna, took a deep breath, trying to center herself. Today wasn’t just any day. Today, the infamous Chef Antoine Dubois, self-proclaimed culinary god and purveyor of artery-clogging delights, was holding a press conference to launch his new “comfort food” menu at St. Jude’s General.

St. Jude’s General, a sprawling beige complex of glass and brick located on the edge of downtown Chicago, was where Amelia had dedicated the last five years of her life to fighting for healthier patient options. She’d successfully replaced sugary cereals with oatmeal, fought tooth and nail for grilled chicken over fried, and even managed to convince the cafeteria to offer whole-wheat bread. But Antoine Dubois? He was a different beast altogether. He was a celebrity chef with a loyal following, a contract signed in blood with the hospital board, and a complete disregard for anything vaguely resembling nutritional value. The upcoming battle felt less like a professional disagreement and more like David versus Goliath, armed with a measuring cup and a calorie counter. Outside, the grey Chicago sky threatened rain, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia. This was going to be interesting.
