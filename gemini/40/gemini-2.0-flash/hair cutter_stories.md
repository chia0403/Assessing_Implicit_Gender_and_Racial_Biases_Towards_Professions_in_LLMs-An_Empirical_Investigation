Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a hair cutter named Eleanor Grace Davies:

**Setting:**

The year is 2042. Neo-Victorian chic is back in a big way, but with a futuristic twist. Think bustles made of recycled plastics, goggles embedded with AR displays, and parasols that double as personal drones. Eleanor Grace Davies' salon, "The Gilded Shear," is located in the heart of the revitalized Gaslamp Quarter in San Diego, California. The building itself is an architectural marvel: a late 19th-century brick structure lovingly restored and retrofitted with shimmering solar panels that mimic stained glass. Inside, the salon is a delightful mix of old and new. Antique barber chairs upholstered in plush velvet sit beneath glowing holographic chandeliers that project shifting patterns onto the walls. Steam-punk inspired devices, gleaming with brass and polished copper, are nestled amongst vintage hair product bottles. Eleanor, however, has kept the salon a "no tech" zone, so old fashioned scissors and razors are her tools of choice.

**Opening:**

The scent of lavender-infused steam hung thick in the air, swirling around Eleanor Grace Davies as she meticulously trimmed a stray curl from Mrs. Periwinkleâ€™s elaborate neo-Victorian updo. Outside, the rhythmic whir of automated delivery drones provided a constant, low hum, but inside The Gilded Shear, time seemed to slow. Eleanor took a step back, tilting her head, her dark eyes gleaming in the soft light of the holographic chandelier. "Just so," she murmured, snipping one last, defiant strand. Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose wardrobe screamed "inherited wealth" and whose face whispered "too many cosmetic procedures," fluttered her augmented eyelashes. "Oh, Miss Davies, you're an absolute marvel! It's simply impossible to find anyone who understands the subtle art of a perfect bustle-compatible chignon these days." Eleanor smiled, a genuine warmth radiating from her face. "The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Periwinkle. Now, shall we discuss the possibility of adding a few strategically placed bioluminescent braids for the upcoming gala?"
