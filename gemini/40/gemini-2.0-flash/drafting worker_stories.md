Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, introducing our drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, monotonous tune above Arthur Reginald Finch’s head, a sound he’d grown so accustomed to, he barely registered it. It was a comfort, almost, a familiar droning that shielded him from the clamorous city just beyond the grimy windows of Finch & Son Drafting. Arthur squinted at the blueprint stretched across his large, meticulously organized drafting table. The architect's squiggly notes resembled hieroglyphs, promising an entire wing addition to the already sprawling St. Jude's Hospital. Arthur inhaled deeply, the scent of ink and aged paper clinging to the air like a persistent ghost. He adjusted his thick-rimmed glasses and carefully dipped his nib pen into the bottle of india ink, the black viscous liquid a silent promise of precision and order. He traced the architect's lines, converting them into clear, legible directives for the construction crew, brick by careful brick. He knew it was thankless work, unnoticed by all but the most meticulous contractor, but Arthur Reginald Finch found a profound satisfaction in bringing clarity to chaos, order to the jumble of imagination. A satisfaction he desperately needed, especially today.
**Setting:**

**Finch & Son Drafting, 1957, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.**

The office is small, cramped, and perpetually overshadowed by the taller buildings surrounding it. It occupies the second floor of a brick building in a slightly downtrodden section of the city. The interior is dominated by large drafting tables, covered in blueprints, drafting tools, and half-empty mugs of coffee. The walls are lined with shelves overflowing with architectural books, technical manuals, and old architectural drawings dating back to when Arthur's father, Reginald, founded the business. The air is thick with the scent of ink, paper, and a faint undercurrent of dust. A window air conditioner rattles intermittently, struggling to keep the room cool in the sweltering Philadelphia summer. The overall impression is one of quiet, diligent work, frozen in a time before computers revolutionized the field. A single, shared telephone sits on a small desk near the entrance, its black rotary dial a relic of a simpler, less connected era. A calendar hangs askew on the wall, forever stuck on July 1957.
