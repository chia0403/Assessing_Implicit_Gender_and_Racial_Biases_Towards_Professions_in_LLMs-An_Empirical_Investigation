The biting wind whipped off the North Sea and threatened to steal Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's breath. She clutched her threadbare shawl tighter, the salt spray stinging her face as she stood on the crumbling cliffs of Ravenswood, her gaze fixed on the churning grey water below. The November air held the tang of seaweed and decay, a somber scent that clung to the ancient stones and mirrored the feeling in her heart. Ravenswood, a village little more than a collection of weathered cottages clinging precariously to the edge of the world, was a far cry from the glittering stages Amelia had once known.

Just six months ago, she'd been headlining at the Savoy, her name whispered in hushed reverence, her voice the toast of London. Now, she was here, hiding in plain sight, renting a tiny room above Mrs. Petrov’s bakery – a space smelling perpetually of burnt sugar and quiet desperation. The whispers here were about the wild weather and the dwindling fish stocks, not about Amelia Hawthorne, the Fallen Star. The Raven’s Roost, the village’s only pub, was her stage now, its clientele more interested in pints of ale than soaring melodies. And her voice, once so powerful and confident, felt rusty, choked with regret, a pale imitation of the siren it once was. Tonight, she would sing again, a somber set of sea shanties for a crowd that wouldn’t recognize the ghost of the woman she used to be. Tonight, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne would try to disappear just a little bit more.
