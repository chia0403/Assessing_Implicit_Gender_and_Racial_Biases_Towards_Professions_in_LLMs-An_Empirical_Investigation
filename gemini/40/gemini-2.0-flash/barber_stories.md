Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the main character being a barber named:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, thick and honeyed, slanted through the grimy window of "Cut Above The Rest," painting long, dusty stripes across the checkered linoleum floor. The air hung heavy with the scents of Bay Rum aftershave, disinfectant, and the lingering ghost of burnt coffee from this morning's percolator. The rotary phone on the counter buzzed a low, persistent hum, ignored as usual. Outside, the rumble of traffic from Edgewater Avenue provided a constant, dull counterpoint to the quiet rhythm inside the shop.

**Story Opening:**

Cyprian "Cy" Aurelius, a man whose own thinning hair was a constant source of ironic amusement to him, ran a well-worn comb through the thick, greased-back pompadour of Mr. Henderson, the retired postman. Mr. Henderson, face scrunched shut against stray hairs, was muttering something about the audacity of the new stamp prices.

"Just a little off the top, Cy," he grumbled, his voice muffled by the protective drape. "Don't want to look like some kinda' beatnik, you know?"

Cy chuckled, a low rumble in his chest. "Wouldn't dream of it, Mr. Henderson. Beatniks are bad for business. Who needs a shave and a trim when they're busy reading poetry and contemplating the void?" He snipped with practiced ease, the rhythmic *snick, snick* a comforting sound in the quiet shop. He glanced out the window at a young woman hurrying down the street, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Something about her gait, the way she clutched a worn leather satchel, triggered a flicker of somethingâ€¦ recognition, perhaps? He pushed the thought aside. It was probably just the late afternoon fatigue playing tricks on him. He'd seen so many faces pass by "Cut Above the Rest" over the years, they all started to blur together after a while. But as the woman disappeared around the corner, Cy had the distinct feeling that his quiet Tuesday was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
