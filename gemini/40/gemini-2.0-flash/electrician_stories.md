The hum of the fluorescent lights above barely registered to Eleanor Mae “Ellie” Harding anymore. After fifteen years climbing ladders and wrestling recalcitrant wiring, the constant buzz had become a sort of white noise lullaby, a monotonous soundtrack to her days. Today, however, even that familiar drone felt like a discordant violin screeching against her nerves.

Ellie stood in the echoing, cavernous space of the old Blackwood Mill, the scent of damp wood and stale metal clinging to the air like a persistent ghost. Sunlight, filtered through grime-streaked, arched windows, cast long, fractured shadows across the concrete floor. Dust motes danced in the beams, creating an ethereal spectacle that did little to alleviate the sheer desolation of the place. The Blackwood Mill, once the bustling heart of the now-forgotten town of Oakhaven, was slated for demolition, its bones deemed too riddled with decay and bad memories to salvage.

Ellie had been contracted to disconnect the power supply – the final death knell before the wrecking ball swung. She preferred jobs like these, quiet and solitary, where she could lose herself in the intricacies of the electrical grid. The silence usually soothed her. But today, the mill felt different. The air was thick with a palpable sense of sorrow, a clinging residue of the lives that had once pulsed within its walls. And Ellie, a pragmatic woman who trusted logic and electricity above all else, couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't alone in the decaying shell of the Blackwood Mill.
