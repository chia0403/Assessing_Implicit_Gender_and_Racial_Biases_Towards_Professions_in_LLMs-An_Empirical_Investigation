The smell of diesel clung to Jedediah "Jed" Silas like a second skin. It permeated his clothes, his hair, even the perpetually chapped skin of his lips. He was more at home in the cab of his eighteen-wheeler, affectionately nicknamed "The Wandering Star," than he ever was in his small, cluttered apartment back in Tulsa.

The setting was a bleak, pre-dawn rest stop just outside of Amarillo, Texas. The sky was a vast, inky canvas pricked with cold, distant stars that were slowly fading as the faintest hint of rose began to paint the eastern horizon. The wind howled across the cracked asphalt, carrying with it the grit of the Texas plains and a low, mournful drone that Jed swore he could feel vibrate in his teeth. A lone, flickering fluorescent light buzzed above the ramshackle restroom building, casting a sickly yellow glow that barely pushed back the darkness.

Around him, other trucks slumbered, their chrome grills catching the weak light like the teeth of sleeping giants. The air thrummed with the residual heat of their engines, a comforting, if somewhat overwhelming, symphony of mechanical breaths. Jed stood beside "The Wandering Star," stretching his stiff limbs and nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee, the bitter brew doing little to chase away the bone-deep weariness that had settled in after a long night of hauling frozen beef from Denver. Another hour or so and he'd be back on the road, heading east, chasing the rising sun and the promise of another paycheck. But for now, here in this desolate corner of Texas, he was just Jed Silas, a man and his truck, waiting for the world to wake up.
