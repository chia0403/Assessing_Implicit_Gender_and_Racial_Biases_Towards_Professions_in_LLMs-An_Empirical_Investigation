The steam hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia Isabella Russo like a second skin. The soft clinking of wind chimes mingled with the rhythmic splash of the bamboo fountain in the corner, creating a cocoon of tranquility within the walls of "The Haven," her massage studio nestled above the bustle of downtown Portland. Outside, the city throbbed with Friday afternoon energy, a chaotic symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps. But inside, time seemed to slow, the world outside fading to a distant murmur. Amelia, wiping a stray strand of dark hair from her brow with the back of her hand, adjusted the lavender diffuser, a familiar comfort against the day's accumulated stress. She glanced at the appointment book, her eyes lingering on the name scrawled in neat cursive: Mr. Silas Blackwood. He was a new client, referred by Dr. Chen for chronic back pain. The Haven had been her sanctuary for five years now, a testament to her dedication and the healing power of touch, but something about the name, Silas Blackwood, sent a faint, almost imperceptible tremor through her. She hoped it was just the extra shot of espresso she'd had at lunch.
