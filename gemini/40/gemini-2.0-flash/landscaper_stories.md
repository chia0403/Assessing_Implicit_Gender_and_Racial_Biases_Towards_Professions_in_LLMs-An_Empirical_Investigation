The late afternoon sun, thick and honeyed, clung to the edges of the manicured hedges like golden paint. A lone robin hopped across the expanse of emerald lawn, its crimson breast puffed with importance. This was Mrs. Van Derlyn's domain, a meticulously curated paradise nestled in the heart of Greenwich, Connecticut. And this, thought Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his worn glove, was where he spent most of his Tuesdays.

Bart McKinley, owner and sole proprietor of McKinley's Greenscapes, wasn't complaining, exactly. Mrs. Van Derlyn paid well, exceptionally well. But her expectations were, let's just say, a bit on the demanding side. Today's mission? Sculpting her prize-winning rose bushes into the vague shape of swans, a task Bart found both artistically challenging and utterly ridiculous. He adjusted the angle of the electric shears, a sigh escaping his lips as he contemplated the sheer volume of rose petals that would soon be carpeting the ground. He really should have charged her extra for this. He always charged her extra for this, but somehow, it never felt quite enough. The scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the sweet perfume of the roses, a heady combination that, under different circumstances, Bart might have found enjoyable. But today, it just amplified the pressure radiating from the grand, Georgian-style mansion that loomed over him like a disapproving matriarch. This was Greenwich, after all, where appearances were everything, and Bartholomew McKinley was just the man paid to keep them that way.
