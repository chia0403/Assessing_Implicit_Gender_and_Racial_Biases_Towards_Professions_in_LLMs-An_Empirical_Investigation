The rain, a miserable, persistent drizzle that seemed determined to soak through concrete, mirrored the gnawing dread in Harold Theodore Finch’s stomach. He adjusted the knot of his tie, a bilious shade of green he regretted choosing this morning, and stared out the grimy window of his office. Finch Assurance, a decidedly less-than-glamorous establishment sandwiched between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually-under-construction deli, was his life. Or, more accurately, his penance.

The office itself was a monument to beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, beige filing cabinets overflowing with policy documents, beige telephone that hadn’t rung in what felt like a beige eternity. The only splash of color came from a slightly wilting philodendron clinging precariously to the windowsill, and the framed picture of Harold’s prize-winning (though frankly, rather mangy) tabby cat, Bartholomew, perched proudly on a velvet cushion. It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October in the sleepy, perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, nestled in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia, and Harold knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that today was going to be different. Very different indeed. The hairs on the back of his neck prickled, a sensation he usually only experienced when Bartholomew coughed up a hairball on his favorite armchair. This feeling, however, was far more sinister. He just couldn't shake the feeling that someone, or something, was about to walk through that door and unravel the meticulously mundane fabric of Harold Theodore Finch's life.
