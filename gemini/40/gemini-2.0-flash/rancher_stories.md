The setting was the relentless, sun-baked expanse of the Painted Desert, Arizona, in the grip of late July. Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and dry heat, danced across the parched earth, mocking any attempt at order. The air shimmered above the bleached bones of long-dead saguaros, and the only sound, besides the persistent drone of cicadas, was the weary groan of the windmill down by the dry creek bed. This was El Rancho de la Esperanza, and for Jedediah "Jed" Tiberius McCallister, it was his lifeline, his burden, and his reason for drawing breath each morning. He surveyed the cracked earth, his brow furrowed beneath the brim of his worn Stetson, a silent prayer forming on his lips for the rain he knew probably wouldn't come. This year was going to be rough.
