The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s unruly auburn curls across her face as she wrestled the canvas onto its easel.  The salt spray from the churning grey Atlantic stung her eyes, but she didn't flinch.  Perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the desolate, windswept coast of Cornwall, Amelia felt utterly insignificant, a tiny speck against the raw, untamed power of the ocean.  The air tasted of brine and impending storm, a perfect symphony for the tempestuous landscape she was attempting to capture.  Her small, weather-beaten studio, a converted fisherman's hut clinging to the cliff face, offered little protection from the elements, but the view, the untamed beauty, was worth every shiver.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks was a constant, hypnotic soundtrack to her work, a reminder of the ephemeral nature of both beauty and life itself.
