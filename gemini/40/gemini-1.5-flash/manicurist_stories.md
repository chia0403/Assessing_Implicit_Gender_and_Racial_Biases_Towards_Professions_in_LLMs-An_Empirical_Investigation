The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the state of Esmeralda “Esme” Valencia’s own frayed nerves.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single flickering fluorescent bulb above her workstation, danced in the humid air, thick with the cloying scent of acetone and cheap vanilla polish.  Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Calle Ocho, the vibrant Latin rhythms seeping through the grimy windowpanes a stark contrast to the quiet desperation humming beneath Esme's capable hands.  She worked with meticulous precision, shaping the ragged edges of a client’s acrylics, her mind a million miles away from the perfectly polished crimson blooming on the nail bed before her.  The air conditioner sputtered its last, leaving only the oppressive heat and the nagging hum of worry to fill the tiny salon.
