The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the crisp mountain air, a lonely counterpoint to the wind whistling through the jagged peaks surrounding the village of St. Goustan.  Fine, white dust, like a ghostly snowfall, clung to everything â€“ the rough-hewn workbench, the worn leather apron of Elias Thorne, and the very air itself. Elias, his face etched with the same patient weariness as the stone he sculpted, paused, his calloused hand wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. The setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows across the valley, painting the slate-grey houses in hues of burnt orange and deep violet.  The air, still carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, grew colder with each passing moment, a stark reminder that winter's icy grip was tightening its hold on the Breton countryside.  His current project, a life-sized angel for the village church, stood unfinished, a silent testament to the slow, painstaking work that was his life.
