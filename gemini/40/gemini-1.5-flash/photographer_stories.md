The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that clashed spectacularly with the muted greys of the Cornish coastline.  Salt spray, thick as a shroud, clung to her parka and the heavy canvas bag slung over her shoulder, its contents – a battered Hasselblad 500C/M and a collection of meticulously chosen lenses – surprisingly dry.  Below her, the waves crashed against the jagged teeth of the rocks at Kynance Cove, a symphony of furious beauty that both thrilled and terrified her.  The sky, a bruised purple and bruised orange, mirrored the turbulent emotions churning within her.  This wasn't just another photoshoot; this was a pilgrimage, a desperate attempt to capture the raw, untamed spirit of the place that had haunted her dreams for years.  The wind howled, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic pulse of the sea, and Amelia felt a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold.
