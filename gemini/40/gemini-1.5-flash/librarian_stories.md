The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that seeped through the single-paned windows of the Ashworth Memorial Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the stained-glass rose window, danced in the quiet stillness.  Elara Genevieve Hawthorne, head librarian and keeper of countless forgotten tales, adjusted her spectacles, pushing them higher up the bridge of her nose.  Her fingers, stained a faint sepia from years of handling antique books, traced the spine of a particularly worn volume – *A Compendium of Curious Creatures and Mythological Beasts* – a fitting companion for the peculiar afternoon that was about to unfold.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, promising a night of tempestuous weather, mirroring the storm brewing within the library's ancient walls.
