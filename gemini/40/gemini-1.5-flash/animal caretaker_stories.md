The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and something distinctlyâ€¦musky.  This wasn't the refined, manicured scent of a high-society garden; this was the raw, untamed aroma of Whisperwind Sanctuary, a sprawling wildlife rehabilitation center nestled deep within the ancient Redwood forests of Northern California.  Amelia, her cheeks flushed crimson despite the chill, heaved the hay onto the rickety wooden cart, the rusty wheels groaning a protest under the weight.  Around her, the sanctuary thrummed with the nocturnal rustlings of its inhabitants: the soft hoot of an owl from the towering redwoods, the nervous chittering of squirrels in the eaves of the weathered barn, and the low, rumbling growl that only a particularly grumpy badger could produce.  Tonight, the work was never-ending, but Amelia wouldn't have it any other way.
