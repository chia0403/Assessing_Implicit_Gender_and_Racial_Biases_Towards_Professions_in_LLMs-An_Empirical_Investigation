The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the relentless August heat beating down on the cobbled streets of  Charleston, South Carolina.  Sunlight, fractured by the Spanish moss draping ancient oaks, dappled the worn floorboards of Amelia Hawthorne's workshop.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny dancing stars, swirled in the shafts of light that pierced the gloom of the small, cluttered space.  Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate apricot from the silk she'd been working on, paused, a needle still poised above a cascade of emerald green fabric.  The rhythmic click-clack of her sewing machine, usually a comforting metronome to her creative process, had fallen silent.  A shadow flickered across the windowpane, momentarily eclipsing the sunlit dust motes, and a prickle of unease settled on Amelia's skin.  It wasn't the heat; it was something else, somethingâ€¦sinister.
