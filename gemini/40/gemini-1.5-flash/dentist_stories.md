The acrid tang of ozone hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usually antiseptic scent of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dental practice.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her Victorian-era office, blurring the gaslights of Willow Creek into shimmering, watery halos.  Inside, the rhythmic whir of the emergency generator battled the storm’s fury, a low hum accompanying the frantic tapping of Eleanor’s fingers on her worn mahogany desk.  Water seeped under the door, a slow, insidious tide creeping towards the pristine white tiles of her waiting room, threatening to swallow the meticulously arranged magazines and the cheerful, yet now ironically damp, potted ferns.  Willow Creek, usually a picture of quaint charm, was tonight a tempestuous beast, and Eleanor, despite years spent facing down anxious patients and the occasional rogue cavity, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach.  Tonight, something felt…different.
