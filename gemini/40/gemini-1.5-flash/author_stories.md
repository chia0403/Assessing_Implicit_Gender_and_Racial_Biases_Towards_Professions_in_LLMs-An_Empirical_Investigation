The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing boat's tiller.  The October wind, a snarling beast from the north, whipped her auburn hair across her eyes, momentarily blinding her as the *Sea Serpent* bucked against a particularly vicious wave.  The grey sky mirrored the turbulent sea, a churning canvas of bruised purples and steely greys that threatened to swallow the tiny vessel whole.  Mia, however, felt a thrill, a familiar comfort in the chaos.  This wild, unforgiving stretch of the Atlantic, just off the jagged, windswept coast of Cornwall, was her sanctuary, her muse, the very wellspring of her latest novel – a gothic thriller she’d tentatively titled *The Kraken’s Kiss*.
