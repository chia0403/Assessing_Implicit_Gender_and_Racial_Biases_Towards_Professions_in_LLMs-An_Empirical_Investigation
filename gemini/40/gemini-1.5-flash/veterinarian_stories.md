The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the reluctant Labrador retriever onto the examination table.  Snow, thick and unrelenting, piled high against the weathered clapboard walls of the Ashwood Animal Clinic, obscuring the already meagre view of the Northumberland coastline. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and wet dog, a familiar comfort to Eleanor, a stark contrast to the icy fury raging outside.  The clinic itself, a rambling Victorian building that had seen better days, creaked and groaned under the weight of the blizzard, mirroring the apprehension tightening in Eleanor's chest. Tonight felt different.  The usual rural emergencies – a limping sheep, a swallowed sock – seemed trivial compared to the unsettling premonition that clung to the air, colder than the blizzard itself.
