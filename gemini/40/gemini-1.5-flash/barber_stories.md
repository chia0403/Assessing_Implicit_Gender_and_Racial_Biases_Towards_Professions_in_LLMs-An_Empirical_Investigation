The rusty sign creaked a mournful tune in the October wind, its faded lettering barely proclaiming "Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Barber."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of Barty's shop, illuminating a chaotic collection of vintage barber poles, chipped porcelain mugs, and faded photographs depicting men with slicked-back hair and handlebar moustaches â€“ a testament to a bygone era. The air hung heavy with the scent of bay rum, stale coffee, and something faintly metallic, a lingering aroma from the last customer's unfortunate nick. Outside, the town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, seemed to be holding its breath, anticipating the first snowfall of the season.  Barty himself, a man whose weathered face mirrored the age of his shop, sat hunched over a worn leather-bound ledger, his shears resting silently beside him, a half-finished cup of lukewarm coffee growing cold on the counter.
