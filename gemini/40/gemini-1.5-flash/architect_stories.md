The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort he welcomed on this blustery November afternoon.  He stood perched precariously on the crumbling edge of the cliff, the wind whipping his charcoal grey overcoat around him like a frantic bird. Below, the churning grey-green waters of the Atlantic hammered against the jagged rocks, a relentless symphony accompanying the mournful cry of gulls.  Before him, clinging defiantly to the windswept headland, stood the ruin – a skeletal frame of gothic stone, half-swallowed by the encroaching sea.  This was Blackhaven Manor, its once-proud turrets now scarred and broken, a testament to the unforgiving power of time and tide. Elias, a man whose life was built on the careful construction of order and precision, found a strange beauty in its chaotic decay.  His task, as commissioned by a mysterious benefactor, was to not only assess the structural integrity of the crumbling edifice, but to dream up a way to restore it – a feat that seemed as improbable as taming the tempest raging around him.
