The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslit lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel, its polished surface reflecting the swirling snow outside.  Each flake, a tiny, frantic dancer, clung briefly to the ornate, ironwork balconies before melting into oblivion.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old leather, expensive perfume, and something indefinablyâ€¦ stale.  Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his bellhop uniform straining slightly at the seams despite the recent mending by his landlady, Mrs. Periwinkle, adjusted the leather strap of his luggage cart. The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of the city, was now showing its age, much like Barty himself, though he wouldn't admit it.  His weary eyes, however, betrayed a certain world-weariness that belied his youth, a weariness born not of hard work alone, but of the secrets whispered within the hotel's decaying grandeur.
