The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled a length of tar-soaked felt onto the steeply pitched roof.  Below him, the city of Auberon sprawled, a tapestry of grey stone and flickering gaslights, its muted sounds – the distant rumble of carriage wheels, the shrill cries of gulls – barely audible above the howl of the wind.  Elias, his thick woolen cap pulled low,  focused on his work, the rhythmic clang of his hammer a counterpoint to the storm's fury.  The smell of damp slate and pine tar clung to his clothes, a familiar scent that spoke of long days and harder work, a scent that was, in its own way, comforting.  He was perched precariously atop the spire of St. Jude's Cathedral, a gothic masterpiece that clawed at the bruised sky, its gargoyles leering down at him from their stony perches.  This wasn't just any roofing job; it was a restoration, a delicate dance between preserving history and battling the relentless assault of time and weather.  And tonight, the weather was winning.
