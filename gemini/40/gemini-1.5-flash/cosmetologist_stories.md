The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Jean Hawthorne truly appreciated.  It was the aroma of a long day at "Shear Perfection," her small but fiercely independent salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  Rain, the kind that pattered like tiny secrets against the ancient brick walls, lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the gaslight glow of the street outside. Inside, however, Amelia was surrounded by a comforting chaos: the low hum of the hair dryers, the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors, and the hushed murmur of client confidences.  Tonight, though, the usual soothing rhythm was disrupted.  A single, flickering candle on the counter cast long, dancing shadows, illuminating the worried crease between Amelia’s perfectly arched eyebrows.  Something felt…off.
