The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes of her salon, "Shear Genius," a name ironically bestowed upon her by a particularly tipsy client three years ago.  The tiny shop, nestled between a failing bakery and a suspiciously quiet pawnbroker's on Bleecker Street, was a haven of mismatched furniture and vibrant colour.  A faded velvet armchair, the colour of a bruised plum, sat opposite a vintage barber's chair, its chrome gleaming dully under the weak light of a single, flickering bulb.  The walls, painted a cheerful sunflower yellow, were adorned with haphazardly hung framed photographs â€“ mostly of Sera's previous clients, their before-and-after transformations a testament to her skill.  Tonight, however, the salon was empty, save for Sera herself, meticulously cleaning her shears under the weak, sputtering tap.  The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within her.
