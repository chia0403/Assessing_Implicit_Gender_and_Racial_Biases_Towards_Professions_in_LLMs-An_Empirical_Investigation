Sweat beaded on the forehead of Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with a recalcitrant vacuum tube.  The air hung thick and heavy, a cloying blend of exhaust fumes, jasmine, and the ever-present scent of rain yet to fall.  Elias, a radio technician for the American Forces Vietnam Network, hunched over his workbench in the cramped, airless shack behind the main broadcasting studio, the flickering fluorescent light casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the beam.  Outside, the city throbbed with a low, unsettling hum – a symphony of cicadas, distant motorbikes, and the muffled echoes of a life lived on the edge.  Tonight, however, the usual cacophony was punctuated by an unnerving silence – a void that was more unsettling than the usual clamor.  The silence emanated from the shortwave radio, usually alive with crackling broadcasts from halfway across the globe, now stubbornly silent, and it was this silence that had Elias Thorne truly worried.
