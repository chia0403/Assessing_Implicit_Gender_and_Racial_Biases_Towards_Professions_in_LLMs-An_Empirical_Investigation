The grey sky, bruised purple at the edges, threatened more snow, a grim addition to the already oppressive chill that seemed to seep from the very bones of the land.  Elias, his breath clouding before him like a ghostly exhalation, adjusted the thick wool scarf around his neck, the rough fabric scratching against his chapped skin. He stood atop the crumbling ramparts of Oldstone Keep, a sentinel against the encroaching twilight and whatever shadowy things it might bring from the moors below.  The keep, once a proud fortress, was now a skeletal husk, its stones stained with the grime of centuries and the faint, lingering scent of decay.  Its only inhabitants were Elias and the handful of weary guards under his command, their vigil a lonely testament to a forgotten kingdom's fading glory.
