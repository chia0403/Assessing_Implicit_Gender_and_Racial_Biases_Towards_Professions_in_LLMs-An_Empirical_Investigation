Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window of her office, blurring the already indistinct view of the cobbled alleyway below. Amelia, a bookkeeper whose meticulous nature extended even to the precise arrangement of her desk pens – three black, one blue, and a burgundy for special occasions – sighed.  The air in her tiny office, perched precariously above a struggling bakery in the heart of Grimsborough’s Old Town, smelled faintly of yeast and despair.  The accounts of “The Gilded Lily,” a failing flower shop on the ground floor, were a current source of the latter.  Their ledger, a chaotic jumble of scrawled entries and suspiciously absent receipts, lay open on her desk, a testament to both the shop’s impending doom and Amelia’s mounting frustration.  The only comforting sound amidst the storm was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a constant reminder that time, like debt, was relentless.
