The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie"  Redfield's weathered Cessna 185, rattling the single propeller like a loose tooth.  Below, the Chugach Mountains hunched like slumbering giants, their snow-capped peaks clawing at the bruised purple sky.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and something else, something primal and unsettling â€“ the metallic tang of blood, faint but undeniably present.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid air, tightened her grip on the yoke, her knuckles bone-white against the worn leather. This wasn't just another charter flight ferrying supplies to a remote logging camp; the radio silence from her last client, the enigmatic prospector Silas Blackwood, had a chilling undercurrent, a silence that spoke louder than any storm.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the unforgiving landscape, painting the scene in hues of orange and impending darkness.  Tonight, the mountains wouldn't just be watching; they would be judging.
