The rasp of the cleaver, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as his own heartbeat, sliced through the pre-dawn chill clinging to the cobblestones of Oakhaven.  Barty, his breath misting in the frigid air, swung the blade again, the rhythmic thud echoing off the damp stone walls of Butterfield's Meats. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of sawdust, a fragrance both comforting and unsettling to the uninitiated. Oakhaven, a town nestled deep within a valley shrouded by ancient, gnarled oaks, was quiet at this hour, save for the occasional creak of a distant shutter and the mournful coo of a lone owl.  But the stillness was deceptive; a tension, as sharp as Barty's cleaver, hung in the air, a silent promise of the day's events yet to unfold.  His butcher shop, a family legacy stretching back generations, stood as a sentinel at the edge of the town, a silent witness to Oakhaven's joys and sorrows, its secrets and its lies.
