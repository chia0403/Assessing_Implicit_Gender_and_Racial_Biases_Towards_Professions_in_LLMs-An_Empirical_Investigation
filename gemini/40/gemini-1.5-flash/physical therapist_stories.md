The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn kayak onto the rocky shoreline.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the jagged teeth of the Maine coast.

Instead, she found herself battling both the elements and the creeping feeling that her quiet escape might be about to become anything but.  The crumpled note tucked into her waterproof bag, its message scrawled in shaky handwriting, was still burning a hole in her pocket.  It simply read: *Need your help.  Come alone.*  And the location was this remote cove, accessible only by kayak.
