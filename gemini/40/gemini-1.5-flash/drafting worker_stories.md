The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  For twenty-three years, Elias, a man whose life was measured in precise millimeters and meticulously rendered lines, had woken to that hum, a constant, almost comforting drone that punctuated the quiet click-clack of his pen against the mylar.  He sat now, hunched over a sprawling blueprint, the faint scent of aged paper and stale coffee clinging to the air like a second skin. The room itself, a cavernous space tucked away in the bowels of the Grimshaw & Sons architectural firm, was a testament to generations of draftsmen.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through grimy windows overlooking a back alley choked with overflowing dumpsters and the skeletal remains of a forgotten fire escape.  The air was thick with the ghosts of blueprints past, the whispers of countless designs – skyscrapers that pierced the clouds, cozy cottages nestled in sun-drenched meadows, and everything in between – all rendered in painstaking detail by hands long since worn out.
