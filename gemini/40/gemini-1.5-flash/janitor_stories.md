The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a monotonous tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the slow sweep of Elias Thorne's mop, danced in the weak beams.  Elias, a man whose life had been meticulously scrubbed clean of excitement, hummed a counterpoint to the lights â€“ a low, melancholic melody only barely audible above the rhythmic swish of his mop head.  The echoing silence of the vast, empty hallway of Blackwood Academy pressed in on him, broken only by the occasional creak of aging floorboards and the distant, rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock somewhere deep within the ancient building. It was 2:17 AM, and Elias Thorne, janitor extraordinaire, was once again the sole inhabitant of a school steeped in history, secrets, and the lingering scent of old textbooks and floor wax.
