The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to Captain Elias Thorne's throat, a familiar companion on nights like this.

The air crackled with the energy of the fire, a terrifying symphony of snapping timbers and the hiss of water against burning wood.  Behind him, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the fire trucks pulsed like a frantic heartbeat, a testament to the desperate battle being waged against the blaze.  Elias, his face smudged with soot and sweat glistening on his brow, felt the familiar adrenaline surge – a mixture of fear and exhilaration that had become his constant companion over his twenty years with the Oakhaven Fire Department.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  The intensity of the fire, the sheer malevolence of its dance, was… unsettling.
