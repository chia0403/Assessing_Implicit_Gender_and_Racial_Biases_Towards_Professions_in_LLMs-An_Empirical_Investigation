He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, "The Wandering Wanderer," its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple light of a pre-dawn sky.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, the kind of air that clung to the high mountain passes of the Cascades like a shroud.  Bart was perched precariously on the edge of the Continental Divide, the vast expanse of the Oregon wilderness stretching before him, a tapestry woven from shadowed forests and the silver gleam of a distant, sleeping lake. The only sound besides the truck's engine was the mournful howl of the wind whistling through the jagged peaks, a lonely soundtrack to Bart's solitary journey.  He adjusted the rearview mirror, his gaze drifting towards the swirling mist that clung to the hairpin turns ahead, a silent warning of the treacherous road that lay before him.
