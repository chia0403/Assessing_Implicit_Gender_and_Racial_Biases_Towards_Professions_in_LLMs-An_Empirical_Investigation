The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down Maple Street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  Her breath plumed out in frosty clouds, momentarily illuminating the swirling snow that clung to the ancient, gnarled branches of the oaks lining the street.  The streetlights, casting a hazy orange glow, barely pierced the gloom that descended early this far north in Wisconsin.  Tonight, the gloom felt heavier than usual, a physical weight pressing down on Amelia as she wrestled with a recalcitrant umbrella.  Ahead, nestled between a Victorian gingerbread house and a more modern, albeit equally charming, craftsman bungalow, sat Sunny Days Childcare, its windows glowing warmly like beacons in the encroaching night.  Inside, the laughter of children – usually a balm to Amelia's soul – sounded oddly muted, almost muffled, tonight. A shiver, unconnected to the cold, ran down her spine.
