The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the gritty reality of the alley outside.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Spa, a sound muffled only slightly by the thick, plush towels piled neatly on the massage table.  Thirty-year-old Elara Vance, her fingers nimble and strong despite the late hour, kneaded the tight knots in her client’s shoulders. The low hum of the aromatherapy diffuser blended with the rhythmic squeak of her knuckles, creating a soothing, almost hypnotic soundtrack to the storm raging beyond the frosted glass window.  Elara’s own shoulders ached, a familiar companion to her long days spent easing the tension of others.  But tonight, it wasn't just physical fatigue; a creeping unease, a prickling sense of something wrong, settled in her stomach, a feeling heavier than any client’s stress she’d ever encountered.
