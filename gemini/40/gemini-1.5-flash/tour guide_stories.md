The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's neck, the heat shimmering off the ochre-coloured sandstone of Petra's Siq.  Sweat trickled down her spine, despite the loose linen shirt she wore.  Amelia adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar, its tiny red light blinking reassuringly in the dim, canyon-like passage.  Ahead, her tour group, a motley collection of sunburnt tourists clutching water bottles and cameras, shuffled slowly, their murmurs a low hum against the ancient stone walls.  The air, thick with the scent of dust and something faintly floral, hung heavy and still.  This was her favourite part of the tour, the Siq, a narrow, winding gorge that offered a dramatic and breathtaking entrance to the lost city. Today, however, the usual thrill was tempered by a nagging sense of unease, a prickling at the back of her neck that hinted at something more than just the oppressive heat.
