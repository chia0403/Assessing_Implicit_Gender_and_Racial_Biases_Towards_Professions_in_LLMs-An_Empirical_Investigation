The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Anya Petrova.  It clung to her scrubs, to the polished steel of the instruments laid out on the tray, even to the faint tremor in her left hand.  Anya, a dental hygienist with ten years of experience and a perpetually worried frown etched between her perfectly straight eyebrows, adjusted her latex gloves, the thin rubber whispering against her skin.  The rhythmic whir of the suction machine pulsed in the background, a metronome keeping time to the anxious beat of her heart.  Outside, the relentless Vancouver rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Albrightâ€™s pristine dental practice, a relentless counterpoint to the quiet, almost suffocating tension within the small, brightly lit operatory.  Today, however, the usual hum of the office felt different, charged with an almost palpable unease that had nothing to do with the impending root canal scheduled for Mr. Henderson at 2 pm.
