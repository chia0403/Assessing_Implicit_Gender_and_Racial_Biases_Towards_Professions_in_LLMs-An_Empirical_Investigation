Inside, the studio was a sanctuary of quiet – a stark contrast to the vibrant energy that would soon fill it.  The scent of lemon and eucalyptus hung faintly in the air, a carefully chosen aroma designed to wake the senses and prepare the body for the rigorous workout ahead. Amy, clad in her signature black leggings and vibrant turquoise tank top,  moved through the dim space, checking equipment and adjusting the carefully curated playlist humming softly from the sound system.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart beat in time with the music, a silent promise of the invigorating chaos about to unfold.
