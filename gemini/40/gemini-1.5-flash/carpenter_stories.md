The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s weathered face as he wrestled the stubborn oak plank onto the workbench.  Seagulls cried overhead, their calls a raucous counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of his hammer against wood.

The wind howled a mournful tune through the gaps in the aged timber frame, a soundtrack to the solitary life Elias had carved out for himself in this windswept corner of the world.
