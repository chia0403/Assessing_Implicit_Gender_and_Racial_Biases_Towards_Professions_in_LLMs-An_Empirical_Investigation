The salt spray stung Amelia Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She stood perched on the jagged rocks of Penzance Head, the wind whipping her auburn hair into a frenzy around her, her oils almost snatched from her easel by a sudden gust.  Below, the churning grey sea gnawed at the cliffs, a relentless, rhythmic symphony that had been the soundtrack to her life for as long as she could remember.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, a pungent perfume that Amelia, despite its harshness, found oddly comforting.  Her small, sturdy easel, braced against a stubborn outcrop of rock, held a canvas already half-covered in swirling blues and angry greys, a testament to the untamed beauty of the Cornish coast that both inspired and challenged her.  This was her sanctuary, this wild, windswept corner of the world, where the only colours brighter than the sea were the fierce wildflowers clinging precariously to the cliff face.
