The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick as the Spanish moss draping the ancient oaks lining the driveway of Magnolia Manor.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony, punctuated only by the rhythmic *snip-snip-snip* of Elias Thorne's shears. Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as bark but whose touch with plants was delicate as a butterfly's wing, worked with a practiced ease born of years spent coaxing life from the stubborn, sun-baked earth.  He hummed a low, mournful tune, the melody echoing the melancholy beauty of the overgrown gardens surrounding the grand, decaying mansion.  The wrought-iron gates groaned a rusty protest as he pushed them open, revealing a vista of overgrown azaleas, their vibrant blossoms choked by weeds taller than a man.  This wasn't just a landscaping job; it felt more like an archeological dig, unearthing the ghosts of forgotten blooms beneath a blanket of neglect.
