The fluorescent lights of Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  Outside, the March wind howled a mournful dirge against the grimy windows of her small, cramped storefront on the edge of Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to its faded charm amidst a sea of sprawling suburbia.  The air inside smelled faintly of stale coffee, printer toner, and the lingering scent of desperation â€“ a familiar aroma that permeated Bea's life from January to April each year.  Mountains of paperwork, organized with a meticulousness bordering on obsessive, threatened to spill from overflowing file cabinets.  A lone, wilting peace lily sat on the desk, a silent testament to Bea's neglected attempts at office decor, its pale blossoms a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos surrounding it.  This year, however, the chaos felt different; heavier.  A sense of unease, as sharp and unsettling as a misplaced decimal point, hung in the air.
