The biting wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, a song Silas Blackwood knew intimately.  He wasn't a man to be sentimental about trees, not really, but even he felt a pang of something akin to respect as he surveyed the behemoth looming before him.  It was a monster of a cedar, easily five centuries old, its bark a tapestry of lichen and age, its crown lost in the swirling grey mist that clung to the slopes of Mount Rainier like a shroud.  Silas ran a calloused hand over the worn handle of his axe, the familiar weight a comfort in the bleak, pre-dawn light of the Cascade Mountains.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ a constant companion in his line of work.  This morning, however, the blood was his own, a slow, stubborn trickle from a gash on his forearm, a testament to yesterday's miscalculation with a rogue branch.  He ignored it, focusing instead on the task at hand: felling the titan before him, and earning his keep in the unforgiving wilderness.
