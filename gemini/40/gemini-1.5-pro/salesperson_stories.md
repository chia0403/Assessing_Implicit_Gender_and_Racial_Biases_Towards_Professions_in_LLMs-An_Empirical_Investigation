The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Motel" cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17.  It was the kind of night that smelled of wet pavement and desperation, the kind of night Eleanor Vance thrived in.  Eleanor, full name Eleanor Rose Vance, clutched her briefcase tighter, the cheap vinyl sticking to her damp palms.  Inside, nestled amongst brochures and order forms for Miracle Mop, the revolutionary self-wringing cleaning marvel, was a half-eaten ham sandwich and a thermos of lukewarm coffee, her dinner.  She'd been driving for six hours straight, chasing a lead on a potential distributor in Nowheresville, Arizona, a town so small it wasn't even on most maps.  The motel, with its peeling paint and flickering vacancy sign, was the only sign of civilization for miles.  Eleanor, never one to be deterred by a little (or a lot of) grime, squared her shoulders and marched towards the dimly lit office, a determined glint in her eye.  This sale, she vowed, was going to happen.
