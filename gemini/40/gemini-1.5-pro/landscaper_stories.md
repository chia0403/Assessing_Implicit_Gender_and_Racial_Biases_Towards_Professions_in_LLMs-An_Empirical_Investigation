The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s braid against her cheek as she surveyed the frost-covered expanse of the Hemlock Estate.  Dawn was just beginning to paint the iron-grey sky with strokes of bruised purple, and the air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and impending snow. Hemlock Estate, nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains, was a relic of a bygone era, all crumbling stone walls, overgrown gardens, and a sprawling, gothic mansion that seemed to sigh with every gust of wind.  Mia, bundled in her warmest layers, stamped her feet to ward off the chill, her breath clouding the air before her. This was her biggest job yet – restoring the estate’s neglected gardens to their former glory – and as she gazed at the daunting task ahead, a flicker of both excitement and trepidation danced in her dark eyes.  The contract stipulated a strict deadline, just before the grand reopening gala in the spring.  It was ambitious, borderline insane, considering the state of the grounds, but Mia had a reputation for coaxing life back into even the most stubborn of landscapes.  And Hemlock Estate, with its secrets buried beneath layers of tangled ivy and forgotten roses, was certainly stubborn.
