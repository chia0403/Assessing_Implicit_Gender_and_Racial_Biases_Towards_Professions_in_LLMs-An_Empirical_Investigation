The siren's wail was a banshee's scream, slicing through the thick, humid Charleston night. Rain lashed against the windshield of Medic 1, blurring the already hazy glow of sodium streetlights reflecting off slick cobblestones. Inside,  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, a paramedic with Charleston County EMS, tightened her grip on the grab bar as the ambulance lurched around a corner, its tires spitting a rooster tail of water. The radio crackled to life, the dispatcherâ€™s voice strained and urgent. "Medic 1, we're getting reports of multiple victims, possible explosion at the Charleston City Market. Be advised, possible structural instability." Amy swallowed hard, the knot of anticipation tightening in her stomach. The historic market, a sprawling labyrinth of vendor stalls and wrought-iron gates, was a beloved Charleston landmark. Now, judging by the thick black smoke churning in the distance, it was becoming something else entirely.  A disaster zone.
