The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  Fluorescent lights spilled out from the Emergency Room entrance, painting a stark rectangle of sterile brightness against the inky pre-dawn sky of rural Vermont.  November had arrived with a vengeance, blanketing the Green Mountains in a premature layer of snow and ice that crunched under Amy’s boots.  She pulled her thick fleece tighter around her, the cold seeping through her scrubs despite the multiple layers underneath. The digital clock on the hospital’s brick facade blinked 5:58 AM.  Two minutes to the start of another twelve-hour shift, and already Amy could feel the familiar knot of anticipation tightening in her stomach.  It wasn't the workload that worried her, not exactly.  It was the unsettling quiet that had settled over the small town in recent weeks, a silence broken only by the whisper of the wind and a creeping sense of unease that clung to the valley like the early morning fog.
