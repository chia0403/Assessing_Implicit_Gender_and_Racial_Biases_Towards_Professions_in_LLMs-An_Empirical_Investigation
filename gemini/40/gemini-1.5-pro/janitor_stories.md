The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed a mournful tune, the only sound accompanying Ezekiel "Zeke" Holloway as he pushed his mop bucket down the sterile hallway.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour for janitors, when the day shift's mess became his responsibility and the secrets of the scientists he served lay exposed in discarded notes and half-empty coffee cups.  Zenith BioTech, perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic, was a fortress of gleaming glass and steel, a monument to human ingenuity and, Zeke suspected, hubris.  Tonight, however, the futuristic sheen was dulled by a thin layer of sea spray that clung to the windows like a ghostly shroud, reflecting the unsettling quiet in the usually humming labs.  Even the rhythmic swoosh of Zeke's mop against the polished floor seemed to amplify the silence, a silence broken only by the distant, rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below.
