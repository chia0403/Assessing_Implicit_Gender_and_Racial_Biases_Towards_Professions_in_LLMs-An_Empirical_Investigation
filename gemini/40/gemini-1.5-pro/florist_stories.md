The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthington's shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and humid, the kind of heat that wilted everything but the hardiest of blooms. Inside, however, a cool, fragrant oasis thrived.  Eliza Jane, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, meticulously arranged a cascade of blushing bride protea and fragrant jasmine vine, her brow furrowed in concentration. Petal & Plume, tucked away on a cobbled side street just off the bustling city market, was her sanctuary, a riot of color and scent that echoed the vibrant, chaotic beauty of Eliza Jane's own soul.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air amongst hanging glass terrariums filled with air plants and miniature orchids.  The walls, painted a soothing shade of sage green, were adorned with vintage botanical prints and framed pressed flowers, each a testament to Eliza Jane's passion and artistry.  This morning, however, a different kind of bloom was about to disrupt the tranquility of Petal & Plume.
