The biting wind whipped across Lake Champlain, sending icy spray stinging against Amelia Hayesâ€™ cheeks. She tugged her wool scarf tighter, the damp fabric clinging uncomfortably to her skin.

It was 7:45 pm, fifteen minutes before the end of her shift, and all Amelia wanted was a hot cup of tea and the blessed warmth of her small apartment.  But the waiting room was still surprisingly full, a testament to the flu season that had descended upon the town like a plague of biblical proportions.
