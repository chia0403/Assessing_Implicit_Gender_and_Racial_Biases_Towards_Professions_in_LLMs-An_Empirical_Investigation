The recycled air hung heavy with the scent of reheated breakfast and something vaguely floral, likely emanating from the duty-free perfume spritzed liberally by a passenger three rows back.  Amelia Rose Clark, her smile plastered on as firmly as the safety instructions card in the seat pocket, surveyed the cabin of Air Aurora flight 117.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over the Alaskan wilderness was a bruised indigo, the serrated peaks of the Chugach Mountains just beginning to catch the first blush of sunrise.  The plane, a slightly aging Boeing 737, hummed with a low thrum, a mechanical lullaby against the backdrop of restless murmurs and the occasional clink of a plastic cup. This was Amelia's third red-eye in a row, and the exhaustion was starting to settle in her bones like a deep-seated ache.  She longed for the familiarity of her Seattle apartment, the comforting weight of her cat curled up on her lap, and the blessed silence of a world untouched by crying babies and demanding passengers.  Little did she know, the silence she craved was about to be shattered in a way she could never have imagined.
