The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Amelia Finch as she wrestled Mrs. Hawthorne’s dustbins to the kerb.  Greystone Manor loomed behind her, a gothic monstrosity clinging to the cliff edge like a petrified gargoyle.  Its leaded windows, reflecting the bruised sky, seemed to watch her every move.  Below, the churning North Sea gnawed at the shingle beach, a constant, restless growl accompanying the screech of gulls.  Agnes tucked a loose strand of greying hair behind her ear, the cold stinging her cheeks.  Greystone, with its echoing corridors and perpetual gloom, was a lonely place to work, but it was home, or as close to home as she’d known in a long time.  And besides,  Mrs. Hawthorne, for all her eccentricities, paid well.  And in a village like Port Blossom, clinging precariously to the Yorkshire coast, well-paying jobs were rarer than a sunny day.
