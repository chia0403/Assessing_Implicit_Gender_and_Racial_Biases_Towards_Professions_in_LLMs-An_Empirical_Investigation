The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the Northwood High parking lot, clutching her thermos of lukewarm coffee like a lifeline.  Flakes of snow, fat and wet, began to plaster themselves to her windshield, mirroring the clinging fatigue that shadowed her hazel eyes. Northwood, a sprawling, brick behemoth of a building, loomed before her, radiating the dull hum of adolescent energy even before the first bell.  Nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside, the school was a world unto itself, a microcosm of teenage hopes, anxieties, and the ever-present scent of stale pizza and floor wax.  Today, that microcosm felt particularly oppressive, as the impending Thanksgiving break hung in the air, a tantalizing promise of rest that felt just out of reach.  Eleanor sighed, the plume of her breath momentarily obscuring the faded "Go Wildcats!" banner draped across the main entrance.  Another Monday.  Another week.
