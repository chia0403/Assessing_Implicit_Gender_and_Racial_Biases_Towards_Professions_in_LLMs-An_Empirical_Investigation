The rusty squeak of the screen door announced another sweltering afternoon in Harmony Creek, Alabama. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom of Floyd's Barber Shop, illuminating the worn leather of the barber chairs and the myriad of half-empty tonic bottles lining the mirrored wall.  Elias Walker Finch, a man whose neatly trimmed mustache seemed at odds with the general disarray of his surroundings, sighed and wiped a bead of sweat from his brow.  Harmony Creek hadn't seen a boom since the cotton gin closed down in '58, and most days, Floyd's saw more flies than customers.  Elias adjusted his own starched white barber's jacket, a vestige of a more prosperous time, and waited. The rhythmic whir of the ceiling fan and the drone of cicadas outside were the only sounds accompanying the slow, inevitable creep of the afternoon.
