The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles, tugging at the hem of his worn Carhartt jacket.  Above him, the skeletal branches of a sycamore clawed at the bruised purple sky, mirroring the tangled mess of wires he was currently wrestling with. Elias, perched precariously on the top rung of his aluminum ladder, squinted through the gathering gloom at the dilapidated Victorian mansion looming over him.

Built in 1888 by a reclusive industrialist, it had stood empty for the better part of a decade, slowly succumbing to the ravages of time and neglect. Now, bathed in the preternatural twilight, its stained-glass windows gleaming like the eyes of a predatory beast, it awaited Elias’s touch to bring it back from the darkness.  He had been hired to rewire the entire place, a daunting task, but one that offered a hefty paycheck – a paycheck Elias desperately needed. The air crackled with static, not just from the approaching storm, but from something else, something older, something that seemed to emanate from the house itself.  A shiver crawled up Elias’s spine, a feeling that had nothing to do with the cold.
