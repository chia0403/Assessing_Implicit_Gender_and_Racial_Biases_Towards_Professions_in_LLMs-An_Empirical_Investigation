The rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her newest patient.  Her consulting room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic district of Ashwood, Massachusetts, usually exuded calm.  The scent of old books mingled with the faint aroma of the Earl Grey tea she perpetually brewed, and a cheerful fire crackled in the hearth even in summer, casting flickering shadows on the Persian rug and the worn leather armchair where her patients sat. But tonight, the storm outside seemed to amplify the tension radiating from the young man hunched in that very chair, his face pale in the firelight.  He hadn't spoken a word since arriving, his gaze fixed on a knot in the antique wooden floorboards. Dr. Vance, however, was patient.  She knew that sometimes, the loudest stories were told in silence.
