The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois as she stood on the fire escape of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre, a cigarette clenched between her teeth.  Ash danced on the wind, mirroring the swirling flakes of the first snow of the season. Below her, the grimy alley reeked of stale beer and forgotten dreams, a fitting aroma for the current state of her career.  The Grand Majestic, once the glittering jewel of New Bedford's theatrical scene, was now more moth-eaten velvet than majestic.  Paint peeled from the ornate facade, the once-grand marquee displaying only a few flickering, burnt-out bulbs.  Esme, in her worn leather jacket and paint-splattered jeans, looked as faded and forgotten as the theatre itself. But inside, beneath layers of dust and neglect, flickered a spark of hope, ignited by the script clutched in her gloved hand â€“ a script she believed could bring the Grand Majestic, and herself, back to life.
