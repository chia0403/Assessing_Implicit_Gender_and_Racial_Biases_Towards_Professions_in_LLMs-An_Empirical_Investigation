Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic apartment, mimicking the frantic drumming of her fingertips on the worn oak desk. Outside, the Parisian twilight bled into the inky sky, the Eiffel Tower a skeletal silhouette against the bruised canvas. Inside, the only light came from a battered brass lamp, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames in the fireplace. Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, chewed on the end of a pen, her brow furrowed in concentration. Scattered around her, amidst stacks of manuscripts and overflowing ashtrays, lay the remnants of a lukewarm cup of coffee and a half-eaten baguette. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, cigarette smoke, and the faintest hint of Chanel No. 5. This cramped, chaotic space was Amelia Thorne's sanctuary, her battlefield, her life's work â€“ the editorial office of "La Plume de Fer," one of Paris's most prestigious, yet perpetually struggling, literary journals.
