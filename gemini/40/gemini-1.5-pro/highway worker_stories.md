The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of Highway 17, whistling a mournful tune through the cracked asphalt.  Dust devils danced across the scrubby, ochre-colored landscape, momentarily obscuring the distant, shimmering heat haze rising from the Mojave Desert floor.  Elijah "Eli" Cartwright squinted against the glare, the harsh sun reflecting off the chrome orange barrels lining the closed lane.  He tugged the brim of his fluorescent yellow hardhat lower, his weathered face a roadmap of sun exposure and long days spent battling the elements.  A worn leather work glove clutched a half-eaten ham sandwich, the other rested on the handle of a shovel propped against the open door of his orange Department of Transportation pickup truck. Eli, a man of few words and even fewer complaints, surveyed the stretch of highway before him â€“ a ribbon of grey cutting through a landscape that seemed determined to reclaim it.  A tumbleweed, the size of a small dog, bounced across the road, momentarily halting traffic in the open lane as a lone sedan cautiously navigated around it.  This was Eli's kingdom, a sun-baked, windswept stretch of highway he knew better than the lines on his calloused palms.  And today, his kingdom held a secret.
