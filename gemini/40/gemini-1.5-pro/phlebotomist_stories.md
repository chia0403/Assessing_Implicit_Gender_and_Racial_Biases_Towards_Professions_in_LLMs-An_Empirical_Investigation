The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping of IV monitors.  Eleanor Vance, a phlebotomist with ten years of experience and a perpetually tired smile, pushed her cart along the polished linoleum floor of the Oncology ward.  The air, thick with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant and the subtler, cloying scent of illness, clung to the back of her throat.  6:00 AM.  The pre-dawn gloom clung to the corners of the long hallway, chased back only by the harsh, artificial glow overhead. Eleanor adjusted the lavender lanyard holding her ID badge, the small silver caduceus cool against her skin.  Today was Wednesday, which meant double rounds on Oncology and Pediatrics.  Eleanor sighed, the small puff of air barely disturbing the sterile stillness.  She steeling herself for another day of needles, nervous smiles, and the quiet bravery of the patients behind those closed doors.  Room 302. Mrs. Peterson.  Eleanor took a deep breath and tapped lightly on the door.
