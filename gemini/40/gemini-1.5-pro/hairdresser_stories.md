The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" cast a lurid, amethyst glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street. Inside, amidst the chemical tang of perms and the rhythmic snip of scissors, Beatrice "Bea"  Fitzwilliam surveyed her domain.  It wasn't much – a cramped salon sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's – but it was hers.  The chipped porcelain sinks, the slightly off-key radio tuned to Smooth Jazz 107.9, even the persistent drip from the leaky faucet in the back room, all bore witness to Bea's decade-long reign as the self-proclaimed Queen of Sycamore Street curls. Tonight, however, the usual hum of hairdryers and gossip was replaced by an unsettling quiet.  The only other person in the salon was Mrs. Henderson, her blue rinse solidifying under the dryer, blissfully oblivious to the creeping unease that pricked at the back of Bea’s neck.  Outside, the wind howled, rattling the salon’s single, rain-streaked window.  It sounded, Bea thought, almost like a scream.
