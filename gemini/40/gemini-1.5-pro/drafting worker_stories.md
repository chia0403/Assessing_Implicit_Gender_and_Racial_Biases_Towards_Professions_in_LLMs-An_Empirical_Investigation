The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Drafting office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' life for the past seven years.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled against the glass panes of the twenty-seventh floor, a mournful symphony in stark contrast to the stale, recirculated air within.  Amelia, hunched over a sprawling blueprint of a proposed shopping mall in Naperville, meticulously traced the outline of a fountain with her drafting pen, the nib scratching lightly against the vellum.  Her brow was furrowed in concentration, a faint smudge of graphite dust staining her cheek. The office was a hive of quiet industry: the click-clack of keyboards, the rustle of tracing paper, the low murmur of conversations.  The only splashes of color in the otherwise grey landscape were the vibrant hues of the architectural renderings pinned to the corkboard walls, silent promises of gleaming steel and glass structures yet to rise from the earth.  It was a Tuesday, just like any other Tuesday, and Amelia expected nothing more than the usual monotony.  She was wrong.
