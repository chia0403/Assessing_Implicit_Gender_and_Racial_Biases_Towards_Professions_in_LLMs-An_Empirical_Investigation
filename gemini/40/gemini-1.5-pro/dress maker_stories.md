The clatter of horse-drawn carriages against cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares drifted up to the attic window of Mademoiselle Elodie Beaumont's dressmaking atelier.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale November sunlight that filtered through the grimy panes, illuminating the chaos of her workspace.  Swatches of silk and velvet spilled from overflowing baskets, half-finished gowns draped over dress forms like ghostly apparitions, and a mountain of pins shimmered precariously on a tilted cushion.  Elodie, perched on a stool with her needle flashing, hummed a mournful tune as she meticulously stitched the final pearl onto the bodice of a wedding gown.  The air in the small, cramped space was thick with the scent of lavender and the faint, metallic tang of blood from a pricked finger.  Outside, the year 1888 was drawing to a close in the fog-wreathed streets of Whitechapel, London, oblivious to the storm brewing within Elodie's heart, a storm far more dangerous than the chilling November air.
