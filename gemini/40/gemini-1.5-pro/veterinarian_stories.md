The biting wind whipped off the churning slate-grey waters of Puget Sound, stinging Dr. Amelia Hayes’s cheeks as she hurried across the rain-slicked deck of the ferry. The salt spray, a constant companion in these parts, plastered damp tendrils of her auburn hair to her forehead.  Around her, the other passengers huddled deeper into their coats, a mix of weary commuters and tourists clutching maps of the San Juan Islands. Amelia, however, felt a familiar thrill of anticipation.  She was returning to Orcas Island, a verdant emerald jewel nestled amongst the archipelago, and more specifically, to her small, perpetually chaotic veterinary clinic in the heart of Eastsound village.  The ferry’s horn blared a mournful bellow, signalling its imminent arrival, and Amelia adjusted the worn leather satchel slung across her shoulder. Inside, nestled among her well-thumbed copies of veterinary texts, was a small, hand-carved wooden owl, a comforting reminder of the island, and the life she’d built there, waiting for her.
