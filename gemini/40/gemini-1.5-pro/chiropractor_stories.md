Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the dull ache in his own lower back. The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center," proclaimed the frosted glass of the door, the elegant script at odds with the peeling paint of the window frame. Located on the edge of Oakhaven, a sleepy town nestled amidst the rolling hills of western Massachusetts, the clinic was usually a haven of calm. But tonight, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old Victorian house that housed Elias's practice and apartment.  Inside, the waiting room was empty, the magazines on the coffee table curling at the edges from the damp air seeping in through the drafty window. Elias, a tall man with tired, kind eyes and hands that knew the language of bones and muscles, stood at the window, watching the storm rage.  He'd been expecting his last patient an hour ago, a new client he couldn't quite place, a name he couldn't quite recall.  And that, more than the storm, was what was unsettling him.
