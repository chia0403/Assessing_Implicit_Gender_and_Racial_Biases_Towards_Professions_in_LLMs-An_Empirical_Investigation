The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Blake law offices hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a paralegal.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Chicago, blurring the already fading twilight into a smudged grey canvas.  Thirty-two stories below, the city lights reflected in the slick streets, creating a shimmering, distorted mirror of the towering skyscrapers. Amelia, hunched over a mountain of discovery documents for a particularly nasty patent infringement case, rubbed her tired eyes.  The faint scent of burnt coffee clung to the air, a testament to Mr. Henderson's perpetually overflowing mug. It was 6:47 pm on a Friday, and Amelia was the only one left in the office, save for the security guard making his rounds. The silence, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the hum of the lights, was a welcome change from the usual cacophony of ringing phones and chattering lawyers.  But tonight, the quiet feltâ€¦different.  Heavier.  Almost expectant.
