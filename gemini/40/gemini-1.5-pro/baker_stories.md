The aroma of burnt sugar and simmering apricots hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that clung to Elina Thistlewick like flour dust to her apron.  Elina, her brown hair escaping its braid and plastered to her forehead with a sheen of perspiration, swore softly under her breath as she yanked the scorched apricot tart from the oven.  Dawn painted the sky in hues of bruised plum and burnt orange over the sleepy village of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the whispering Redwood National Park. Thistlewick's Bakery, a charmingly ramshackle building with crooked eaves and a paint-peeling sign depicting a cheerfully plump loaf of bread, was the first establishment to stir in the pre-dawn quiet.  Inside, amidst the comforting chaos of flour-dusted surfaces, mismatched mixing bowls, and the rhythmic whir of the ancient stand mixer, Elina battled a particularly stubborn batch of pastry. This wasn't just any pastry; it was for the annual Oakhaven Autumn Festival, and Elina, as the village's sole baker, carried the weight of the entire village's sweet tooth on her capable, if slightly flour-covered, shoulders.
