The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's High School parking lot, carrying with it the scent of decaying leaves and faint strains of the marching band's relentless practice.  A lone figure, Amelia "Amy" Catherine Rios, stood at the edge of the field, her breath clouding the air.  Her worn varsity jacket, emblazoned with the faded snarling wolf of the St. Jude's Timberwolves, did little to ward off the chill.  Amy, the head coach of the girls' soccer team, watched as the last rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange, a stark contrast to the grey monotony that had settled over the small town of Oakhaven, Indiana.  This was her fourth season, and despite the team's consistently mediocre performance, Amy still felt a flicker of hope ignite within her every time she stepped onto the field. This year, something felt different. This year, she could almost taste victory.
