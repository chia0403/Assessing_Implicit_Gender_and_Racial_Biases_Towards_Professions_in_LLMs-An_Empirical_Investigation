Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's atelier, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Parisian Saint-Germain-des-Prés.  Her studio, nestled above a bustling boulangerie, was a sanctuary of plush velvets, antique furniture draped in dust sheets, and overflowing mood boards pinned with swatches of silk and linen.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax polish and Gen's signature Earl Grey tea, usually vibrated with creative energy.  But today, a strange stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the faint crackling of the dying fire in the ornate fireplace.  Gen, her fiery red hair pulled back in a loose chignon, sat perched on a velvet-upholstered stool, staring intently at a blank canvas propped on an easel.  This wasn’t a literal canvas, but a metaphorical one – the reimagining of a grand apartment overlooking the Seine, a project that had unexpectedly stalled, leaving her feeling as blank as the primed surface before her.
