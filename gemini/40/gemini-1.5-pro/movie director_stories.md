Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Valeria "Val" Reyes' Malibu cliffside home, blurring the usually spectacular Pacific view into a swirling grey canvas.  The salt spray, whipped into a frenzy by the gale, stung against the glass like a thousand tiny fists. Inside, the opulent living room, usually bathed in California sunshine, felt oppressive, shadowed in the pre-dawn gloom. Val, still in her silk pyjamas, paced the length of a Navajo rug, the rhythmic tap of her bare feet a counterpoint to the storm's roar. Her latest film, a gritty neo-noir thriller titled "City of Angels, City of Devils," had premiered just three days ago to… less than stellar reviews.  The phone call from her agent, Michael, still echoed in her ears – a polite yet devastating post-mortem of the film's critical mauling and disappointing box office opening.  Val, a woman who had built her reputation on crafting visually stunning and emotionally complex narratives, now found herself staring into the abyss of a potential career implosion. The salty air tasted like failure.
