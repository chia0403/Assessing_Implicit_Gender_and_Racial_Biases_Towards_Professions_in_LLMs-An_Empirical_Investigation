The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles, tugging at the hem of his long coat as he hurried down Cobblestone Lane.  Gas lamps flickered weakly against the encroaching November dusk, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the swaying branches of the bare sycamores lining the street.  Athersby, a port town perpetually cloaked in a salty mist, held a damp chill in the air that seeped into the very bones. Elias clutched his worn leather satchel tighter, the precious contents – a bolt of emerald green silk destined for Lady Beatrice Ainsworth’s winter ball gown – a comforting weight against his side.  His shop, "Thorne & Needle," nestled between a fishmonger and a rather dubious apothecary, was just a few more paces down the lane, a beacon of warm, inviting light against the gathering gloom.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting glow seemed tinged with an unsettling flicker, and a prickle of unease settled at the nape of Elias's neck.
