Rain lashed against the windows of the converted Victorian townhouse, blurring the sodium glow of the streetlights into hazy halos.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the walls lined with anatomical charts and children's drawings.  Eleanor "Ellie" Grace Hawthorne, a registered occupational therapist, sat perched on a velvet-covered armchair, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reviewed the file spread across her lap.  The scent of woodsmoke and cinnamon tea filled the air of her home office, a comforting contrast to the storm raging outside.  Ellie’s practice, “Hawthorne House Therapies,” specialized in helping children with sensory processing disorders, and tonight’s case was proving particularly perplexing.  Seven-year-old Leo Davies, according to his mother's frantic notes, had become increasingly withdrawn, exhibiting extreme sensitivity to touch and sound, coupled with an alarming fascination for spinning objects. Ellie tapped a pen against her teeth, the rhythmic click a small counterpoint to the drumming rain. Something about Leo's case tugged at her, a feeling she couldn't quite articulate, a sense of familiarity that went beyond professional curiosity.
