The flickering neon sign of the "Starlight Diner" cast a greasy, purple glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17.  Inside, a lone waitress wiped down the counter with a weary sigh, the only sound competing with the rhythmic hiss of the antiquated coffee machine. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, whipping the rain against the windows like icy fingers.  This desolate stretch of road, somewhere between Nowhere, Nevada and Even Less, California, was where Elias Thorne, a wiry man with perpetually grease-stained fingertips and eyes that held the distant reflection of a thousand vacuum tubes, had chosen to make his stand.  His radio repair shop, "Thorne's Transmissions,"  a cramped shack tucked behind the diner, was his kingdom, a chaotic symphony of wires, resistors, and half-disassembled radios, each humming with a ghostly energy only he seemed to understand. Tonight, however, the usual static hum was punctuated by something else â€“ a faint, rhythmic pulsing, like a heartbeat from the far reaches of the cosmos.
