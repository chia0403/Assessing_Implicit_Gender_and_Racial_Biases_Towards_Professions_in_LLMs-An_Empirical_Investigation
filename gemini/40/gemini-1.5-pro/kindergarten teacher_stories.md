The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, occasionally punctuated by the frantic buzz of a trapped fly against the windowpane.  Sunshine, weak and watery from a November sky, struggled to penetrate the grime clinging to the outside, casting the room in a perpetual twilight. Rainbow-painted cardboard letters, slightly curled at the edges, drooped from the ceiling like wilting flower petals. Tiny chairs, each bearing the sticky residue of countless juice boxes and glue sticks, were haphazardly arranged around a low, circular table. Mrs. Vance, her normally bright blue eyes shadowed with fatigue, surveyed the scene with a sigh. It was Monday morning at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a town where the biggest excitement was the annual pumpkin pie contest at the county fair.  And this Monday, a particular Monday just two weeks shy of Thanksgiving, felt heavier than most.
