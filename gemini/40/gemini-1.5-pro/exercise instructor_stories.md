The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the Art Deco buildings into shimmering mirages.  Salt spray hung in the air, a tangible reminder of the turquoise expanse just beyond the palm trees.  Inside the sun-drenched studio of "Body By Beatriz," the air thrummed with a different kind of energy.  A pulsing bass line reverberated through the polished wooden floors, fueling the pre-class buzz.  Beatriz "Bea" Rodriguez, her dark hair pulled back in a high ponytail that swayed with her every movement, adjusted the microphone clipped to her neon pink tank top.  Her smile, bright as the hibiscus flowers blooming outside, didn't quite reach her eyes, which held a flicker of apprehension she hoped none of her devoted clients would notice.  This wasn't just any Thursday morning Zumba class. This was the day her life was supposed to change.
