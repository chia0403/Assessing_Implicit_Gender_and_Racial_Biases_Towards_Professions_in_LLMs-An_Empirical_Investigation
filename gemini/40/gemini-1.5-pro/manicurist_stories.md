The insistent buzz of the electric file grated on Elina Petrova's nerves, a counterpoint to the soothing spa music tinkling from the hidden speakers.  The Peach Blossom Nail Spa, tucked between a dry cleaner and a pho restaurant in the bustling heart of Little Saigon, Orange County, usually hummed with the chatter of women, the scent of acetone and sweet almond oil a constant presence. But it was a Tuesday morning, a lull before the lunchtime rush, and the only other person in the salon was Mrs. Nguyen, the owner, dozing lightly behind her beaded curtain at the cash register.  Elina meticulously shaped a client's acrylics, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the California sun beat down on Bolsa Avenue, casting long shadows through the salon's large front window. A faded poster advertising a Lunar New Year celebration from two years ago still clung to the glass, a testament to the passage of time and the relentless churn of life in this vibrant corner of Southern California.
