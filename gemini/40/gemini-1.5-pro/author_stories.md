The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Her fingers, stiff with cold despite the thick wool gloves, gripped the railing of the small ferry connecting the mainland to the isolated island of Ailsa Craig.  Famous for its granite quarries and its teeming gannet colonies, Ailsa Craig was usually bustling with bird watchers and geologists during the summer months.  But in late November, with winter's icy breath already clinging to the air, Amelia was the only passenger braving the crossing.  She'd come seeking solitude, a place where the constant hum of London, the deadlines, and the whispers about her last novel couldn't reach her.
