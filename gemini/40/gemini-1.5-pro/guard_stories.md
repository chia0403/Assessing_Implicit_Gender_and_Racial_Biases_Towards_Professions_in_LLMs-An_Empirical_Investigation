The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and turning his breath into fleeting ghosts.  He pulled his thick wool cloak tighter around him, the rough fabric scratching against the worn leather of his jerkin. Above, the bruised purple sky threatened snow.  Elias patrolled the western ramparts of Castle Drakon, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains looming behind him like slumbering giants.  The castle itself, a sprawling edifice of black stone that seemed to claw its way out of the mountainside, was eerily silent at this late hour.  Only the rhythmic crunch of Elias' boots on the frost-covered stone and the distant howl of the wind broke the stillness.  He gripped the hilt of his longsword, the cold steel a familiar comfort against his gloved hand.  Something felt wrong.  The usual nocturnal rustlings of the forest below were absent, replaced by an unnerving quiet.
