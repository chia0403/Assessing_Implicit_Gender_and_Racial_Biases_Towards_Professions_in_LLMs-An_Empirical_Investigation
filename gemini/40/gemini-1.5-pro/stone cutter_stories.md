The biting wind whipped off the Tyrwhitt Peaks, carrying the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of snow.  Elias Thorne, his calloused hands tucked deep in his wool-lined pockets, surveyed the granite cliff face looming before him. The setting sun painted the sheer rock in hues of burnt orange and deep violet, the last gasp of warmth before the long, frigid night settled over the valley.  Elias's breath plumed white in the air, mirroring the wisps of snow clinging precariously to the jagged edges of the cliff. His quarry, nestled high above the timberline, was a vein of Starstone, a mineral prized for its ethereal luminescence and legendary durability.  The village of Oakhaven, nestled far below in the valley's embrace, depended on Elias and his craft.  Their hearths, their tools, even the cobblestones beneath their feet - all bore the mark of his chisel. This next cut, however, was unlike any he'd attempted before.  The Starstone vein, thicker than any he'd seen, promised not just prosperity, but something far more ancient and powerful.
