The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the "Skyreach Tower," whistling a mournful tune through the exposed steel beams.  Fifty stories below, the city of Chicago hummed with oblivious life, a tapestry of yellow cabs and hurried pedestrians dwarfed by the structure Elias Vance was helping to build.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, tightened the harness securing him to a girder two hundred feet above ground.  He wasn’t afraid of heights – he’d been scaling scaffolding since he was old enough to walk alongside his father, a veteran bricklayer – but the wind today had a particularly nasty bite, a prelude to the brutal winter that was fast approaching.  He adjusted his hard hat, the brim dusted with a fine layer of frost, and squinted at the blueprint clutched in his gloved hand.  The installation of the east-facing curtain wall was behind schedule, and foreman Miller had made it abundantly clear that no one was going home early until they caught up.  Elias sighed, the sound lost in the wind's howl.  This was going to be a long day.
