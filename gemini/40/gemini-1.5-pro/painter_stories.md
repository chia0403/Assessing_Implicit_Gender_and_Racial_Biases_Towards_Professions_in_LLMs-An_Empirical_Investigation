The biting November wind whipped at the edges of Eliza Jane Holloway's easel, threatening to tear the canvas from its moorings and send it spiraling down the cliffs towards the churning, iron-grey sea.  Perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Eliza ignored the chill seeping through her worn woolen coat and the stinging spray of saltwater misting her face.  She was captivated. The tumultuous meeting of sky and water, the bruised purple and slate grey hues swirling together, the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged, basalt cliffs â€“ it was a symphony of chaos and beauty she was desperate to capture.  Her paintbrush danced across the canvas, laying down thick strokes of cobalt and titanium white, trying to translate the raw energy of the ocean onto the pristine surface.  The tiny fishing village of Port Lorne, nestled in the cove below, looked like a scattering of brightly painted toy houses from her vantage point, their cheerful colours a stark contrast to the brooding drama of the seascape unfolding before her.
