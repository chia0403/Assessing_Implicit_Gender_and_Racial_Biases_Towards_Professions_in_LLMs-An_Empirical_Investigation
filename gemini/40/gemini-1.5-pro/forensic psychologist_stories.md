The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he climbed the steps of the grand, yet decaying, Blackwood Manor. Gargoyles perched precariously on the eaves, their granite faces seeming to sneer at him.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots, the sound amplified by the unnatural silence that blanketed the sprawling estate. Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the frost-bitten hills of the Peak District, had been the scene of an unspeakable tragedy just weeks before. A triple homicide, the local papers called it, whispering of a family curse and a history steeped in darkness. Elias, however, dealt in facts, not folklore.  He pulled his collar higher, the icy air stinging his cheeks.  He was here to unravel the psychology behind the violence, to piece together the fractured narrative etched in blood and silence within those forbidding walls.  The Derbyshire Constabulary had requested his expertise, admitting they were baffled.  And baffled, Elias knew, was a dangerous state of mind when dealing with the human abyss.
