The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Periwinkle's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, occasionally punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of the plastic clock above the whiteboard.  It was a Friday afternoon in late October at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of Vermont.  Crimson and gold leaves peeked through the large windows, framing a view of the rolling Green Mountains, now dusted with the first hints of snow. The air inside, however, was thick with the sweet scent of crayon wax and the restless energy of second graders anticipating the weekend.  Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose spirit was as bright as her sunflower-yellow cardigan, surveyed the room.  Scattered construction paper pumpkins, lopsided ghosts fashioned from cotton balls, and glittery spiderwebs adorned every surface, evidence of the week's Halloween festivities.  Despite the impending chaos of dismissal, a sense of warmth permeated the room, a testament to Mrs. Periwinkle's ability to create a space where both learning and laughter flourished.
