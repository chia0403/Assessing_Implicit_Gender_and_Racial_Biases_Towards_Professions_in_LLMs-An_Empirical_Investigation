The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his tweed cap and sending fallen sycamore leaves swirling like dervishes across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  The grand, gothic pile loomed above him, its many windows gleaming darkly in the late afternoon light, like the eyes of some watchful beast. Elias, his weathered face etched with the lines of a life spent outdoors, adjusted the heavy sack of tulip bulbs slung over his shoulder and surveyed his domain.  Blackwood Manor's gardens, his responsibility and his refuge, stretched for acres, a tapestry of formal flowerbeds, ancient topiary, and sprawling woodland, all nestled within the rolling Derbyshire hills. Winter was closing in, its icy fingers already reaching for the vibrant hues of autumn, but for Elias, the changing seasons were simply another chapter in the endless story of the gardens, a story he knew intimately and loved deeply.  This year, however, a different story was beginning to unfold, a story whispered on the wind, carried on the rustling leaves, and hinted at in the shadowed corners of the manor itself.  A story that had nothing to do with roses or rhododendrons, but everything to do with secrets and shadows.
