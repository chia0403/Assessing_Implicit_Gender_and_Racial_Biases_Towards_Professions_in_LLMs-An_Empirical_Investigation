The salt spray kissed Amelia "Millie" Hawthorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Cornish coast her constant companion.  Her cottage, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, was a haphazard collection of stone and slate, clinging to the earth as if afraid the wind might snatch it away.  Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic tick of a grandfather clock inherited from her grandmother and the frantic tap-tap-tapping of Millieâ€™s fingers on the keys of her ancient typewriter.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the tempest brewing within her own mind.  The deadline for her third novel, a gothic thriller set in the very landscape that unfolded before her, loomed like a storm cloud, and the words, usually so readily available, remained stubbornly elusive.  October had descended upon Portwenn, bringing with it not only the biting wind and relentless rain, but also a pervasive sense of unease that seeped into Millie's bones and mirrored the growing darkness in the manuscript before her.
