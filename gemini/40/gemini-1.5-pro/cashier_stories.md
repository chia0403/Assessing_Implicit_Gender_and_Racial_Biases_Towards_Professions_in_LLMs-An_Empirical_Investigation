Amelia, with her nametag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, chewed thoughtfully on the end of a purple pen, her gaze fixed on the rhythmic sweep of the windshield wipers of the lone car parked at the gas pumps.  It was 3:17 am in the desolate town of Harmony Creek, population 842, and the only sound besides the rain and the hum was the gentle whir of the slushie machine churning its icy concoctions in a rainbow of artificial flavors.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and something vaguely chemical, like floor cleaner mixed with desperation.
