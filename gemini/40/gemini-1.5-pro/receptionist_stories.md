The chipped porcelain flamingo perched precariously on the corner of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's desk vibrated with the insistent buzzing of the main phone line.  It was 7:58 am, two minutes before Hawthorne and Finch, Attorneys at Law officially opened, but the calls always started early.  Amelia, already settled behind her mahogany desk in a crisp, cornflower blue dress, sighed and pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The office, located on the fifth floor of a slightly dilapidated Art Deco building in downtown Los Angeles, was still bathed in the cool pre-dawn light filtering through the expansive, arched windows.  Dust motes danced in the muted beams, illuminating the faint scent of stale coffee and lemon polish that perpetually hung in the air.  Outside, the city was slowly waking, a symphony of distant car horns and the clatter of early morning deliveries beginning to build.  But within the hushed confines of Hawthorne and Finch, only the relentless trilling of the phone hinted at the chaos soon to descend.
