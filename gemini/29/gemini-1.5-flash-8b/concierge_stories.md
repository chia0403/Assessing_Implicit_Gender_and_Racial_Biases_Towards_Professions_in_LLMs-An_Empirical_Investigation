The flickering neon sign of the "Grand Zenith Hotel" cast a lurid, emerald glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Rue des Étoiles.  A single, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the ancient stone beneath Amelia Seraphina Dubois's feet as she adjusted the crimson velvet lining of her concierge uniform.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and exotic spices drifting from the nearby market stalls, vibrated with the low, rhythmic pulse of the city – a symphony of sirens, clanging trams, and hushed whispers.  Amelia, her perfectly sculpted eyebrows arched in a thoughtful frown, surveyed the scene.  The hotel, a towering monument to opulence and faded grandeur, stood sentinel over the chaotic Parisian alleyways, its imposing façade a stark contrast to the restless energy of the night.  Tonight, a storm brewed not just in the sky, but within the very heart of the Grand Zenith.  A renowned opera star, Madame Evangeline Delacroix, was due to arrive in the morning.  Her arrival was not just an event, but a carefully orchestrated performance in itself, and Amelia, as the hotel's foremost concierge, was tasked with ensuring every note was flawlessly executed.
