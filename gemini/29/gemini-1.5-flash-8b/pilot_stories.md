The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she wrestled the controls of the 'Crimson Comet,' a vintage biplane patched together from scavenged parts and stubborn hope.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Azure Mountains clawed at a bruised, twilight sky.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling with the echoes of a forgotten war.  The year was 1938.  Ash, pilot extraordinaire and self-proclaimed guardian of the Sky Trails, traced a course across the vast, uncharted territories of the western United States.  She was a solitary figure, her only company the whispering wind and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.  Today's mission: deliver a coded message to the hidden outpost of Skyhaven, a secret haven for the disenfranchised and the forgotten.  This wasn't just about a message; it was about hope, a flickering flame in a world growing darker with each passing day.
