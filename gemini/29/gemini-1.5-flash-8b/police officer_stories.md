Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Precinct 13 station, mimicking the relentless drumming in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's head.  The air, thick with the smell of damp concrete and stale coffee, hung heavy in the small, windowless room.  Flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows on the chipped Formica desk, highlighting the scattered evidence: a half-eaten sandwich, a crumpled photograph of a woman with eyes that seemed to follow her even now, and a single, crimson-stained glove.  Precinct 13, nestled in the heart of the grimy, forgotten industrial district of Southport, was a place where the city's forgotten sins clung to the air like mildew.  Every corner whispered tales of secrets buried beneath layers of rust and neglect.  Izzy, a seasoned detective with eyes the color of storm clouds and a steely resolve forged in the crucible of a thousand tough cases, knew this particular one was different.  It smelled of something more than just another missing person; it smelled of something predatory, something sinister.
