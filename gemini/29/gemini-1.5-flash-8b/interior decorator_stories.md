The scent of pine needles and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the ancient stone walls of the Blackwood Manor.  Rain slicked the cobblestones outside, mirroring the sheen of polished mahogany that lined the hallway Amelia Blackwood, Interior Designer, found herself navigating.  Amelia Blackwood, a woman whose life revolved around the careful choreography of light and shadow, colour and texture, felt a peculiar sense of unease.  This wasn't just another grand estate needing a touch of her signature elegance; this was her family’s ancestral home, Blackwood Manor, and its renovation was stirring up ghosts – not just of the past, but of the very family dynamics she’d spent a lifetime striving to reconcile.


The manor, sprawling and imposing, stood perched on a windswept hill overlooking the mist-shrouded valley.  Its Gothic architecture, with its towering turrets and jagged gargoyles, seemed to whisper tales of forgotten tragedies and whispered secrets.  Sunlight, filtering through stained-glass windows depicting scenes of heraldic beasts and celestial events, painted ethereal patterns across the polished floors.  The air itself hummed with a history Amelia couldn't quite grasp, a symphony of hushed voices and clinking silverware from generations past.  A subtle, metallic tang, like old blood, hung in the air, particularly strong in the library, where Amelia found herself drawn.
