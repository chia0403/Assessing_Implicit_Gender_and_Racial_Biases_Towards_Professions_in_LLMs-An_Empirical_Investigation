The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glistening crimson pools that pooled around the stainless steel worktables.  Dust motes danced in the faint air currents, swirling around the gleaming knives, the sharp glint of each blade a miniature sun in the dim interior.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's domain, a place where the raw, unyielding strength of the animal met the precise, unwavering hand of the craftsman.  Barty, a man whose weathered face bore the etchings of countless hours spent in the company of blood and bone, meticulously carved a thick sirloin, his movements practiced and almost silent.  The scent of thyme and rosemary, mingled with the earthy tang of freshly cut meat, hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this otherwise isolated corner of the city.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a constant, rhythmic percussion that punctuated the quiet hum of Barty's work.  He was alone, as he always was, the only companion in this cavernous workshop his own steady rhythm and the low, guttural groans of the now-silent, now-transformed animals he worked with.
