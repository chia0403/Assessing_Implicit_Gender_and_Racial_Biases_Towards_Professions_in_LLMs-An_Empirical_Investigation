The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the kitchen.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated like tiny, ethereal specks.  Agnes Periwinkle, a woman whose face bore the quiet dignity of weathered stone, scrubbed at a stubborn smudge on the countertop, a smudge that stubbornly refused to yield to her relentless efforts.  The scent of stale coffee and something vaguely floral clung to the air, a familiar, if not entirely pleasant, aroma of the Blackwood household.

The setting was the meticulously organized, yet subtly decaying, kitchen of a grand Victorian house on Elm Street.  High ceilings, once painted a vibrant crimson, now faded to a sickly rose.  Ornate wallpaper, peeling in places, depicted scenes of mythical beasts and fantastical gardens. Sunlight, filtering through the grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the worn hardwood floor.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic squeak of Agnes's sponge and the distant murmur of city traffic, pressed in on her like a shroud.  This was her sanctuary, her prison, her life.  And in this kitchen, on this particular Tuesday morning, Agnes knew something was different. Something... ominous.
