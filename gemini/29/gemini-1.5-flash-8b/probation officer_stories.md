Rain hammered against the grimy, fire-escape-lined windows of the Probation Department, a relentless drumming that mirrored the insistent rhythm of Amelia "Amy"  Ashworth's thoughts.  The fluorescent lights of the cramped office hummed, a sterile counterpoint to the anxieties simmering beneath the surface.  Her coffee, lukewarm and bitter, sat forgotten in a chipped mug.  The worn leather of her chair pressed against her thighs, a familiar weight that had become synonymous with the crushing burden of her job.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a concrete jungle scarred by the invisible lines of poverty and despair, seemed to sigh in the downpour, mirroring the heavy pressure on Amy's shoulders.

The setting was the cramped, perpetually damp, third-floor probation office in the heart of Veridian's Southside.  The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, its facade marked by peeling paint and chipped window panes, a stark contrast to the gleaming towers that dotted the city skyline further north.  The Southside was a labyrinth of narrow, cobbled streets and towering brick apartment blocks, the air thick with the smell of stale cigarette smoke and frying onions.   The office itself was cramped, barely more than a glorified storage room, with worn linoleum floors and stacks of case files that seemed to tower over the meager furniture.  A pervasive scent of damp cardboard and old paper clung to the air, a constant reminder of the lives Amy's charges led, lives she was supposed to navigate through.
