The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Associates" office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia Petrova's fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a recent graduate with a degree in Interior Design, found the repetitive nature of her receptionist duties a little less inspiring than the blueprints and colour palettes that had filled her dreams.  But the paycheck, meagre though it was, kept her afloat.

The office, situated on the 12th floor of a towering glass skyscraper overlooking the sprawling city of Aethelgard, offered a panoramic view that was both exhilarating and utterly distracting.  Skyscrapers pierced the pale-blue sky, punctuated by the occasional plume of smoke from a distant factory.  Below, the city pulsed with a life Amelia often felt detached from, a symphony of sirens, cars, and distant conversations she could only barely glimpse through the tinted windows. Her own existence felt confined within the sterile white walls of the reception area, her role a mere intermediary between the architects within and the world without.  Today, however, felt different.  A particular scent, something faintly metallic and faintly floral, hung heavy in the air, hinting at something more than the usual office routine.
