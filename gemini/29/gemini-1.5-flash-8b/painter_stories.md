The biting November wind whipped through the narrow alley, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic, like old blood.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron walls of the building housing Amelia "Maisie"  Ashworth's tiny studio.  Maisie, hunched over her easel, wrestled with a palette knife, the bristles scraping a thick impasto of burnt sienna and ochre across the canvas.  The subject: a skeletal, gnarled oak tree, its branches clawing at the bruised, pewter sky.  Inside the cramped space, the air, thick with the aroma of turpentine and linseed oil, felt both suffocating and exhilarating.

Maisie's studio, a former coal cellar, was a testament to her resourcefulness and desperation.  Two flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the space, illuminating dust motes swirling in the air.  Bare, bulbous roots, unearthed during the cellar's renovation, were haphazardly arranged in makeshift planters, their muted greens hinting at life amidst the gloom.  A single, tattered velvet curtain hung precariously on a rusty nail, separating the workspace from a cramped living area barely large enough for a cot and a rickety table.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of distant sirens and the rhythmic thud of hurried footsteps, but here, within the sanctuary of her colours and brushes, Maisie found refuge and a world of her own.
