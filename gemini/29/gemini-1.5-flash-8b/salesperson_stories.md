The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" retail emporium hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s latest sales pitch.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the skylights, illuminating the vast showroom filled with rows upon rows of meticulously arranged trinkets, gadgets, and gizmos.  Amy, a petite woman with a vibrant, if slightly nervous, energy, stood before a display of intricately carved wooden birds.  Each bird, painstakingly crafted, seemed to whisper tales of faraway lands.  Today's target:  a discerning, impeccably dressed man in his late 40s, Mr. Alistair Finch, known for his appreciation of the arts, but notorious for his patience bordering on the glacial.  The air crackled with unspoken tension.  Behind the counter, a weathered, mahogany clock ticked inexorably, the sound echoing the rhythmic beat of Amy's racing heart.  The clock, ironically, was the only item in the whole store that seemed to possess any tangible permanence.
