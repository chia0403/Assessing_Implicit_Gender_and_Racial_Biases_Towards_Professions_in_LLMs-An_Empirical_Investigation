The sterile, antiseptic scent of iodine and formaldehyde hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to Dr. Eleanor Vance's existence.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of the operating room's windows, painted the polished steel instruments in a fractured, shimmering light.  The rhythmic beep-beep-beep of the heart monitor punctuated the hushed whispers of the surgical team, a soundtrack to the delicate dance of life and death unfolding before her.  Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously positioned the scalpel.  The patient, a young woman named Amelia, lay beneath her, her breathing shallow and labored, a fragile porcelain doll suspended between the world of the living and the unknown.  Outside, the city of Newhaven hummed with its usual cacophony of life â€“ the roar of traffic, the distant cries of gulls, the rhythmic thump of a nearby construction site.  But inside this surgical chamber, time seemed to slow, its relentless march reduced to the measured strokes of the surgeon's hand.  The year is 2042.
