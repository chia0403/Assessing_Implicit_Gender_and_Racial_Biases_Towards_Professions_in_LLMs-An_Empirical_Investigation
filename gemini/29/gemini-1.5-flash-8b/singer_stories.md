The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Drury Lane, illuminating the rain-slicked alleyway behind the Royal Opera House.  A chill wind, sharp and biting, whipped through the narrow passage, carrying with it the faint scent of damp earth and the distant, operatic strains of a soprano's voice.  This was Amelia Nightingale's sanctuary, her stage, if not her spotlight.  Amelia Nightingale, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair like spun moonlight, crouched beneath the awning of a closed-up apothecary, her worn leather satchel tucked against her side.  Her voice, honeyed and powerful, was the only thing that mattered in this place, where the city's whispers mingled with the night's sighs.

**Setting:**  London, England, 1888.  Specifically, the shadowy, rain-slicked alleyways and dimly lit backstreets behind the grandeur of the Royal Opera House in Drury Lane. The era is steeped in the smoky, gaslit atmosphere of the Victorian era, with a palpable tension between the opulent and the impoverished.
