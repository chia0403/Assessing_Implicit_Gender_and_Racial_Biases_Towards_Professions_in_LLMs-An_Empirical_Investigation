The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull rose, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the "Nail Nirvana" salon.  A single, almost defiant, sunflower, wilting slightly in a chipped ceramic vase, stood sentinel on the counter beside Amelia  Evelyn  Pendleton's workstation.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glow, as Amelia meticulously filed a client's nail, a delicate, almost perfect, almond shape.  Her movements, usually a blur of practiced precision, were today oddly hesitant.  Outside, the city rumbled, a constant, low thrumming, like a wounded beast.  Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's tools and the hushed whispers of her clients, a muffled chorus that seemed to deepen the suffocating atmosphere of the salon. Today, it felt like the world itself was holding its breath.
