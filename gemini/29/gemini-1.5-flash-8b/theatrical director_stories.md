The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled courtyard of the Grand Théâtre des Lumières, illuminating a scene of chaotic preparation.  Dust motes swirled in the air, mingling with the scent of freshly-ground coffee and stale theatrical paint.  Amelia Cavendish, Director of Dramatic Productions, a woman whose sharp wit was as renowned as her fiery temper, surveyed the chaos with a sigh that threatened to shatter the fragile peace.  Her crimson velvet dress, a stark contrast to the muted tones of the surrounding props, seemed to pulse with suppressed energy.  The air thrummed with the rhythmic clatter of hammers, the hushed murmur of voices, and the sharp crack of a misplaced set piece.  Tonight was the premiere of "The Crimson Crown," a play Amelia had poured her heart and soul into, and the looming potential for disaster was palpable.  Tonight, the fate of her career, and perhaps her sanity, rested on the fragile shoulders of a cast as unpredictable as the weather in Paris.
