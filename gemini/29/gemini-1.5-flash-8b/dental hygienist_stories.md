The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed, a constant, almost oppressive, drone.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-caked windowpanes, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished stainless steel trays and the sterile white walls.  Anya Sharma, a dental hygienist with a quiet intensity that belied her 26 years, adjusted the headrest of the patient chair, her gloved fingers hovering over the polished chrome.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart echoed the steady pulse of the small, vibrating scaler in her hand.  Today, a Tuesday, was shaping up to be another typical day in the bustling, slightly-too-loud dental practice on the edge of the city, a place Anya had worked at since graduation.  The scent of antiseptic and fear hung heavy in the air, an invisible veil woven from the anxieties of her patients. This particular patient, Mr. Henderson, a retired librarian with a penchant for tweed jackets and even more tweed-like anxieties, was already fidgeting, his eyes darting nervously around the room. The waiting area, a chaotic tapestry of forgotten magazines and half-eaten granola bars, seemed to mirror the chaotic thoughts swirling in her mind, thoughts about the upcoming dental school entrance exam and the lingering feeling of not being enough, despite the skill and dedication she had already shown.
