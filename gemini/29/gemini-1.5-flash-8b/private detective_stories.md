Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated building, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Amelia Blackwood’s head.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and stale cigarette smoke, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia Blackwood, Private Investigator, hunched over a chipped Formica table in her office – a cramped space more reminiscent of a forgotten pawn shop than a detective's den –  a half-eaten tuna sandwich and a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee her only companions.  Outside, the city of Ashfall, choked by smog and the ghosts of forgotten factories, slumbered beneath a bruised twilight sky.  The city, and its secrets, were her domain.

The setting: Ashfall, a once-proud industrial city now reduced to a grimy husk clinging to the edges of progress.  Steel mills, their skeletal remains scarred and rust-eaten, poked like skeletal fingers into the perpetually overcast sky.  Abandoned warehouses, their windows like vacant eyes staring into the gloom, lined the narrow, rain-slicked streets.  This was the landscape of Amelia Blackwood's life, a world where whispers carried the weight of buried truths and shadows held the key to untold crimes.  The city, like Amelia herself, was a blend of faded grandeur and gritty resilience.  Tonight, a new whisper had reached her ears, a lead as thin as a thread of rain in a downpour.
