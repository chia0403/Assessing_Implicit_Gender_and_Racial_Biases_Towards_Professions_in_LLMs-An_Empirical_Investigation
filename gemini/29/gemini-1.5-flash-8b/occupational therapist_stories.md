The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and spilled chamomile tea, reflected Amelia "Amy"  Fitzwilliam's worried face.  Rain lashed against the single-paned window of her tiny, cluttered therapy office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful symphony, carrying with it the promise of a long, bleak winter.  Amy, a registered occupational therapist with a heart as resilient as the oak trees clinging to the hillside, stared at the tangled mess of colourful fabric scraps strewn across her desk.  Each thread, each meticulously stitched seam, represented a fractured limb, a lost ability, a life painstakingly pieced back together.

Her tiny office, crammed into a converted garage nestled beneath the eaves of a sprawling Victorian home in the misty hills of Vermont, smelled faintly of pine needles and antiseptic. Sunlight, a precious commodity in the season's twilight, struggled to penetrate the dense foliage outside, casting long, dramatic shadows that danced on the stacks of colourful therapy aids, neatly organised and yet still somehow chaotic.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves wafted through the open window, a stark contrast to the sterile whiff of the therapy materials stacked in neat yet ever-so-slightly-overwhelming rows.  It was a place where the quiet hum of a sewing machine mingled with the soft click of splints being adjusted, where hope, however fragile, found a temporary shelter.
