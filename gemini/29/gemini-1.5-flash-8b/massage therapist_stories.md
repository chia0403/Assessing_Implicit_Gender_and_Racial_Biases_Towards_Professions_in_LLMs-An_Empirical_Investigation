Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, unassuming massage parlour, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle hum of the air conditioner.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, her fingers tracing the intricate lines of a well-worn massage chart, was preparing for another day of soothing tensions.  The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting embrace against the relentless downpour outside.  Amelia, with her soft, almost ethereal beauty, radiated a calm that seemed to absorb the anxieties of the city outside.  The small, dimly lit room, decorated with calming watercolours of misty mountains and serene forests, was a sanctuary from the chaos of the city, a haven of quiet whispers and the low, rhythmic kneading of muscle.  Tonight, Amelia anticipated a particularly troubled client.  Her schedule, usually filled with the quiet sighs of relief, held a palpable tension this evening, a foreshadowing of the storm about to break.
