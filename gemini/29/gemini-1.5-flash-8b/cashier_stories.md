The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" general store hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee, old paper, and the faint, sickly sweet aroma of the candy aisle, clung to her like a second skin.  It was a Tuesday, around 3 PM, the slow death knell of the workday.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, slicing through the gaps in the faded curtains.  Amelia, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that struggled to reach her tired, downturned mouth, swiped another customer's credit card.  The card, a shimmering rectangle of plastic, felt cold beneath her fingertips.  This was the third transaction of the day that involved a rejected payment.  It was the kind of day when the rhythm of the store, usually a comforting drone, grated on her nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard.
