The biting wind, a relentless razor against exposed skin, whipped across the desolate expanse of the I-95 median.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grey asphalt and grit, danced across the cracked concrete.  Amelia Petrova, her name a whisper against the roar of passing trucks, hunched over a battered toolbox.  The fluorescent yellow of her safety vest, normally a beacon of visibility, seemed almost swallowed by the monochrome landscape.  It was 3 AM, the hour when the interstate, usually a restless artery, slept, and Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, felt the weight of the night press down on her.

Amelia's team, a ragtag group of night owls bonded by shared fatigue and the grim ritual of patching and repairing, was tasked with closing the largest one, a particularly deep fissure that threatened to derail more than just cars.
