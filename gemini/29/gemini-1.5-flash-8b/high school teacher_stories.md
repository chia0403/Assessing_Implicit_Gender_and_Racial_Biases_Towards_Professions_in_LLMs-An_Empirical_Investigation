Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Ms. Elara Nightingale's classroom, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the worn mahogany desk.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the history classroom at Northwood High.  The year was 1998, a year etched in her memory not just for the relentless downpour but for the unsettling silence that had fallen over the usually boisterous student body.  It was the week after the school-wide assembly where the principal, Mr. Grimshaw, had announced the closure of the prestigious Northwood Theatre program.  The very air in the room felt thick with the unspoken anxieties of the students, their collective disappointment palpable.  Elara, a history teacher at Northwood for ten years, surveyed her class, a collection of anxious faces illuminated by the pale fluorescent light, each one a miniature tempest of unspoken emotion.  A single, paper-thin snowflake, clinging to a stray raindrop, drifted down onto the textbook sprawled across her desk, a silent testament to the quiet storm brewing within the walls of the once vibrant high school.
