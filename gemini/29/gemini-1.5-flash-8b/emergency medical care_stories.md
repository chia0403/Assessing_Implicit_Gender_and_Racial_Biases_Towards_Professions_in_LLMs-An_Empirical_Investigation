Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, mimicking the relentless rhythm of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heartbeat.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the cramped, sterile triage room.  Broken pallets and scattered debris littered the floor, a stark contrast to the sterile white of the medical supplies stacked neatly in the corner.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the rain into a frenzy.  This wasn't exactly the ideal setting for a Level 1 trauma center, but the remote coastal town of Havenwood had been caught in the eye of a ferocious storm, leaving the local hospital overwhelmed.  Eleanor, a seasoned emergency medical care provider, had volunteered to establish a temporary triage facility, hoping to mitigate the worst of the storm's effects.
