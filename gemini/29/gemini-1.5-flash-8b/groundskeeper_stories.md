The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Oakhaven Cemetery, tugging at Elias Thorne's worn tweed jacket.  His breath puffed out in white clouds, swirling amongst the scattered autumn leaves that crunched beneath his worn, well-loved boots.  The cemetery, usually a hushed sanctuary of somber elegance, felt particularly desolate this late afternoon.  A thin film of frost already coated the tombstones, mirroring the chill that had settled into Elias's bones.  He was a groundskeeper, a silent guardian of this hallowed ground, and today, as always, his work was his solace.

Oakhaven Cemetery, nestled in the heart of the sprawling Blackwood Hills, was a place of timeless beauty, marred only by the inevitable passage of time.  Towering, centuries-old trees cast long shadows over the meticulously manicured lawns, their tangled roots whispering secrets to the wind.  Rows of headstones, each a testament to a life lived and lost, stretched as far as the eye could see, their inscriptions etched with names, dates, and the silent prayers of the departed.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, held a palpable sense of history, a weight of untold stories carried on the breeze.  Elias, with his weathered face and eyes that held the wisdom of the seasons, felt intimately connected to this place, a custodian of its secrets.
