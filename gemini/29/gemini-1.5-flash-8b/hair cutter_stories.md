The rhythmic buzz of the clippers vibrated through Amelia Nightingale’s hands, a comforting counterpoint to the anxious chatter of the patrons in her small, tucked-away salon, "Scissors & Smiles."  Sunlight, fractured by the swirling dust motes dancing in the air, painted the space in shifting hues of gold and amber.  A floral wallpaper, faded but still vibrant with faded roses and forget-me-nots, lined the walls, a stark contrast to the stark, clinical white of the cutting station Amelia currently occupied.  Antique mirrors, their frames tarnished with age, reflected the busy salon, a kaleidoscope of colours and expressions.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with perpetually tired but kind eyes, expertly guided the razor-sharp blade, the rhythmic snips a soothing mantra in the otherwise chaotic hum of the day.  Outside, the city of Veridian swelled and simmered, a distant, throbbing roar that seemed to ebb and flow with the tides of the day.  Veridian, a city built on secrets and shadowed alleys, held its breath, listening to the hushed whispers of Amelia’s shears, a tiny, contained storm within its bustling heart.
