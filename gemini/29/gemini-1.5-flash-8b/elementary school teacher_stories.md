The fluorescent lights of Miss Amelia Hemlock's classroom hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of pencils on paper.  Crayon shavings, the remnants of a thousand childish creations, littered the chipped wooden floor.  Sunlight, filtered through grimy window panes, cast long, distorted shadows across the rows of desks, highlighting the scattered piles of construction paper and half-finished drawings.  Amelia Hemlock, a woman whose auburn hair was perpetually escaping its bun, sighed.  Another Tuesday. Another avalanche of tiny hands and even tinier voices vying for her attention.  The aroma of slightly stale milk and questionable lunchbox leftovers hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar scent that spoke of the simple, often chaotic, beauty of childhood.  Outside, the wind howled a melancholic tune, a counterpoint to the cacophony within the walls of Oakhaven Elementary School.  The old building, weathered and worn, seemed to whisper stories of generations of students, generations of teachers, generations of spilled milk and whispered secrets.  This year, however, held a particular promise of trouble, a new challenge that threatened to shatter the fragile equilibrium of her carefully crafted classroom routine.
