The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Nebraska plains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust devils, the size of miniature tornadoes, danced across the cracked earth, swirling crimson dirt into the already hazy afternoon light.  The only sound besides the wind's relentless howl was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Elias's rig, a battered but loyal Freightliner named "The Iron Horse," struggling to maintain traction on the rutted highway.  It was a landscape that mirrored the weary state of Elias's soul.  He'd been hauling a load of vintage farm machinery for three days straight, from a dusty Kansas auction house to a forgotten Iowa antique dealership, a journey that felt as long and arduous as the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him.  The sun, a bruised orange orb sinking below the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the dust devils.  This wasn't a day for miracles, and frankly, Elias was starting to doubt his own sanity.
