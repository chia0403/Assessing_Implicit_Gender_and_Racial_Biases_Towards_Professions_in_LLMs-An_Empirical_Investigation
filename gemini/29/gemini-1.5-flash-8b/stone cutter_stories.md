The biting wind whipped across the exposed stone face of Mount Cinder, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled in the frigid air, obscuring the jagged peaks that formed the backdrop to his workshop.  He coughed, the rough stone grit clinging to his throat, a familiar companion in this high, unforgiving landscape.  Below, the village of Ashfall huddled like a flock of sparrows, its low stone buildings barely visible through the swirling mist.  Elias, his face weathered and lined like the ancient stones he carved, hunched over his chisel, the rhythmic clang echoing against the towering cliff face.  He wasn't just a stone cutter; he was the sculptor of memories, the keeper of the mountain's silent stories.  Every furrow, every groove, whispered of forgotten gods and buried battles, of a time when the mountains themselves were alive.  Today, however, only the relentless wind and the gnawing ache in his bones seemed to have a voice.
