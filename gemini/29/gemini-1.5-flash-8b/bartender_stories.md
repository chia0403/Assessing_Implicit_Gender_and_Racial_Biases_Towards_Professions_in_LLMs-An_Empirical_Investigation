The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, roasted peanuts, and something faintly floral, probably clinging stubbornly to the worn floral wallpaper.  Barkeep, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, wiped down the polished mahogany bar, the rhythmic scrape of the rag a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses.  Rain hammered against the small, single-paned windows, mimicking the frantic drumming in Barty's chest. Tonight, a certain restlessness coiled in the air, heavier than the usual Friday night fog.  He sighed, running a hand through his already dishevelled dark brown hair. Tonight, he was supposed to be enjoying a quiet night. Tonight, he was supposed to be... well, he wasn't supposed to be anything. Tonight, he was just Barty, the bartender.
