The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Cascade Range, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the loose timbers of his lean-to.  Snow, the consistency of coarse grit, coated everything in a blinding white.  He huddled deeper into his threadbare wool coat, the rhythmic chop-chop-chop of the axe echoing faintly in the desolate stillness.  The air, thin and frigid, hung heavy with the scent of pine and impending doom.  He'd been working this remote stretch of the forest, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the other loggers, for three months now.  Three months of unrelenting labour, of battling against the unforgiving mountain wilderness, and three months of a growing sense of isolation that felt like a suffocating shroud. The only companions were the whispering pines and the distant, indifferent howl of a wolf.

Elias Thorne, 32 years old, with hands calloused and scarred like ancient battlefields, was a logger through and through. His life was a symphony of the rustling trees, the screech of the saw, and the thunder of the falling timber.  He was a man carved from the very heart of this wilderness, molded by its relentless beauty and raw power. He considered himself a protector of the land, a humble servant of the wood. But beneath the surface, a nagging discontent, a feeling of something lost, began to echo with each successive day. This remote patch of forest, seemingly untouched by time, held a secret, a mystery that Elias, despite his ingrained reverence for the wood, sensed in its very heart.
