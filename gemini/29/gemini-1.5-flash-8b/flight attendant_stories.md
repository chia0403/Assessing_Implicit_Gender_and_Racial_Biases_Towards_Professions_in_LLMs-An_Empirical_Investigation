The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the bustling international terminal.  A single, sickly-sweet aroma of jasmine clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of jet fuel that clung to Amelia Kensington, a flight attendant for the prestigious Aerolineas del Sol.  Amelia, her uniform crisp and immaculate despite the oppressive heat, watched the throng of travelers navigate the labyrinthine corridors, their faces etched with a mix of anticipation and anxiety.  Her own anxiety was a simmering undercurrent, a barely contained tremor in her normally composed demeanor.  This flight,  scheduled to depart from the bustling metropolis of Rio de Janeiro to the remote archipelago of the Islas del Sol, felt different.  A premonition, a strange unease, clung to her like the smell of the exotic fruit juices sold by street vendors.  She traced the condensation on the cool surface of a nearby window, the reflection blurring the faces of the hurrying passengers, and wished desperately that it was a fever dream.

Amelia Kensington, however, knew better. This wasn't just another flight; it was a potential disaster waiting to happen. This plane, like the others, was on the brink of collapsing beneath the weight of secrets, and the first passengers were already aboard.
