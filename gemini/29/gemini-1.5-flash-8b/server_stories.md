The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hawthorne's worn uniform.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless drumbeat that echoed the frantic rhythm of her heart.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smells of stale coffee, simmering stew, and desperation.  The tiny diner, tucked away on the backstreets of Havenwood, was a sanctuary for the weary souls of the city, but tonight, even the familiar aroma seemed to weigh heavier than usual.  Amelia, her name barely a whisper on the windswept streets, was the only server on duty, tasked with keeping the meager clientele from sinking deeper into their anxieties.  The clock on the chipped wall ticked with the agonizing slowness of a condemned man, each second a judgment.  Outside, the city slept, oblivious to the storm brewing within the confines of The Rusty Mug.
