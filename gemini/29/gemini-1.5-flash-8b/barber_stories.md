The scent of freshly-cut hair, a heady mix of rosemary, lavender, and something vaguely metallic, clung to the air in Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Quill."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked windowpanes, illuminating swirling patterns of auburn and charcoal on the worn, wooden floor.  Cobwebs, thin as gossamer, draped from the chipped plaster ceiling, a testament to the infrequent visits of the occasional customer.  Barty, a man weathered by the relentless winds of time and countless snips, sat hunched over a mahogany barber's chair, his gaze fixed on the unruly mop of brown hair before him.  A small, almost imperceptible tremor ran through his calloused fingers as he carefully adjusted the razor.  The shop, nestled between a bakery overflowing with the smell of cinnamon and a struggling apothecary, was a relic of a bygone era â€“ a forgotten haven in the heart of a bustling, if somewhat drab, town.  This was the quiet, almost ghostly, existence of Barty Butterfield, the barber of Oakhaven, a man clinging to the remnants of a life he no longer quite recognized.
