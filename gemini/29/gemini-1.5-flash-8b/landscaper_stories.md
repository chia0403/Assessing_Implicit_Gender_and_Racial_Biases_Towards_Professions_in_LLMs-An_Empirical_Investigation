The midday sun beat down on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's back, turning the sweat clinging to his brow into a shimmering film.  Dust motes danced in the air, swirling around the meticulously sculpted topiary of a miniature, snow-white dragon that Barty had painstakingly fashioned.  He squinted, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The dragon's snout, crucial to the entire design, was stubbornly refusing to achieve the perfect, pointed symmetry he craved.

Barty, a landscaper of considerable renown (or, at least, renown within the confines of the affluent, gated community of Willow Creek), stood in the meticulously manicured courtyard of a sprawling Victorian mansion.  Ivy, thick as a forest, climbed the mansion's walls, its emerald embrace a stark contrast to the bleached, beige stone.  This particular property, the "Willow Creek Estate," wasn't just a house; it was an aesthetic statement, a testament to the owner's profound appreciation for the art of the absurdly elaborate garden.
