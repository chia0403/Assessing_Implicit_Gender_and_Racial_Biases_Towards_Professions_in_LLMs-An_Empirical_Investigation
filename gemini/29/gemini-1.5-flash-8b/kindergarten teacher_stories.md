The chipped paint of the "Miss Abigail Davies" sign, clinging precariously to the chipped paint of the kindergarten door, seemed to sigh in the humid morning air.  Inside, Miss Abigail Davies, a woman whose auburn hair perpetually resembled a tangled nest of sunflowers, surveyed her classroom.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a grinning sun, painted the room in a kaleidoscope of warm, shifting colours.  Crayon shavings, a fine, dusty confetti, littered the meticulously-arranged tables.  Little paper dinosaurs, sculpted with varying degrees of enthusiasm, lay scattered alongside construction paper hearts and meticulously drawn suns.  This was Ms. Davies's haven, her meticulously maintained kingdom of coloured paper, boisterous whispers, and sticky fingerprints.  Today, however, a quiet stillness hung in the air, a stark contrast to the usual cacophony of childhood.
