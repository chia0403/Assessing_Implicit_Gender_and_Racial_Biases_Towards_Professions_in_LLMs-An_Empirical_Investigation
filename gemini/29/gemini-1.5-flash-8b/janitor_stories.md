The fluorescent hum of the Zenith City Archives thrummed a constant, low-level anxiety.  Dust motes, tiny specks of forgotten history, danced in the pale light.  Elias Thorne, Archives Janitor, meticulously scrubbed a chipped ceramic mug, the faint scent of aged paper and mildew clinging to the air.  He'd been at it for thirty-seven years, each day a silent, methodical dance around the forgotten whispers of a city built on secrets.  The Archives, a sprawling, labyrinthine structure nestled beneath the gleaming skyscrapers of Zenith City, felt like a different world entirely, a world preserved in amber.  Today, however, the quiet hum held an edge.  Something feltâ€¦off.

The setting: The Zenith City Archives.  Located deep beneath the vibrant, futuristic metropolis, the Archives was a vast complex of interlocking corridors and towering, dusty shelves, filled with centuries of records, documents, and artifacts.  Dim, flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows that danced with the motes of dust perpetually suspended in the air.  The air itself carried a faint, almost imperceptible scent of decay and old paper.  The only sounds were the rhythmic clatter of Elias's cleaning tools and the low, persistent hum of the city above.
