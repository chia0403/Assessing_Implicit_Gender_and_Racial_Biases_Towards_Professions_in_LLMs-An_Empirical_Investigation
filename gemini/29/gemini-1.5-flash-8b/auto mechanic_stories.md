The air in "Rusty Wrench," Leo Maxwell's cluttered auto repair shop, hung thick with the smell of burnt oil and something vaguely floral â€“ a mystery that had been plaguing Leo for weeks.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, painted erratic patterns across the greasy workbench.  Tools, some gleaming, others rusted and chipped, lay scattered like fallen soldiers around him.  Leo, a man built like a sturdy oak, with calloused hands that spoke volumes of a lifetime spent wrestling with engines, squinted at the sputtering engine of a battered, mint-green Volkswagen Beetle.  This particular job, the owner had insisted, was "special."

Setting:  A bustling, yet somewhat run-down, corner of the fictional town of Oakhaven, nestled amidst a tapestry of towering oak trees and winding cobblestone streets. Rusty Wrench, Leo Maxwell's shop, was situated on a block dominated by antique shops and a vibrant but somewhat seedy jazz club. The aroma of freshly baked bread from the local bakery mingled with the mechanic's workshop scents, creating a unique blend of the urban and the rustic.  Rain had begun to fall outside, drumming a rhythmic tattoo against the corrugated metal roof of the shop. The flickering neon sign of the jazz club, announcing "The Blue Note," cast a hazy purple glow onto the wet street.
