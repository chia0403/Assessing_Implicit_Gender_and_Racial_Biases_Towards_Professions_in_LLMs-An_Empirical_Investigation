The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Ready Solutions" office hummed, a low, insistent thrum that mirrored the steady beat of Amelia Peabodyâ€™s own anxieties.  Her meticulously organized desk, a miniature battlefield of receipts, tax forms, and meticulously-color-coded spreadsheets, seemed to mock her with its silent order.  It was the Tuesday after Tax Day, a day normally reserved for celebratory champagne and relief.  Instead, Amelia felt the familiar tightening in her chest, a knot of dread that usually appeared only during particularly complex audits.

The office, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling downtown core of Portland, Oregon, was a stark contrast to the vibrant cityscape outside its windows.  Beige walls, pale linoleum floors, and the ubiquitous aroma of cheap coffee blended with the faint smell of desperation permeating the air.  Rows of identical desks faced a single, long fluorescent light, each occupied by a tax preparer, their expressions ranging from weary resignation to outright panic.  Amelia's was at the far end, a position that often felt both isolated and strangely symbolic. The rhythmic clatter of keyboards, the muffled sighs, and the occasional frustrated groan were a constant soundtrack to her anxieties.  Today, the soundtrack was amplified, each note seeming to echo the mounting weight of unfiled returns and unanswered questions.
