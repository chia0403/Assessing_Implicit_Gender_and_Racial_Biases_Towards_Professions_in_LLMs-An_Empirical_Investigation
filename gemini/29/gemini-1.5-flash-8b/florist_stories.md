The scent of lilies, jasmine, and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air of Amelia Nightingale’s shop, “Blooming Blossoms.”  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked windowpanes, illuminating the intricate arrangements crafted by Amelia.  Dried lavender sprigs, meticulously arranged, filled a small ceramic pot.  This was a typical Tuesday afternoon in the back streets of Alderwood, a city choked by industry and shrouded in perpetual grey.  The scent of exhaust fumes mingled with the floral bouquet, a constant reminder of the city's harsh reality just outside the cozy, if somewhat dilapidated, shop front.  Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate shade of rose, carefully positioned a single, perfectly formed crimson rose at the heart of a cascading cascade of orchids.  She hummed a tuneless melody, lost in her work, oblivious to the steady drip, drip, drip of the leaky water pipe in the back.
