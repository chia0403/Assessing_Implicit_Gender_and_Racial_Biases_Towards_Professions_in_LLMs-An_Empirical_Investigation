Eleanor, perched on the edge of her desk, a stack of spelling tests clutched in her hand, watched her students buzz with the anticipation of the upcoming Thanksgiving break.  Their chatter, a cacophony of excited whispers and stifled giggles, filled the air like the chirping of a flock of sparrows preparing for flight.
