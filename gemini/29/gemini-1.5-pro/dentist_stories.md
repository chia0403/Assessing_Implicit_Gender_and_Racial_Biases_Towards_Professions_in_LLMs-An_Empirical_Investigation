The biting November wind whipped down Elm Street, rattling the oversized tooth that hung precariously above the doorway of "Dr. Eleanor Vance, DDS."  Inside, the waiting room of the small, brick building was warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the grey skies outside.  The air smelled faintly of cinnamon and antiseptic, a combination that Eleanor Vance found oddly comforting.  Snow began to fall, fat lazy flakes that promised a quiet, if chilly, Friday afternoon in the small town of Havenwood, Maine.  Eleanor, her hands still slightly numb from the recent root canal sheâ€™d performed, peered out the window, watching the first tentative flakes settle on the branches of the ancient oak tree that dominated the town square.  It was the kind of snowfall that made her want to curl up by the fire with a good book and a cup of hot cocoa, a luxury she knew she wouldn't be afforded today.  Her last patient, a Mrs. Higgins with a notoriously difficult temperament and a penchant for complaining, was due any minute.
