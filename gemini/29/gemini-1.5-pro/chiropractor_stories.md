The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside "Aligned Spine & Wellness," Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., stared out the window, the rhythmic squeak of the sign a counterpoint to the drumming of rain against the glass.  His clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor, wasn't exactly thriving.  The chipped paint on the window frame and the single wilting peace lily in the corner testified to that. Port Blossom, once a bustling lumber town, had fallen on hard times, and Elias, fresh out of chiropractic school and full of misplaced optimism, had found himself stranded in its slow, decaying current.  The clock ticked towards 7 PM, the usual time Mrs. Higgins, his only regular patient, shuffled in for her weekly adjustment.  Tonight, however, the only sound was the relentless Oregon rain, and a growing sense of unease tightening in Elias's chest.
