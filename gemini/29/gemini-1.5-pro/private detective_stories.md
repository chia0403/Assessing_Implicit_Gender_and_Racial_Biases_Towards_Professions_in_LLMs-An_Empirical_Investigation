Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, each drop a staccato note in the mournful symphony of a Wednesday night in November.  The neon glow of the "Lucky Clover Liquor Store" across the street painted lurid streaks across the water-streaked glass, turning Silas's reflection into a ghostly, elongated figure.  His office, nestled above a dusty bookstore on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York City, was a testament to organized chaos.  Stacks of case files teetered precariously on every available surface, interspersed with overflowing ashtrays and half-empty coffee cups.  The air was thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke and the faint, bittersweet aroma of the jasmine tea Silas perpetually brewed. He sat slumped in his worn leather armchair, the springs groaning in protest, a fedora perched low over his eyes, the brim dripping with metaphorical gloom.  The phone, a bulky black rotary model, shrilled, shattering the oppressive silence.
