The bell above the door to "Petal & Plume" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the sigh escaping Elias Thorne's lips. Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and humid, promising an afternoon thunderstorm. Inside, the small shop buzzed with the sweet, earthy scent of damp soil and a hundred different blooms. Elias, his hands stained green from repotting a fussy maidenhair fern, pushed a stray lock of auburn hair from his brow and surveyed his domain.  Sunlight, filtered through the canopy of hanging Boston ferns and trailing ivy, dappled the worn wooden floorboards. Buckets overflowing with hydrangeas in shades of lavender and blush pink lined one wall, while another showcased vibrant sunflowers jostling for space with delicate lisianthus.  Elias thrived in this chaos of color and fragrance, a sanctuary he'd built brick by brick, bloom by bloom.  But today, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual peaceful symphony of his shop, a premonition of change heavy in the air like the impending storm.
