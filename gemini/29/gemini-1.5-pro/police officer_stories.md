The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of steel and ice cream â€“ an odd but familiar Chicago mix. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz stamped her feet, trying to coax feeling back into her toes. Her breath plumed out, a ghost against the backdrop of Wrigleyville bathed in the sodium-orange glow of streetlights.  It was 2:17 am, and the usual post-game revelry had long since died down, leaving behind an unsettling quiet broken only by the distant rumble of the L train.  Across the street, the marquee of the iconic ballpark loomed, a sleeping giant casting long shadows that danced with the swirling snow flurries.  Tonight's scene, however, was far from a celebration.  A single squad car, its flashing lights painting the freshly fallen snow in pulsating red and blue, illuminated a dark stain spreading across the sidewalk outside Murphy's Bleachers.
