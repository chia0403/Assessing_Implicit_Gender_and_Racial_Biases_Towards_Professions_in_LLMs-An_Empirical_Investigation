The crimson velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of anticipation, shimmered under the single spotlight.  A hushed expectancy, thick enough to cut with a diamond-encrusted butter knife, hung in the air of the opulent Crystal Ballroom.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful ballad against the art deco windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, overlooking the churning grey expanse of Lake Michigan.  But inside, in this gilded cage of chandeliers and champagne flutes, the only storm brewing was in the heart of Eliza Jane Holloway, tonight's headliner.  She stood in the wings, her throat tight, her ivory silk gown clinging to her damp palms, the ghost of a melody playing on her lips. Tonight was not just any performance; tonight, Eliza Jane was singing for her life.
