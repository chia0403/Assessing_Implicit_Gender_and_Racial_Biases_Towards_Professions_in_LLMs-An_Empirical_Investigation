The rain lashed against the gothic arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head.  Her mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in a world of swirling emotions, was cluttered with half-read journals and the cold dregs of a forgotten cup of tea.  The gaslight flickered, casting elongated shadows that danced across the ornate Persian rug, giving the room a disquietingly theatrical air.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, slick with rain, reflected the orange glow of the streetlamps, creating a scene both beautiful and melancholic. It was late November, 1888, a time when the fog hung thick and heavy, not just in the air, but in the hearts of the city's inhabitants.  Fear, a palpable entity, stalked the narrow wynds and grand squares, whispering of a darkness that lurked just beyond the pools of lamplight.  Dr. Vance, usually a sanctuary of calm reason amidst the city’s anxieties, felt the chill of this fear creeping into her own bones.
