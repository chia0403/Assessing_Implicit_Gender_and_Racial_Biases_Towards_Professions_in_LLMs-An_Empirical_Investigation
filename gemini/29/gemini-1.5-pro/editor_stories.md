The air, thick with the scent of old paper and Amelia's lukewarm Earl Grey, vibrated with the low hum of the ancient building.  Outside, the narrow, cobbled streets of the Old Town were slick with reflected neon light, casting a lurid glow on the centuries-old stonework.  It was late November, the kind of raw, bone-chilling evening that burrowed deep into your marrow and refused to let go.  Amelia, wrapped in a moth-eaten cashmere cardigan, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair from her face and sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm raging both outside and within her. The deadline for "Whispers" loomed, a monstrous shadow stretching across the already overflowing stack of work beside her.
