The biting November wind whipped around Vivienne Holloway, causing her burgundy beret to cling precariously to her salt-and-pepper curls.  She hunched deeper into her worn tweed coat, its pockets overflowing with crumpled scripts and half-eaten granola bars. The flickering gaslights of Victorian London cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled alleyway, leading to the stage door of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre.  Rain, mixed with soot, slicked the stones beneath her sensible boots.  Vivienne, despite the chill that seeped into her very bones, felt a familiar thrill of anticipation. Tonight was the premiere of her audacious reimagining of "Hamlet," set not in a Danish castle, but within the claustrophobic confines of a Victorian asylum.  And if the whispers she'd overheard amongst the stagehands were any indication, it was going to be either a spectacular triumph or a glorious disaster.  There was no middle ground with Vivienne Holloway.
