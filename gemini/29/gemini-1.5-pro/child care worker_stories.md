The fluorescent lights of the Rainbow Rascals Daycare hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of a swing set outside.  A faint smell of apple juice and disinfectant hung in the air, mingling with the more pungent aroma of Play-Doh.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed her kingdom. Tiny plastic chairs were scattered haphazardly, a half-finished Lego castle dominated one corner, and a trail of glitter, like fairy dust gone astray, shimmered across the linoleum floor. It was 3:00 pm, the witching hour just before parents arrived, when the energy of twenty toddlers reached its chaotic crescendo.  Outside, the October wind rustled the leaves of the giant oak tree that shaded the playground, hinting at the approaching chill of autumn.  Amelia took a deep breath, bracing herself for the onslaught of parental inquiries and the inevitable hunt for missing mittens.  Today, however, a different kind of chaos was brewing, one that glitter and glue couldn't fix.  It started with a whisper, a secret passed from one small hand to another, accompanied by wide, knowing eyes and hushed giggles.  Amelia had a feeling this wasn't going to be an ordinary afternoon.
