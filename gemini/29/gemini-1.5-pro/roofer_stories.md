The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, releasing a pungent aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He knelt on the scalding shingles of the Widow McCallister's Victorian, the slate-grey roof sloping precariously towards the manicured lawns of Ashbury Heights. Far below, the San Francisco Bay shimmered, a hazy blue canvas dotted with the white sails of pleasure boats.  Elias adjusted his sweat-soaked bandana, the Golden Gate Bridge a miniature marvel in the distance. The air, thick with the smell of tar and the faint, salty tang of the ocean, vibrated with the low hum of the city.  A single, errant seagull cried overhead, its shadow flitting across the shingles. This was Elias's office, his domain – a precarious kingdom of shingles and sky.  He’d been roofing since he was sixteen, learning the trade from his grandfather, and the heights never bothered him. It was the secrets hidden beneath the shingles, the stories whispered by the chimneys, that truly captivated him.  And the Widow McCallister’s house, with its peeling paint and boarded-up attic windows, whispered louder than most.
