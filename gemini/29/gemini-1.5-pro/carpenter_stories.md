The rasping screech of saw against oak echoed through the crisp October air, punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias Thorne's hammer. Wood shavings, like fallen leaves, swirled around his work boots, dusting the worn leather a pale gold. His workshop, a converted stable nestled behind his modest cottage on the outskirts of the village of Oakhaven, was a sanctuary of organized chaos.  Tools hung neatly on pegboards, each in its designated spot, a testament to Elias's meticulous nature.  Yet, the current project, a magnificent half-finished grandfather clock destined for the mayor's parlor, sprawled across the workbench, surrounded by intricate carvings and gleaming brass components. Oakhaven, tucked away in the folds of the whispering Longbarrow Downs, was a place steeped in quiet tradition and age-old superstitions, where the rhythm of life was dictated by the changing seasons and the creak of ancient trees.  And Elias, with his calloused hands and keen eye for detail, was as much a part of its tapestry as the gnarled oaks themselves. But this morning, a subtle shift in the usual tranquility hung heavy in the air, like the stillness before a storm.
