The flickering neon sign of "The Binary Bean" cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto.  Inside, amidst the aroma of burnt coffee and synthetic ramen, Amelia "Mia" Sharma hunched over her laptop, its screen reflecting in her tired, hazel eyes.  Lines of code scrolled past like a digital waterfall, each one a carefully placed brick in the complex architecture of her latest project â€“ a self-learning AI designed to compose haiku.  Rain lashed against the window, mirroring the storm brewing inside Mia's head as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn bug. Outside, the year was 2147, and flying cars zipped between towering holographic advertisements, but inside The Binary Bean, time seemed to hold still, suspended in the ethereal glow of a thousand lines of code.
