The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, architect extraordinaire, as she stood on the precipice of what was, charitably, a glorified pile of rubble.  Crumbling brick walls, jagged gaps where windows used to be, and a tenacious tangle of weeds threatening to reclaim the entire structure painted a bleak, but not entirely uninspiring, picture.  This was the Cavendish Manor, a once grand Victorian edifice perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Sea just outside the quaint, perpetually misty town of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Eleanor tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, her emerald eyes glinting with a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration.  This wasn't just another commission; this was her chance to resurrect a sleeping giant, to breathe life back into a forgotten piece of history.  And, perhaps, to finally escape the shadow of her overbearing father's legacy.
