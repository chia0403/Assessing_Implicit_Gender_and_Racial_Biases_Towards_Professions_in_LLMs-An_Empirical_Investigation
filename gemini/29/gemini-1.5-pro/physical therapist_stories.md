The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of the Château de Valois, a sprawling rehabilitation center nestled in the foothills of the French Pyrenees.

Inside the Château, warmth and the faint antiseptic tang of a medical facility awaited, but out here, in the biting pre-dawn chill, Elias felt a familiar pang of loneliness, a feeling as ingrained as the routines of his daily work with the Château's patients. He’d arrived at Valois six months prior, seeking refuge from a past he couldn’t outrun, and the isolation of the Pyrenees had initially offered solace. But lately, the silence had begun to whisper secrets of its own.
