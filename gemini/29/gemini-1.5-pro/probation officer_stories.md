The stale cigarette smoke clinging to Amelia Reyes's blazer wasn't from her.  Amelia didn't smoke, not anymore. But the smell, like a phantom limb of her wilder past, seemed determined to linger.  It was a Thursday afternoon in late October, the kind that held the promise of a chill in the air but delivered only a heavy, humid stillness.  The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot outside the Redwood County Probation Office, a squat, beige building that looked more like a neglected dentist's surgery than a place of rehabilitation.  Inside, flickering fluorescent lights buzzed over scuffed linoleum floors and rows of chipped metal desks. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun and a weary set to her brown eyes, sat at hers, a precariously balanced stack of files threatening to topple onto the lukewarm coffee she nursed.  Redwood County, nestled in the forgotten corner of California's Central Valley, wasn't exactly known for its scenic vistas or low recidivism rates, and Amelia, at thirty-two, already felt the weight of both on her shoulders. Today, however, promised to be different. A new case had landed on her desk, one that even jaded Redwood County was buzzing about. The name:  Daniel "Danny Boy" Blackwood. The charge:  Arson.
