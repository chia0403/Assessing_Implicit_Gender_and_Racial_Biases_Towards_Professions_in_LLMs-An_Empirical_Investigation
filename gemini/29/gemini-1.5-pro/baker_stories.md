The aroma of burnt sugar and cardamom hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume that clung to the brick walls of Lavender & Thyme Bakery like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the large front window, obscuring the view of the usually bustling Hawthorne Street in Portland, Oregon.  Inside, Eloise Beauregard, her auburn hair escaping its braid and dusted with flour, slammed the oven door shut with a frustrated sigh.  The kouign amann, her signature pastry and the bane of her existence this particularly dreary Tuesday morning, were refusing to caramelize properly.  The usually golden, crunchy exterior remained stubbornly pale.  Outside, the November wind howled, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Eloise.  This was the third batch she'd ruined, and the grand opening of her bakery was a mere three days away.
