The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" buzzed a tired, wasp-like hum, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Gallowgate Lane.  The lane itself, nestled in the heart of Glasgow's oldest district, was a narrow chasm of crumbling tenements and forgotten alleyways, permanently shrouded in a damp, peaty twilight.  Tonight, the relentless drizzle mirrored the perpetual melancholy that hung over the city like a shroud. Inside, Finnian O'Malley, his apron speckled with stray hairs and shaving cream, surveyed his empty shop. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a mournful hammer blow against the silence. He rubbed his tired eyes, the lines around them etched deep by years of close work and late nights.  The aroma of bay rum and sandalwood, usually a comfort, tonight only amplified the feeling of a long, lonely evening ahead.
