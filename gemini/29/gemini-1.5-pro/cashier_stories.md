The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s life.  It was 2:17 AM, the deadest part of the night shift, in the deadest part of town.  Outside, the Nevada desert stretched out, an endless expanse of black punctuated by the distant, flickering lights of Las Vegas, a shimmering mirage that promised a life Amy knew she’d never have.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, lingering scent of the cherry-flavored air freshener Amy had plugged in three hours earlier.  She leaned against the counter, absently tracing patterns in the dust that had settled on the lottery ticket scanner, the rhythmic beep of the gas pumps the only other sound besides the infernal humming.  Her name tag, slightly askew, proclaimed her to the world: Amy Rodriguez, Cashier.  A world that, at this hour, seemed to consist only of her and the occasional tumbleweed that blew across the deserted highway.
