The scent of stale apple juice and dried Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Eleanor Josephine Davies had come to associate with Monday mornings.  Sunlight, still weak from its climb over the San Gabriel Mountains, streamed through the large window of her kindergarten classroom, illuminating a riot of finger paintings and lopsided alphabet letters tacked to the corkboard. Outside, the jacaranda trees lining the perimeter of Maplewood Elementary shimmered with a haze of purple blossoms, their vibrant colour a stark contrast to the grey concrete of the school building.  Eleanor, or Ellie as everyone called her, surveyed the scene with a mixture of exhaustion and a deep, abiding fondness.  It was the beginning of another week, another opportunity to nurture the twenty bright, chaotic little humans entrusted to her care.  This morning, however, a strange quiet permeated the room, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the oversized, brightly coloured clock above the doorway.  Ellie had a feeling that this particular Monday was going to be anything but ordinary.
