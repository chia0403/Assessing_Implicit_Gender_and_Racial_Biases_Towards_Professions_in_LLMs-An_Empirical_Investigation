The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, a familiar sting that mirrored the ache in her heart.  The Isle of Skye, with its brooding mountains cloaked in mist and its dramatic cliffs plunging into the turbulent sea, had always been her refuge.  Today, however, the raw beauty offered little solace.  Amelia, a renowned wildlife photographer, stood perched precariously on the edge of the Quiraing, her trusty Nikon D850 clutched tight, its lens pointed towards the colony of seabirds swirling below. The wind howled a mournful tune, echoing the emptiness that had settled within her since the gallery in Edinburgh had rejected her latest collection, deeming it “too bleak, too desolate.”  The irony wasn't lost on her.  The wild, untamed landscapes she captured, the very essence of Skye, were a reflection of her own soul, a soul now fractured by disappointment and self-doubt. The sharp, metallic tang of the approaching rain promised a storm, and Amelia wondered if this time, the island's embrace wouldn't be enough to shield her from the tempest brewing within.
