The flickering fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years as a guidance counselor.  Her office, a small, windowless box painted a depressingly cheerful shade of butter yellow, offered sanctuary from the chaos of teenage life swirling just beyond the closed door.

Amelia sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose, a familiar ache settling between her eyebrows.
