The biting November wind whipped off Lake Erie, rattling the ancient windows of the Mercy Clinic and stinging Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheeks as she hurried across the parking lot.  Slush, the consistency of half-melted ice cream, splattered the hem of her dark green scrubs.  Mercy Clinic, perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning grey water, served the small, isolated town of Port Blossom, Ohio.  Population: 2,417, not counting the occasional wayward seagull.  Amelia, fresh out of PA school and still clinging to the idealism that had driven her into medicine, had envisioned herself in a bustling city hospital, saving lives amidst the constant thrum of advanced technology. Instead, she found herself facing her first solo night shift in a clinic where the most advanced piece of equipment was a ten-year-old X-ray machine and the biggest emergencies usually involved fishing hook injuries or the occasional rogue snowmobile accident. Tonight, however, felt different.  The air crackled with an unusual stillness, a hushed expectancy that prickled Amelia's skin and sent a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.
