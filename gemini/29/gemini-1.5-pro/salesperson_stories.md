This deal, a potential contract for their new line of lightweight carbon fiber components, was make or break for her small startup, Rodriguez Industrial Solutions.  The crisp Colorado air, biting even through the airport's glass doors, held the promise of either exhilarating success or crushing defeat.  Amy took a deep breath, the metallic tang of recycled air filling her lungs, and stepped out into the pre-dawn chill.
