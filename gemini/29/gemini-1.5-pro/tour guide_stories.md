The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Mermaid's Kiss*, a rickety but charming ferry chugging its way towards Inis Fáil.  The mythical isle, shrouded in a near-perpetual mist, rose from the turbulent Irish Sea like a slumbering giant.  Jagged cliffs, stained ochre and green, clawed at the sky, while the mournful cry of unseen seabirds echoed across the water.  Amelia, bundled in a thick Aran sweater despite the July air, adjusted her microphone headset.  Twenty-three expectant faces turned towards her, a mixture of seasoned travellers and wide-eyed first-timers, eager to explore the legends and landscapes of the island said to be the final resting place of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the mythical people of the mounds.  A shiver, unrelated to the chill wind, danced down Amelia's spine. Inis Fáil held secrets, whispered on the wind and hidden in the ancient stones.  She knew them well, but today, something felt different, charged, as if the island itself was holding its breath.
