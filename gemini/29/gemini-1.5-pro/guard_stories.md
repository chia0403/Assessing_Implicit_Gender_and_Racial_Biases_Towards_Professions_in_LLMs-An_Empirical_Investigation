The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his exposed cheeks and rattling the iron bars of the gate he guarded.  He pulled his thick wool cloak tighter, the coarse fabric scratching against his chainmail.  Above, the sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the coming snowstorm.  Below, the cobbled streets of Aethelgard, the fortress-city carved into the side of Mount Cinder, were already dusted with a fine layer of white. Lanterns flickered weakly, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock Elias's solitary vigil.  The gate, known as the Serpent's Tooth for its jagged, iron spikes, was the only entrance to the upper city, home to the King and his court.  Tonight, the air thrummed with a tension Elias couldn't quite place, a feeling like the mountain itself was holding its breath.
