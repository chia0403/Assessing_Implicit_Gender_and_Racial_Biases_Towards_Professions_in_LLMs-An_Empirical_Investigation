The humid Miami air hung thick and sweet, smelling of hibiscus and exhaust fumes, a scent Eliza Perez had come to associate with home.  Her salon, "Nailed It," was nestled between a bustling botanica and a laundromat that perpetually hummed with the rhythmic whir of dryers.  The vibrant coral walls of Nailed It were adorned with framed diplomas and a scattering of hand-painted flamingoes, a testament to Eliza’s artistic flair.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating rows of perfectly organized nail polishes, glittering like a rainbow of jewels. It was a Tuesday morning, typically slow, but today, a sense of unease prickled at Eliza’s skin, a feeling as sharp as a broken acrylic tip.
