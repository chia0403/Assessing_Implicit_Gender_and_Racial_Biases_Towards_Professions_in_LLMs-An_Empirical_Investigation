The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint, frantic tapping of keyboards from the handful of junior analysts still clinging to hope in the adjoining office.  Elias rubbed his temples, the beginnings of a migraine throbbing behind his eyes.  He had gambled big on QuantumLeap Robotics, and tonight, the dice were rolling against him.
