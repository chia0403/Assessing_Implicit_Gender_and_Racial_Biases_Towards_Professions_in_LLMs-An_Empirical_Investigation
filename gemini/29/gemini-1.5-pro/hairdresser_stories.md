The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose blue-rinsed hair defied gravity.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, owner and sole stylist of the small salon, plastered a welcoming smile on her face, tucking a loose strand of her own fiery auburn hair behind her ear. Shear Perfection, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront in the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, Oregon, wasn’t exactly glamorous.  The faded floral wallpaper, the slightly-too-loud hum of the ancient hairdryer, and the lingering scent of perm solution all spoke to its humble nature.  But for Amelia, it was a haven, a place where she could wield her scissors like magic wands, transforming the ordinary into something a little bit extraordinary, one haircut at a time.  This Tuesday morning, however, held a different kind of energy, a subtle buzz that prickled Amelia’s skin and had nothing to do with Mrs. Higgins’ impending perm.  Something was about to change in Harmony Glade, and Amelia had a feeling it was about to start with a snip.
