The wind, sharp and laced with the scent of pine needles, whipped around Elias Thorne as he surveyed the granite face of Widow's Peak.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum colour, cast long shadows across the quarry, turning the scattered chips of grey and rose-coloured stone into a mosaic of amethyst and charcoal.  Nestled high in the Alpe di Siusi, Elias’s workshop clung to the mountainside like a swallow’s nest, a precarious structure of weathered timber and corrugated iron.  Within, the air hummed with the almost imperceptible vibration of the unfinished angel he was carving for the church in Castelrotto, a commission that had occupied him for the better part of a year.  Elias, his calloused hands stained ochre from the stone dust, felt the familiar thrill of anticipation that always came before the first strike of his chisel. But today, a different sort of tension tightened his shoulders.  A raven, black as a coal scuttle, perched on the peak above, croaked three times and then took flight, its shadow a fleeting omen against the deepening twilight.  Elias knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that something was about to change.
