The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quad of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles, slick with rain, leered down from the medieval stonework, and the gas lamps flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the swaying branches of the ancient oak in the center of the quad.  Alistair clutched a leather-bound volume of Chaucer to his chest, the cold seeping through the worn leather and chilling his fingertips.  He was late, unforgivably late, for his tutorial with young Mr. Henderson, a promising but perpetually distracted student.  Tonight's subject: the allegorical significance of the Wife of Bath.  But something else weighed heavier on Alistair's mind than tardiness or Chaucer – the unsettling discovery he’d made earlier that afternoon in the Bodleian Library, a discovery that seemed to unravel the very fabric of his meticulously ordered academic life.
