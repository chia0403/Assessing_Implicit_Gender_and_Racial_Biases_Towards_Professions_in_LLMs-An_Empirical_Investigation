Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office, mimicking the frantic drumming of her fingers against the mahogany desk.  Outside, the gaslights of Victorian London blurred into hazy halos, swallowed by the November fog. Inside, the only illumination came from a flickering oil lamp perched precariously on a stack of ledgers, casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered room.  Amelia, her spectacles perched low on her nose, chewed on the end of a quill pen, a furrow creasing her brow. The air smelled of damp wool, aged paper, and the faint, lingering scent of lavender water, Amelia's preferred fragrance against the pervasive London grime.  The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to amplify the silence, broken only by the occasional rustle of parchment and the persistent whisper of the rain.  This wasn't just any rainy Tuesday evening in 1888 for Amelia Hawthorne, accountant. Tonight, the numbers weren't adding up, and something far more unsettling than a simple accounting error was at play.
