The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, scattering crimson and gold leaves across the manicured lawns of Athelney Manor.  Frost crunched under Elias Thorne's boots as he made his early morning rounds, the rising sun painting the frost-covered grass a pale, ethereal pink. Elias, his weathered face framed by a thick, grey beard, pulled his tweed cap further down against the chill. He carried a dented metal bucket filled with birdseed, its familiar weight a comfort in the vast solitude of the grounds.

He knew every dip and rise of the land, every secret pathway carved by generations of rabbits and foxes, every whispering secret held within the ancient stones of the house itself.
