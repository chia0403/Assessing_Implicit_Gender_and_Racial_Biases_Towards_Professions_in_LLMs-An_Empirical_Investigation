The incessant dripping from the leaky faucet in the back room of Apothecary & Anise echoed the persistent thrum of anxiety in Elias Thorne's chest.  Rain lashed against the large, arched window overlooking the cobbled square of Oakhaven, a small, isolated village nestled deep in the misty folds of the Welsh mountains.  The year was 1923, and while the rest of the world seemed to be roaring into a new age of jazz and flapper dresses, Oakhaven remained stubbornly rooted in its quiet traditions, a place where whispers travelled faster than motorcars and the scent of woodsmoke perpetually hung in the air. Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose as he meticulously measured out powdered foxglove, felt the weight of those traditions pressing down on him like the heavy, grey sky.  He was, after all, not just a pharmacist, but the *only* pharmacist for miles, a role inherited from his father and his father before him. And tonight, that role felt less like an honour and more like a cage.
