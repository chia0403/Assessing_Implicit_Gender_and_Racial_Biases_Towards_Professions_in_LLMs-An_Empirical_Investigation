The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual buttercream and vanilla that permeated Eliza Jane Wilder’s bakery, “Sugar & Bloom.”  Crimson dusk bled through the large storefront window, casting long shadows across the meticulously organized worktable, where a half-finished wedding cake, lopsided and forlorn, sat like a sugary monument to disaster.  Eliza Jane, her apron smeared with icing and her fiery red hair escaping its braid, stared at it with a mixture of despair and simmering rage.  Outside, the humid Charleston evening throbbed with the promise of a summer thunderstorm, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. Sugar & Bloom, nestled amongst the pastel-hued historic buildings on Rainbow Row, was supposed to be her sanctuary, her haven, her dream come true.  But tonight, it felt more like a sugary prison.
