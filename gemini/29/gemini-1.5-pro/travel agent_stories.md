Rain lashed against the window of "Wanderlust Voyages," blurring the neon glow of the Parisian streetlights into impressionistic streaks of color.  Inside,  Amelie Josephine Dubois, her chin propped on a hand adorned with a silver compass ring, sighed. The romantic charm of her tiny travel agency, nestled between a boulangerie and a flower stall in the Marais district, was lost on her tonight.  Normally, the scent of freshly baked bread and lilies would invigorate her, fueling dreams of far-flung destinations.  But tonight, the only aroma she registered was the bitter tang of unsold airline tickets and the faint, lingering scent of jasmine tea, long grown cold in its chipped porcelain cup.  November in Paris was proving less enchanting, and considerably more damp, than the brochures promised. The Eiffel Tower, barely visible through the downpour, seemed to slump under the weight of the sky, mirroring Amelie's own weary spirit. This year, it seemed, everyone was choosing the predictable sunshine of the Caribbean over the moody romance of the City of Lights.
