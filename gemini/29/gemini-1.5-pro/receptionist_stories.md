The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby buzzed like trapped wasps, a sound Elara Vivienne Holloway had successfully tuned out over her three years as the hotel's receptionist.  The Grand Majestic wasn't actually that grand, nor particularly majestic.  It was a faded, once-glamorous art deco building clinging to a prime spot on Miami's South Beach, its glory days long surrendered to the relentless march of time and the salty ocean air.  Tonight, the humid Miami heat hung heavy, even inside the lobby's chilled air conditioning, promising a storm.  Beyond the revolving doors, palm trees swayed dramatically against a bruised purple sky, and the first fat raindrops began to splatter the sidewalk.  Elara tapped a crimson-painted nail against the worn mahogany of the reception desk, her gaze drifting towards the ornate, if slightly tarnished, clock above the elevator bank. 11:57 pm.  Three minutes until the end of her shift, and the blessed arrival of Miguel, the night receptionist.
