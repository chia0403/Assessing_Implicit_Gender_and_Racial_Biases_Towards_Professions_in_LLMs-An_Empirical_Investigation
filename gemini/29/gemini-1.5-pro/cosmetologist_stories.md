The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance’s ankles as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts vying with the exhaust fumes for dominance.  Her salon, "Crimson & Clover," was nestled between a falafel joint and a vintage bookstore with a perpetually dusty window display.  Inside, the air was thick with the sweet, chemical tang of hairspray and nail polish remover, a scent Eleanor found strangely comforting.  It was Friday night, the busiest time of the week, and the small space buzzed with the low hum of dryers and the rhythmic snip of her shears.  Christmas lights twinkled around the vintage vanity mirrors, casting a warm glow on the chaotic scene.  Eleanor, despite the pre-holiday rush, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest.  It wasn’t the overflowing appointment book or the constantly ringing phone. It was the postcard propped against her makeup mirror, its cheerful seaside image a stark contrast to the unsettling message scrawled on the back.
