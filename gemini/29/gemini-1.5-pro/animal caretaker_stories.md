The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges, a stark contrast to the crisp, white frost that clung to the weathered wood fences enclosing the sanctuary's various habitats.  Oakhaven nestled deep within the Catskill Mountains, a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, from majestic bald eagles to tiny, shivering field mice.  Amy, bundled in layers of fleece and a worn canvas jacket, inhaled the sharp, pine-scented air, a familiar comfort against the gnawing anxiety that had been her unwelcome companion for the past week.  A new arrival was expected â€“ a rescued snow leopard cub, and Amy, Oakhaven's head caretaker, felt the weight of its fragile life settle heavily on her shoulders.
