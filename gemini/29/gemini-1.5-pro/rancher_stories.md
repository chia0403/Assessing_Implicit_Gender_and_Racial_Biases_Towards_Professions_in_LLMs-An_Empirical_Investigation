The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Montana plains, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Vance Holloway.  His breath plumed out in frosty bursts as he surveyed the restless herd of Hereford cattle huddled against the barbed wire fence of his south pasture. The sky, a bruised purple-grey, stretched endlessly above the rolling landscape, broken only by the jagged peaks of the Crazy Mountains in the distant west.  Eliasâ€™s ranch, nestled in the foothills just east of Wilsall,  was a patchwork of weathered barns, sturdy corrals, and a sprawling, two-story farmhouse that had seen generations of Holloways come and go.  The first flakes of snow began to fall, fat and lazy, promising a long, cold night ahead. Elias knew he had to get the herd moved to the sheltered north pasture before the full force of the blizzard hit.  He adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson and nudged his horse, a sturdy Appaloosa named Comet, towards the milling cattle.  This winter, Elias had a feeling, was going to be a tough one.
