It wasn't just a glitch.  It feltâ€¦ intentional.  The sleek, minimalist office, usually a haven of calm, felt oppressive tonight, the silence broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the ominous ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from a simpler, less digitally dependent time.  Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and Amelia, with a growing knot of dread in her stomach, knew she was the only one who could unravel the mystery before it unraveled them all.
