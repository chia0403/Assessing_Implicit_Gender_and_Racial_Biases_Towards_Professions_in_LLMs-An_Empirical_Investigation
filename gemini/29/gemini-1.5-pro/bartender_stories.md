The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually lulled Adeline "Addie" Bellweather into a sort of meditative state as she polished glasses. Tonight, however, it only amplified the gnawing anxiety that had taken root in her stomach.  The Mug, nestled between a pawn shop and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the dimly lit port town of Port Blossom, Maine, was usually bustling with fishermen, dockworkers, and the occasional lost tourist.  But tonight, just past nine on a Thursday, Addie was alone, save for the flickering neon sign of a mermaid clinging to a beer stein in the window and the insistent drumming of the rain. The air, thick with the smell of salt, spilled rain, and stale beer, felt heavy, almost oppressive.  Something was brewing, Addie could feel it, and it wasn't just the storm outside.
