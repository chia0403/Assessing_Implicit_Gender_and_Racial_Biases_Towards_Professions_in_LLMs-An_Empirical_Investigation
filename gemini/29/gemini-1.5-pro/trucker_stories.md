The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt, baking the dashboard to a near-molten state. Dust devils danced across the shimmering asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," and for Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, it felt aptly named.  She gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather, the rumble of the engine a constant, vibrating presence beneath her.  Amy adjusted the brim of her faded trucker cap, pushing back a strand of dark hair that had escaped her ponytail.  Miles stretched ahead, unbroken by anything but the occasional scrub brush and the distant, hazy silhouettes of mountains. Her destination: Ely, Nevada, a pinprick of civilization on the vast canvas of the desert, still a good five hours away. This haul of automotive parts from Reno wasn't the most glamorous, but it paid the bills, and right now, that's all that mattered to Amy.
