The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, a soundtrack to Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's practiced smile.  Fluorescent lights glinted off the polished galley counter as she prepped the pre-departure beverage service. Outside, the tarmac of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport shimmered under the oppressive Georgia sun.  It was July, the air thick and heavy, even inside the chilled cabin of Delta flight 172, bound for Paris Charles de Gaulle. Mia adjusted the silk scarf at her neck, a small rebellion against the starched uniformity of her navy blue uniform.  The flight was nearly full, a mix of chattering tourists and weary business travelers already immersed in their laptops.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 14:52.  Seven minutes until boarding was complete. Seven minutes until she could escape the artificial calm of the cabin and embrace the chaotic ballet of takeoff.  Seven minutes until she could leave behind the stifling Atlanta heat and climb towards something... different.
