The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose blue-rinse perm was as predictable as the tides. Elias Thorne, the shop's owner and sole stylist, sighed, pushing a stray lock of his own dark hair out of his eyes.  Shear Perfection wasn't exactly thriving. Tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down antique shop on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada, the clientele consisted primarily of Mrs. Henderson and a handful of other regulars who favored practicality over pizzazz. The desert wind whipped sand against the large front window, obscuring the faded "Grand Opening" banner that had been hanging there for the better part of five years.  Inside, the air smelled faintly of perm solution and the dusty, sweet scent of Elias's grandmother's rosewater hair tonic, a legacy he clung to despite its dwindling supply. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor, giving the small space a melancholic, almost ghostly feel.  Elias plastered a smile on his face, ready to face another afternoon of predictable trims and gossip. Little did he know, this particular Tuesday was about to change everything.
