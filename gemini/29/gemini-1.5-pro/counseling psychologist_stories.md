Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  The room, nestled on the third floor of a converted Victorian house in the quiet, leafy Boston suburb of Brookline, was usually a haven of calm.  Persian rugs softened the polished oak floors, and the scent of lavender from a diffuser mingled with the faint, comforting aroma of old books lining the mahogany shelves. But tonight, the usual tranquility was shattered by Mrs. Albright's choked sobs, each one a jagged shard against the gentle backdrop. Elias, his brow furrowed with concern, leaned forward in his wingback chair, the flickering gaslight catching the warm brown of his eyes. He waited patiently, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner and the relentless drumming of the rain.  Outside, the skeletal branches of a centuries-old elm tree clawed at the darkening sky, a stark silhouette against the bruised purple twilight.
