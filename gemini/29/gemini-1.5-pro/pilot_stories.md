The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" St. Clair's parka as she pre-flighted her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver.  The pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, the jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains barely visible against it.  Lake George, usually a serene expanse of deep blue, was choked with ice, the surface fractured into a mosaic of white and grey.  Mia exhaled, her breath clouding in the frigid air, and ran a gloved hand along the Beaver's sturdy pontoons, now fitted with skis for winter operations.  This was her third supply run to the remote gold mining outpost at the head of the Knik Glacier, a treacherous route even for a seasoned bush pilot like herself.  Today, however, something felt different.  The silence, normally broken only by the wind's howl and the creak of the plane's metal frame, was heavy, almost expectant.  A shiver ran down Mia's spine, unrelated to the cold.
