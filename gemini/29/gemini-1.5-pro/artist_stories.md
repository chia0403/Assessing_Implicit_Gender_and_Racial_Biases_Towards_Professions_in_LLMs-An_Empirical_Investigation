The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliff edge. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock formations of Santorini. Her easel, weighted down with rocks pilfered from a nearby donkey path, stood steadfast against the gusts, holding a half-finished canvas depicting the impossibly blue-domed churches that clung to the caldera's rim like barnacles to a ship's hull.  The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, dramatic shadows across the whitewashed village of Oia, transforming the already breathtaking landscape into something ethereal. Mia, oblivious to the biting wind and the dizzying drop, squinted, her brow furrowed in concentration as she mixed a vibrant shade of cerulean blue on her palette.  This was her third attempt to capture the precise hue of the sky just as the sun kissed the sea â€“ a color that existed, it seemed, only in this magical place, and only for these fleeting moments.
