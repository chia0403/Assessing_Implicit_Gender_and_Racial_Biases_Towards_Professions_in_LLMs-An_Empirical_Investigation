The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the towering pines, a mournful whistle that cut through the otherwise silent pre-dawn.  Frost crunched under the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood as he trudged through the knee-deep snow towards the warm glow of the mess tent.  Camp Nine, nestled deep within the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana, was a temporary scar on the pristine landscape, a collection of canvas tents, corrugated iron sheds, and stacked logs waiting for the spring thaw and the arduous journey down to the sawmill.  The air, normally crisp and pine-scented, hung heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and the faint tang of diesel from the idling generator that provided the camp’s meager electricity. Jed’s breath plumed out in white puffs, each one vanishing quickly into the frigid air, a testament to the raw power of the approaching winter. He pulled his thick wool cap lower over his ears, the cold already seeping into his bones despite his layers of flannel and denim.  Another long day awaited him in the unforgiving wilderness, another day wrestling with giants.
