Flakes of snow, premature yet insistent, danced in the swirling gusts, clinging to the elaborately carved lintel above the heavy oak door. Number 17 Sycamore Row, Beacon Hill, Boston. The address, whispered amongst Boston’s elite, promised a certain pedigree, a quiet elegance that Amy aimed to enhance, not disrupt.  Inside, she knew, lay a warren of dimly lit rooms, heavy with the ghosts of old money and the weight of expectation.  Her client, Mrs. Penelope Van Derlyn, was notoriously difficult, a woman whose taste was as refined and unforgiving as the diamond brooch pinned to her cashmere lapel.  This commission, if successful, could catapult Amy’s fledgling interior design business into the stratosphere. If it failed… well, Amy preferred not to dwell on that. Taking a deep breath, she adjusted her scarf, a splash of vibrant cerulean against the muted grey of the building, and rang the doorbell, its chime echoing through the cavernous space beyond.
