The ornate brass handles of the Grand Majestic Hotel's revolving doors spun with a low, rhythmic whir, pulling in the damp, salty air of the Atlantic. Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the view of the bustling boardwalk beyond. Inside, the lobby glittered – a cacophony of polished marble, crystal chandeliers, and the hushed murmurs of affluent guests.  Elias Finch, a wiry young man with a shock of unruly brown hair perpetually escaping from beneath his pillbox hat, straightened his uniform vest, the Grand Majestic's golden insignia gleaming against the deep navy fabric. It was the start of the summer season in Seabrook, and Elias knew the next few months would be a whirlwind of demanding guests, overflowing luggage carts, and the constant jingling of tips – if he was lucky. He took a deep breath, the faint scent of chlorine from the hotel pool mingling with the richer aromas of old money and expensive perfume, and prepared for the onslaught. Tonight, Elias suspected, would be especially chaotic. The annual Seabrook Summer Soiree was about to begin, and the hotel was buzzing with anticipation.
