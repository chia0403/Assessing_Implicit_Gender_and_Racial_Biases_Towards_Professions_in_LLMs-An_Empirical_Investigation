The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the restless shuffling of students packing their bags on a Friday afternoon. Rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked windows overlooking the football field of Northwood High, blurring the already fading autumn colours into a watercolour wash of grey and brown.  Northwood, a small, forgotten town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, seemed perpetually shrouded in mist and melancholy, a feeling that often seeped into the very bones of its inhabitants. Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a loose bun, sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose, a familiar ache settling behind her eyes.  She loved teaching English Literature, she really did, but sometimes the weight of apathy, both hers and her students', felt like a physical burden.  This particular Friday felt heavier than most.  There was a strange tension in the air, a preternatural stillness beneath the storm's fury, that had prickled at the back of her neck all day.
