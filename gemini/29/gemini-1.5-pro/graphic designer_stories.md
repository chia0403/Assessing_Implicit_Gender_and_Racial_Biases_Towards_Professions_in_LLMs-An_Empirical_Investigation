The insistent London drizzle seemed to mirror the relentless thrum of anxiety in Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s chest.  Her flat, a converted Victorian attic space in Notting Hill, usually vibrated with the bright energy of her design work. Tonight, however, the glow of her iMac cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering gaslight outside her window. Scattered across her worn oak desk were crumpled sketches, discarded Pantone swatches, and half-empty mugs of lukewarm tea – the remnants of a creative block that had settled in like a stubborn fog.  The deadline for the rebranding of "Seraphina's Secrets," a high-end lingerie company, loomed over her like a guillotine. Amy, known for her bold, innovative designs, had so far produced nothing but a series of uninspired, cliché concepts that even she, with her generous self-criticism, found appalling. The scent of jasmine from the struggling plant on her windowsill did little to soothe her frayed nerves.  Outside, the city hummed with a life she felt increasingly detached from, the rhythmic swoosh of cars on rain-slicked Portobello Road a mournful soundtrack to her creative paralysis.
