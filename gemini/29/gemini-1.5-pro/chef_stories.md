The biting November wind whipped around the corners of the Beaux-Arts building, rattling the ornate windowpanes of Antoine Moreau's restaurant, "Le Papillon Bleu." Inside, the air hummed with the quiet anticipation of the evening service.  Copper pots gleamed under the warm glow of the hanging lamps, reflecting the soft chatter emanating from the small, intimate dining room.  Antoine Moreau, his dark hair streaked with grey at the temples, meticulously arranged a sprig of thyme on a plate, his brow furrowed in concentration.  He surveyed his creation – a delicate pan-seared scallop atop a bed of saffron risotto – with a critical eye.  Le Papillon Bleu, nestled in the heart of Montreal's historic Old Port, was Antoine's life's work, a testament to his unwavering dedication to culinary perfection. Tonight, however, a disquiet gnawed at him, a premonition that the meticulously planned evening was about to take an unexpected turn.
