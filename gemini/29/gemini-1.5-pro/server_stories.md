The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, otherworldly glow on the rain-slicked streets of Zenith, Pennsylvania. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne wiped down the counter with a practiced hand, the smell of stale coffee and frying onions clinging to her like a second skin.  Zenith was the kind of town where dreams went to die, a place bypassed by interstates and forgotten by time.  The Starlight, open 24/7, was its beating heart, a haven for truckers, insomniacs, and the occasional lost soul seeking refuge from the relentless drizzle and the even more relentless monotony of life.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A low hum vibrated through the floor, and the air crackled with an energy Amy couldn't quite place.  It was the kind of night that hinted at something big, something about to change.
