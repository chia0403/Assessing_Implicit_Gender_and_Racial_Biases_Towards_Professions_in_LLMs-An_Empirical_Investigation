The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum colour, dipped below the serrated peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains, casting long, skeletal shadows across the manicured lawns of Pasadena.  Ajacia "Ace" Villanueva, her Louboutins sinking slightly into the dewy grass, adjusted the "For Sale" sign, its cheerful yellow a stark contrast to the gathering dusk.  The property, a sprawling Spanish Colonial Revival with a terracotta roof and a fountain gurgling in the courtyard, was her latest listing, and Ace, despite the gnawing anxiety in her stomach, was determined to sell it. This wasn't just another multi-million dollar mansion; this was the key to finally escaping the shadow of her overbearing, real-estate-mogul mother and carving her own name into the unforgiving granite of the Pasadena property market.
