Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a professor as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of old paper and stale pipe tobacco hung heavier than usual in Professor Alistair Pembroke's office, clinging to the worn tweed of his jacket and the unruly curls of his silver hair. He hated cleaning, or rather, he loathed the disruption to his meticulously curated chaos. Each stack of books, each scattered note, each chipped porcelain figurine held a specific place in his internal map of the universe – a universe, he was quite certain, was about to be overturned.

A thin, trembling hand, gnarled with age, reached for a magnifying glass. He squinted at the ancient script, each character a tiny, defiant hieroglyph taunting him with its secrets. “Just a little bit closer, you stubborn old thing,” he muttered to the papyrus fragment, the brittle voice of a man battling both antiquity and impending doom. He knew, deep in his scholarly bones, that what he held in his hands was more than just another piece of the past; it was a key. A key to something…dangerous.

**Setting:**

The story is set primarily in and around **Greyhaven University**, a prestigious but somewhat gothic institution nestled in the misty, rolling hills of **Northumberland, England**.

*   **Professor Alistair Pembroke's Office:** This is a crucial, almost character-defining space. It's a book-lined sanctuary, overflowing with archaeological finds, historical artifacts (some genuine, some questionable), and the accumulated debris of a long academic life. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grimy windows, giving the room a perpetually twilight quality. Think towering bookshelves, a cluttered desk overflowing with papers, maps pinned haphazardly to the walls, and a pervasive smell of dust and antiquity.

*   **Greyhaven University's Library:** A vast, echoing space with soaring ceilings and endless rows of books. The library is a place of hushed reverence, punctuated only by the rustling of pages and the occasional cough. Secret passages, hidden alcoves, and forgotten archives may exist within its labyrinthine depths.

*   **The Northumberland Countryside:** The windswept moors, ancient Roman ruins, and crumbling castles that surround Greyhaven add a layer of atmosphere and mystery. The landscape is both beautiful and unforgiving, steeped in history and folklore.

I hope this gives you a good starting point for your story! Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any aspect or have other ideas.
