Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The morning light, fractured by the dusty Venetian blinds of her apartment, did little to soothe the gnawing unease in Eleanor “Ellie” Vance’s stomach. The clatter of the city bus groaning past her window was a familiar, if unwelcome, soundtrack to her pre-dawn angst. She’d slept poorly, a jumbled mess of Victorian fireplaces, overgrown gardens, and the steely glare of Mrs. Hawthorne, the town's notoriously difficult socialite. Ellie, a real estate agent for Peterson & Sons Realty, had been working for three weeks to get Mrs. Hawthorne to even look at 'Fairfield Manor', the only house on the market that fit the woman's absurdly specific criteria. Ellie had poured over the property listing like it was a treasure map, memorized the square footage down to the inch, and even researched the provenance of the stained-glass windows. Today was the day. She had one last shot to get her in the door. If she didn't, she knew Mr. Peterson would assign the listing to someone more experienced. Her stomach lurched again, this time with the added weight of ambition.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the quaint, coastal town of **Seabrook, Massachusetts**. Seabrook is a picture-postcard New England town, defined by its rocky coastline, weathered clapboard houses, and a main street dotted with antique shops and lobster shacks. It has a strong sense of history, with many families tracing their lineage back to the original settlers. However, beneath the charming surface lies a simmering undercurrent of competition and social hierarchy, particularly among the older, established families. Peterson & Sons Realty, where Ellie works, occupies a prominent corner on Main Street, its windows displaying glossy photographs of the town’s most coveted properties, from cozy cottages to sprawling oceanfront estates. Fairfield Manor, the property Ellie is trying to sell, sits perched on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic, a grand, slightly decaying Victorian mansion with a history as rich and turbulent as the ocean it overlooks.
