The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, even at seven in the morning, clinging to Eliza Mae Dubois like a damp shroud. Eliza sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Across the street, the wrought-iron gates of the plantation house, Oakleigh Manor, loomed, its peeling white paint a stark contrast against the vibrant green of the magnolia trees that draped its porch. This was it. This was either going to be the project of a lifetime or a complete and utter nightmare.

Eliza Mae Dubois, interior decorator extraordinaire (or at least, that's what she hoped she was), gripped her overstuffed tote bag tighter. It held samples of fabrics, paint chips in a kaleidoscope of creams and greens, and a dog-eared copy of Southern Living magazine – her bible, practically. Oakleigh Manor had been in the Devereux family for generations, slowly crumbling into genteel disrepair. Now, the last Devereux, a reclusive octogenarian named Mrs. Evangeline, had finally decided to let go of the past and embrace…well, whatever Eliza had in store for her. The thought both thrilled and terrified Eliza. She knew Southern sensibilities; she *was* Southern, after all. But Mrs. Devereux was legendary for her eccentricities and unwavering adherence to tradition.

The dust motes danced in the morning light as Eliza crossed the street, the chirping of cicadas almost deafening. Oakleigh Manor seemed to hold its breath, waiting, like a sleeping giant disturbed from a century-long slumber. Today, Eliza Mae Dubois intended to wake it up.
