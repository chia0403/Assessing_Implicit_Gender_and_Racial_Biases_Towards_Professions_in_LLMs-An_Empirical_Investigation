The fluorescent lights of "World Awaits: Your Adventure Starts Here" hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the vibrant posters of tropical beaches and snow-capped mountains adorning the walls. Eleanor Marie Ainsworth, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun that barely contained its rebellious curls, sighed and straightened a stack of brochures featuring all-inclusive resorts in the Dominican Republic. Another Monday, another mountain of paperwork, and another day dreaming of escapes that seemed perpetually out of her reach.

Eleanor's world was a cubicle in a strip mall on the outskirts of Des Moines, Iowa. The rhythmic whir of the air conditioning, the insistent ringing of the telephone, and the muffled conversations of her colleagues formed a suffocating soundscape. Outside, the grey sky threatened rain, a fitting metaphor for her current state of mind. The scent of stale coffee and printer ink clung to the air, a far cry from the exotic spices and salty breezes she imagined wafting through the bustling marketplaces of Marrakech, a destination currently trending on the internet that she could only experience vicariously through online reviews and grainy webcam footage. Her keyboard, sticky from a rogue coffee spill last Tuesday, felt like an anchor tying her to a life that felt increasingly stagnant. Today, she was determined, things would be different. Even if it was only in her mind, Eleanor Marie Ainsworth was going on an adventure.
