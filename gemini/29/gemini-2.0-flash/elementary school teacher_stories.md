## The Story Opening:

The chalk dust danced in the late afternoon sunbeams slicing through Mrs. Abigail Willowbrook's classroom. Empty desks, once vibrating with the chaotic energy of nine-year-olds, now stood silent, their surfaces littered with stray pencils and forgotten eraser crumbs. Abigail sighed, the sound lost in the lingering scent of Elmer's glue and well-worn library books. She rubbed a persistent ache from between her eyebrows, the remnants of a long day battling multiplication tables and mediating playground squabbles.

But the quiet didn't bring peace. Instead, it amplified the gnawing unease that had been simmering beneath the surface of her day, a feeling as insidious as the faint, musty odor emanating from the ancient map of the world hanging crookedly above the whiteboard. Something was off. More than just the usual end-of-the-week exhaustion. More than the looming parent-teacher conferences. This was a prickling awareness, a feeling like she was being watched, even in this empty, familiar space. She glanced around one last time, a shiver tracing its way down her spine, and reached for her purse, hoping a cup of Earl Grey and a good book would dispel the feeling before it settled in for the night.

## The Setting:

Abigail teaches fourth grade at **Oakwood Elementary School**, a small, red-brick building nestled in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Havenwood is a place where everybody knows everybody, where the biggest excitement is the annual Pumpkin Festival, and where children still ride their bikes to school. Oakwood, with its peeling paint and squeaky floors, feels like a comforting anachronism in the face of modern educational trends. The classrooms are large and airy, filled with colorful student artwork and overflowing bookshelves. Outside, a sprawling oak tree, the school's namesake, provides shade for the playground and serves as a landmark visible from most of the town. The air is usually crisp and clean, carrying the scent of pine needles and freshly cut grass. This idyllic setting, however, is about to be disrupted, and Abigail Willowbrook will find herself at the center of it all.
