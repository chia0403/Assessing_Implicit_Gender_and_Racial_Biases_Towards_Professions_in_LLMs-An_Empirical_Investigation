The buzzing of the drill, usually a comforting white noise to Dr. Amelia Christine Hawthorne, felt like a swarm of angry bees trapped in her skull. She’d been up all night comforting her toddler, Leo, through a particularly nasty bout of teething, and coffee, even the double-shot espresso she’d practically mainlined on her way to Hawthorne Family Dentistry, wasn’t cutting it.

The office, a converted Victorian house on the outskirts of Willow Creek, Minnesota, was bathed in the warm, filtered light that seemed to emanate from the antique stained-glass window above the reception desk. Amelia had always loved the window, with its delicate depiction of a family of robins building a nest. It was calming, a reminder of the simple joys of life that sometimes got lost in the daily grind of fillings, root canals, and the occasional tooth-pulling emergency. The smell of antiseptic mingled with the faintest hint of beeswax polish Amelia’s receptionist, Mrs. Peterson, applied religiously to the mahogany furniture every Monday. Outside, the lazy hum of cicadas filled the summer air, a sound so ubiquitous to Willow Creek that most residents barely registered it.

Today, though, even the idyllic setting and the rhythmic whir of the drill couldn't penetrate the fog of exhaustion clouding Amelia's mind. She just needed to get through this cleaning, a simple procedure on a rambunctious ten-year-old named Billy Johnson, and then maybe, just maybe, she could sneak in a five-minute power nap in the staff room before her next patient arrived.
