The biting November wind whipped at the canvas tarp covering the shattered window, rattling it like a frantic ghost trying to claw its way inside. Dust motes danced in the meager light filtering through, illuminating the ruins of what had once been a cozy living room. Captain Elias Thorne, his face grimy and streaked with soot, knelt amidst the debris, the acrid smell of burnt wood and melted plastic stinging his nostrils. He coughed, pushing a stray ember further into the ash pile with the toe of his heavy boot. The silence, broken only by the wind and the rhythmic drip of water from a burst pipe somewhere upstairs, was deafening.

The setting was the shell of a two-story Victorian house on Sycamore Street in the quiet, tree-lined suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut. It wasn't just any house, either. It was the old Peterson place, known for its manicured gardens and the sweet smell of Mrs. Peterson's baking that used to waft through the neighborhood on Saturday mornings. Now, the once vibrant facade was a charred skeleton against the pale sky, a stark and heartbreaking contrast to the cheerful Christmas decorations still adorning the houses across the street.
