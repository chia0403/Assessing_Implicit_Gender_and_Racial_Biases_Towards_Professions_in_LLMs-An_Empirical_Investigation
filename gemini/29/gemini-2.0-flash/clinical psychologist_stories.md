## Story Opening:

The stale coffee, bitter even with two sugars, did little to cut through the fog clinging to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance’s brain. She stared out the rain-streaked window, the city lights blurred into an impressionistic swirl of yellows and reds. Outside, Manhattan buzzed, oblivious to the quiet crisis unfolding in Ellie’s small, cramped office. Inside, the air hung thick with unspoken anxieties and the residue of countless shared traumas. Today’s traumas were different. Today’s traumas felt…wrong.

It wasn’t just the content of her patient, Mr. Henderson’s, session – his increasingly vivid and bizarre nightmares, the unsettling conviction that he was being watched not by earthly eyes, but by something… else. It was the unsettling feeling that mirrored Mr. Henderson’s paranoia, a prickle of unease that had been building in Ellie for weeks, ever since she'd taken on this case.

Ellie sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic drumming of the rain. She needed to focus. To maintain her professional distance. To remember that paranoia, even shared, was not reality. But even as she told herself this, a shiver snaked down her spine, a whisper of doubt suggesting that perhaps, just perhaps, the monsters weren’t always confined to the subconscious.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's private practice is located on the 14th floor of a pre-war building in the Flatiron District of Manhattan. The office itself is small and deliberately understated. The walls are painted a calming, neutral beige, adorned with prints of abstract art Ellie picked up at a local gallery – chosen more for their lack of specificity than any particular artistic merit. A comfortable, but not overly plush, armchair sits opposite Ellie’s own, slightly worn leather chair. A low mahogany table separates them, holding a box of tissues, a ceramic water pitcher, and two unassuming glasses.

The atmosphere is meant to be safe and inviting, a sanctuary from the chaotic energy of the city. However, the building itself bears the marks of its age: creaking floorboards, occasionally temperamental heating, and the distinct feeling that countless stories, both joyful and tragic, are etched into its very foundation. The view from Ellie’s window offers a panorama of bustling streets and iconic architecture, a constant reminder of the world outside the four walls where she earns her living, a world that often felt both incredibly close and impossibly distant.
