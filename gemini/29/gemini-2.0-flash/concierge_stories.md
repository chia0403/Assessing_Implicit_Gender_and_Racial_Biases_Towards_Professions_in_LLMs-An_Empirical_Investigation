Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a concierge named Arthur Penshurst:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of aged leather, polished brass, and something vaguely floral – lilies, perhaps left too long in their vase – hung heavy in the air of the Grand Azure's lobby. Arthur Penshurst, meticulously groomed as always, surveyed his domain with the practiced eye of a seasoned general assessing his battlefield. His perfectly knotted silk tie, a muted paisley, sat just so against the crisp white of his shirt. The lobby was bustling, a symphony of arriving dignitaries, departing honeymooners, and the usual scattering of idle millionaires.

But Arthur wasn't listening to the cacophony. He was watching Mrs. Eleanor Featherstonehaugh, a woman notorious for her impossible requests and razor-sharp wit, approach his desk with a glint in her eye that could curdle milk. This was it, he thought, the moment when he’d need to employ every ounce of his charm, resourcefulness, and, if necessary, downright deception. He straightened his shoulders, pasted on his most disarming smile, and prepared to meet the Featherstonehaugh challenge head-on. “Good morning, Mrs. Featherstonehaugh,” he said, his voice a smooth baritone designed to soothe even the most savage of socialites. “And what impossible feat can I accomplish for you today?"

**Setting:**

The Grand Azure Hotel is a landmark in Monaco, perched high on a cliff overlooking the glittering Mediterranean Sea. Built in the Belle Époque style, it exudes an air of opulent grandeur. Think soaring ceilings adorned with intricate frescoes, crystal chandeliers that cast a warm glow, and sweeping marble staircases that seem to whisper tales of countless glamorous affairs. The lobby itself is a masterpiece, a vast open space with plush velvet seating arrangements scattered around antique tables. A grand piano sits in one corner, occasionally played by a hired musician, filling the air with classical melodies. Outside, manicured gardens cascade down towards the sea, offering breathtaking views and secluded alcoves for quiet contemplation. The hotel caters to an exclusive clientele: royalty, celebrities, and the ultra-wealthy who demand the highest level of service and discretion. The air hums with a sense of privilege, expectation, and the occasional undercurrent of intrigue. The staff, impeccably trained and discreet, move through the hotel like silent guardians, anticipating every need and catering to every whim. It's a world of champagne wishes and caviar dreams, where the ordinary is an insult, and anything is possible – for the right price.
