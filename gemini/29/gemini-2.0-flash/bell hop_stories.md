## Story Opening:

The scent of lilies and old money hung heavy in the lobby of the Grand Imperial Hotel, a scent Bartholomew "Bart" Finch had come to both loathe and rely on. It was the smell of privilege, the aroma of effortlessly acquired ease. Bart, standing ramrod straight beside the revolving doors, adjusted his gold-braided cap and plastered on a smile that felt more like a rictus. He watched as a woman draped in what looked suspiciously like a small, disgruntled poodle, entered the lobby, her heels clicking a staccato rhythm on the marble floor. He knew, with a bellhop's intuition honed by years of observing the comings and goings of the city's elite, that she would demand his immediate attention, and that whatever she required would be both incredibly specific and utterly unreasonable. He braced himself. Another day, another dollar, another drama unfolding within the gilded cage of the Grand Imperial.

## Setting:

The Grand Imperial Hotel, perched on the edge of the city's historic district, was a monument to bygone glamour. Built in the roaring twenties, its Beaux-Arts facade was a breathtaking display of sculpted stone and ornate detail. Inside, the lobby was a symphony of polished marble, soaring ceilings adorned with crystal chandeliers, and plush velvet seating. Liveried bellhops, like Bart, stood at attention, ready to cater to the whims of the wealthy and the powerful who frequented its hallowed halls. The air hummed with the hushed conversations of business deals being brokered, secret rendezvous being planned, and fortunes being both made and lost. The Grand Imperial was a microcosm of the city itself: a glittering facade masking a labyrinth of secrets and desires. The time is the present day, although the hotel retains a nostalgic, almost timeless feel.
