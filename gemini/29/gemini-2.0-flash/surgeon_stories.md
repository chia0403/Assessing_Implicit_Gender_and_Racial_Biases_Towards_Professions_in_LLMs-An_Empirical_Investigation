## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill clung to the air outside County General Hospital in a grimy corner of downtown Detroit. Streetlights, fighting a losing battle against the encroaching gloom, cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal trees lining the cracked pavement.

Ellie fumbled in her oversized purse for her ID badge, the plastic cold against her clammy fingers. Today, another day, she would once again be the one standing between life and death. Today, another day, she would try not to break.
