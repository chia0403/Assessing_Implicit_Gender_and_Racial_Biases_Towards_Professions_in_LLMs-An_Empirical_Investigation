## Story Opening and Setting

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic thump-thump-THUMP of the cleaver on the butcher block was the morning's alarm clock for the entire street. Arthur Percival Finch, proprietor of "Finch's Fine Cuts," had been wielding the blade before sunrise for longer than most could remember. This morning, however, the familiar cadence faltered. Arthur paused, the cleaver hovering mid-air, its polished steel reflecting the pale dawn light filtering through the shop window. He wasn't looking at the hanging carcasses of beef or the rows of plump sausages. He was staring, transfixed, at the small, handwritten note tucked beneath a freshly decapitated chicken. The crisp, almost menacing, script read: "The blood sings, Arthur. Are you listening?"

**Setting:**

The setting is the quaint, almost suffocatingly charming village of Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling green hills of the English countryside. Time seems to have slowed considerably here, resisting the relentless march of progress with the stubbornness of an ancient oak tree.

Finch's Fine Cuts is a cornerstone of Oakhaven life. Situated on the main street, its weathered wooden facade painted a cheery, if slightly faded, shade of butcher-shop red, the shop exudes an old-world charm. The scent of sawdust, smoked meats, and a faint metallic tang hangs heavy in the air. Inside, the walls are lined with gleaming white tiles, a stark contrast to the dark, varnished wood of the counters and the display cases overflowing with prime cuts of meat. Strings of sausages dangle from the ceiling, alongside hand-painted signs advertising "Mrs. Higgins' Famous Black Pudding" and "Arthur's Award-Winning Bacon." The air is always cool, a welcome respite from the summer heat, and often thick with the murmur of conversation as locals gather to gossip and discuss the day's events while Arthur expertly carves their orders. The shop is a place of community, of tradition, and, now, a growing sense of unease.
