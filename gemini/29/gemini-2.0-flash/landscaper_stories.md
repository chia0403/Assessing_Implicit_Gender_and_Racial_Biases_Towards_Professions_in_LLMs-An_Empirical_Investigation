Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, introducing our landscaper protagonist:

**Setting:**

The early morning air hung thick and humid, the kind of Georgia summer morning where even breathing felt like a workout. Spanish moss dripped from the ancient oak trees that lined the long, winding driveway of Ashton Manor, a sprawling antebellum estate just outside Savannah. The white columns of the mansion gleamed in the nascent sunlight, promising a cool respite from the oppressive heat. The scent of damp earth, blooming magnolias, and the faintest whiff of saltwater carried on the breeze.

**Opening:**

The familiar rumble of his beat-up Ford F-150 shattered the morning stillness. A plume of dust billowed behind it as it crunched to a halt in the circular driveway. **Jasper Elijah Bloom**, landscaper extraordinaire and owner of Bloom's Botanical Bliss, climbed out of the cab, stretching his back with a groan. He was a man built like the live oaks he tended – sturdy, weathered, and deeply rooted to the land. His hands, calloused and stained with soil, automatically reached for the brim of his worn baseball cap, shielding his eyes as he surveyed the grounds. Ashton Manor was a behemoth of a job, and one that paid handsomely, but its sheer size always made Jasper feel a little intimidated. Today's task: wrestle the unruly rose garden back into submission before Mrs. Worthington, the Manor's sharp-tongued owner, arrived from her Charleston vacation. He grabbed his trusty pruning shears, a glint of determination in his hazel eyes. "Alright, roses," he muttered to himself, "let's see who's really in charge here."
