The fluorescent lights of the Kepler-77 Research Facility hummed with the same monotonous energy as the cleaning machine under Bartholomew "Barry" Quibble's control. The air, filtered to an almost sterile point, smelled faintly of ozone and something indescribablyâ€¦ technical. It wasn't an unpleasant scent, but after ten years of mopping up spilled nutrient solutions and scraping bio-luminescent algae off experimental hydroponic trays, it had become the aroma of tedium personified.

Barry paused, the circular scrubbing head of the machine whining in protest. He wiped a sheen of sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smear of soapy residue. His shift was almost over, thank goodness. Just one more pass through the 'Xenobiological Adaptation' wing, and he could clock out, grab a microwaved dinner from the vending machine, and collapse into a puddle of exhaustion in front of the television.

Kepler-77 was a vast, underground complex burrowed deep within the arid plains of Nevada. It was a place of secrets, whispers of alien ecosystems, and scientific breakthroughs that never seemed to make it to the public. Barry knew very little of the specifics, of course. The scientists in their crisp white coats treated him like a ghost, barely acknowledging his presence as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors and sanitized their meticulously organized chaos. He was just the guy who kept the floors clean. Just Bartholomew Quibble, the unsung hero of hygiene in the search for extraterrestrial life.
