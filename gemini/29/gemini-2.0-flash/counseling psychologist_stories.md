## Opening:

The chipped porcelain of the mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's hands, a comforting heat against the perpetual chill that seemed to cling to her office. She stared out the rain-streaked window at the November sky, the grey mirroring the sludge of emotions she often sifted through with her patients. Today, the grey felt heavier, more personal. The appointment sheâ€™d just concluded with Mrs. Henderson had been particularly draining, the woman's grief for her lost cat palpable, thick in the air like incense smoke. Eleanor understood grief, perhaps too well.

A sharp knock at the door startled her, jolting her back to the present. "Come in," she called out, her voice a little rougher than she preferred.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's counseling office was located in the historic district of Beacon Harbor, Maine. The building itself, a converted Victorian townhouse, boasted a charming, if slightly dilapidated, facade with peeling paint and window boxes overflowing with dead petunias. Inside, however, Eleanor had worked hard to create a sense of calm and sanctuary.

The room was small, dominated by a plush, mismatched collection of armchairs and a comfortable, slightly sagging couch. A low coffee table, cluttered with books on mindfulness and anxiety, sat between them. The walls were painted a soothing, muted green and adorned with framed prints of Impressionist landscapes - calming scenes that often served as a silent, visual prompt during particularly challenging sessions. Sunlight, when it bothered to make an appearance, filtered through lace curtains, casting dappled patterns on the worn, wooden floor.

The overall effect was a deliberate attempt to create a space that felt both professional and welcoming, a place where patients could feel safe enough to unravel the tangled threads of their lives. But despite her best efforts, the lingering echo of past stories, the whispers of pain and hope, seemed to cling to the room, adding a subtle layer of weight to the atmosphere.
