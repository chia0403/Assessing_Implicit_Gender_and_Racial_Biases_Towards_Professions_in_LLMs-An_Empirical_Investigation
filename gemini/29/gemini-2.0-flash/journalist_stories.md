The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, tearing at the edges of Abigail Eleanor Harding’s threadbare wool scarf as she stared at the churning grey waves. She pulled the scarf tighter, her fingers numb despite the worn leather gloves she wore. Spurn Head, East Yorkshire. It was a bleak place, even on a good day. Today, with the sky a low, bruised purple, it felt like the edge of the world.

The abandoned lifeboat station, skeletal and rusted, stood sentinel against the relentless onslaught of the waves. It was here, according to her anonymous tip, that Abigail would find the story that would finally, irrevocably, break her out of the dreary confines of the *Hull Daily Mail* obituaries section.

She hadn't slept properly in days, fuelled by cheap coffee and the gnawing anxiety that this was either the biggest break of her career or the most elaborate practical joke ever played on a journalist scraping the bottom of the barrel. She had a name – Arthur Finch – and a vague location. And that was it.

The wind howled, a mournful cry that swallowed the sound of the waves crashing against the shingle beach. Abigail checked her watch. He was late. Maybe it was a joke after all. Maybe she should just go home, crawl under a duvet, and forget she ever heard the words "North Sea, Spurn Head, tomorrow at dawn".

But then, in the grey predawn light, a figure emerged from the swirling mist, a hunched silhouette against the stark landscape. Abigail took a deep breath, her heart hammering against her ribs. This was it.
