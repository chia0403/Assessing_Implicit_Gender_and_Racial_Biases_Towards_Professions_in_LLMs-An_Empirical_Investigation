Okay, here's a story opening with a registered nurse named Evelyn Reed as the main character, including setting details:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent beeping of the cardiac monitor sliced through the weary hum of the ICU like a rusty saw. Evelyn Reed, her navy scrubs clinging to her frame after a grueling twelve-hour shift, instinctively reached for the patient’s chart.  The name glared back at her from the plastic protector: Thomas Abernathy, 72, post-operative bypass. Evelyn knew the story by heart - a good candidate, surgery went well, but now his heart was sputtering, a fragile engine threatening to stall. She pressed a gloved finger to his wrist, feeling the faint, erratic pulse beneath the paper-thin skin.  Outside, the relentless rain hammered against the panoramic windows of the 17th floor, each drop a miniature drumbeat mirroring the frantic rhythm of Mr. Abernathy’s heart.  It was a storm inside and out, and Evelyn, armed with her years of experience and unwavering focus, was the only thing standing between Mr. Abernathy and the abyss.
**Setting Details:**

*   **Location:** The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of St. Jude's Hospital. A large, modern hospital located in downtown Chicago.
*   **Time:** Late evening (around 11:00 PM) on a rainy night.
*   **Atmosphere:** Tense, high-pressure, and filled with the beeping and whirring of medical equipment. The rain adds to the sense of urgency and isolation.
*   **Visuals:** Brightly lit, sterile, and dominated by banks of monitors displaying vital signs. The panoramic windows offer a dramatic view of the storm-swept city, but the lights of Chicago are blurred and indistinct. The stark white of the beds and equipment contrasts with the darker blues and greens of the nurses' scrubs.
*   **Sensory:**  The sounds of the monitors, the smell of antiseptic and cleaning solutions, the faint, metallic tang of blood, and the chill of the air conditioning all contribute to the clinical and slightly unsettling atmosphere.
