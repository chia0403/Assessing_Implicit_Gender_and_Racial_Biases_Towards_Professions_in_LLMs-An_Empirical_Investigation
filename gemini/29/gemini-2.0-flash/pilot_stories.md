The wind howled a mournful ballad through the corrugated metal of the hangar doors, a song Amelia Grace Holloway knew well. It was the sound of the high desert, of dust devils dancing on the horizon and the thin, biting air that tested both woman and machine. Here, at the edge of the Mojave Desert, where California bled into Nevada, sat the barely-there airstrip of Dust Devil Aviation, a collection of sun-bleached buildings and a single, stubborn Joshua Tree.

Amelia Grace Holloway, her name a jarring clash of elegance against the grit of her surroundings, wiped a smear of grease from her cheek with the back of her hand. The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the distant mountains, cast long, distorted shadows across the concrete floor. Inside the hangar, smelling of aviation fuel and the metallic tang of old engines, Amelia wrestled with the cowling of her pride and joy, a beat-up but beloved Beechcraft Bonanza she'd nicknamed "The Wanderer." Tomorrow, she was scheduled to deliver a crate of medical supplies to a small ranching community nestled deep in the Black Rock Desert, and The Wanderer wasn't feeling cooperative.
