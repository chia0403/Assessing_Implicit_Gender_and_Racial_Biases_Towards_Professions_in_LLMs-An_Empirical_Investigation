Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a legal drama, focusing on setting the scene and introducing the main character:

**Setting:**

The harsh Miami sun beat down on the polished chrome of the Biscayne Building, reflecting blindingly off its mirrored facade. The building, a modern monolith that housed a diverse array of law firms, buzzed with the frenetic energy of high-stakes deals and desperate pleas. Inside, the air conditioning fought a losing battle against the oppressive humidity, creating a sticky, slightly uncomfortable environment. The scent of expensive cologne mingled with the faint, lingering aroma of stale coffee, a testament to the long hours that kept the city's legal machinery churning.

**Opening:**

The muted buzz of the intercom jolted Eleanor Vance awake. She hadn't realized she'd drifted off, her head resting on a stack of deposition transcripts. A damp patch clung to her temple, a testament to the unrelenting Miami heat that even the firm's state-of-the-art AC couldn't completely conquer.

"Eleanor, you've got a visitor," Brenda's voice crackled through the speaker. "Says it's urgent. A Mr. Ricardo Alvarez."

Eleanor sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. "Send him in, Brenda. And bring me another one of those industrial-strength iced coffees, would you?"

She straightened her navy blue blazer, trying to appear more composed than she felt. Ricardo Alvarez. The name didn't ring any immediate bells, but in her line of work, that could mean anything. It could be a potential client with a multi-million dollar lawsuit, or a desperate soul clutching at straws, hoping for a miracle. More often than not, it was the latter. Eleanor Vance, Senior Associate at the prestigious law firm of Harding & Blake, had built her reputation on a blend of sharp legal acumen and a surprising dose of empathy. It was that empathy that often kept her up at night, wrestling with the weight of her clients' burdens. She braced herself. Whatever Mr. Alvarez had to say, it was bound to be messy.
