## Story Opening & Setting

**Opening:**

Dust motes danced in the single ray of late afternoon sun that pierced through the perpetually grimy window of her office. Penelope Agnes Plumtree sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic clatter of her ancient adding machine. Another month, another battle with the Baker & Sons’ ledger, another victory – or at least, a grudging truce. The stubborn old machine sputtered to a halt, spitting out a paper tape littered with numbers and Penelope's neat, almost frantic, calculations. She tore it off, her brow furrowed. Something still felt off. The balance should have been a perfect, satisfying zero, a testament to her meticulousness. Instead, a measly twelve cents stubbornly clung to the wrong side of the ledger. Penelope hated loose ends, especially loose ends measured in pennies.

**Setting:**

Penelope Agnes Plumtree's office was a small, cramped space at the back of Baker & Sons Wholesale Meats, a sprawling, somewhat dilapidated warehouse situated on the edge of the industrial district in the fictional town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The air, even in winter, carried the faint but undeniable aroma of cured ham and sawdust. The room itself was a testament to decades of accumulated paperwork. Stacks of invoices, delivery slips, and payment confirmations threatened to engulf Penelope’s worn, mahogany desk. A single, bare bulb hung precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows across the room. The walls were a sickly shade of green, peeling in places to reveal patches of faded, floral wallpaper from a bygone era. Beside the desk stood a towering bookshelf, crammed with ledgers dating back to the company's founding in 1903, each one meticulously labelled in a spidery, faded script. The only personal touch in the room was a small, framed photograph of Penelope’s late grandmother, a woman with a stern gaze and a mischievous twinkle in her eye. The picture stood as a silent reminder of the values Penelope held dear: honesty, hard work, and the importance of a perfectly balanced ledger.
