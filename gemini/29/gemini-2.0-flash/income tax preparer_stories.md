## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of H&R Block hummed a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to another soul-crushing April. Beatrice Eleanor Higgins, CFP (though she rarely mentioned the "CFP" part, feeling it smacked of pretension), adjusted her oversized glasses and sighed. Outside, a late afternoon drizzle was turning the parking lot into a shimmering sheet of despair. Inside, the air hung thick with the anxiety of impending tax deadlines and the faint, lingering scent of stale coffee and regret. Beatrice knew that scent intimately. It was the scent of her professional life.

A stack of crumpled W-2s and receipts threatened to topple over from the edge of her desk, a miniature monument to the organized chaos of tax season. She massaged her temples, a familiar ache throbbing behind her eyes. This year had been particularly brutal. More complicated forms, more confusing regulations, and a clientele that ranged from blissfully ignorant to aggressively suspicious. She longed for May, for the quiet hum of her apartment, for evenings spent curled up with a good book and a glass of Chardonnay, far, far away from the relentless ticking of the tax clock. But first, she had Mrs. Gable's farm income, and Mr. Henderson's suspiciously high business expenses, to conquer. And judging by the nervous fidgeting of the man currently pacing just outside her cubicle, her next challenge was about to begin.
