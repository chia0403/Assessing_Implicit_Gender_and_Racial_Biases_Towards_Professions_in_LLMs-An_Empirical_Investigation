The fluorescent lights of the "Healthy Habits, Happy Hearts" clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the daily anxieties of dietary doom. Outside, the late October wind whipped orange leaves down Elm Street, but inside, the air was thick with the scent of overripe bananas and nervous sweat. Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe but stylish bun, straightened the perfectly aligned rows of miniature plastic food models on her desk. She hated the smell of bananas. It always reminded her of her ex-husband's disastrous attempt to start a banana smoothie business.

Eleanor adjusted her reading glasses and sighed, the sound a small puff of exasperation in the otherwise sterile environment. Her clinic, nestled in the heart of the quaint, postcard-perfect town of Willow Creek, was usually a haven of calm. But this morning, something feltâ€¦off. Maybe it was the impending Halloween decorations going up everywhere, a sugar-laden assault on her professional sensibilities. Or maybe it was the looming arrival of her first patient, Mrs. Agatha Plumtree, who had an uncanny ability to derail any conversation into a detailed account of her prize-winning zucchini loaf. Whatever it was, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth felt a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. This was going to be one of *those* days.
