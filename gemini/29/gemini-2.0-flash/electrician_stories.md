The acrid smell of burnt plastic clung to the air, thick and suffocating, making Elias Thorne cough as he squinted through the gloom of the abandoned textile mill. Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, a relentless percussion against the already decaying edifice. He pulled his wool beanie further down his forehead, his breath misting in the frigid air.

Elias Thorne, electrician and, according to his wife, "purveyor of increasingly dangerous hobbies," had answered a cryptic ad online: "Power Restored: Historical Site." Historical site, his foot. This was more like a historical ruin teetering on the precipice of collapse.

The mill, once a proud pillar of the now-ghost-town of Redemption, Pennsylvania, was a cavernous beast of brick and rotting timber. Mountains of rusted machinery lay tangled like skeletal remains, draped in cobwebs thicker than his thumb. Sunlight, where it managed to penetrate the boarded windows, cast long, distorted shadows that danced eerily in the dust-laden air. The air was thick with the scent of damp wood, mildew, and something vaguely metallic, like old blood.

He hefted his battered tool bag higher onto his shoulder, the weight a comforting familiarity in this unsettling place. He knew he shouldn't be here. Everything screamed "danger" and "structural integrity compromised." But the challenge, the puzzle of coaxing life back into dead wires, the thrill of the unknownâ€¦ Elias Thorne couldn't resist. Besides, the money was good, and his wife was threatening to sell his vintage oscilloscope if he didn't bring home some extra cash soon. He just hoped whatever this "historical site" was restoring *to* was worth risking his neck.
