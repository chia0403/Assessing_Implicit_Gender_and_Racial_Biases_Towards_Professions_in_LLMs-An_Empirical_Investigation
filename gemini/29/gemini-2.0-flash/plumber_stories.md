## Opening:

The smell of old pipes and despair hung heavy in the air, a noxious cocktail that only intensified in the humid July heat. Leo Maxwell Figueroa sighed, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his grimy hand, and tightened his grip on the rusty monkey wrench. He'd faced worse smells, sure, but the oppressive silence of the house was what truly unnerved him. No TV drone, no creaking floorboards, no bark of a grumpy Chihuahua - just the low hum of the ancient refrigerator and the distinct feeling that he was being watched.

## Setting:

Leo was currently crouched beneath the sink in the kitchen of what had once been a grand Victorian house on Willow Creek Lane, on the outskirts of the small, somewhat forgotten town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The house, "Whispering Pines," was a two-story behemoth, its once pristine white paint now peeling and cracked, like sunburnt skin. Ivy, thick and unruly, clawed its way up the porch columns, threatening to swallow the entire structure whole. The front yard was a riot of overgrown weeds and wilted flowers, hinting at a former garden that had long been abandoned to the elements. The interior wasn't much better. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that managed to penetrate the grimy windows, illuminating chipped wallpaper and furniture shrouded in white sheets. The kitchen, though spacious, was dated beyond belief, boasting avocado green countertops and linoleum flooring that curled at the edges. It was a place where secrets seemed to cling to the shadows and the past refused to stay buried. Leo wouldn't have touched the job with a ten-foot pole if his Aunt Rosa hadn't practically begged him to help the new owner.
