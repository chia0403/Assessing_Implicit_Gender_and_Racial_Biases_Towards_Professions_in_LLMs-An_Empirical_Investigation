The first crack of dawn, a pale, watery blue, was just beginning to bleed into the inky black when the alarm shrieked on Archibald "Archie" Butterfield's bedside table. Archie groaned, a deep, guttural sound that vibrated through his chest, and slapped the snooze button with a calloused hand. Five more minutes wouldn't hurt, he reasoned, even though he knew perfectly well that five minutes invariably turned into twenty.

Archie lived in a small, weathered bungalow on the outskirts of the sleepy coastal town of Seabreeze, Oregon. The bungalow, painted a faded, seafoam green that was peeling in several places, looked like it was permanently braced against the relentless Pacific winds that howled through the area every fall and winter. His closest neighbors were a gaggle of seagulls who squawked incessantly from the dilapidated pier a few blocks away and Mrs. Higgins, a sweet but slightly eccentric old woman who kept a flock of miniature goats in her backyard. Archie liked the solitude, though; after a long day battling the elements on someone's roof, the quiet hum of the ocean was a balm to his tired soul.

Seabreeze itself was a town that time seemed to have forgotten. The once-bustling cannery had closed down years ago, and now the main street was lined with antique shops, quirky art galleries showcasing driftwood sculptures, and the occasional struggling cafe clinging to the hope of tourist season. The year-round residents, weathered and hardy like the town itself, mostly worked in the fishing industry, or, like Archie, in trades that kept the old buildings standing. It was a place where everyone knew everyone else's business, a place where secrets rarely stayed buried for long, and a place where Archie Butterfield, roofer extraordinaire, felt, for the most part, at peace.
