Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character named Abraham Thatcher:

**Opening:**

The smell of cedar and regret hung heavy in Abraham Thatcher's workshop, a scent almost as familiar as his own sweat. He hadn't seen a full day of honest work in nearly a month, and the silence of the un-chiseled wood screamed louder than any angry customer ever could. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, accusing fingers across the dusty floorboards, highlighting the abandoned projects, the half-finished rocking horse, the stack of birdhouses that would never sing. He ran a calloused hand over a piece of cherry, smooth and cold, a stark contrast to the burning in his gut. He was a carpenter, dammit, a craftsman, a builder of dreams, not a… a mourner.

**Setting:**

Abraham's workshop is a detached structure behind his modest, clapboard house in Havenwood, Maine. It's a sturdy, single-room building, built with his own two hands years ago, and imbued with the scent of decades of sawdust, varnish, and wood shavings. Sunlight streams in through the large, grimy windows, illuminating a chaotic, yet strangely organized space. Tools hang neatly on pegboards, each in its designated spot, a testament to Abraham’s meticulous nature – when he was working. Saws, chisels, planes, and hammers gleam with the patina of age and constant use. Workbenches, scarred and stained, line the walls, each littered with various stages of projects. A wood-burning stove sits in one corner, cold and unused. The overall feeling is one of well-worn comfort, a place of creation and quiet contemplation, now tainted by a palpable sense of abandonment and sorrow. Outside, the Maine woods press in close, a constant reminder of nature's indifference to human grief.
