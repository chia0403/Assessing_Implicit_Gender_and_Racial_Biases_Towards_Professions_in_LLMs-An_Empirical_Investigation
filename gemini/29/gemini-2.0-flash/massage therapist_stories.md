The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the scent of frangipani and something vaguely medicinal, a lingering waft of eucalyptus from the last client. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the small, turquoise-painted spa, creating a rhythmic drumming that usually soothed, but today felt like a relentless pressure against Annelise Briard's temples.

Annelise Briard, her dark hair escaping the loose bun at the nape of her neck, sighed and rubbed at the tension pinching the bridge of her nose. She loved her little piece of paradise – "Tranquility Haven," the sign proudly proclaimed in chipped, hand-painted letters – but Paradise had been throwing curveballs lately, and her serenity was starting to fray around the edges.

The spa itself was nestled just off the main drag of Port Douglas, Australia, a small coastal town brimming with tourists escaping the winter chill. It was a converted shed, really, but Annelise had poured her heart and soul into transforming it into a haven of calm. Lush green plants spilled from terracotta pots, casting dappled shadows across the worn wooden floor. Balinese textiles adorned the walls, adding pops of vibrant color against the calming turquoise. The massage table, her trusty companion, sat in the center of the room, draped in fresh, crisp linen, waiting patiently for its next occupant.
