The midday sun, a molten blob in the hazy Athenian sky, beat down on the Acropolis. Sweat trickled down Evangelia "Eva" Papadopoulosâ€™s brow, stinging her eyes as she squinted at the thirty-odd faces before her. They were a motley crew: a honeymooning couple from Ohio, a gaggle of giggling teenagers from Japan, a lone, serious-looking historian from Scotland, and a handful of others whose origins were harder to decipher. Eva adjusted the microphone clipped to her crisp, white blouse and summoned her most enthusiastic smile. She knew, no matter how tired she was, that she had to bring these ancient stones to life. This was her purpose, her passion, and the way she honored her heritage.

Eva stood near the Propylaea, the monumental gateway to the Acropolis, its marble columns gleaming white against the weathered rock. Behind her, the iconic Parthenon stood majestically, a testament to the ingenuity and artistry of the ancient Greeks, even in its ruined state. The air hummed with the murmur of other tour groups, the clicking of cameras, and the distant sounds of Athens buzzing below. Below them, the city sprawled, a chaotic yet captivating tapestry of whitewashed houses, ancient ruins, and vibrant modern life, all basking in the golden Mediterranean light. This was Eva's stage, and she was ready to begin her performance.
