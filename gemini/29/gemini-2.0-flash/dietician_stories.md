Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dietician:

**Setting:**

The stifling humidity clung to Savannah, Georgia like Spanish moss to an oak tree. It was mid-August, and even at 7:00 AM, the sun beat down with a ferocity that seemed determined to melt the cobblestone streets and turn the antebellum mansions into shimmering mirages. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth hated August. Not just because of the weather, but because it always seemed to bring a fresh wave of tourists, all determined to "indulge" in Southern cuisine, then frantically search for a quick fix to undo the damage. She could practically taste the regret and cholesterol from her office window.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, a registered and licensed dietician with a Ph.D. in nutritional science, sighed, tugging at the collar of her linen blazer. Even in her air-conditioned office, housed in a beautifully restored building on Chippewa Square, she felt the oppressive heat radiating from outside. Her first appointment of the day, a Mr. Bartholomew "Big Bart" Butterfield, was already fifteen minutes late. Eleanor chewed on the end of her pen, glancing at the carefully curated artwork on her walls â€“ all landscapes featuring vibrant, fresh produce. She liked to think the artwork subconsciously influenced her clients. Judging by the stacks of cookbooks promoting deep-fried everything that Big Bart's file contained, she had her work cut out for her. A deep rumble, like a distant freight train, heralded his arrival. The whole building seemed to shudder slightly as he entered. Eleanor braced herself. Another August, another culinary crisis.
