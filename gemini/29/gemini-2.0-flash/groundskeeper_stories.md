The crisp morning air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and blooming wisteria. Dew clung to the meticulously trimmed blades of grass, each tiny droplet reflecting the pale, pre-dawn light filtering through the ancient oaks of Oakhaven Manor. Inside, the wealthy elite slept soundly, blissfully unaware of the tireless work that went into maintaining their pristine paradise. But out here, in the hush before the estate woke, Augustine Silas Blackwood was already at work.

Augustine, his weathered hands already stained green from the day's first pruning, paused beside the Victorian-era fountain, its cherubic figures slick with moisture. The water trickled musically, a counterpoint to the chirping of the early birds. He glanced up at the Manor, its imposing stone facade a silhouette against the brightening sky. Oakhaven had been his domain for twenty years, a legacy he’d inherited from his father, and his father before him. He knew every inch of the sprawling grounds, every delicate rose and towering cedar, every secret path and forgotten grotto. It was more than just a job; it was in his blood, a silent pact made with the land itself. But today, as he surveyed the perfectly manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds, a sense of unease settled in his stomach. Something was different, something just out of place, a disharmony in the symphony of Oakhaven. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but Augustine Silas Blackwood, the groundskeeper, knew that something was about to change.
