The Dewey Decimal system betrayed Eleanor Abigail Finch that Tuesday. Not in the sense that it led her astray amongst the towering shelves of the Grandview Public Library – Eleanor could navigate those labyrinthine aisles blindfolded, categorizing the call numbers in her sleep. No, it was the *smell* of 641.5943 (German Cooking) that gave her away. The faint, yet undeniably pungent aroma of sauerkraut clung to her cardigan, a residual assault from the hastily shelved "Sauerbraten Secrets" that had just been returned by a gentleman with a penchant for garlic.

Eleanor, a librarian whose life revolved around quietude and the preservation of literary treasures, was currently attempting to discreetly stalk Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, the charmingly disheveled historian who haunted the local history section like a benevolent ghost. She’d been orchestrating “accidental” encounters for weeks, strategically placing herself near microfilm readers and pretending to be deeply engrossed in the genealogy of the Grandview founding fathers. Today, her plan involved strategically reorganizing the travel guides (910.2 – Travel Information and Services) to appear as though she'd been surprised in a sudden fit of organizational zeal.

The Grandview Public Library, affectionately known as "The Grand Old Dame," was a Victorian masterpiece, a cathedral of knowledge built from red brick and stained glass. Sunbeams, fractured and colored, streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above the hushed reading rooms. The scent of aging paper, leather bindings, and beeswax polish permeated everything, a comforting aroma that was Eleanor’s personal brand of aromatherapy. Today, however, it was battling a losing war against fermented cabbage.
