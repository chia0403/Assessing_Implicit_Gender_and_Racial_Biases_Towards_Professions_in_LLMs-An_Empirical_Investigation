## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The aroma of peppermint and desperation hung heavy in the air of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's waiting room. A low hum of New Age music attempted to soothe the frayed nerves of those seated on the worn, floral-patterned chairs, but it did little to mask the creak of arthritic knees or the stifled groans of sciatic agony. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her stool in her sun-drenched office, chewed nervously on the end of her pen. Her first patient of the day, a retired butcher with a neck as stiff as a frozen sausage, was a no-show. Again.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's practice, "Ainsworth Chiropractic & Wellness," was located in the heart of Willow Creek, a quaint, if slightly fading, town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon. Her office occupied the ground floor of a converted Victorian house, its pale yellow paint peeling in places, a testament to years of damp Oregon winters. The interior, however, was a carefully curated haven of tranquility (or at least, Eleanor desperately hoped it was). Sunlight streamed through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating shelves lined with anatomical models, pamphlets on healthy living, and a collection of vintage chiropractic charts salvaged from a dusty antique store. The treatment room was dominated by a well-worn, navy blue chiropractic table, its padded surface bearing the imprints of countless spines, each carrying its own story of pain, resilience, and the occasional miraculous adjustment. Despite the overall charm, a persistent draft snaked through the floorboards, a constant reminder of the building's age and Eleanor's perpetually tight budget.
