## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth swore under her breath, a frustrated puff of air that frosted in the biting February air. The lambing shed, normally a sanctuary of bleating hope in the depths of winter, had become a scene of chaotic desperation. Old Mrs. Hemlock's prize ewe, Agnes, was in distress, her first lamb stubbornly breech, and Eleanor's hands, already numb despite her thick gloves, were working with agonizing slowness. The reek of ammonia and afterbirth hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp, metallic tang of blood.  "Come on, Agnes, you magnificent beast," she muttered, her words a prayer whispered into the gloom. "Just a little more. We're almost there."

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the remote, windswept Yorkshire Dales, specifically in the small, close-knit village of Bramblewick. Bramblewick, nestled amongst rolling green hills and grey stone walls, is a community deeply reliant on agriculture, particularly sheep farming. The Hemlock family's farm, "Shepherd's Rest," is a sprawling, slightly ramshackle affair, a testament to generations of hard work and frugal living. The lambing shed, a long, low building attached to the main barn, is poorly lit and perpetually drafty, offering only the bare minimum of shelter to the ewes and their newborn lambs during the harsh winter months. Outside, the wind howls relentlessly, whipping snow against the windows and threatening to bury the entire farm under a blanket of white. The stark beauty of the Dales landscape, usually a source of solace, feels menacing and unforgiving tonight.
