The flickering fluorescent lights of Sector Gamma hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes’s late-night coding session. The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, clung to her like a damp shroud. Outside, the neon jungle of Neo-Kyoto glittered, a dizzying spectacle of holographic geishas and automated noodle stands that Amelia usually found exhilarating. Tonight, however, she couldn’t see past the lines of code dancing on her triple monitors, each one a potential rabbit hole leading to the heart of the system crash that had crippled the city’s energy grid.
