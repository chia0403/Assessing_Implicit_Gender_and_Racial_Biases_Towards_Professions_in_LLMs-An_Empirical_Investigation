**Story Opening:**

The biting wind off Lake Michigan howled like a banshee, clawing at Dr. Eleanor “Ellie” Ainsworth's exposed cheeks as she hurried across the snow-dusted parking lot. Inside, the fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Emergency Room hummed a sterile counterpoint to the natural chaos outside. A thin layer of slush clung to the soles of her boots, a constant reminder of the brutal Chicago winter that refused to loosen its grip.

Ellie checked her watch: 6:57 PM. Three minutes until the start of her shift, and already a knot of nervous energy was tightening in her stomach. Weekends in the ER were a lottery of the bizarre, the tragic, and the occasionally comical, but tonight, a premonition of something…off… prickled at the back of her neck. She'd learned to trust her instincts. More often than not, they were right.

**Setting:**

The year is 2024. St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling brick behemoth, dominates the landscape of Chicago's South Side. The ER, a labyrinth of gurneys, monitors, and harried medical professionals, is a constant churn of activity. The air is thick with the smells of antiseptic, disinfectant, and something vaguely metallic, a cocktail that Ellie had long since become immune to.

Beyond the bustling activity of the triage desk and the urgent calls echoing down the corridors, lie the smaller, more intimate examination rooms. Each one a tiny stage where dramas of life and death play out in rapid succession. Tonight, the winter chill seems to have seeped into the very bones of the building, adding a layer of discomfort to an already tense atmosphere.
