Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a character introduction:

**Story Opening:**

The first scent was always asphalt, hot and heavy, especially on days like this when the sun beat down like a blacksmith's hammer. Then came the exhaust, thick and acrid, courtesy of the endless stream of eighteen-wheelers barreling down I-80. For Eudora Beatrice Higgins, it was the perfume of her life, a bittersweet aroma that reminded her of freedom and responsibility in equal measure. Today, though, the usual symphony of highway sounds was overridden by a persistent, unsettling hum. It vibrated not just through her ears, but up through the soles of her work boots, a low thrum that felt distinctlyâ€¦wrong.

**Setting:**

The story takes place on a particularly desolate stretch of Interstate 80 in western Nebraska. It's late summer, bordering on early fall, with fields of dried cornstalks flanking either side of the highway as far as the eye can see. The sky is a blindingly bright, cloudless blue, offering no relief from the relentless heat. The asphalt of the highway shimmers under the sun, creating mirages that dance just above the surface. The only signs of civilization are the occasional truck stop or small town visible in the far distance, and the constant flow of traffic - a mix of long-haul trucks, family cars, and the odd motorcycle - all heading east or west across the vast, open plains. The highway maintenance crew's equipment - a battered orange dump truck, a steamroller, and a couple of portable generators - are parked haphazardly along the shoulder, baking in the heat.
