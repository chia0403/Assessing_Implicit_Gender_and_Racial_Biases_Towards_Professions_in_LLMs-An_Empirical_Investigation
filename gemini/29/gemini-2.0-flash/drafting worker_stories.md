Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of ammonia and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to the fabric of Arthur Reginald Penhaligon's already weary work shirt. He squinted, the fluorescent lights of the office reflecting off the celluloid of his trusty triangle. Another day, another deluge of blueprints. Today's assignment: the expansion of the Westbridge Water Treatment Facility, a project so gargantuan it felt like he was charting the course of a small, metallic continent. Arthur sighed, adjusting the worn leather wrist support he'd fashioned himself. He loved the precision of drafting, the feeling of lines solidifying into something real, but lately, the weight of these projects felt less like creation and more like a slow, methodical erosion.

**Setting:**

The year is 1978. Arthur works for "Evergreen Engineering," a mid-sized architectural and civil engineering firm nestled in the bustling, but increasingly industrial, outskirts of Seattle, Washington. The office itself is a sprawling, single-story building of cinder block and corrugated metal, a far cry from the sleek glass and steel structures they often designed for others. Inside, the atmosphere is a peculiar mix of intense concentration and low-level anxiety. Rows of drafting tables, each a personal kingdom cluttered with pencils, erasers, t-squares, and coffee stains, dominate the main room. Calculators click and whir like metallic locusts, the hum of the fluorescent lights a constant, droning presence. Outside, the sounds of construction – the clang of metal, the rumble of trucks, the shouting of foremen – serve as a constant reminder of the projects they were diligently bringing to life. There's a sense of boomtown prosperity, a feeling that Seattle is on the cusp of something big, but also an underlying tension, a premonition that the rapid growth might be unsustainable.
