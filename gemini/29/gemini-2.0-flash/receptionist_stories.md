The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Mildred Abigail Peterson’s otherwise unremarkable Tuesday morning. The scent of artificial pine, emanating from the automated air freshener, did little to improve the sterile atmosphere of "Synergy Solutions," a company whose name seemed deliberately at odds with the tedious reality of its day-to-day operations. Mildred, perched behind her vast, polished desk like a lonely ship captain navigating a sea of beige, surveyed the empty chairs. She’d already arranged the brochures for the company's various consulting services into a perfect fan, straightened the wilting peace lily (a birthday gift from last year, now clinging precariously to life), and even alphabetized the visitor badges. Time, it seemed, was determined to stretch out before her like a vast, unpopulated desert. This was the life of a receptionist, she mused, a master of minutiae and a slave to the clock. Just then, the elevator dinged, shattering the quiet like a dropped teacup, and Mildred straightened up, forcing a smile onto her face. "Synergy Solutions, how may I help you?" she chirped, her voice just a shade too high-pitched, as the doors slid open.
