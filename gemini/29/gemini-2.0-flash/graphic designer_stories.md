The persistent buzz of the fluorescent lights above her head hummed a dreary counterpoint to the energetic music blasting through Amelia Isabelle Carter’s noise-canceling headphones. It was nearly 3 AM, and the stale office air felt thick enough to cut with a linoleum knife. Outside, the neon glow of Seoul’s Gangnam district painted the rain-slicked streets in a vibrant, pulsating canvas, a stark contrast to the muted, perpetually-beige palette of "Creative Solutions," the advertising agency where Amelia found herself chained to her Wacom tablet.

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of fiery red hair – dyed that color out of pure, defiant boredom – behind her ear. Coffee had long ceased to be effective, and now she was running solely on the faint fumes of desperation and the faint, flickering hope that her boss, Mr. Kim, would actually approve the redesigned billboard for "Daehan Kimchi," a brand with a reputation for being stubbornly traditional.

She knew she was pushing the envelope, replacing the tired imagery of smiling grandmothers and overflowing earthenware pots with a sleek, minimalist design featuring a single, perfectly-placed kimchi leaf, bathed in a dramatic spotlight. It was bold, modern, and utterly un-kimchi-like. But Amelia believed, with the fervor only a sleep-deprived graphic designer could muster, that it was exactly what the brand needed to claw its way back into the hearts (and stomachs) of a younger generation. The question was, would Mr. Kim see it that way?
