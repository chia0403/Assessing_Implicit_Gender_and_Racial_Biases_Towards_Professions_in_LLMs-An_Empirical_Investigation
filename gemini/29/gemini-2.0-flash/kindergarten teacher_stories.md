The air in Mrs. Clementine "Clemmie" Abernathy’s kindergarten classroom at Meadowbrook Elementary always smelled faintly of sunshine, glue, and the peculiar, sweet scent of freshly-laundered fingerpaint smocks. This particular Monday morning, however, that familiar aroma was overpowered by something else entirely: the distinct tang of burnt toast. Clemmie, her auburn curls escaping the confines of her loosely-tied bun, frantically waved a paper plate at the smoke detector while simultaneously trying to prevent little Timmy Henderson from using a glitter glue stick to decorate his already heavily-glittered nostrils.

Meadowbrook Elementary itself was a squat, brick building nestled in the heart of the quiet, suburban town of Oakhaven, Ohio. Oakhaven was the kind of place where the biggest scandal of the year was usually Mrs. Peterson’s petunias getting mysteriously nibbled on (suspect: squirrels), and the most exciting event was the annual Fall Festival, complete with a pumpkin-carving contest and a pie-eating competition that always ended in a sticky mess. The school was just as idyllic – bright classrooms lined with student artwork, a sprawling playground with a well-worn jungle gym, and a staff that genuinely cared about the children in their care. It was a safe haven, a place of learning and laughter…most days, anyway. Today, with the lingering smell of burnt toast hanging heavy in the air, Clemmie suspected it was going to be one of *those* days.
