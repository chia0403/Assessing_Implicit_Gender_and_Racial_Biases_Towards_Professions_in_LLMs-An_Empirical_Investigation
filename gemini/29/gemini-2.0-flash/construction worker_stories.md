## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy, tasting of exhaust fumes and freshly cut asphalt. Angelo "Ange" Bellini, his sun-creased face slick with sweat, squinted against the glare bouncing off the steel girders that skeletalized the nascent skyscraper. He spat a stray pebble off his tongue, a habit ingrained from years of chewing on the grit that perpetually coated his clothes. He liked the grit. It was honest, a badge of honor earned through muscle and grit.

Today, however, something felt different. An odd, unsettling tremor ran through the steel, a vibration that wasn't quite earthquake and wasn't quite the rhythmic thump of the jackhammer three stories down. It wasâ€¦ sharper, more insistent. Ange paused, his calloused hand resting on the wrench clamped to a stubborn bolt, and scanned the horizon. No unusual weather patterns. No errant crane swings. Just the relentless grind of urban progress and a feeling crawling beneath his skin, a feeling that whispered, *wrong*.

## Setting:

Ange is working on a high-rise construction site in **Neo-Detroit, Michigan, 2077**. This isn't the Detroit of faded glory and Motown legends. It's a city reborn, a gleaming metropolis built on a foundation of advanced technology and simmering social unrest. Sleek hovercars zipped between the towering structures, casting long shadows across the perpetually overcrowded streets below. Holographic advertisements flickered across the building facades, vying for attention in a cacophony of light and sound.

The construction site itself is a chaotic dance of steel and concrete, a vertical symphony of clanging metal and shouted commands. Drones buzzed around, carrying materials and monitoring progress, while augmented reality interfaces overlaid blueprints onto the worker's visors. Despite the advancements, the work remained brutally physical. Ange, a man who preferred the tangible feel of wrench against bolt to the virtual world, often felt like a relic in this futuristic landscape. He was a craftsman in a world that increasingly valued automation, a man building the future with the sweat of his brow, even as that future threatened to leave him behind.
