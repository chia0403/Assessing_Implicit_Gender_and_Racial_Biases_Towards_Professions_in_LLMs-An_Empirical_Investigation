The cloying sweetness of honeysuckle hung thick in the air, doing little to mask the underlying aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves that clung to the crumbling stone of Oakhaven Manor. The oppressive humidity, a constant companion in the Louisiana bayou, made the sweat prickle on the back of Delilah Mae Broussard's neck. She hated the summer. Hated the gnats that buzzed incessantly around her face, hated the way her starched uniform shirt stuck to her like a second skin, and most of all, she hated cleaning the east wing of Oakhaven. It was always dampest there, farthest from the perpetually humming dehumidifiers, and seemed to attract the worst of the encroaching swamp.

Delilah paused on the threshold of the dusty drawing room, her fingers tightening on the worn handle of her feather duster. Sunlight struggled weakly through the grime-coated windows, barely illuminating the room's opulent, yet decaying, contents. A hulking mahogany desk sat hunched against the far wall, its surface piled high with yellowed letters and forgotten trinkets. Silk drapes, once a vibrant crimson, now hung in tatters, their faded glory a testament to Oakhaven's slow, inevitable decline. Delilah sighed. Another day, another battle against the forces of entropy in a house that seemed determined to crumble into the bayou it was built upon.
