Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character and the fact that he's a logger:

**Setting:**

The year is 1933. The place is a logging camp called "Whispering Pines," nestled deep in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. The air hangs thick with the scent of damp pine needles, sawdust, and woodsmoke. Colossal Sitka spruce and Douglas fir trees, some centuries old, stand like silent sentinels on all sides. The camp itself is a rough-and-tumble collection of wooden shacks, a mess hall, and a machine shop, all clinging precariously to the side of a steep, muddy slope. The sounds of axes biting into wood, the groan of falling timber, and the distant rumble of trucks fill the air during the day. At night, itâ€™s only the crackling of the campfire and the mournful hoot of an owl that pierce the darkness. The Depression has cast a long shadow, making even a dangerous job like logging seem like a lucky break.

**Story Opening:**

Silas Elijah Blackwood spat a wad of chewing tobacco onto the muddy ground and wiped his calloused hands on his worn denim pants. The morning mist clung to the massive, moss-draped tree before him, making its already formidable trunk seem even more imposing. Silas, a man built like a redwood himself, with shoulders broad enough to carry the weight of the world and eyes as blue and unforgiving as the winter sky, squinted up at its crown, gauging the angle, estimating the fall. This particular giant had stood watch over these woods for longer than anyone could remember, and today, it was Silas's job to bring it down.
