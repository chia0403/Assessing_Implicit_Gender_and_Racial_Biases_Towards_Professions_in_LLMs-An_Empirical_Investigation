The yeasty, warm air of the bakery hung heavy around Amelia Rose Briarwood like a comforting hug. It was 4:00 AM, the hour when most of the town of Havenwood dreamt of sugar plums and gingerbread, but for Amelia, it was when her day truly began. A soft, orange glow emanated from the ovens lining the back wall, their gentle heat chasing away the pre-dawn chill that seeped into the old brick building.

Havenwood itself was a town steeped in tradition, nestled deep in the verdant hills of Vermont. It was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, the leaves turned a fiery crimson in autumn, and the aroma of maple syrup hung perpetually in the air. "Briarwood Bakery," Amelia’s family legacy, had been a Havenwood fixture for over a century, its reputation built on generations of perfected recipes and the sheer love poured into every loaf.

Outside, a light dusting of snow had begun to fall, turning the quaint, cobblestone streets into a postcard-perfect winter scene. Inside, Amelia, her dark hair pulled back into a practical bun, was already elbow-deep in flour, humming a tuneless melody as she kneaded the dough for her famous sourdough. The rhythmic push and pull of her hands was almost meditative, a familiar comfort in the pre-dawn solitude. Today's menu was ambitious: cranberry scones, apple cider donuts, and, of course, her signature brioche, a recipe whispered down from her grandmother, a woman Amelia remembered only through sepia-toned photographs and the lingering scent of vanilla extract. Something felt different about this morning, though. A strange flutter in her chest, a premonition that today, the comforting routine of Briarwood Bakery might be…interrupted.
