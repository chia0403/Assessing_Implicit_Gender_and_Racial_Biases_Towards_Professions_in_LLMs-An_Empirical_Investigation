The fluorescent lights of Kramer & Finch hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Josephine Vargas’s late night. Stacks of meticulously organized deposition transcripts threatened to topple from the corner of her desk, forming a paper mountain range mirroring the exhaustion etched on her face. Outside, the Chicago skyline twinkled, a glittering distraction Amelia couldn't afford. She was on a deadline. Judge Thompson expected her memorandum of law in the morning, and the fate of the Johnson vs. Sterling Industries case rested, at least in part, on her ability to articulate the nuances of product liability law.

Kramer & Finch, a venerable firm located on the 47th floor of the Thompson Center, was known for its aggressive litigation strategies and its even more aggressive partners. Amelia, a paralegal with a sharp mind and even sharper wit, had carved a niche for herself as the go-to person for complex research and document review. She was good, damn good, but good wasn’t always enough in a city that ran on ambition and high-stakes legal battles. Tonight, the pressure was particularly palpable. A successful outcome in the Johnson case could mean a promotion, a coveted corner office, and maybe, just maybe, a little bit of respect from Mr. Finch himself.
