**Story Opening & Setting:**

The salt-laced wind whipped at Eleanor Ainsworth's hair, tugging strands free from her messy bun as she stared out at the churning grey of the North Sea. She stood perched on the edge of the crumbling cliff, the jagged rocks below a menacing reminder of the island's unforgiving nature.  The wind howled a mournful song around the abandoned lighthouse behind her, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  This was the perfect place to find inspiration, or so she kept telling herself.

Eleanor, a woman known for crafting whimsical tales of talking animals and enchanted forests, felt utterly lost. She was known for her fantastical novels that had topped the bestseller lists, but after struggling to come up with a new idea for her next book, she felt like a fraud. She’d come to the Isle of Skell, a remote, windswept speck of land off the coast of Scotland, hoping its wild, isolated beauty would shake loose the writer's block that had gripped her for months.  The rental cottage she’d secured in the tiny village, Port Morag, felt more like a prison than a refuge; its damp stone walls echoed with the silence of her unproductive days. All that came from hours of staring at the blank page was a growing sense of panic.

The air smelled of brine and peat smoke, carried on the wind from a distant chimney. A lone seagull cried overhead, its call a lonely counterpoint to the roar of the waves.  Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold. Something about the Isle of Skell felt different, older, more…alive than she had anticipated.  And the feeling wasn't comforting. As she turned to head back to her cottage, a glint of metal in the gorse bushes caught her eye.  A tarnished silver locket, half-buried in the damp earth, lay there, waiting to be found.  She picked it up, brushing away the clinging soil.  An icy chill ran up her spine.  This island, she suspected, held secrets far darker than any she had imagined, and she was about to stumble right into the middle of them.
