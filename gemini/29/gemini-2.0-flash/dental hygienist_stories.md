Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dental hygienist named Clara Beatrice Miller:

**Setting:** A perpetually overcast Tuesday in late October. The air hangs thick with the smell of damp leaves and woodsmoke in the small, historic town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The Havenwood Dental Clinic, a squat brick building attempting a cheerful facade with a newly painted blue door, sits just off the main square, overshadowed by the looming, gothic architecture of the Havenwood Historical Society building.

**Opening:**

The hiss of the suction and the low hum of the ultrasonic scaler filled the small operatory, a familiar symphony that usually soothed Clara Beatrice Miller. But today, even the routine click of Mrs. Higgins' partial denture against the side of the tray couldn't drown out the unsettling feeling gnawing at Clara's insides. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, was regaling Clara with the latest gossip about the annual Havenwood Harvest Festival pie-baking contest, but Clara's mind was miles away, replaying the scene from last night. The flickering gaslight of the Historical Society, the glint of something metallic in the shadows, and that bone-chilling whisper... Was she truly imagining things? She scrubbed a little harder at a stubborn coffee stain on Mrs. Higgins' lower incisors, hoping the physical activity would ground her. "So, Clara, dear," Mrs. Higgins mumbled around the suction tube, "You think my rhubarb pie has a chance this year? Ethel Mae Simmons is entering her infamous black walnut, you know." Clara forced a smile. "I'm sure it's delicious, Mrs. Higgins. But let's focus on those pearly whites first, shall we?" Even to her own ears, her voice sounded strained, a nervous tremor betraying the calm facade she worked so hard to maintain. Havenwood was supposed to be safe, predictable, a haven from the chaos of the world. But something, Clara feared, was about to change.
