## Story Opening:

The scent of microwaved popcorn and teenage anxiety hung heavy in the air of the guidance office, clinging to the worn floral armchair and the overflowing in-tray like a persistent cough. Ms. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth, guidance counselor extraordinaire and resident optimist of Northwood High, sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. The last bell had rung twenty minutes ago, but her desk was still a battlefield littered with college brochures, scholarship applications, and crumpled tissues stained with mascara.

Another student, another crisis. Another reminder that even in the seemingly idyllic suburb of Oakhaven, Maryland, life for a seventeen-year-old could feel like navigating a minefield blindfolded. Ellie straightened her posture, a practiced move honed over fifteen years of listening to broken dreams and budding romances, and plastered on her most reassuring smile. She had three more appointments before she could finally escape the fluorescent glow and return to the blessed quiet of her small, book-lined apartment. Three more opportunities to offer a lifeline, a kind word, a sliver of hope in the face of the overwhelming pressure of adolescence.

## Setting:

**Location:** Northwood High School, Oakhaven, Maryland.

**Time:** Late afternoon, October.

**Description:** Oakhaven is a quintessential American suburb, boasting tree-lined streets, meticulously manicured lawns, and a palpable sense of community. Northwood High School, a brick building softened by climbing ivy, sits at the heart of it. The school itself is a mix of old and new, with creaky wooden floors in the older wings and sleek, modern labs added in recent renovations.

Ellie's guidance office is a small, somewhat cluttered space on the second floor. Posters advertising SAT prep courses and college open houses plaster the walls. The aforementioned floral armchair provides a (theoretically) comfortable space for students to confide in her. Her desk, usually piled high with paperwork, is currently dominated by a half-eaten bag of microwave popcorn (her emergency sustenance) and a stack of meticulously organized student files. Sunlight streams through the window, painting dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the room, adding to the feeling of exhaustion that permeates the space.
