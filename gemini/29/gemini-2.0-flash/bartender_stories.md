Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the full name of the main character, who is a bartender:

**Setting:** The Rusty Nail, a dimly lit, perpetually smoky bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. It’s a haven for tourists seeking cheap thrills and locals seeking solace in stiff drinks. Mismatched antique furniture crowds the space, and the air hangs thick with the scent of spilled beer, cheap cologne, and regret. The walls are adorned with peeling vintage posters, faded photographs of jazz legends, and the occasional, questionably authentic, voodoo charm. The hour is late – closer to dawn than midnight – and the usual cacophony of tourist chatter has thinned to a low hum of hushed conversations and the clinking of glasses.

**Opening:**

The ice pick chipped a sliver off the iceberg wedge, sending it skittering across the scarred mahogany bar. A low, mournful saxophone wailed from the ancient jukebox in the corner, mirroring the feeling churning in Bernadette Louise Dubois’ gut. Bernadette, or Bernie as most knew her, wiped down the counter with a practiced hand, the damp cloth barely making a dent in the sticky residue of a thousand spilled Hurricanes. She'd seen it all behind this bar: drunken proposals, tearful confessions, bitter fights, and the occasional, inexplicably enthusiastic karaoke performance. Tonight, though, the air felt different. Heavier. Ominous.

A lone figure sat hunched at the far end of the bar, bathed in the anemic glow of a flickering neon sign that advertised a brand of beer Bernie wouldn’t serve if you paid her. He hadn't ordered anything in the last hour, just nursed the same half-empty glass of something dark and amber, his face hidden in shadow. Usually, Bernie wouldn't give a customer a second glance. But there was something about this man, something in the way he carried himself, that pricked at her instincts. It was a feeling she knew well, a subtle dissonance in the rhythm of the night, like a sour note in a jazz solo. And in a place like the Rusty Nail, that usually meant trouble was brewing.
