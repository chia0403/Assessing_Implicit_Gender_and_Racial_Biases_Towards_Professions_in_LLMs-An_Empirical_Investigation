## Story Opening:

The air in the interrogation room was thick with silence, a silence broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the fluorescent lights overhead and the subtle creak of the old metal chairs. Dr. Evelyn Reed, forensic psychologist and specialist in high-risk offender profiling, leaned forward, her gaze unwavering on the man across the table. He was a mountain of a man, built like a brick wall, yet his eyes darted nervously, betraying a vulnerability he tried desperately to conceal. The scent of stale coffee and something acrid, like burnt sugar, clung to the air, a grim reminder of the long hours spent within these walls.

“Mr. Kowalski,” Evelyn began, her voice calm and measured, a stark contrast to the tension that crackled in the small room. “Let’s go back to the beginning, shall we? Tell me about the doll.”

## Setting:

The setting is a dimly lit, claustrophobic interrogation room in the **King's County Correctional Facility** located in **Brooklyn, New York**. The room is sparsely furnished with a steel table bolted to the floor, two uncomfortable metal chairs, and a one-way mirror that Evelyn knew concealed a team of detectives and prosecutors eagerly awaiting a breakthrough. The walls are painted a drab, institutional grey, chipped and scarred with the history of countless confessions and denials. Outside, the constant hum of the city – sirens, traffic, distant shouts – serves as a stark reminder of the chaos and crime Evelyn dedicated her life to understanding.
