The stale scent of cheap whiskey and regret clung to Leo Maxwell's trench coat like a bad memory. He hated Tuesdays. Especially Tuesdays that began with a sunrise choked by smog and a dame with legs that could curdle milk. The dame, a vision in emerald green satin that screamed "money" and "trouble," perched precariously on the edge of his office chair, her lipstick a defiant smear of crimson against the pallor of her skin. Rain hammered against the grimy window of his office, a pathetic symphony mirroring the state of his bank account.

Leo's office, located on the fifth floor of the barely-standing Bradbury Building knock-off on Hope Street, hadn’t seen a lick of paint since Truman was in office. The peeling wallpaper, a faded floral pattern clinging desperately to life, spoke volumes about his success rate. A single, bare bulb cast a harsh light on the chipped mahogany desk littered with cigarette butts, half-empty coffee cups, and the detritus of a life lived mostly on the margins. The only decoration, besides the aforementioned peeling wallpaper, was a framed photo of a pug named Winston, Leo's ex-wife's prized possession and a constant reminder of his failings. He hadn't seen Winston in three years, not since… well, that was a story for another Tuesday.
