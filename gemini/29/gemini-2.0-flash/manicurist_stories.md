The clatter of tiny glass bottles was the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s life. It usually soothed her, a percussive rhythm in the chaotic ballet of her salon, “Graceful Fingers” in the heart of Little Italy, San Francisco. But today, the clatter felt more like a frantic drum solo, a nervous energy vibrating through the small, sun-drenched space and mirroring the feeling in Amelia's chest.

Graceful Fingers was a riot of pink and gold. Pink walls, accented with gold-framed vintage posters of glamorous women with impossibly lacquered nails. Gold-rimmed mirrors reflected the bustling street outside: the aroma of fresh basil battling with exhaust fumes, old men arguing in rapid-fire Italian on park benches, tourists snapping pictures of the overflowing flower boxes hanging from every window. The three manicure stations were draped in floral-printed cloths, each meticulously set with sterilized tools, hand creams with names like “Bella Rose” and “Golden Sunshine,” and a dizzying array of nail polishes, arranged by color and brand in a rainbow that threatened to topple over.

Amelia herself, perched on her stool, fidgeted with her own perfectly manicured nails – a shimmering, almost holographic, shade of lavender. Usually, she found solace in the meticulous work, the artistry of shaping, buffing, and painting, the connection she forged with her clients as she listened to their stories. But today, her hands felt clumsy, her focus scattered. She kept glancing at the clock, its ticking sounding like a judge's gavel, reminding her that it was almost time for *him* to arrive. The air, thick with the scent of acetone and anticipation, felt heavy, charged with an undercurrent Amelia couldn’t quite decipher.
