The biting wind whipped around Miss Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's ankles, snagging at the hem of her tweed skirt. She hunched deeper into her old, but beloved, duffel coat, the faux fur collar scratching against her chin. Above her, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter of Blackwood High School clawed at the perpetually grey sky. It was early. Too early, Eleanor thought, even for a Tuesday in late November in Blackwood, Pennsylvania. A scattering of amber streetlights cast a weak, sickly glow across the deserted parking lot, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the frigid air.

Blackwood, a town nestled deep in the Allegheny Mountains, was exactly the kind of place people left, not arrived in. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a scent Eleanor usually found comforting, but this morning it felt heavy, almost oppressive. Blackwood High School, a hulking, brick edifice that looked more like a Victorian-era penitentiary than a place of learning, only amplified that feeling. Its stained-glass windows, depicting scenes of idealized pastoral life that clashed violently with the reality outside, seemed to mock her as she fumbled with her keys.

Eleanor wasn't from Blackwood. She was a refugee from the city, running from a life she hadn't quite managed to build, and she found herself teaching English Literature to teenagers who, frankly, couldn't care less about the Brontës or Shakespeare. But this year, she’d promised herself, would be different. This year, she would make a difference. This year, she would find something, anything, to love about Blackwood, Pennsylvania. This year, she just needed to survive.
