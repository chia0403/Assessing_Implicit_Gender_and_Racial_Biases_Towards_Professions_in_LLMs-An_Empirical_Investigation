## Story Opening:

The screech of the emergency exit door slamming open was the only warning. A frigid blast of Himalayan air punched into the cabin, snatching at loose belongings and whipping Sarah Eleanor Hawthorne’s blonde ponytail across her face. Her meticulously applied red lipstick suddenly felt like a ridiculous, clownish mockery of preparedness.

Sarah hadn’t even finished her pre-landing checks. Landing was supposed to be another fifteen minutes, smooth and uneventful into Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. But the sudden, catastrophic decompression, coupled with the jarring lurch of the plane, had rewritten the script entirely.

Her practiced smile evaporated, replaced by a knot of cold terror in her stomach. This wasn’t the kind of turbulence you warned passengers about with a reassuring "flight attendant demo." This was the kind of turbulence that threw oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling and sent carry-on luggage tumbling like dice in a cosmic game.

She grabbed the nearest seatback, knuckles white against the worn fabric, her ears popping with sickening ferocity. Years of emergency training kicked in, a robotic mantra battling the panic that threatened to overwhelm her. Breathe. Assess. Assist.

But as she peered through the swirling chaos towards the gaping hole in the side of the aircraft, framed by jagged metal and the dizzying panorama of snow-capped peaks, Sarah Eleanor Hawthorne couldn’t shake the chilling premonition that this was more than just a textbook emergency. This was the beginning of something far, far stranger.

## Setting:

**Inside a Boeing 737-800, flying over the Himalayas.** Specifically, Flight KP402, a relatively new plane leased by a Nepalese airline for the peak tourist season. The interior is well-maintained but shows subtle signs of heavy use: slightly frayed edges on the seat cushions, a persistent hum from the aging air conditioning system, and the faint aroma of stale curry in the overhead compartments.

The cabin is about 70% full, a mix of adventure tourists, Nepali businesspeople, and returning expats. Many are glued to their devices, taking advantage of the spotty onboard Wi-Fi. The air is thick with the murmur of conversations in multiple languages, punctuated by the occasional chime of a call button. Sunlight streams through the windows, painting the interior in a warm, deceptively peaceful glow, an ironic contrast to the unfolding disaster. The external setting is breathtaking: a vast expanse of snow-covered mountains under a brilliant blue sky, a landscape both majestic and unforgiving.
