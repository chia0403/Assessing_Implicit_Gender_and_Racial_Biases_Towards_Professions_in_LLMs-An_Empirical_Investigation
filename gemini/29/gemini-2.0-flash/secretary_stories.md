The relentless hum of the fluorescent lights was Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's constant companion. They flickered just enough to catch the edge of her vision, a tiny, maddening strobe effect against the muted beige of the office walls. It was 2:17 PM, according to the digital clock perched precariously on the edge of her overloaded desk, and the afternoon slump had officially set in. Agnes, a woman whose life seemed to have been predestined for filing and answering phones, sighed, the sound barely audible above the drone of the air conditioning and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Mrs. Hendershot's manicured nails on her keyboard two cubicles over.

Agnesâ€™s workspace was a microcosm of her existence: meticulously organized, yet overflowing. Stacks of manila folders threatened to topple, each labeled in her neat, precise script. Post-it notes, adorned with reminders about Mr. Abernathy's dry cleaning and Mrs. Fitzwilliam's luncheon reservation, clustered around her monitor like colorful barnacles. A single, wilting African violet sat on the corner of her desk, a valiant, but ultimately failing, attempt to inject some life into the sterile environment of Abernathy, Fitzwilliam & Finch, Attorneys at Law, on the 27th floor of the prestigious Sterling Building in downtown Chicago.

Outside, the city sprawled in a chaotic tapestry of steel and glass, a vibrant, bustling world that Agnes only glimpsed through the perpetually dusty windows. Today, however, the skyline was obscured by a thick, grey blanket of rain, reflecting the melancholic mood that had settled over Agnes like a lead weight. She stared at the drops streaking down the glass, each one a tiny, fleeting reminder of the life she wasn't living.
