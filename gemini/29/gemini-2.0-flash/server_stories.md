Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of silverware hitting porcelain was a lullaby to Anya Petrova. It wasn't a pleasant one, maybe more a discordant lullaby of late-night exhaustion and barely-there tips, but it was familiar. Tonight, the discordant notes were particularly shrill, each scrape of a fork against a plate echoing the hollow ache in her own stomach. Anya plastered a smile on her face, a reflex honed over years of navigating the capricious moods and bottomless appetites of diners at "The Golden Spoon." She tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, the faint scent of marinara sauce clinging stubbornly to her fingertips, and approached Table Seven. A family of four – two perpetually-scowling teenagers, a weary-looking mother, and a father whose face was perpetually buried in his phone – sat in stony silence, their half-eaten lasagna congealing before them.

"Everything to your liking, folks?" Anya asked, her voice bright despite the fatigue pulling at the corners of her eyes.

**Setting:**

"The Golden Spoon" is a family-style Italian restaurant located in a faded strip mall on the outskirts of suburban Chicago. The interior is a pastiche of red-and-white checkered tablecloths, faux-Tuscan landscape paintings that have seen better days, and dim lighting that attempts, and mostly fails, to mask the wear and tear. The aroma is a potent mix of garlic, oregano, and something vaguely industrial that emanates from the perpetually overworked dishwasher in the back. It's the kind of place where birthday parties are celebrated with forced enthusiasm and the special occasion is a coupon good for 20% off on Tuesdays. Outside, the parking lot is perpetually sticky from spilled soda and discarded napkins, and the flickering neon sign above the entrance hums a constant, buzzing counterpoint to the din inside. It is a space where dreams come to get a day job.
