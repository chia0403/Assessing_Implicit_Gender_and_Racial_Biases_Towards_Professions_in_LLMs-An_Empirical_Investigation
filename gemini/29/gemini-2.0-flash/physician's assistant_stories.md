## Story Opening:

The smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a sterile perfume that clung to Dr. Amelia Hernandez’s nostrils even after she’d clocked out for the day. Today, it was particularly acrid, a harsh reminder of the overflowing waiting room and the endless stream of coughs, complaints, and anxieties she'd navigated. Exhaustion pressed down on her, a physical weight settled deep in her bones. All she wanted was to peel off her scrubs, pour a glass of wine, and forget about charting for at least twelve glorious hours.

As Dr. Hernandez shut down her computer, the muted beeping of the heart monitor from examination room three echoed through the otherwise empty clinic. It was just a phantom sound, a trick of her tired mind, she told herself. Dr. Peterson, a family practitioner with a penchant for early departures, had already locked up his rooms. Yet, the persistent, rhythmic beep continued, a insistent whisper in the otherwise silent building. A shiver ran down her spine, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the malfunctioning thermostat.

Against her better judgment, she turned and headed towards room three. It was probably just a glitch, something she could fix in five minutes. But the small voice of responsibility, the one that had led her to this demanding but ultimately rewarding career, wouldn’t let her walk away. 

Her name, carefully embroidered in navy thread above the pocket of her scrub top, read: **Eleanor Maeve Campbell, PA-C.** And Eleanor Maeve Campbell never ignored a distress signal, even if it was just a phantom beep in a darkened clinic.

## Setting:

The story begins in the **Hopewell Family Clinic**, a modest medical practice located in the small, rural town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Havenwood is nestled in a valley surrounded by rolling hills, a picturesque community known for its annual apple festival and its close-knit population. The clinic itself is a single-story brick building, functional but uninspired, built in the 1970s. 

Inside, the decor is a mishmash of well-worn furniture, faded landscape prints, and posters promoting healthy eating habits. The examination rooms are small and utilitarian, each equipped with a standard examination table, a sink, and a blood pressure cuff that probably needs recalibrating. The waiting room, usually bustling during the day, is now eerily quiet, the chairs lined up neatly like expectant patients awaiting their turn. The lighting is fluorescent and unflattering, casting long shadows across the empty space. The overall impression is one of comfort and competence, if a little outdated. It's a place where generations of Havenwood residents have come for their aches, pains, and check-ups, a fixture in the community, but tonight, under the cloak of darkness, it feels decidedly different. It feels…unsettling.
