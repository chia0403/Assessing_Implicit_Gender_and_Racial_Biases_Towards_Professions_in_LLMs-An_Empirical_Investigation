## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The year is 1957. The air in Juniper, Montana hangs thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. The town itself clings to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, a scattering of clapboard houses, a single dusty main street, and the ever-present rumble of logging trucks echoing through the valleys. The sun, a blood-orange orb in the crisp autumn air, casts long shadows across the weathered facades, making even the cheerful green of the “Juniper Hardware & Feed” sign look somehow melancholic.

**Opening:**

The ringing of the bell above the door was almost deafening in the otherwise silent office. Alistair Finch, his tie loosened and collar slightly askew, startled, nearly knocking over the precariously stacked pile of paperwork threatening to topple from his desk. He straightened his spectacles, perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, and peered over the top. A woman stood silhouetted in the doorway, her face obscured by the backlighting of the late afternoon sun. 

"Can I help you?" Alistair asked, his voice a touch sharper than he intended. He’d been wrestling with Mrs. Gable’s catastrophic hen house fire all afternoon, and his patience was wearing thinner than the threadbare carpet beneath his worn leather shoes.

The woman stepped forward, revealing a face etched with worry, framed by tightly curled blonde hair. "Mr. Finch, I presume? I need to talk to you about life insurance. For my husband, Dale." Her voice was soft, barely a whisper, and Alistair suddenly felt a prickle of unease crawl down his spine. This wasn't going to be another simple policy renewal. He could feel it in his bones. And Alistair Finch, insurance agent for the good people of Juniper for the past twenty years, had learned to trust the instincts that came with a lifetime of calculating risk. He just hoped this one didn't involve more than just paperwork.
