The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia Hawthorne’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors.  A faint, rosy blush painted the eastern sky, mirroring the blush of the sourdough starter bubbling merrily in its crock on the counter.  The air, still thick with the night’s dampness, carried the promise of rain and the already familiar aroma of warm bread – a comforting, yeasty perfume that had permeated Amelia’s life since she was a child, kneading dough alongside her grandmother in this very shop, “Hawthorne’s Hearth.”  The bell above the door, a tarnished brass relic from a bygone era, tinkled a lonely welcome to the empty street, its sound swallowed by the quiet murmur of the awakening city beyond.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb overhead, danced in the pale light, a silent waltz to the rhythm of Amelia’s heartbeat, already quickening with the day’s work ahead.
