The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather’s salon, "Shear Bliss."  Rain lashed against the oversized windowpanes of her quaint, Victorian-era shop on Bleecker Street, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears.  Inside, the only illumination came from a single, flickering gas lamp above her work station, casting long, dancing shadows across the plush velvet chairs and the antique vanity laden with jars of brightly colored creams and powders.  Sera, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, hummed a low, melancholic tune as she expertly sculpted a client's unruly curls, the orange glow highlighting the sharp concentration in her emerald eyes.  Outside, the storm raged; inside, Sera worked her magic, oblivious to the tempest brewing both inside and outside the walls of Shear Bliss.
