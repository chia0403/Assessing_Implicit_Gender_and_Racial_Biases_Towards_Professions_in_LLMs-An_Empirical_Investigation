The stale air of the server room hung heavy, a humid blanket woven with the faint ozone scent of a thousand whirring fans.  Amelia “Mia” Hernandez, a systems analyst with a caffeine addiction rivaling that of a small nation, squinted at the blinking lights of the rack.  The rhythmic hum, usually a soothing white noise, tonight felt like a relentless, accusatory drone.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the digital symphony within, rattling the reinforced windows of the data center like skeletal fingers tapping impatiently.  Mia, clad in a faded band t-shirt and jeans, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, felt the familiar prickle of anxiety crawl up her spine.  This wasn't just a routine server check; something was profoundly wrong.  The rhythmic pulse of the network, usually a steady heartbeat, was erratic, spiking and dipping like a fever chart.  Tonight, the city's digital arteries were hemorrhaging data.
