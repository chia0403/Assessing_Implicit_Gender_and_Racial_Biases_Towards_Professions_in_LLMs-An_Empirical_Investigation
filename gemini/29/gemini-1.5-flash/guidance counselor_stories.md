The chipped porcelain mug warmed Elara Vance’s hands, a meager defense against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of Northwood High’s guidance office.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The scent of stale coffee and angst hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to the worn, floral-patterned armchair where Elara usually sat, offering comfort and (hopefully) sage advice. Today, however, the comfort felt brittle, the sage advice elusive.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees clawed at the sky, their silhouettes grim against the bruised purple twilight.  Inside, Elara stared at the overflowing in-tray, each file a potential crisis, each student a story waiting to unravel, a life teetering on the precipice of something unknown.  This was her Tuesday.  This was Northwood High.
