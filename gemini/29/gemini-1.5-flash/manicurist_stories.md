The chipped turquoise paint of the "Mani-Cure-osity" sign flaked onto the already dusty windowsill, mirroring the state of Esmeralda "Esme" Valenti's own spirits.  A humid Louisiana summer hung heavy over the small, square salon nestled between a failing bakery and a pawn shop on the less-than-desirable side of Lafayette.  The air inside, thick with the cloying sweetness of nail polish remover and the faint, underlying scent of beignets gone stale, was almost as suffocating as the heat outside.  Esme, her usually vibrant crimson nails now a dull, almost apologetic shade of pink, slumped onto her worn, vinyl-covered stool, the rhythmic whir of her electric file a lonely counterpoint to the mournful sigh of the ancient air conditioner.  The only customer of the day, a grumpy old woman named Mrs. Dubois, had just left, complaining about the price of a basic manicure and the "insolence" of Esme's silence.  Another slow day in paradise, Esme thought, the weight of unpaid bills pressing down like the summer humidity.
