The biting November wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor Vance’s coat as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of Blackwood Manor.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, clinging to the collar of her sensible, navy wool coat.  Blackwood Manor, a Gothic behemoth perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the turbulent North Sea, was less a building and more a brooding, gothic exclamation point against the bruised twilight sky.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and dissociation, hadn't expected the beauty of the location to be so unsettling.  The beauty felt… brittle, like a flawless porcelain doll on the verge of shattering.  Tonight, however, the unsettling beauty was entirely secondary to the chilling reason for her visit.  She was here to see Mr. Silas Blackwood, a man whose reputation preceded him like a shadow, a man whose sanity, or lack thereof, was the subject of intense, whispered speculation throughout the county.
