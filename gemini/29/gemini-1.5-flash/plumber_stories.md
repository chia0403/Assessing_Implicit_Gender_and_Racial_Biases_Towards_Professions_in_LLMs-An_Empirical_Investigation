The rusty swing set groaned a mournful tune in the blustering November wind, its chains rattling like the bones of some forgotten beast.  Fallen leaves, the color of bruised plums and decaying cigars, clung to the damp grass of Mrs. Periwinkle's overgrown lawn.  A thick, grey fog, smelling faintly of woodsmoke and something vaguely metallic, clung to the quaint, crooked houses of Oakhaven, obscuring the already fading light.  This was the kind of day that made even the hardiest souls yearn for a crackling fire and a steaming mug of something strong.  For Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, however, it meant another callout.  His trusty van, affectionately nicknamed "The Plunger," coughed and sputtered its way up the rutted driveway, its headlights cutting feeble swathes through the gloom.  Barty, a man whose hands were perpetually stained a mixture of grease and pipe cleaner, sighed.  Another blocked drain.  Another day wrestling with the subterranean mysteries of Oakhaven's aging plumbing system.
