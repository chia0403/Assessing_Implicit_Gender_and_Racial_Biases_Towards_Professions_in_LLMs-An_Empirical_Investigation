The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Northwood High” sign flaked onto the asphalt like a dying sunset, mirroring the slow, agonizing fade of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s enthusiasm.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of Tuesday that tasted of lukewarm coffee and the faint, desperate scent of desperation clinging to the air conditioning vents.

Eleanor, however, felt the secret wasn’t forgotten; it was actively trying to suffocate her.  The late summer heat hung heavy and humid, promising a day of sticky desks, restless teenagers, and the ever-present hum of teenage angst threatening to overwhelm her already frayed nerves.  Today, however, felt different.  A tremor of something… unsettling… vibrated beneath the familiar routine.
