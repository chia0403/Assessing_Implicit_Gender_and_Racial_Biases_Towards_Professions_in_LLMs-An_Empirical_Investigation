The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elara Jean Blackwood's fingertips as she polished a already gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug, blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor Store" sign across the street into a hazy, crimson smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, lingering sweetness of cheap perfume, a familiar perfume of desperation and fleeting hope.  The only other occupant was a stray cat, a skinny ginger thing huddled beneath a wobbly table, its eyes reflecting the flickering gaslight overhead like twin embers of defiance.  Elara sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drumming of the rain.  Another slow night at The Rusty Mug, another night spent listening to the cityâ€™s melancholic symphony.
