The air hung thick and humid in the courtroom, a miasma of stale coffee and simmering resentment.  Judge Evangeline "Eva" Moreau tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against the polished mahogany of her bench, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the frantic whispering emanating from the gallery.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rather unsettlingly serene-looking Justice, sliced across the dust motes dancing in the air.  Outside, the relentless New Orleans summer beat against the courthouse walls, a relentless percussion only slightly less oppressive than the case before her: *State v.  Beauchemin*, a tangled web of accusations involving a vanished fortune, a family feud older than the city itself, and a defendant who seemed to exude an aura of simmering, almost supernatural, menace.  Eva, however, was unfazed.  She'd seen worse, handled worse, and sent far worse to places far worse than the stifling courtroom where she now sat, the weight of the city, and its secrets, settling heavily on her shoulders.
