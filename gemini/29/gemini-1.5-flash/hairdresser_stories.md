The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Jean Blackwood truly appreciated.  Amelia, or Amy as most of her clients called her (though she'd much prefer the formality, especially on Mondays), sighed, her reflection staring back from the dusty, silver-framed mirror behind the styling chair.  Rain lashed against the single, mismatched windowpane of her tiny salon, "Shear Perfection," tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually damp, yet charming, coastal town of Port Blossom. The town itself was a postcard come to life, all pastel-colored houses clinging to the cliffside, overlooking a turbulent sea that mirrored the unpredictable moods of its inhabitants.  The only sounds competing with the relentless drumming of rain were the mournful cry of gulls and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears, a counterpoint to the melancholic sigh of the wind.  Tonight, however, even the familiar comfort of her scissors felt inadequate.  Tonight, something feltâ€¦ different.
