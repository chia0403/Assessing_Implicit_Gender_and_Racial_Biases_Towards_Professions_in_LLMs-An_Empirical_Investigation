The rasp of steel on granite echoed through the silent quarry, a lonely counterpoint to the mournful cry of a distant hawk.  Dust, the fine, grey powder of a thousand shattered dreams, motes in the pale afternoon sun, clung to everything: Elias Thorne's calloused hands, his worn leather apron, the very air he breathed.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the slow, deliberate strokes of his chisel, stood poised above a colossal block of grey, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The quarry itself, a gaping maw carved into the side of a windswept mountain, was a testament to generations of such men, a place where the whispers of ages past mingled with the sharp tang of freshly broken stone.  The air held the scent of damp earth and crushed quartz, a perfume both bracing and melancholic â€“ a fitting aroma for a man whose art was as much about subtraction as it was creation.
