The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Holloway's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy canvas onto the easel.  The salt spray from the churning North Sea, a relentless grey-green beast under a bruised, purple sky, stung her cheeks.  She stood perched precariously on a jagged outcrop of rock, the wind howling a mournful symphony around her, the only sound besides the rhythmic crash of waves against the unforgiving cliffs of Cornwall's dramatic coastline.  Her small, weathered cottage, barely clinging to the cliff face like a barnacle, was a speck of warm ochre against the bleak landscape. This was her sanctuary, her studio, her obsession â€“ a place where the untamed beauty of the sea and sky battled for dominance on her canvases, and where Mia, armed with nothing but paint and brushes, sought to capture their raw, elemental power.
