The recycled air hung thick and stale, a miasma of cheap coffee, stale perfume, and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name a whisper against the roar of the engines, adjusted the tiny silver wings pinned to her crisp, navy uniform.  It was a gesture as automatic as breathing, a silent reassurance in the face of the turbulence that had buffeted Flight 747 for the last hour.  Outside, the inky blackness of the Atlantic pressed against the fuselage, punctuated only by the occasional flash of lightning –  a malevolent strobe light in a drama far beyond Amelia’s control.  The plane, a lumbering metal bird, pitched and yawned, groaning under the weight of the storm and the anxieties of its passengers.  This wasn’t just another transatlantic flight; tonight, Amelia felt the weight of the world – or at least, a very significant chunk of it – resting on her perfectly manicured shoulders.
