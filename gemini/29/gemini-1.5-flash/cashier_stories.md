The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's otherwise silent existence behind the chipped Formica counter.  Rain lashed against the smeared windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted gas station across the street.  The only other sound, besides the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner, was the low, steady drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet somewhere in the bowels of the ancient building.  Elara, her nametag slightly askew, meticulously arranged a stack of discount candy bars, her movements as precise and predictable as the automated lottery ticket dispenser beside her.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ a familiar fragrance in this forgotten corner of Oakhaven, Ohio.
