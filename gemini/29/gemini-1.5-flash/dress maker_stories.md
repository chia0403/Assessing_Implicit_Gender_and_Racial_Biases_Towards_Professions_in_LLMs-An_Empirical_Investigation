The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the chipped porcelain dolls perched on every available surface.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime on the windowpanes, cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workroom.  This was the sanctuary of  Elara Genevieve Beaumont, a dressmaker whose fingers, gnarled with years of stitching and pressing, still held a remarkable dexterity.  Her small shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight city of Porthaven, was a haven of forgotten elegance, a place where the ghosts of bygone eras whispered amongst the spools of thread and bolts of faded brocade.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elara's needle against the fine fabric provided the only consistent sound in the quiet, expectant stillness of the morning.
