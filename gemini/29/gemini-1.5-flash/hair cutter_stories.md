The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of lavender and something faintly metallic – a perfume only Amelia "Mia" Bellweather truly understood.  It was the smell of a freshly-sharpened shears, mingled with the lingering aroma of hairspray and the subtle tang of human sweat, a fragrance as familiar to her as her own breath. Mia, owner and sole operator of "Shear Genius," perched on a worn leather stool behind her antique barber's chair, the faint hum of the nearby city a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her scissors.  Her tiny shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town, was a sanctuary – a chaotic yet comforting haven tucked away from the relentless pulse of the tourist throngs.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a mischievous cherub wielding a pair of shears, dappled the worn wooden floorboards.  Outside, the Charles Bridge hummed with the murmur of a thousand conversations, a distant symphony to the quiet intimacy of Mia's world.
