The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Sunflower Class!" sign flaked onto the already cluttered welcome mat, a miniature testament to the chaotic, vibrant energy contained within.  It was 7:45 AM, the pre-dawn hush of the quiet suburban street a distant memory, replaced by the high-pitched squeals and the thunderous rumble of tiny feet echoing from within the brightly colored walls of Room 104 at Sunny Meadows Elementary.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose perpetually cheerful smile was only slightly less vibrant than the sunflowers that adorned her classroom, inhaled deeply, the scent of crayons, Play-Doh, and slightly-too-sweet apple juice filling her lungs.  It was another Monday, and another day of adventure in the land of finger painting, naptime negotiations, and the never-ending quest for lost shoes.
