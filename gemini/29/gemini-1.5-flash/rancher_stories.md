The wind, a rasping, gritty hand, clawed at Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed his spread.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and red, danced across the parched earth of the Broken Spur Ranch, the setting sun painting the mesas in fiery hues of orange and purple.  The air, thick with the scent of dry sagebrush and the faint, metallic tang of blood – not from a recent kill, but the lingering memory of a harsh, unforgiving land – hung heavy in his lungs.  Elias, a man etched by years of sun and struggle, squinted against the dying light, his gaze sweeping over the skeletal remains of cattle – a silent testament to the relentless drought that had gripped the Arizona Territory for the past three years.  The ranch, once a vibrant tapestry of green and brown, was now a skeletal outline of its former self, a landscape mirroring the gnawing emptiness in Elias's own heart.
