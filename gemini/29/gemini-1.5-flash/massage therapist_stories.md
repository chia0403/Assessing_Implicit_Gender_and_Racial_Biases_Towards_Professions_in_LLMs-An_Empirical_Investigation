The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the biting November wind howling outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy grey.

The lawyer’s rhythmic sighs were the only sounds besides the quiet whisper of the flames, a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside. Elara, however, wasn’t entirely focused on the lawyer's knots; a different kind of tension was tightening in her own chest, a premonition prickling at the edges of her awareness. Something was wrong, something… unsettling.
