The acrid bite of woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that clung to Lieutenant Evelyn “Evie” Reed like a second skin.  It was a scent that spoke of charred timber and fear, a scent that tonight, clung to the damp, pine-needle-strewn earth of the Redwood National Park with particular malice.  Towering redwoods, their ancient bark scarred and blackened, clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  A choked orange glow pulsed through the gaps in their immense trunks, a morbid heartbeat against the backdrop of the whispering, wind-tossed canopy.  Evie, her face smudged with soot and her fire-resistant Nomex jacket damp with sweat, adjusted the weight of her axe.  The crackling symphony of the inferno, a malevolent orchestra playing its final movement, urged her forward. This wasn’t just another wildfire; this felt…personal.
