The salt spray stung Officer Anya Petrova's face as the October wind whipped her hair across her eyes.  She wrestled it back, the familiar scent of brine and decaying seaweed doing little to ease the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  The craggy cliffs of Cornwall loomed above, their silhouettes stark against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Below, the Atlantic churned, a restless beast mirroring the turmoil in her own heart.  The small fishing village of Portwenn, usually picturesque with its bobbing boats and quaint cottages, was tonight draped in an unsettling stillness, broken only by the mournful cry of gulls circling the shrouded figure slumped on the wet stones at the base of the cliff path.  Anya knew, even before she reached the body, that this wouldn't be a simple case of a drunken fisherman taking a tumble.  This feltâ€¦ different.  More sinister.
