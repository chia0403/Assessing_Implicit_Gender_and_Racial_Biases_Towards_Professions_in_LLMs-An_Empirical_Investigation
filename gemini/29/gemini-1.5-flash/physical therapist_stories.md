The salt spray kissed Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from the rocky outcrop.  Her fingers, usually nimble at manipulating the intricacies of the human musculoskeletal system, were stiff and raw from the relentless grip of the coarse twine.  The wind, a raw, untamed beast, howled a mournful ballad around the jagged cliffs of the Isle of Skye, its icy breath whipping her thick, auburn braid across her cheek.  Below, the turbulent Atlantic churned, a frothing expanse of grey and white under a bruised, storm-laden sky.  Evelyn, however, barely registered the spectacular, if somewhat menacing, scenery.  Her focus remained entirely on the recalcitrant net, a microcosm of the stubborn resistance she often encountered in her own practice, but on a far less picturesque scale.  This was her escape, this windswept corner of Scotland, a sanctuary far removed from the sterile environment of her physiotherapy clinic in Inverness.
