The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face, a familiar discomfort she barely registered.  The November wind, however, howled a different tune – a mournful, almost frantic melody that whipped through the skeletal branches of the cypress trees lining the crumbling seawall.  Below, the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic gnawed at the concrete, a relentless rhythm mirroring the anxiety churning in Amelia’s own stomach. The air hung thick with the scent of brine and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling that clung to the back of her throat.  She adjusted the collar of her worn, navy trench coat, its warmth a paltry shield against the biting wind and the creeping unease that had settled over the small, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom since the disappearance of fisherman Silas Blackwood three weeks ago.  Amelia, a seasoned investigative reporter for the *Boston Globe*, knew a good story when she smelled it, and the stench of something rotten was far stronger than the sea air today.
