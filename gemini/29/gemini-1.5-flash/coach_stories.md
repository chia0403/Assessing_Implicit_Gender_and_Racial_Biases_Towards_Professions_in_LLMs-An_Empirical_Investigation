The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she surveyed the frost-covered field.  Exhaled breaths plumed white against the pre-dawn gloom, mirroring the icy tension she felt tightening in her chest.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a smell that usually soothed her, but this morning only served to amplify the gnawing anxiety.  This wasn't just another practice for the Wolverines; this was the regional championships, and the weight of their hopes, and her own reputation, pressed down on her like the unforgiving weight of the freshly fallen snow.  The floodlights hummed a mournful tune above the sparsely populated stands, illuminating the skeletal branches of the surrounding oaks that clawed at the bruised, twilight sky.  Amy adjusted her worn, navy blue Wolverines jacket, the team logo – a snarling wolf’s head – feeling strangely less fierce than usual.  This year, everything felt different.  This year, everything hung in the balance.
