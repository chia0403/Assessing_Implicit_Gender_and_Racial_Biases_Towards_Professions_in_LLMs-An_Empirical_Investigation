The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying plantains and exhaust fumes.  Dr. Evelyn Reed adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the weight of her laptop and overflowing files a familiar burden. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the early morning hour, clinging to the wisps of hair that escaped her neat bun.  Evelyn, a registered dietitian and nutritionist with a specialty in community health, navigated the bustling streets of Santo Domingo, the cacophony of car horns and vibrant chatter a stark contrast to the quiet, sterile environment of her office back in Boston.  This wasn't a vacation;  this was fieldwork, a six-month immersion into the heart of the Dominican Republic's food culture, a project she’d poured her heart and soul – and a substantial amount of grant money – into.  Her mission: to understand the dietary habits of the local population and develop a sustainable nutrition program, one that wouldn't just offer advice but also respect and integrate the rich tapestry of Dominican cuisine.  Today, she was visiting Mercado Modelo, a sprawling market overflowing with the vivid colours and intoxicating aromas of the Caribbean.
