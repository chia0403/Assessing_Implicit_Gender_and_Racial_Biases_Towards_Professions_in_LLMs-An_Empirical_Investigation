The salt spray stung Chef Aurelia “Rel” Davenport’s face as she wrestled the recalcitrant fishing boat’s tiller.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking behind the jagged peaks of the Isle of Skye, cast long shadows across the churning grey water.

The air, thick with the tang of brine and peat smoke from the distant crofts, crackled with impending fury.  This wasn’t exactly the idyllic setting she’d envisioned for perfecting her new seafood bisque recipe, but then again,  inspiration, like the best scallops, often came from the most unexpected places.
