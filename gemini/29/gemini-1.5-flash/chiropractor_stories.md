The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the collar of her navy peacoat pulled high.  Rain, sleeting now, plastered the already-drab leaves to the pavement of Oakhaven, a town so quaint it bordered on cliché.  Gabled roofs, dripping with icy water, leaned over narrow streets lined with shops that seemed to whisper of a bygone era – a vintage bookstore with a window overflowing with dog-eared classics, a bakery whose aroma of cinnamon and sugar fought valiantly against the chill, and, finally, her own practice, Hawthorne Holistic Health. The weathered sign creaked in the wind, its chipped paint hinting at the long, sometimes arduous, hours Amelia dedicated to easing the aches and pains of Oakhaven's residents. Inside, the waiting room, usually a haven of calming lavender and soft jazz, was currently a desolate space, the only sound the rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock in the corner.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, a premonition settling in Amelia’s gut, colder than the sleeting rain.
