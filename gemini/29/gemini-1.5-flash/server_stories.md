The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Amelia Hernandez's hand, a familiar discomfort in the fluorescent glare of the Sunrise Diner.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour of the greasy spoon, the time when the lingering smell of burnt coffee battled with the faint, metallic tang of last night's spilled blood orange juice.  Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the deserted street.  Amelia, her name stitched in faded cursive onto the breast pocket of her stained apron, sighed, the sound swallowed by the hum of the refrigerator and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet lull was broken by a low, persistent whine that seemed to emanate from somewhere deep within the diner's aging structure, a sound that prickled at the edges of Amelia's already frayed nerves.
