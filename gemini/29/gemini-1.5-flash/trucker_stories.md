The biting Montana wind howled a mournful tune around Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's rig, a symphony of ice scraping against metal and the groan of his aging eighteen-wheeler.  He sat hunched in the worn leather of his driver's seat, the flickering glow of the dashboard illuminating his tired face, etched with the map of a thousand lonely highways.  The cab, smelling faintly of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the lingering scent of pine from a previous load of lumber, felt like a second skin, a refuge from the vast, unforgiving landscape outside.  Snow, thick and relentless, plastered the plains in a blinding white expanse, blurring the already indistinct line between road and sky.  The only other visible landmarks were the skeletal branches of wind-battered trees, clawing at the heavens like desperate hands.  Zeke's destination: Havre, Montana.  His cargo: a shipment of frozen beef, ticking away the minutes in the refrigerated trailer behind him, a silent passenger on this perilous journey.  But it wasn't the weather that worried Zeke tonight. It was the feeling, a cold knot tightening in his gut, that something was wrong, something more sinister than a blizzard brewing.
