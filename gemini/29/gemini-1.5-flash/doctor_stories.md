The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the stubborn oak door of the old Victorian manor open.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her coat to her back, clinging to the wool like a second skin.  Grey light, barely filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient trees surrounding Blackwood Manor, cast long, skeletal shadows across the decaying stone steps.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something faintly floral yet undeniably…rotten.  This was it, the culmination of months of investigation, a case that had haunted her waking hours and bled into her dreams – the disappearance of  Lord Ashworth, a man whose wealth was only surpassed by the chilling rumours that clung to him like the persistent fog that often shrouded the estate.  Eleanor shivered, pulling her collar higher, not entirely from the cold.  A prickling unease, deeper than the chill wind, settled in her bones. This wasn't just a missing person's case; something far more sinister was at play within Blackwood Manor's decaying walls.
