The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume only a bibliophile could truly appreciate, hung heavy in the air of the Grand Archives of Eldoria. Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, meticulously straightening a row of crumbling tomes bound in human skin (a rather unfortunate legacy of the city's less enlightened past), sighed. The silence, usually her sanctuary, felt oppressive today, a suffocating blanket woven from the weight of untold centuries of knowledge and the anxieties gnawing at her own heart.  Outside, the relentless Eldorian wind howled, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eleanor's fingers on the spine of a particularly stubborn volume.  The Grand Archives, usually a haven of order and quiet contemplation, felt poised on the brink of somethingâ€¦unsettling.
