The chipped paint of the Rialto Theatre’s backstage door flaked onto Isabella “Izzy” Moreau’s worn leather boots as she wrestled it open.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of decaying roses and the metallic tang of old greasepaint, a scent Izzy had come to associate not with nostalgia, but with the relentless, exhilarating pressure of opening night.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb swinging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the gloom like frantic stagehands preparing for a chaotic performance.  The Rialto, a once-grand dame of the city’s theatre district now clinging to life by its fingernails, was a fitting backdrop for Izzy’s latest, most ambitious, and possibly most disastrous production:  "The Tempest," reimagined as a punk-rock opera set in a dystopian wasteland.
