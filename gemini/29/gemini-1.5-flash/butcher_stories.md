The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood, iron, and sawdust, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butchershaw.  It clung to him like a second skin, a testament to years spent behind the slick, marble counter of his family's butcher shop, "Butchershaw's Best," nestled on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough's old market district.  The year was 1923, and the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* of Barty's cleaver against the chopping block provided a steady, almost hypnotic, counterpoint to the clatter of the market and the distant rumble of horse-drawn carts.  Grimsborough, a town clinging stubbornly to its Victorian past despite the creeping tendrils of modernity, was a place of shadows and secrets, and Barty, with his calloused hands and keen eye, knew more than most about the hidden cuts of both meat and character.  This particular Tuesday morning, however, promised something different.  A chill, colder than the morning air, had settled in Barty's bones, a premonition that the day's butchering would involve more than just prime cuts of beef.
