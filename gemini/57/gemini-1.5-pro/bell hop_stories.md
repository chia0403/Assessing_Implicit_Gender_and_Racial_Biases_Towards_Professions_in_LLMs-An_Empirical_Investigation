The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air onto the bustling lobby, a welcome respite from the sweltering Charleston summer. Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass depiction of a palmetto tree above the entrance, painted kaleidoscopic patterns across the marble floor.  Finely dressed guests, dripping with pearls and smelling of expensive perfume, drifted through the opulent space like elegant swans on a placid lake.  Amidst this ballet of wealth and leisure, Silas Finch, his navy uniform crisply pressed and his cap perched jauntily on his head, stood at his designated post by the imposing mahogany reception desk, a picture of youthful attentiveness.  His eyes, the colour of warm honey, scanned the arriving guests, anticipating the next opportunity to offer his assistance â€“ a heavy suitcase to carry, a direction to give, a door to open with a flourish.  He knew the Grand Majestic, its secrets and its rhythms, as intimately as he knew the lines on his own palm.  This wasn't just a job; it was his stage, and Silas, with his quick wit and infectious smile, was ready to perform.
