The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the Victorian mansion, rattling the ancient windows and whipping Amelia "Milly" Cartwright's already wind-chapped cheeks.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, dusting the overgrown topiary in the neglected gardens of Hemlock Hall.  Milly, hunched against the cold in her thick overalls, hefted her toolbox, its weight a reassuring presence against the creeping unease that settled in her stomach whenever she visited this place.  Hemlock Hall, perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, had a reputation. Locals whispered of strange noises, flickering lights, and a general sense ofâ€¦wrongness.  But Milly wasn't one for ghost stories.  She was a plumber, and a damn good one.  A leaky pipe was a leaky pipe, regardless of whether it resided in a crumbling seaside manor or a suburban semi-detached.  Besides, the pay was exceptionally good, and Milly needed every penny she could get.  This time, the call had been about a burst pipe in the west wing, a part of the house supposedly closed off for decades.  Milly adjusted her headlamp and took a deep breath of the salty, snow-laden air. Time to get to work.
