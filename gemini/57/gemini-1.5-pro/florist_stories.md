The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Evelyn Ainsworthâ€™s shears.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, shimmered under a late October sun, the air crisp and scented with woodsmoke and the last gasp of autumn roses.  Inside, Evelyn, her auburn hair tucked behind one ear, was coaxing a cascade of burgundy dahlias and ivory hydrangeas into a frothy arrangement.  The shop, small but brimming with life, was a riot of color and fragrance.  Sunbeams, filtered through the large front window, danced across buckets overflowing with lilies, snapdragons, and chrysanthemums, turning the droplets of water clinging to the petals into miniature rainbows.  Evelyn hummed along to the gentle jazz playing softly on the radio, utterly content in her floral haven, oblivious to the storm brewing just beyond the horizon.
