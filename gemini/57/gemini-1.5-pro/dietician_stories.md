The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Vance's cheeks as he hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of Ashworth Manor.  Rain threatened, the sky a bruised purple above the imposing grey stone edifice.  Ivy, the color of dried blood, clung to the walls, its tendrils reaching towards the mullioned windows like grasping fingers. Ashworth Manor, a secluded wellness retreat nestled deep in the Vermont countryside, promised its wealthy clientele rejuvenation and tranquility. But beneath its veneer of rustic charm, Elias sensed a disquiet, a subtle unease that had been prickling at him since his arrival three days prior. He adjusted the strap of his leather messenger bag, its contents – dietary plans, calorie charts, and a well-worn copy of "The Physiology of Taste" – a stark contrast to the opulent surroundings.  He was there to overhaul the retreat's nutritional program, a task that already seemed far more complicated than he'd anticipated.
