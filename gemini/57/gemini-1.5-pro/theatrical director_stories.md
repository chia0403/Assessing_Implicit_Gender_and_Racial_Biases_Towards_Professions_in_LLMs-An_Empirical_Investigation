The damp chill of a November evening clung to the air like a persistent stagehand refusing to strike the set.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the rehearsal room, blurring the sodium glow of the streetlights into hazy halos. Inside, amidst a chaotic jumble of props – a chipped porcelain doll, a tarnished brass telescope, and a stack of moth-eaten velvet curtains – Elias Thorne, his full name Elias Peregrine Thorne, paced with the restless energy of a caged panther.  The cavernous space, normally echoing with the murmur of actors’ voices and the scrape of chairs, was eerily silent.  Only the rhythmic drip of a leaky pipe punctuated the tense stillness. The St. Jude's Playhouse, a once-grand theatre now clinging precariously to its faded glory on the edge of London's Theatreland, had seen better days, much like the play Elias was desperately trying to salvage.
