The flickering gaslight painted Amelia Nightingale’s dressing room in a sepia tone, catching the dust motes swirling around her half-packed trunk. The air hung thick with the scent of cheap cologne, stale champagne, and the lingering ghost of Amelia’s signature perfume, a heady mix of gardenia and sandalwood.

It was a humid July night in 1923, and the grand, if slightly faded, Majestic Theatre in New Orleans buzzed with anticipation for Amelia’s final performance before she embarked on her European tour.  A tour that, if the whispers in the theatre’s shadowed corners were to be believed, might just make her a star.
