Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already fading neon cityscape of Neo-Kyoto.  Inside, the air buzzed with the low hum of servers stacked against one wall, their blinking LEDs casting a flickering, ethereal glow across Elias’s face.

Empty ramen containers and discarded energy drink cans littered the surface of his expansive desk, silent testament to a marathon coding session.  Elias, his dark hair a tangled mess and his usually sharp grey eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, was locked in a battle against a particularly stubborn piece of code for the upcoming Sensorium launch – the most anticipated virtual reality operating system in a generation.  Tonight, success or failure rested entirely on his shoulders. The pressure was immense, a physical weight pressing down on him, threatening to suffocate him in the sterile, tech-filled confines of his apartment, twenty stories above the relentless rain.
