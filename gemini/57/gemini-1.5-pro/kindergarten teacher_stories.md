The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped inside Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, punctuated the otherwise silent pre-dawn gloom.  Pale light, barely strong enough to distinguish the crayon-bright murals from the alphabet friezes, filtered through the large window overlooking the playground.  Rainbow's End Kindergarten, nestled in the heart of sleepy Willow Creek, Oregon, was usually a riot of color and sound. But at this hour, only the cricket and the gentle rustling of leaves in the giant oak tree outside disturbed the stillness. Eleanor, her brown hair pulled back in a messy bun, sat perched on a miniature chair at one of the tiny, brightly colored tables, a steaming mug of chamomile tea warming her hands.  She was surrounded by stacks of construction paper, glitter glue, and pipe cleaners, the remnants of a late-night crafting session for the upcoming "Wonderful World of Worms" unit.  The faint scent of playdough and impending chaos hung in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor, even in the quiet solitude.
