The biting Michigan wind whipped Amelia Grace Holloway's hair across her face as she hurried across the slush-covered parking lot of the Pearly Whites Dental Clinic.  It was a bleak Tuesday morning in February, the kind where the sun seemed to have given up entirely and the sky remained a perpetual shade of dishwater grey.  Iron Mountain, nestled deep in the Upper Peninsula, was a town of sturdy pines, hardy folks, and teeth that had seen their fair share of pasties and fudge. Amelia, bundled in a thick parka, fumbled with her keys, the metal cold against her gloved hand.  The clinic, a squat, single-story building painted a cheerful, yet slightly unconvincing, shade of mint green, was her second home.  She'd been working there for five years, ever since graduating from the hygiene program in Marquette, and knew every chipped tile on the floor and every creak in the ancient dental chairs.  This morning, however, held a strange tension in the air, a feeling Amelia couldn't quite put her finger on.  It wasn't just the weather, though that certainly contributed. It was something else, something lurking beneath the surface of the usual Tuesday routine.
