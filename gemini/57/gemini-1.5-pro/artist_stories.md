The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s hair across her face, momentarily blinding her to the breathtaking view.  She tucked a loose strand behind her ear, the damp curl clinging stubbornly to her cheek.  Below her, the fishing village of Port Blossom tumbled down a steep cliff face, a riot of brightly painted cottages clinging precariously to the rugged Cornish coastline.  The air thrummed with the cries of gulls and the distant rumble of a fishing trawler returning to harbor.  Amy, perched on a windswept outcrop overlooking the scene, shivered despite the thick wool of her fisherman’s sweater.  Her canvas, propped on a weathered easel, remained stubbornly blank.  For three days she’d sat here, trying to capture the ephemeral beauty of this place, the shifting light on the turquoise water, the stoic strength of the cliffs against the relentless sea. But so far, her paints refused to cooperate, the image in her mind's eye remaining frustratingly elusive.  This trip to Cornwall was supposed to be her artistic breakthrough, a chance to escape the stifling pressures of the London art scene and rediscover her passion.  Instead, she was plagued by a crippling artist's block, the stark white of her canvas mocking her every attempt to fill it.
