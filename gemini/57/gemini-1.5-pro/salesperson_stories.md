The flickering neon sign of the "Desert Rose Motel" buzzed a melancholic B flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic chirping of crickets. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, swirling around Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum's sensible beige Corolla.  Bea, her lipstick a shade too bright against her pale complexion, adjusted the rearview mirror and sighed.  Mojave, California, population 4,275 (or so the faded welcome sign claimed), wasn't exactly the thriving metropolis she'd envisioned when she took the regional sales job for "Miracle Mop."  The setting sun painted the distant San Bernardino Mountains in hues of bruised purple and angry orange, a dramatic backdrop to the rows of stunted Joshua trees and the lonely gas station flickering like a dying ember in the encroaching twilight. This was her third town this week, and the gnawing feeling in her stomach told her it wasn't going to be any easier selling self-wringing mops here than it had been in Needles or Barstow.
