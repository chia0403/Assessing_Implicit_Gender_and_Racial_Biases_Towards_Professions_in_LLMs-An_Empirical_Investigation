Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Reyes's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight view of Chicago's Magnificent Mile.  The city lights, usually a vibrant tapestry woven across the inky canvas of night, were diffused into hazy halos.  Inside, the only illumination came from the cool glow of Amelia's laptop screen and the muted green light of the "Do Not Disturb" sign she'd flipped on her door an hour ago.  Amelia, Chief Operating Officer of Thorne & Cross, a prestigious international law firm, massaged her temples, feeling the familiar throb of a stress headache beginning to bloom.  The merger with the London-based firm, Sterling & Price, was proving to be far more complicated than anyone had anticipated, and tonight, with the deadline for the finalized contract looming just days away, Amelia was drowning in a sea of redlined documents and conflicting legal jargon.  The silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of rain, was a thin veil over the simmering chaos that threatened to erupt if just one more thing went wrong.
