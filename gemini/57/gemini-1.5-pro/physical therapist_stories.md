The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the oversized windows of ReNu Physical Therapy. Inside, Amelia Reyes, DPT, adjusted the thermostat a notch higher, her breath misting slightly in the frigid air that still managed to infiltrate the cozy clinic.  Pale sunlight filtered through the frosted glass, illuminating the rows of exercise equipment and casting long shadows across the brightly colored therapy balls scattered around the polished wooden floor. Amelia glanced at the clock: 7:58 am. Two minutes before her first patient, Mr. Henderson, would shuffle in, complaining about his perpetually stiff hip and the weather – in that order.  The scent of peppermint and eucalyptus from the diffuser mingled with the faint chlorine smell clinging to Amelia’s scrubs from her pre-work swim at the Loyola Park pool, a ritual she rarely missed, even in Chicago’s brutal winters. It was the only time she felt truly weightless, a welcome respite before the weight of other people’s pain settled onto her shoulders.
