The rain hammered against the window of "Flights of Fancy," blurring the neon pink flamingo in the sign outside into a shimmering, watery mess.  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, the sound swallowed by the downpour and the rhythmic thrum of the ancient radiator struggling in the corner.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in March in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon, and the usually picturesque view of the harbor was obscured by a grey curtain of rain so thick it felt like dusk had arrived prematurely. Amelia, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a loose braid and her emerald green eyes fixed on the flickering screen of her computer, was desperately trying to conjure sunshine â€“ at least the vicarious kind. She navigated through images of white sand beaches, turquoise lagoons, and vibrant coral reefs, searching for the perfect escape for a client who, like everyone else in Port Blossom that day, was dreaming of anywhere but here.
