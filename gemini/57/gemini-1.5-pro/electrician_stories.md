The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he perched precariously on the top rung of his ladder, the skeletal metal of the Ferris wheel a stark silhouette against the bruised twilight sky. Below him, the Coney Island boardwalk was a ghost of its summer self, the vibrant laughter and cacophony of whirling rides replaced by the mournful groan of the ocean and the lonely caw of a scavenging gull. The air, thick with the salty tang of the sea and the faint, metallic scent of rust, clung to Elias like a second skin.  He tightened his grip on the string of fairy lights, his calloused fingers numb despite his thick work gloves.
