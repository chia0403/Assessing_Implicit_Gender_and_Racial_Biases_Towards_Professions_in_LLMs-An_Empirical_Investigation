The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the turquoise paint until it radiated heat like a kiln.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," and shimmered in the distance like malevolent spirits. Inside,  Delilah "Dee" Montgomery wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, the cool air from the vents doing little to combat the oppressive desert heat. Her knuckles, tanned and calloused from years gripping the wheel, were white as she navigated a particularly nasty pothole that threatened to swallow the rig's front tire whole. Dee adjusted her mirrored aviator sunglasses, the reflection showing the endless expanse of sagebrush and scrub, broken only by the occasional gnarled juniper clinging to life in the unforgiving landscape.  Country music twanged low from the radio, a mournful ballad about lost love and hard living, a soundtrack that fit the desolate beauty of the Nevada desert perfectly. Dee was three days into a cross-country haul from Sacramento to Cincinnati, a load of prefabricated housing strapped tight to the flatbed behind her.  She had a deadline to meet and a restless energy that kept her pushing forward, mile after lonely mile.
