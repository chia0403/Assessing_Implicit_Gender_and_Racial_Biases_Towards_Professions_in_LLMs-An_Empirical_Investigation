The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the neglected expanse of the old Hemlock House gardens.  Frost crunched under her worn work boots, the sound a stark counterpoint to the rustling of dry leaves clinging precariously to skeletal branches.  Hemlock House, a gothic monstrosity perched on a cliff overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Atlantic, had been empty for years. Its sprawling grounds, once meticulously manicured, had surrendered to a wild tangle of overgrown ivy, gnarled rose bushes, and weeds that reached Amy's knees.  The salty air carried the tang of seaweed and the faint, unsettling cry of gulls circling overhead. Amy pulled her thick fleece tighter around her, a determined glint in her hazel eyes.  This was going to be her biggest project yet, and she was both intimidated and exhilarated by the prospect of bringing these forgotten gardens back to life.
