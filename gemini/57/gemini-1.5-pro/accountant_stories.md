The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Reyes' small accounting office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing in her temples.  The air in the cramped, single room was thick with the smell of damp wool and instant coffee, a scent Amelia usually found comforting, but tonight it only added to the oppressive atmosphere.  Her desk, normally a bastion of order, was awash in receipts, invoices, and bank statements, a chaotic testament to the tangled finances of the Brightside Diner, her most problematic client.  Flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the room, highlighting the peeling paint on the walls and the chipped enamel of her favourite mug, which bore the legend "World's Okayest Accountant."  Outside, the neon glow of the Starlight Motel sign pulsed through the downpour, illuminating the dreary stretch of highway that ran through the desolate town of Harmony Springs, Nevada.  Amelia, usually so meticulous, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach. Something wasn't adding up, and it wasn't just the diner's books.
