The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Moreau’s parka as she prepped her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver for takeoff.  Glacier-carved peaks, draped in a pre-dawn indigo, ringed the frozen expanse of Lake Clark.  Breath plumed from Ace’s nostrils, momentarily obscuring the intricate web of frost that had blossomed across the cockpit window.  Port Alsworth, little more than a cluster of cabins and a gravel airstrip clinging to the lake’s southern shore, was still asleep.  Only the faint whine of the Beaver’s warming engine and the rhythmic clinking of Ace’s carabiner against her flight suit broke the stillness. This was Ace’s domain: a vast, unforgiving wilderness where the line between beauty and peril was razor thin.  Today, that line was about to be crossed.
