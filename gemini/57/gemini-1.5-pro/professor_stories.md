The biting wind whipped Professor Alistair Finch's tweed jacket around him as he hurried across the cobbled quad of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone buildings, their expressions oddly mirroring his own anxiety.  It was late November, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak in the center of the quad clawing at the bruised, twilight sky.  A thin layer of frost crunched under his worn leather shoes, the sound swallowed by the looming silence that had fallen over the normally bustling university.  Finals week was over, students had fled for the holidays, and a peculiar stillness had settled upon the hallowed halls, a stillness that felt less like peace and more like a held breath before something unknown.  Alistair clutched the small, leather-bound diary tighter in his gloved hand, the smooth cover cold against his skin. He had a feeling this particular Christmas break would be anything but ordinary.
