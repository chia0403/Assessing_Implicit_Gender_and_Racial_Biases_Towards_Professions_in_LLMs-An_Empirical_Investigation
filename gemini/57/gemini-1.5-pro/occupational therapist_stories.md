The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne’s auburn braid against her cheek as she climbed the steps of the grand, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian house.  Greystone Manor, as it was pompously named, clung to a rocky outcrop overlooking the slate-grey expanse of the North Sea, just outside the sleepy fishing village of Port Blossom, Maine. The salt spray had weathered the shingles to a silvery hue, and the intricate gingerbread trim was peeling in places, revealing the dark wood beneath. Amy tugged her worn leather satchel higher onto her shoulder, the weight of her assessment kit a familiar comfort. Today marked her first day working for the newly opened  Greystone Rehabilitation Center, a facility specializing in long-term care and recovery for patients with neurological conditions.  A shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down her spine as she reached for the heavy brass knocker.  The stories surrounding Greystone were whispered in hushed tones in Port Blossom – tales of eccentric former residents, strange happenings, and an air of melancholy that permeated the very stones.  Amy, however, was a pragmatic occupational therapist, more interested in the tangible needs of her patients than in local folklore. Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something about Greystone, and the patients within, would challenge her in ways she couldn’t yet imagine.
