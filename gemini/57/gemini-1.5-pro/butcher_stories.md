The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and something subtly sweeter, something almost metallic. It snagged at the edges of Elias Thorne's thick canvas apron, plastered against his considerable frame. Elias, his cheeks raw and red from the cold, adjusted the brim of his flat cap and surveyed his domain: Thorne's Quality Meats, a squat brick building nestled between a perpetually grey fishmonger's and a bakery that perpetually smelled of burnt sugar.  Saltwick-on-Sea, a town clinging stubbornly to the Yorkshire coast, was preparing for another bleak winter, and the queue outside Elias' shop stretched longer than usual. The scrape of boots on the pavement and the muffled coughs of those huddled against the chill were the soundtrack to Elias' pre-dawn routine. Inside, hanging from gleaming steel hooks, quarters of beef, legs of lamb, and plump pheasants awaited his practiced hand, their surfaces frosted with a delicate rime. The air within was thick with the cold, earthy scent of raw meat and sawdust, a smell Elias found strangely comforting.  He unlocked the shop door, the brass knob cold beneath his glove, and the first customer, a stout woman with a pinched face and a basket clutched tight, bustled past him, exhaling a cloud of frosty breath that momentarily obscured the carcasses hanging in the window.
