The neon "Prescriptions 24/7" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of the mostly deserted strip mall.  Inside "Good Health Pharmacy," Elias Thorne, Pharm.D., meticulously counted out metformin tablets, the rhythmic click of the pill counter a stark contrast to the howling wind battering the storefront. It was 2:17 am in the desolate town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, a place whose name ironically belied the undercurrent of unease that permeated the damp air.  The only other sign of life was the flickering gas station across the street, where a lone figure huddled by the pumps, their face obscured by the shadow of a baseball cap.  Elias shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Something felt wrong, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the drafty pharmacy. He had a feeling this was going to be a long night.
