The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vivienne Holloway, tugging at the edges of her charcoal grey scarf and sending stray strands of auburn hair dancing across her cheek.  She shivered, pulling her tailored coat tighter around her as she surveyed the scene before her.  The skeletal frame of the "Nova" tower, her latest project, clawed its way into the perpetually overcast Glasgow sky.  Around it, the Clyde shipyard, a relic of a bygone industrial age, hummed with a different kind of construction â€“ the dismantling of the past rather than the creation of the future.  Rusting cranes groaned like arthritic giants, their long arms reaching out over the greasy, slate-grey water, while the air vibrated with the rhythmic clang of metal on metal. This stark juxtaposition, the sleek, modern lines of Nova against the decaying grandeur of the shipyard, perfectly mirrored the internal conflict brewing within Eleanor herself.  She was on the precipice of something great, something that could redefine the Glasgow skyline, but the weight of expectation, the pressure to deliver, threatened to crush her before the first pane of glass was even installed.
