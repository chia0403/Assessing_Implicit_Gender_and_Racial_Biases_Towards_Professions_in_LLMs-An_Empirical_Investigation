The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner in Elara Rose Valencia's hand.  Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air to a shimmering haze. Inside, the air conditioning struggled to maintain a semblance of cool against the relentless desert heat. Elara, with her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue Quick Stop polo shirt, watched the digital numbers on the register climb as Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose face seemed permanently etched with disapproval, slowly counted out pennies for her single can of peaches.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight slicing through the grimy windows, illuminating the rows of brightly colored candy, chips, and lukewarm sodas that lined the aisles.  This was Elara's kingdom, a two-aisle empire of expired lottery tickets, questionable hot dogs rotating slowly on a metal cylinder, and the ever-present smell of stale coffee. It was 3:17 pm on a Tuesday, and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary had happened â€“ yet.
