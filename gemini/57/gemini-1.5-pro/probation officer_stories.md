The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Dragon Chinese takeaway cast a lurid, greasy glow across Eleanor Vance’s rain-streaked windscreen.  Rain hammered on the roof of her battered Ford Focus, a relentless rhythm mirroring the dull ache behind her temples.  Ashworth, a satellite town clinging precariously to the edges of Manchester, was not known for its charm.  Rows of terraced houses, most with boarded-up windows and peeling paint, huddled together against the encroaching damp of the Pennines.  Eleanor, a probation officer for the Greater Manchester Probation Service,  sighed, pulling her worn leather satchel closer.  It was 7:30 pm on a Friday night, and she was on her way to her final check-in of the week.  The name on her file: Darren “Daz” Eccles.  He was a repeat offender, a petty thief with a penchant for stolen car radios and a disturbingly casual attitude towards community service.  Eleanor gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white.  This wasn't going to be a pleasant visit.
