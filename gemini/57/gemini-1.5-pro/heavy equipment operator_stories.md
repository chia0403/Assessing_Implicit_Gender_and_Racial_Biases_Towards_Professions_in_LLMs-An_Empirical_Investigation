The biting wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the Chugwater Formation, carrying with it the fine red dust that painted everything in a perpetual sunset hue. Even inside the cab of her Caterpillar D11T dozer, Bethany "Betty" Calhoun could taste the grit on her tongue.  The Wyoming sky, usually a brilliant, cloudless blue, was today a bruised purple, promising snow before nightfall.  The digital clock on the dash blinked 6:17 AM, but the weak winter sun hadn't yet crested the jagged teeth of the Laramie Mountains to the west, leaving the sprawling natural gas field shrouded in a pre-dawn gloom. Betty adjusted the brim of her hard hat, the headlamp casting long, distorted shadows across the control panel, and gripped the levers.  Today’s job was to carve out a new access road to well site 17, a task complicated by the frozen ground and the increasingly treacherous winds.  She exhaled, a plume of white against the cold glass, and fired up the engine. The D11 roared to life, a mechanical behemoth ready to wrestle the earth to Betty’s will.
