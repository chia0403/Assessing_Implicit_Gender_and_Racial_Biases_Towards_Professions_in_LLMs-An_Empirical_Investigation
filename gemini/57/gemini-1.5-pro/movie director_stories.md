The biting February wind whipped around Anastasia "Ana" Volkov, plastering strands of her raven hair across her chapped lips.  She pulled her thick, moss-green scarf tighter, the wool scratching against the expensive cashmere of her coat.  Below her, the city of Prague glittered, a tapestry of baroque rooftops dusted with snow, the Vltava River snaking through it like a ribbon of pewter.  Ana stood on the Charles Bridge, normally thronged with tourists, but now eerily deserted save for a lone street musician huddled against the biting wind, his melancholic accordion melody echoing in the frosty air.  This was her city, her muse, the backdrop for her next film, a neo-noir thriller titled "The Prague Labyrinth."  And tonight, beneath the watchful gaze of the ancient statues lining the bridge, Ana was searching for the perfect shot, the opening scene that would set the tone for the entire movie.
