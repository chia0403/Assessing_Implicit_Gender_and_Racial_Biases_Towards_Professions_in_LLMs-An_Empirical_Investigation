The insistent chirping of a robin, stubbornly perched on the windowsill outside her classroom, finally roused Ms. Eleanor Vance from her grading stupor.  The afternoon sun, slanting through the dusty panes of Maplewood Elementary, painted long rectangles of warmth across the worn linoleum floor.  A faint aroma of chalk dust and stale peanut butter lingered in the air, the familiar scent of a school day nearing its end.  Maplewood, nestled in the heart of Vermont's Green Mountains, was a small, single-story building, the kind where every footstep echoed through the halls and the principal knew every student by name.  Outside, beyond the playground's rusted swing set and the towering maple that gave the school its name, the vibrant hues of autumn were just beginning to bleed into the landscape.  This particular afternoon, however, Eleanor felt anything but vibrant. A stack of fourth-grade spelling tests, littered with creative misspellings of "believe," lay heavy on her desk, a stark reminder that the upcoming parent-teacher conferences loomed like a gathering storm.
