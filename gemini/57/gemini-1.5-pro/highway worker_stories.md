The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, stinging Elias Vance's cheeks even through the thick fleece lining of his orange parka.  The pre-dawn darkness clung to the Nevada desert like a shroud, broken only by the rhythmic flashing of the emergency lights on Elias’s pickup truck.  Fifty yards ahead, bathed in the harsh glare of the truck's headlights, a tumbleweed the size of a small car skittered across the asphalt, a perfect metaphor for the randomness of Elias's life lately.  He’d been with the Nevada Department of Transportation for fifteen years, patching potholes and scraping armadillos off the highway, and he'd seen some strange things. But this call, a reported obstruction in the westbound lane just outside of Battle Mountain, felt different.  The dispatcher had sounded unnerved, almost whispering about something large and…unidentifiable. Elias adjusted his hardhat, a nervous tremor running down his spine. The only sound besides the wind was the low hum of the generator powering the floodlights he'd set up, illuminating a section of the highway that seemed to swallow the light whole.
