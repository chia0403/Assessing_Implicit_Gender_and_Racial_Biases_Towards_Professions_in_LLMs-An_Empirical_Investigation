The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks as she wrestled a "For Sale" sign into the unforgiving Vermont earth.  Perched precariously on the edge of a rutted dirt road, overlooking the town of Maple Hollow, the property boasted a breathtaking vista.  Rolling hills, ablaze with autumnal hues, stretched out beneath a sky the color of faded denim.  The house itself, however, was less inspiring.  A dilapidated Victorian, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, it slumped on its foundations, whispering stories of neglect and forgotten dreams.  Amy, clad in her signature sensible heels and a power suit ill-suited for the rugged terrain, sighed.  This was the third showing today, and so far, the only interest expressed had been from a family of squirrels looking for winter lodgings.  This sale, like the house itself, was proving to be a fixer-upper.
