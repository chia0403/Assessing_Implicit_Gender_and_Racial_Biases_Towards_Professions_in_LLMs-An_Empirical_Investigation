The biting wind, scented with brine and coal smoke, whipped through the cobbled alleyways of Port Blossom, tugging at the hem of Elias Thorne’s long, charcoal coat.  He clutched his battered leather satchel tighter, the precious contents within – a bolt of emerald green silk, destined to become the Countess of Auberon's opera gown – protected from the elements.  Above him, the gas lamps flickered, casting a sickly yellow glow on the grimy brick buildings that leaned precariously towards each other, as though gossiping secrets only the shadows knew.  Elias’s small tailor shop, nestled between a fishmonger and a rather dubious-looking apothecary, offered a beacon of warm light in the gloom.  Its single window, meticulously polished, displayed a collection of exquisitely crafted garments, each a testament to Elias’s skill and an invitation to a world of elegance and refinement, a stark contrast to the rough-and-tumble reality of Port Blossom.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting glow seemed tinged with an unsettling anticipation, a premonition that hung in the air as thick as the sea fog rolling in from the harbor.
