The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, whistling a mournful tune that echoed across the scarred slopes of Mount Rainier.  Frost crunched under the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood as he surveyed the stand of timber marked for felling.  A plume of condensation rose from his breath, momentarily obscuring the already fading light.  Jed, a man built like an oak, with hands calloused and weathered by years of wrestling nature's giants, adjusted the thick wool cap pulled low over his ears. Camp Nine, a collection of canvas tents and ramshackle wooden structures clinging precariously to the mountainside, was already swallowed by the encroaching shadows. The only visible sign of life was the flickering orange glow of the cookhouse fire, a beacon in the growing darkness, promising warmth and the hearty meal Jed craved after a long day battling the cold and the unforgiving terrain. The scent of pine, damp earth, and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both invigorated and haunted him.  This was Jed's world, a realm of towering trees, treacherous slopes, and the constant, low hum of danger.  He knew it intimately, respected its power, and yet, a growing unease gnawed at him.  Something felt different this season.  Something feltâ€¦wrong.
