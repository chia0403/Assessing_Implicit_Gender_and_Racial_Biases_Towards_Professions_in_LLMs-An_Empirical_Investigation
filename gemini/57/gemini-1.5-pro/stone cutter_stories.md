The wind, sharp and smelling of pine resin, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat as he surveyed the cliff face. Grey granite, streaked with veins of quartz that glittered like trapped starlight, rose sheer above him, disappearing into the swirling mists that perpetually clung to Mount Cinder.  Elias, his calloused fingers already itching for the feel of chisel against stone, adjusted the leather satchel containing his tools.  The village of Hollow Creek, nestled in the valley below, was a patchwork of slate roofs and smoking chimneys, dwarfed by the looming presence of the mountain. For generations, the Thorne family had quarried the mountain’s heart, shaping its rough beauty into the very bones of the village – its houses, its church, even its cobbled streets.  But this commission was different. This wasn't a simple lintel or a well-worn paving stone. This was for the Spire, a monument to a forgotten king, a legend whispered in hushed tones around crackling fires. And Elias, at the tender age of twenty-two, had been chosen to carve it.
