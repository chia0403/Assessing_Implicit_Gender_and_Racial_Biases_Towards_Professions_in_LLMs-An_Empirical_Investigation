The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen, rutted track leading to the wolf enclosure.  Dawn hadn't yet cracked over the Black Hills Sanctuary, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and icy grey.

Amy pulled her thick, wool-lined parka tighter around herself, the crunch of her boots on the frozen ground the only sound besides the mournful howl of Chinook, the sanctuary’s alpha male, echoing through the pre-dawn stillness.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within a remote valley, was a sprawling haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, a place where Amy had poured her heart and soul for the past five years.  This morning, however, a different kind of chill settled in her stomach, a premonition that something was wrong, far beyond the usual winter woes.
