The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's dark hair across his face as he trudged across the frozen yard, the crunch of his boots the only sound louder than the mournful lowing of the Hereford cow huddled in the corner of the paddock.  The late November air in rural Harmony Ridge, Vermont, held the promise of snow, a threat Elias welcomed for the aesthetic beauty but dreaded for the complications it would add to his already overflowing workload.  Harmony Ridge, nestled deep in the Green Mountains, boasted a population just shy of one thousand, nearly half of whom owned some manner of livestock.  Elias, the only veterinarian for fifty miles, was intimately familiar with every lame horse, arthritic goat, and calving cow in the valley. Tonight, it was Betsy, a prize-winning heifer belonging to Old Man Hemlock, that demanded his attention. The barn, a weathered structure that had seen more winters than Elias himself, offered a meager refuge from the wind, but the smell of hay and manure, usually comforting, was tinged with a sharp, metallic scent that made Eliasâ€™s stomach clench. This wasn't going to be a simple birthing.
