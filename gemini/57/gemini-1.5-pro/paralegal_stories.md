The fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Blake law offices hummed a monotonous C sharp, a soundtrack Amelia Grace Hawthorne had grown accustomed to over her five years as a paralegal. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the windowpanes of the 27th-floor office and spitting pellets of sleet against the glass.  The city, usually a glittering tapestry of light and movement, was obscured by a thick, swirling grey. Inside, the only illumination came from the harsh overhead lights and the warm glow emanating from Amelia’s computer screen, where a complex web of interconnected documents related to the Peterson antitrust case pulsed with digital life.  It was 7:17 pm on a Friday night, and Amelia was, as usual, the last one left. The silence, broken only by the occasional click of her mouse and the rhythmic whir of the office printer, was a welcome reprieve from the day’s cacophony of ringing phones, demanding attorneys, and the incessant chatter of the office’s resident gossip, Brenda from accounting. Tonight, the quiet felt less like solitude and more like a heavy blanket, pressing down on her with the weight of the unfinished Peterson case.  Something about it felt…off.
