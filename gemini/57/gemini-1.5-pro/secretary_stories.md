The relentless clack of the typewriter keys punctuated the humid stillness of the office.  Beatrice Amelia Higgins, her fingers flying across the QWERTY keyboard, barely registered the rhythmic percussion.  Outside, the New Orleans sun beat down on Royal Street, baking the already stifling July air.  The faint, sweet scent of pralines from the confectionery below drifted up through the open window, mingling with the less appealing aroma of stale cigar smoke clinging to the heavy velvet drapes.  Beatrice’s small office, tucked away on the second floor of the historic LaLaurie Mansion, was a curious blend of antiquated elegance and practical functionality.  Antique mahogany furniture sat alongside a bulky filing cabinet and a humming refrigerator stocked with tiny bottles of Coca-Cola.  A faded portrait of a stern-faced woman in a lace collar, presumably Madame Delphine LaLaurie herself, gazed down disapprovingly from above the fireplace.  Beatrice, however, paid her little mind. Her focus was entirely on the document before her, a complex legal brief that absolutely, positively had to be on Mr. Marchand’s desk by noon.
