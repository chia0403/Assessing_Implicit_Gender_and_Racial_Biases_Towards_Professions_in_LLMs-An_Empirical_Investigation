The biting November wind whipped at Captain Amelia "Ace" Hernandez's turnout coat as she stood on the precipice of what used to be the Blackwood Manor's grand staircase. Now, only charred remnants of mahogany and wrought iron remained, silhouetted against the angry orange glow of the inferno still consuming the west wing. Ash rained down like morbid confetti, settling on her helmet and the frozen ground around her. Blackwood Manor, once the crown jewel of the sleepy town of Oakhaven, perched atop Widow's Hill, was now a skeletal husk, its secrets and grandeur being devoured by the insatiable flames.  The air, thick with the smell of smoke and damp earth, crackled with the unsettling sounds of groaning timbers and the hiss of water against intense heat.  Below, the frantic ballet of her team continued, hoses snaking across the lawn like metallic pythons, each firefighter a tiny figure battling a monstrous, unpredictable foe. Ace felt the weight of responsibility settle on her shoulders, heavier than her oxygen tank.  This wasn't just a fire; it was a piece of Oakhaven's history burning to the ground.  And she had a gnawing feeling that something more sinister than faulty wiring was at play.
