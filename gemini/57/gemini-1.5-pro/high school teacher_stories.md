The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom buzzed relentlessly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large, grimy windows.  Grey November pressed against the glass of Westbridge High, a squat, brick building clinging to the edge of the Oregon coast like a barnacle to a ship's hull. The salt-laced wind howled outside, rattling the loose panes and whipping the skeletal branches of the lone oak tree in the parking lot. Inside, Elias’s Advanced Placement Literature class was supposed to be discussing the allegorical significance of the albatross in Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” but the pervasive gloom seemed to have seeped into the students' very bones.  They huddled in their desks, wrapped in hoodies and apathy, their gazes fixed on anything but the weathered paperback in their hands.  Elias sighed, the scent of chalk dust and old books heavy in the air. This was his tenth year teaching at Westbridge, and some days, like this one, felt like a slow, steady erosion of his soul.
