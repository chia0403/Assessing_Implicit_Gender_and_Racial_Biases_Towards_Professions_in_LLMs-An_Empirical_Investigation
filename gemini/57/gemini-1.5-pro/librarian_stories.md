The frosted breath of November clawed at the leaded windows of the Alderanth Library, etching fleeting patterns on the glass. Inside, nestled amongst the towering shelves of ancient tomes and forgotten lore,  Elara Thistlewick, the head librarian, shivered despite the crackling fire in the hearth.  Alderanth, a village perched precariously on the edge of Whispering Cliffs, was perpetually shrouded in a damp, clinging mist, a mist that seeped into the very stones of the library and settled deep in Elara's bones.  The only sounds were the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the soft rustle of Elara's wool skirt as she moved between the shelves, her fingers trailing over the spines of leather-bound books. The air smelled of aged paper, woodsmoke, and something faintly metallic, a scent Elara couldn't quite place but found increasingly unsettling.
