The insistent drumming of rain against the arched Victorian window mirrored the throbbing ache in Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s temples.  Her dental practice, nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine, usually offered a calming view of the picturesque harbor, dotted with lobster boats bobbing gently on the teal water.  Today, however, a thick fog had rolled in, swallowing the charming seaside town and leaving everything shrouded in a damp, grey blanket. The only color came from the vibrant fuchsia bougainvillea spilling from a hanging basket just outside, its cheerful blooms a stark contrast to the gloom that seemed to have settled not only over Port Blossom, but over Eleanor herself.  It was a Tuesday, typically her busiest day, yet the waiting room remained stubbornly empty.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, was more unsettling than the usual cacophony of chattering patients and ringing phones.
