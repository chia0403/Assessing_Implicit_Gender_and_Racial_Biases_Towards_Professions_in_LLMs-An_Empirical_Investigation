The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the layers of protective gear.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into the endless white of the ice shelf, offered no warmth.  Beneath his feet, the Ross Ice Shelf groaned and shifted, a constant, low rumble that spoke of the immense power held within the frozen landscape.  Aris, his breath clouding the air in front of his visor, checked the readouts on his wrist-mounted computer.  -70 degrees Fahrenheit. Wind speeds gusting to 40 knots. Standard operating procedure for McMurdo Station in deep winter, but today felt different.  Today, the unease wasn't just from the cold. It emanated from the gaping maw of the newly discovered chasm that yawned before him, a jagged tear in the ice that seemed to descend into the very heart of the Earth.  A chasm that, according to his research, shouldn't exist.
