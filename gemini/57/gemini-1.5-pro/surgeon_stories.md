The biting Chicago wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorneâ€™s charcoal grey overcoat as he hurried across Michigan Avenue, the icy spray from Lake Michigan stinging his face.  The Magnificent Mile glittered with festive lights, a stark contrast to the churning grey sky above. Christmas music blared from hidden speakers, a jarring counterpoint to the urgency gnawing at Elias.  He clutched his phone tighter, the screen displaying a missed call from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the illuminated red notification pulsing like a frantic heartbeat.  It was 5:53 am, December 24th, and Elias knew, with a chilling certainty, that Christmas Eve was about to be anything but peaceful.
