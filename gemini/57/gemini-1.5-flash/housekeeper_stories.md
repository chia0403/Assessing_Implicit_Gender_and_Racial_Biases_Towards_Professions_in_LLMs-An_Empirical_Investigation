The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Elara Blackwood’s scrubbing.  Water, the colour of weak tea stained with rust, swirled around a particularly stubborn smear of what Elara suspected, with a weary sigh, was decades-old gravy.  The kitchen of Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity clinging precariously to the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a battlefield.  A battlefield strewn with forgotten recipes, dusty heirlooms, and the lingering scent of damp wool and something indefinably…rotten.  The air hung heavy with the salty tang of the sea and the almost imperceptible, yet ever-present, aroma of decay – a fitting perfume for a house with as many secrets as Blackwood Manor possessed.  Elara, however, was used to secrets.  She'd spent the last ten years scrubbing them from the floors, the silverware, and, increasingly, from the very fabric of the house itself.
