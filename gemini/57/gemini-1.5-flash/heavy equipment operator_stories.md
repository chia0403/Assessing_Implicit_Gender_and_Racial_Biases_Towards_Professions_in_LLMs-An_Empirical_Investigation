The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through the steel bones of the D9 bulldozer, mirroring the tremor in Elias Thorne’s chest.  Elias, his face grimy with a blend of sweat and red Arizona dust, wrestled the massive machine across the parched landscape.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down on the sprawling expanse of the abandoned copper mine, baking the cracked earth to the consistency of brittle bone.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the desolate plain, their silent pirouettes a mocking counterpoint to the groaning protest of the bulldozer's tracks.  The air hung heavy with the scent of copper, a metallic tang that mingled with the acrid smell of diesel fumes and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of something else… something burnt and vaguely… floral.  This wasn't just another day clearing tailings; something felt profoundly wrong.
