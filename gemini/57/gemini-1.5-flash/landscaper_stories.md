The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning the sweat beading on his forehead into tiny, shimmering rivers.  He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smudge of dirt on his already grime-stained cheek.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass, honeysuckle, and something faintly metallic – the lingering perfume of a storm that had passed through earlier, leaving behind a sky the color of bruised plums. Elias squinted up at it, momentarily distracted from the unruly thicket of overgrown privet he was wrestling with.  He was perched precariously on a crumbling stone wall bordering the sprawling, somewhat neglected gardens of Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity that seemed to claw at the summer sky with its skeletal branches and shadowed eaves.  The manor itself was a story waiting to be told, but Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire (or at least, that’s what his business card claimed), was far more interested in taming the untamed wilderness that surrounded it.
