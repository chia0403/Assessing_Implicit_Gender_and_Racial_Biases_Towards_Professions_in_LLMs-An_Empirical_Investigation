The flickering neon sign of the "Byte & Brew" cast a lurid green glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked trench coat.  Water dripped from the brim of her hat, mirroring the steady stream of code cascading down her laptop screen.  Steam curled from the oversized mug clutched in her gloved hand, the bitter aroma of dark roast coffee a stark contrast to the sickly sweet scent of exhaust fumes clinging to the air of Neo-Kyoto's grimy backstreets.  Elara, a programmer whose genius was only surpassed by her caffeine addiction, hunched deeper into her chair, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers a counterpoint to the throbbing bass of a nearby synth-pop club. Tonight, she was chasing a ghost â€“ a rogue algorithm that threatened to unravel the city's meticulously crafted digital infrastructure, one flickering neon sign at a time.
