The stale scent of disinfectant and despair clung to the air like a second skin.  Fluorescent lights hummed a mournful tune above Elias Thorne, as he pushed his mop across the polished terrazzo floor of the Blackwood Academy for the Gifted. Elias, a man whose life was as unremarkable as the beige uniform he wore,  found a strange beauty in the echoing silence of the hallowed halls at 3 AM.  The academy, a gothic masterpiece of wrought iron and stained glass, stood proudly on a windswept hill overlooking the town of Oakhaven, its imposing silhouette a stark contrast to the sleepy, almost forgotten village below. Tonight, however, even the usual nocturnal symphony of creaking wood and rustling leaves was subdued, a pregnant silence that prickled Eliasâ€™s skin more than the usual chill of the autumn night.
