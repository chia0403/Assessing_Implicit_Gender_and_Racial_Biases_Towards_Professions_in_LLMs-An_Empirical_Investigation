The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Third Grade Class!” sign peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the state of Eleanor Vance’s own frayed nerves.  It was the first day of school, a day usually brimming with the chaotic energy of excited children and the crisp scent of new crayons. But today, a thick, humid blanket of anxiety hung heavier than the oppressive August air over Oakhaven Elementary.  The school, a squat, brick building clinging to the edge of a sprawling, overgrown field, usually buzzed with the sounds of recess; today, an unsettling silence reigned.  Even the usual chorus of cicadas seemed muted, their frantic chirping replaced by a low, almost mournful hum.  Eleanor adjusted the too-tight collar of her floral blouse, a tiny bead of sweat tracing a path down her temple.  This wasn't just the first day of school; it felt like the first day of something… else.
