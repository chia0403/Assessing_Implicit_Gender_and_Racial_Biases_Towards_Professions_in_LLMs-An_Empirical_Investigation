The fluorescent lights of "Sweet Surrender Cakes" hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the vibrant explosion of colour surrounding Amelia Katherine Finch.  Amelia, or Millie as she preferred, was knee-deep in buttercream, her apron a testament to a morning spent wrestling with unruly roses and meticulously piping delicate swirls onto a three-tiered wedding cake.  The air hung thick with the sweet scent of vanilla and almond, a perfume that usually brought her joy, but today, the sugary aroma felt cloying, mirroring the suffocating weight of expectation pressing down on her.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the churning anxiety in her stomach.  This wasn't just any wedding cake; it was for the daughter of the city's mayor, a woman known for her ruthless perfectionism and a social media following that could make or break Millie's fledgling business.
