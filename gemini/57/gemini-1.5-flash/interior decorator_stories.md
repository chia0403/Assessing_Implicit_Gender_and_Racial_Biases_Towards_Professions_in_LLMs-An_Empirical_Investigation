The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded robin's egg blue, perfectly mirrored the melancholic slump of Aurelia “Reli” Beaumont’s shoulders.  Rain lashed against the glass panes of the dilapidated Victorian mansion, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already fragile façade.  Reli, renowned in certain circles for her ability to coax beauty from even the most stubbornly derelict spaces, found herself utterly stumped.  This wasn't just a case of peeling wallpaper and mismatched furniture; this was a house that seemed to actively resist her touch, a place where the very air hung heavy with the ghosts of forgotten sorrows. The scent of damp earth and decaying roses clung to the heavy velvet drapes, a fragrance that spoke of neglect and, perhaps, something far more sinister.  The grand staircase, once a testament to opulent grandeur, now groaned under the weight of its own neglect, its ornate banister scarred and splintered like a broken promise.  This was Blackwood Manor, and Reli Beaumont had just accepted the most challenging commission of her career.
