The chipped Formica countertop felt cold against Elias Thorne’s cheek.  He leaned against it, the weight a familiar comfort in the suffocating humidity of The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic clinking of ice in glasses and the low hum of conversation from the handful of patrons scattered amongst the sticky booths.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and something faintly floral – probably the wilting lilies perched precariously on a table in the corner, a testament to a forgotten birthday or a failed romance. Elias, a man carved from granite and weariness, watched the rain streak down the glass, mirroring the lines etched around his tired eyes. The Rusty Mug, tucked away on a forgotten side street in the rain-slicked city of Porthaven, was as much his sanctuary as it was his prison.
