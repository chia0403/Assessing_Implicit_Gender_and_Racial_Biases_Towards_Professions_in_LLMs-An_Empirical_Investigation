The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a sound as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, grimy window high in the north wall, danced in the shafts of afternoon light, catching the fiery hues of the setting sun. Elias, his strong hands calloused and stained the deep ochre of the stone he worked, paused, the rhythmic scrape replaced by a quiet sigh.  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet stone and woodsmoke, a familiar perfume in the heart of the ancient quarry town of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the Greystone Mountains.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, promising a blizzard before nightfall. Elias glanced towards the unfinished angel, its wings half-formed, a silent testament to the long, arduous winter ahead.
