The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's life.  Amelia, meticulously arranging a pyramid of brightly colored gummy bears, sighed.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of artificial fruit and the faint, underlying aroma of stale coffee – a smell she’d come to associate with the slow, relentless crawl of another Tuesday night shift.  Outside, the October wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the insistent beeping of the scanner, a soundtrack far more dramatic than anything happening within the four plastic-paneled walls of the convenience store.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of the sign across the street into a hazy, indistinct smear.  Tonight, even the usual late-night stragglers seemed to be avoiding the storm, leaving Amelia with nothing but the echoing silence and the relentless hum of the refrigerators to keep her company.
