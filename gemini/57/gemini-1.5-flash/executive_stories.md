The air conditioning in Amelia Hernandez’s corner office hummed a low, monotonous drone, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her stilettos on the polished mahogany floor.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the glittering, rain-slicked cityscape of Hong Kong, the skyscrapers blurring into a hazy, vertical tapestry under the bruised purple sky.  Amelia, CEO of Hernandez Global Investments, stood poised before the window, a glass of lukewarm jasmine tea forgotten in her hand.  The cityscape, usually a symbol of her success, tonight felt oppressive, mirroring the churning anxieties in her stomach.  A crucial deal, one that could make or break the company’s expansion into Southeast Asia, was hanging precariously in the balance, and the weight of it pressed down on her like the humid Hong Kong air.  The city’s vibrant energy, usually a source of inspiration, felt tonight like a suffocating blanket.
