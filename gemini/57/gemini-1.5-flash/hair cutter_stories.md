The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Worthington truly appreciated.  Her salon, "Shear Perfection," nestled on a cobbled side street in the quaint, perpetually autumnal town of Oakhaven, wasn't exactly bustling. In fact, at 7:15 am, the only sound louder than the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner was the gentle hum of the refrigerator, keeping Mia's meticulously organized collection of styling products at the perfect temperature. Outside, the skeletal branches of ancient oak trees clawed at the misty sky, their leaves long since surrendered to the relentless advance of the season.  Inside, though, Mia found a quiet solace, surrounded by the comforting weight of her tools and the promise of a day spent transforming lives, one perfectly sculpted strand at a time.
