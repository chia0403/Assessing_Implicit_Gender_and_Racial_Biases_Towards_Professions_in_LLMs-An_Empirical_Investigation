The salt spray stung Dr. Evelyn Reed’s face as she navigated the rickety wooden walkway, the rhythmic creak a counterpoint to the relentless roar of the Atlantic.  Seagulls, fat and indolent, wheeled overhead, their cries lost in the wind’s howl.  She clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – a well-used goniometer, a roll of kinesiology tape, and a half-eaten protein bar – jostling against the worn leather.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, was bracingly cold, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched, sterile environment of her usual clinic in Charleston.  This, however, was no ordinary day, and this, perched precariously on the edge of the windswept island of Monhegan, Maine, was no ordinary workplace.  Evelyn was here on a mission, a far cry from the routine rehabilitation of tennis elbows and strained hamstrings that filled her typical schedule.  This was about something far more profound, far more… mysterious.
