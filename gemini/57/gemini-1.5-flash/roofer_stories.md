The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's grizzled cheeks, stinging like a swarm of angry wasps.  Below him, the city of Bristol sprawled, a patchwork quilt of terracotta roofs and grey stone, all dusted with the first, tentative snow of the season.  Elias, perched precariously on the apex of a Victorian townhouse, adjusted his worn leather work gloves, the scent of damp slate and old tar clinging to them like a second skin. He'd been a roofer for thirty years, long enough to know the rhythm of the city's heartbeat – the mournful sigh of the wind, the distant clang of a factory bell, the hushed whispers of the rain on the tiles – and long enough to know that this particular job was going to be a devil to finish before nightfall.
