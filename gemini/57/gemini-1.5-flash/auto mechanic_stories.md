The grease-stained overalls of Silas "Si" Blackwood felt like a second skin, the scent of motor oil a comforting cologne.  The air in Si's Auto Repair hung thick and warm, a humid blanket woven from the summer heat seeping in through the open bay doors and the exhaust fumes of a half-dismantled Ford pickup that dominated the center of the shop.  Tools – gleaming wrenches, battered sockets, and a chaotic assortment of specialized gizmos – lay scattered across well-worn workbenches, their metallic gleam reflecting the flickering fluorescent lights overhead.  Rust-colored dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating spiderwebs clinging to rafters that groaned under the weight of years and countless oil changes.  The rhythmic clang of Si's hammer, punctuating the low hum of the distant highway, was the soundtrack to his life, a familiar symphony that had played for the better part of three decades in this small, forgotten corner of Harmony Creek, Arizona.
