The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the crisp October air, mirroring the slow decay Ms. Eleanor Vance felt creeping into her own life.

The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a scent that somehow managed to be both comforting and profoundly depressing, much like her current existence.  Her classroom, 207, smelled faintly of stale coffee and despair â€“ a familiar aroma that greeted her each morning like a long-lost, unwelcome friend.
