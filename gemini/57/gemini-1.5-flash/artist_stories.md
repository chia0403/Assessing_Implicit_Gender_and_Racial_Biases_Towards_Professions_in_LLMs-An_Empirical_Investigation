The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that clashed spectacularly with the muted greys of the Cornish coastline.  Salt spray, tasting faintly of seaweed and brine, peppered her already paint-splattered overalls.  She hunched deeper into her worn oilskins, the canvas propped precariously on her easel swaying slightly in the gust.  Before her, the Atlantic churned a restless, bruised purple under a sky the colour of a bruised plum, the waves crashing against the jagged teeth of the granite cliffs with a violent, almost mournful rhythm.  The air was thick with the scent of storm and the faint, underlying aroma of the gorse bushes clinging precariously to the cliff edge, their yellow blooms long since withered and gone.  This was her sanctuary, her studio, the wild, untamed beauty of Porthcurno inspiring her more than any gallery ever could.
