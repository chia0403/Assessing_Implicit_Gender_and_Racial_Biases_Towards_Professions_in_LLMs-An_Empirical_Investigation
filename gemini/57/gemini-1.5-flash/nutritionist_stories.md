The chipped paint of the Victorian terrace flaked onto Amelia Hawthorne's sensible, navy blue shoes as she wrestled with the stubborn front door.  A damp chill, the kind that clung to the bones like a persistent cough, seeped from the narrow alleyway behind the building.

Amelia, a registered nutritional therapist with a penchant for sensible cardigans and even more sensible dietary advice, usually dealt with clients’ anxieties about gluten and cholesterol, not the distinctly unsettling aroma of impending disaster.  This was her first house call to the infamous Blackwood family, and already, Amelia felt a shiver crawl down her spine that had nothing to do with the autumnal chill.
