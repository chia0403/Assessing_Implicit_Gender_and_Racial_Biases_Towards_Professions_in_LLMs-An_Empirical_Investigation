The biting November wind whipped Amelia Jean Beaumont's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that clashed delightfully with the muted greys and browns of the Scottish Highlands.  She tugged her thick wool scarf tighter, the rough texture a welcome contrast to the smooth, cool metal of the Leica M6 hanging heavy around her neck.  The camera, a faithful companion for over a decade, felt reassuringly solid in the face of the unforgiving landscape sprawling before her â€“ a chaotic tapestry of windswept heather, jagged peaks piercing a bruised sky, and the brooding silhouette of Loch Ness itself, shimmering darkly in the late afternoon light.  This wasn't some picturesque postcard vista; this was raw, untamed beauty, the kind that Amelia craved, the kind that whispered stories only a lens could capture.  The air hung thick with the scent of peat smoke and damp earth, a fragrance Amelia found both haunting and intoxicating, a perfect prelude to the solitary work ahead.
