The salt spray stung Aurelia "Rel" Hawthorne's face as she wrestled the easel into position, its legs sinking slightly into the yielding sand.  The wind, a relentless sculptor of the dunes, whipped her auburn hair across her eyes, momentarily obscuring the breathtaking vista before her.  Rel squinted, her gaze fixed on the churning turquoise waters of the Atlantic, where the setting sun bled fiery oranges and molten golds across the sky, mirroring the palette she held in her trembling hand.  She was perched on a precarious outcrop of rock, a lonely sentinel against the immensity of the Outer Banks, the wind-ravaged beauty of Cape Hatteras stretching before her like a wrinkled, ancient tapestry. The air, thick with the scent of brine and wild rosemary, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  This was her sanctuary, her studio, a place where the raw, untamed power of nature inspired the delicate strokes of her brush.
