The biting wind, sharp as a dropped axe, whipped Elias Thorne's beard across his frozen cheeks.  He pulled the worn wool of his toque lower, the breath fogging momentarily before vanishing into the frigid air.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly yellow at the horizon, offered no promise of warmth.  Towering Douglas firs, their branches laden with a thick, clinging snow, clawed at the bruised sky like skeletal fingers.  Elias stood at the edge of the Blackwood logging camp, the rhythmic thud of axes a distant counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind that rattled the flimsy cabins.  The smell of pine, usually comforting, was overridden by the sharp, metallic tang of iron â€“ the iron of blood, he grimly surmised, remembering the accident from yesterday. This wasn't just another day in the woods for Elias Thorne; this was a reckoning.
