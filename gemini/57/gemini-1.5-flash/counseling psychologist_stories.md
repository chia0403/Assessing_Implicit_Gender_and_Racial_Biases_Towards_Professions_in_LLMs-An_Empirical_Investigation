Eleanor, a woman whose tailored suits usually projected an image of controlled competence, felt the familiar prickle of unease as she checked her watch for the tenth time in as many minutes.  Her next appointment, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was already fifteen minutes late, and the storm outside felt less like a meteorological event and more like a premonition.
