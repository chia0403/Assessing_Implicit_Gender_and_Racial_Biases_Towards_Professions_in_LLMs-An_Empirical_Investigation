The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own heartbeat.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with hands as steady as a surgeon's and a smile that could disarm a rabid badger (though she hadn't actually tried that), adjusted the tourniquet on her latest patient's arm.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and something vaguely floral â€“ perhaps the desperate attempt of lilies in a vase to combat the pervasive scent of fear that clung to the waiting room like a persistent cough. Outside, a late summer thunderstorm raged, the wind rattling the windows of the clinic, mirroring the anxiety that often roiled within the veins of her patients.  This particular Tuesday, however, felt different.  A low, persistent dread, heavier than the usual pre-appointment jitters, settled in Amelia's stomach, a feeling that whispered of something far more sinister than a simple case of needle phobia.
