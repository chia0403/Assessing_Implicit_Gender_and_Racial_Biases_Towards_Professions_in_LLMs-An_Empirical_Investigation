The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, harsh bulb above her station, danced in the languid afternoon light filtering through the grimy window of "Nails by Nina," a salon tucked away on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street.  Sera, her own perfectly manicured hands stained a fleeting amethyst from a recent client, sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic whir of the nearby nail dryer. Outside, the cacophony of New York City – a symphony of honking taxis, chattering pedestrians, and the insistent wail of a distant siren – seemed a million miles away, muffled by the salon's faded floral wallpaper and the low hum of conversation from the other manicurists.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her oddly comforting prison.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of routine felt strangely… off.  A prickling unease, sharper than the sting of a carelessly applied acrylic tip, settled in her stomach.
