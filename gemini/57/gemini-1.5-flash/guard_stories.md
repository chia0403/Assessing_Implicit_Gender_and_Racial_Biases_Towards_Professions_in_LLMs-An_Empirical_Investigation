The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and raising gooseflesh on his arms despite the thick furs lining his guard coat.  He hunched deeper into his collar, the collar itself stiff with frozen grime collected from weeks on patrol.  The twin moons of Xylos, pale and distant, offered little warmth, their ethereal glow barely piercing the perpetual twilight that clung to the craggy peaks of the Whisperwind Mountains in the distance.  Elias, a veteran of the Obsidian Guard, adjusted the grip on his halberd, the polished black metal cold against his calloused fingers. His breath plumed out before him, a ghostly white whisper in the vast, silent expanse.  Ahead, the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned watchtower stood silhouetted against the bruised purple sky, a grim sentinel against the encroaching darkness that seemed to seep from the very earth itself.  This was his post, and tonight, it felt more desolate than ever.
