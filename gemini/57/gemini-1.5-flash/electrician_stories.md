The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around Elias Thorne’s ears, whipping stray strands of his greasy brown hair across his face.  He tugged his worn leather work gloves tighter, the chill seeping through even the thickest layers of his clothing.  Above him, the skeletal remains of a derelict lighthouse clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the churning grey sea below.  Elias, a journeyman electrician with calloused hands and a perpetually tired gaze, adjusted the heavy coil of wiring slung across his shoulder.  The island of Aisling, shrouded in a perpetual mist and a history as dark as the stormy ocean surrounding it, was his current – and possibly final – assignment. The old lighthouse, abandoned for decades, was his battlefield, and the flickering ghost of a faulty bulb his only enemy... for now.
