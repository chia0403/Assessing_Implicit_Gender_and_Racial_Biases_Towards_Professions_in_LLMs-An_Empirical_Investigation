The salt spray stung Elara Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from its tangled embrace with a rusted buoy.  Seagulls squawked overhead, their cries a discordant symphony against the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged cliffs of the Isle of Skye.

This wasn't exactly the picturesque retreat she'd envisioned when she'd accepted the temporary position at the remote island's small rehabilitation centre.  The wind whipped her auburn hair across her face, stinging her eyes as the smell of brine and peat smoke hung heavy in the crisp air.  The grey, brooding sky threatened more rain, a fitting backdrop for the melancholic beauty of the landscape and the challenging case that awaited her back at the clinic: a young fisherman, lost at sea for three days, clinging to life but struggling to regain even the simplest of movements.
