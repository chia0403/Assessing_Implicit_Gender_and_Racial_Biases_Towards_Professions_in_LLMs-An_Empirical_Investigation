Empty coffee cups and discarded magazines littered the small space, remnants of a transatlantic flight crammed with exhausted businessmen and fidgeting children. The lingering aroma of duty-free perfume and stale pretzels fought a losing battle against the ever-present scent of jet fuel.  This was Seraâ€™s life, a constant cycle of take-off, turbulence, and landing, punctuated by the ever-shifting demands of a thousand different passengers, each with their own anxieties and expectations hanging heavy in the air, almost as thick as the recycled oxygen.
