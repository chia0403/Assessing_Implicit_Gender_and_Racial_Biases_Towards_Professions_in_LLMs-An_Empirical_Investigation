The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance's desk seemed to mirror the cracks in the meticulously organized fa√ßade of Northwood High.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the sodden football field, blurring the already indistinct lines between the manicured lawns and the encroaching twilight. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst; a familiar perfume to Eleanor, who had spent the last fifteen years navigating the treacherous emotional landscape of adolescence within these hallowed (and somewhat damp) halls.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual hum of adolescent drama was muted, replaced by a heavier, almost palpable sense of unease that clung to the air like the lingering scent of chlorine from the school pool.  A single, flickering fluorescent light above her desk buzzed intermittently, mirroring the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Something was wrong, and Eleanor Vance, guidance counselor extraordinaire, knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that she was about to find out just how wrong it was.
