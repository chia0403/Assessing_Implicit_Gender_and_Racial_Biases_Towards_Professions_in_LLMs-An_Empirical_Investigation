The aroma of stale crayons and slightly-burnt toast hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow-hued mobiles swaying gently above the brightly-colored carpet, dappled the classroom.  Tiny fingerprints, a testament to a day already brimming with chaotic creativity, smudged the windows.  Outside, the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Elementary hummed with the pre-lunch buzz of playground energy – a stark contrast to the relatively peaceful calm (for now) of Ms. Vance's "Sunshine Butterflies" kindergarten class.  Eleanor, perched precariously on a miniature chair, meticulously sharpened a particularly blunt crayon, a small smile playing on her lips as she anticipated the afternoon's finger painting session – a session she already suspected would result in more paint on the children than on the paper.
