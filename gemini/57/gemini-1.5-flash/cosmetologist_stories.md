The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois as her own reflection.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of "Shear Perfection," her salon nestled on the cobbled streets of Montmartre, Paris.  Each drop, a tiny percussionist on the glass panes, underscored the frantic rhythm of her afternoon.  Outside, the Eiffel Tower, usually a romantic backdrop, was shrouded in a swirling grey mist, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Sera's normally serene workspace.  Her normally meticulously organized station was a chaotic swirl of half-finished blow-dries, spilled powders, and a discarded tube of crimson lipstick lying forlornly amidst a tangle of bobby pins.  Tonight, the usual charm of her little salon was lost beneath the weight of impending disaster â€“ a disaster in the form of Madame Evangeline's wedding, scheduled for tomorrow morning.
