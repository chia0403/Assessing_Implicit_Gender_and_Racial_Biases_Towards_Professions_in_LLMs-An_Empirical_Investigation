The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that clawed at the leaded-glass windows of "Stitches in Time."  Rain lashed against the panes, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the steady beat of Seraphina Evangeline Thorne's sewing machine.  Seraphina, or "Sera" as she preferred amongst her closest clients (a select few, mostly society matrons with a penchant for dramatic ball gowns), was hunched over a cascade of emerald green velvet, her nimble fingers coaxing the fabric into the precise pleats demanded by the sketch pinned beside her.  The shop itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic quarter of  Charleston, South Carolina, was a haven of quiet elegance.  Antique sewing machines gleamed under the soft glow of a Tiffany lamp, bolts of shimmering fabric stood in vibrant rows like a spectrum of dreams, and the air was thick with the ghosts of countless creations past.
