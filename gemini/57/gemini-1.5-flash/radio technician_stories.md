The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant antenna cable.  Wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate, windswept headland, whipping his already-tangled brown hair into a frenzy.  Below, the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic gnawed at the jagged cliffs, a relentless, hungry beast.  Elias, perched precariously on a rusted scaffolding platform bolted to the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned lighthouse, cursed under his breath.  His breath plumed out in white puffs, swallowed instantly by the biting November air. This wasn't the picturesque coastal setting advertised in the job description; this was a purgatory of rust and relentless wind, a fitting location, perhaps, for the dying embers of a once-proud radio station.  The only company Elias had was the insistent crackle of static emanating from the ancient transmitter nestled within the lighthouse’s crumbling stone shell – a constant reminder of the task ahead: resurrecting the "Voice of the Isles," a radio station as weathered and forgotten as the cliffs themselves.
