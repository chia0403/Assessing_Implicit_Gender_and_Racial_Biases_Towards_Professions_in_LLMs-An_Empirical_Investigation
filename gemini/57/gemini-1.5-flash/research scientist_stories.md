The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vance’s parka, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already-dim light of the perpetual twilight.  The research station, a squat, metal behemoth clinging precariously to the ice shelf, groaned under the pressure of the relentless elements.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone and stale coffee, a familiar aroma to Eleanor, who’d spent the last three years of her life within these unforgiving walls.
