The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered, frost-covered DC-3.  Below, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Weddell Sea stretched to the horizon, a churning expanse of grey-white punctuated only by the jagged peaks of icebergs, colossal and ancient, that clawed at the bruised sky. The air crackled with static; the radio, a temperamental beast at the best of times, sputtered and wheezed, offering only the lonely hiss of the void.  Evie gripped the worn yoke, her knuckles white against the pale leather.  This wasn't just another flight; this was a rescue mission, a desperate gamble against the brutal indifference of the Antarctic winter.  The fate of three trapped researchers hung precariously in the balance, suspended somewhere between the frozen wasteland and the indifferent sky.
