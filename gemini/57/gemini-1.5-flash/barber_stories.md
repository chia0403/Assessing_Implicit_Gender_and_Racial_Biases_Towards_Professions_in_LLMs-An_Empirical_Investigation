The rasp of the straight razor against honed steel echoed in the near-empty barbershop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of "Barnaby's Blades," illuminating the fine layer of hair clinging to the worn wooden floor.  Barnaby "Barney" Fitzwilliam, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too many bad haircuts and even more bad days, meticulously stropped his razor, the rhythmic motion a meditative practice in a life increasingly devoid of peace.  The air hung heavy with the scent of bay rum, stale coffee, and the lingering ghost of Brylcreem, a perfume of bygone eras that Barney, at 62, embodied perfectly.  Outside, the bustling city of Chicago roared its modern indifference, but within Barnaby's Blades, time moved at its own deliberate pace, a sanctuary from the relentless march of progress.
