The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying plantains and simmering spices, a fragrant assault on the senses that Aurelia “Reli” Hernandez had grown accustomed to, yet never quite immune to.  Reli, Executive Chef of the renowned "Isla Perdida" restaurant nestled on the cliffside overlooking the turquoise chaos of the Caribbean Sea, wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, the flour dusting her already sun-kissed skin. The kitchen, a gleaming, stainless-steel labyrinth, buzzed with the pre-dinner frenzy.  The rhythmic clang of pans, the sizzle of oil, and the hushed urgency of the line cooks formed a chaotic symphony, a ballet of culinary precision orchestrated by Reli herself.  Tonight was a special one – the annual  "Luna de Miel" (Honeymoon) gala, and the pressure was palpable, hanging thicker than the tropical night air.
