The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, Director of the crumbling Majestic Theatre. Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the cavernous space, mimicking the nervous flutter in Elias's stomach.  The Majestic, once a beacon of glittering glamour, now stood as a testament to time's relentless erosion â€“ chipped plaster angels wept silently from the ceiling, their gilded wings dulled by decades of neglect.  Tonight, however, the theatre held a different kind of hush, a silence pregnant with the potential for either glorious resurrection or final, crushing defeat.  For tonight, Elias Thorne was staging his magnum opus, a daring adaptation of "King Lear," set not in ancient Britain, but in the decaying heart of 1930s Chicago.
