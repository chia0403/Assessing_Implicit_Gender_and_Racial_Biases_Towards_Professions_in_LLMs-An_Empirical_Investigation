The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne's ankles as he hurried across the windswept quadrangle of St. Jude's Hospital.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered his dark overcoat to his back.  The imposing Gothic architecture of the hospital, usually a source of quiet contemplation, felt tonight like a looming, granite fist, its shadow stretching long and menacing across the slick cobblestones.  Inside, the sterile scent of antiseptic couldn't quite mask the underlying aroma of fear and desperation that permeated the hallowed halls.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, pushed through the revolving doors, the heavy glass groaning a mournful protest against the windâ€™s assault.  He was late, again, a fact that gnawed at his already frayed nerves.  The emergency room buzzed with a frantic energy, a symphony of beeping monitors and hushed, urgent voices, a cacophony that Elias knew all too well.  Tonight, however, the usual clinical chaos felt amplified, charged with a palpable sense of dread.
