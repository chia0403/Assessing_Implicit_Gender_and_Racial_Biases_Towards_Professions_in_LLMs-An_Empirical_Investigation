The crimson sun bled across the jagged peaks of the Granite Ridge, painting the barren valley floor in hues of bruised purple and ash grey.  Dust, thick and gritty, clung to everything â€“ the worn, leather-patched gloves of Bartholomew "Barty"  MacIntyre, the scarred metal of his bulldozer, even the wisps of smoke curling from the abandoned mine shaft that dominated the landscape.  Barty, a man whose face was a roadmap of sun-baked lines and calloused hands, wrestled the massive machine into a new position.  The bulldozer groaned, the hydraulics protesting with a guttural roar, a sound that echoed through the silent valley like a beast awakening.  This was the forgotten heart of the Copper King Mine, a place where the ghosts of forgotten fortunes whispered on the wind and the only company Barty kept were the shadows and the relentless, unforgiving mountain.
