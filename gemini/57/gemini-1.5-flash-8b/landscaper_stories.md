The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's hair across her face as she surveyed the overgrown chaos of the Blackwood estate.  Ivy, thick as pythons, choked the ancient oak trees, their once-proud branches now skeletal fingers clawing at the bruised, grey sky.  Dead leaves, churned into a brown soup by the relentless autumnal gales, littered the once-manicured lawns, now a testament to neglect.  Amelia, a landscaper with a reputation for turning barren patches into vibrant oases, felt a familiar pang of frustration. This job, more than most, felt like wading through a swamp of someone else's sadness.  The air, thick with the scent of decaying wood and damp earth, hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive stillness of the mansion itself.  She adjusted her gloves, the leather chafing her palms, and squinted at the looming, gothic structure.  It was a challenge, certainly, but this one feltâ€¦different.  Something about the Blackwood estate whispered of secrets and sorrow, a story etched into the very soil beneath her feet.
