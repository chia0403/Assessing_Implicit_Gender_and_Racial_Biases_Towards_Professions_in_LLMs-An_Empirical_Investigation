The desert wind, a relentless razor, whipped across the cracked asphalt of Route 66.  Dust devils danced like phantoms in the shimmering heat haze, and the only sound louder than the rhythmic groan of the old semi-truck, "The Crimson Comet," was the relentless thrum of Elias Blackwood's own, desperate heartbeat.  He gripped the worn leather steering wheel, knuckles white against the ancient wood.

Elias Blackwood, 47, with eyes the color of storm clouds and a face etched with the stories of a thousand lonely miles, wasn't just a trucker; he was a custodian of forgotten highways, a keeper of secrets buried beneath layers of cracked pavement and sun-baked earth.  The Crimson Comet, a rust-colored behemoth with a faded, hand-painted logo of a blazing comet, was more than just a vehicle; it was his sanctuary, his refuge, his home.  Right now, however, it was a metal cage, its confines feeling suffocating in the oppressive heat.  He was approaching a stretch of road known only as the "Ghost Mile," a section of highway notorious for phantom sightings and disappearances â€“ a place whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires and muttered in trucker's bars.  A knot tightened in his stomach as he crested a rise, the desolate emptiness of the desert stretching before him, unbroken save for the ragged outline of a lone, skeletal saguaro cactus.
