The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Butterfield's face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, simmering stew, and desperation.  The small, dimly lit diner was a microcosm of the grey, overcast evening outside: a place where time seemed to slow to a crawl, where hushed conversations and the clinking of silverware were the only sounds that mattered. Amelia, all of five-foot-two and perpetually tired, wiped down the sticky counter, the faint floral scent of her lavender-scented hand sanitizer barely combating the greasy residue.  It was Wednesday night, the slowest night of the week, a night that felt like a lifetime waiting to end.  Her apron, stained with countless spills and smeared with traces of countless meals, was a testament to years spent navigating the back-and-forth of this little piece of the city.
