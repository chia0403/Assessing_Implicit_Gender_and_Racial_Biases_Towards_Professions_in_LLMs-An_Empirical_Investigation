The biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the ramshackle wooden shutters of Elias Thorne's workshop, rattling the half-finished chair legs stacked precariously against the wall. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating splinters of wood and shavings scattered across the floor like fallen stars.  Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands weathered like ancient maps and eyes the colour of grey-tinted amber, knelt beside a workbench groaning under the weight of a complex, intricate clock mechanism.  The workshop, nestled within the shadowed alleys of the Old Quarter, reeked of linseed oil and sawdust, a comforting, familiar scent that was the very air he breathed.  He traced the delicate curve of a gear with a calloused fingertip, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the cobbled streets echoed with the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths' hammers and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares.  Elias, lost in the intricate dance of wood and metal, felt a sudden, sharp pang of loneliness, a sensation as unwelcome as a stray raindrop in the heart of a snowstorm.
