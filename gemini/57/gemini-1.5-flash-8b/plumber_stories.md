The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Reliable Plumbing" storefront cast a sickly yellow glow over Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Jr., as he wrestled with a stubborn drainpipe.  The air, thick with the cloying aroma of mildew and something vaguely resembling burnt sugar, hung heavy in the cramped basement apartment.  Barty, a man whose plumber's uniform seemed permanently stained with a shade of grease Barty himself couldn't name, swore softly under his breath.  His greasy hands, calloused and scarred, gripped the pipe with the intensity of a desperate hug.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of rain against the corrugated metal roof was a constant, insistent soundtrack to his struggle.  This was not the glamorous image of a plumbing adventure Barty conjured in his daydreams of fixing leaky faucets in elegant mansions.  This was the reality of a Tuesday night in the perpetually damp basement of Mrs. Higgins's apartment building on Elm Street, a reality laced with the threat of a flooded apartment.

**Setting:** A cramped, damp basement apartment in a run-down apartment building on Elm Street.  The air is thick with the smells of mildew, burnt sugar, and pipe wrench.  Fluorescent lights flicker above, casting a sickly yellow glow on the grime-coated walls.  The building itself feels old and tired, the corrugated metal roof above echoing the relentless rhythm of the rain.
