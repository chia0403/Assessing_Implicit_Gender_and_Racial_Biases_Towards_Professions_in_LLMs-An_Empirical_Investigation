The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's shawl around her, stinging her cheeks like tiny ice shards.  The sprawling, gothic architecture of Blackwood Manor, draped in a thick shroud of mist, seemed to press in on her, its shadowy eaves whispering secrets only the wind could carry.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker Extraordinaire (a title she'd rather not be known for) shivered, pulling her woolen scarf tighter.  It was the dead of winter, and the frosty breath of the manorâ€™s ancient oaks felt profoundly cold, far colder than the temperature readings indicated.  

This wasn't just any manor, of course.  Blackwood Manor was famed, whispered about, for its collection of exceptionally rare and peculiar creatures.  Amelia, along with a handful of other dedicated staff, was entrusted with the care of a menagerie that defied classification:  a family of snow leopards with an unsettling penchant for moonlit ballet, a gaggle of talking ravens who held court in the library, a grumpy, one-eyed basilisk who guarded the secret rose garden, and a dozen other wonders that had made the Blackwood name synonymous with the extraordinary.  Her current duty: to ensure the nocturnal owls maintained their ritualistic hooting over the moonlit pond in the west gardens.
