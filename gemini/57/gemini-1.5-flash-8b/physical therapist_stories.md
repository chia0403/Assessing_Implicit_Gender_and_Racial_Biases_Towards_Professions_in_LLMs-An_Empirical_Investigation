Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing ache in Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s temples.  The small, cramped physiotherapy clinic, nestled in the shadow of the looming, grey mountains of the Copperbelt, was usually a symphony of muted sighs and the rhythmic click-clack of her orthotics machine.  Today, however, the silence was pregnant with tension, punctuated only by the mournful wail of a distant siren.  Amy, a physical therapist with sharp eyes and hands that knew the language of bone and muscle, sat hunched over a chart, her brow furrowed in concentration. The file contained a name that sent a chill down her spine:  Moyo.  Moyo Zulu.  A name etched onto a life, a life that seemed fractured and in desperate need of repair.


The clinic itself was a testament to the harsh realities of the area.  Built from scavenged materials and patched together with a surprising amount of makeshift ingenuity, it whispered tales of resilience and hardship.  Dusty, faded posters of healthy, smiling bodies contrasted oddly with the chipped paint and peeling wallpaper.  A faint aroma of antiseptic and something faintly metallic hung in the air, a constant reminder of the demanding clientele.  Beyond the small, single-pane windows, the Copperbelt landscape stretched out, a rugged tapestry of rocky outcrops and scrubby vegetation, a stark reminder of the raw, untamed beauty that lay beneath the harsh, unrelenting sun.  The wind howled outside, and the rain continued its relentless assault on the already battered building. Amy knew, with a sinking feeling, that Moyo's story wasn't just about fractured bones; it was about a life broken by forces far greater than any physical therapy could mend.
