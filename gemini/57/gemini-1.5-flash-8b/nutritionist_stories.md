The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the bustling marketplace of San Cristobal de las Casas.  Sunlight, filtered through a canopy of ancient oaks, cast long, dappled shadows across the cobblestone streets.  The aroma of roasted maize, spicy chiles, and exotic herbs filled Amelia Rodriguez-Garcia's nostrils, a constant reminder of the vibrant culinary tapestry woven into the very fabric of this mountain town.  Amelia, a registered dietitian and nutritionist with a passion for indigenous Andean cuisine, navigated the crowded stalls with practiced ease, her eyes scanning the colourful displays of produce.  Today was the annual "Fiesta de la Cosecha," a celebration of the harvest, and Amelia was on a mission.  She was meticulously documenting the nutritional content of the unique crops grown in these high altitudes, searching for the secret to the residents' remarkable longevity and vitality.  Her worn leather journal, filled with detailed sketches and scientific notes, sat securely in her satchel, a constant companion on her culinary expeditions.
