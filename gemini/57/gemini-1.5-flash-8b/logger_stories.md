The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, stinging Elias Thorne’s exposed cheeks.  Snow, the consistency of fine, dry sand, swirled around his ankles, obscuring the already treacherous path down the mountainside.  He squinted, his breath clouding the frigid air, trying to discern the faint tracks he'd followed for the last hour.  The timberline, a ragged, frozen fringe of gnarled trees, marked the edge of the forest, a frontier where the world abruptly turned gray and unforgiving.  Elias, a logger for over twenty years, knew this landscape intimately.  He knew the whisper of the wind, the groan of the ancient trees, the subtle shift of the ground beneath his boots, even in this blinding snow.  Today, though, something felt different.  Not menacing, not dangerous, but unsettlingly…quiet.

The setting is the remote, mountainous region of the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest, winter.  The specific location is a sparsely populated valley near the timberline, known for its rugged beauty and fiercely independent logging communities. The time is the early 1930s.
