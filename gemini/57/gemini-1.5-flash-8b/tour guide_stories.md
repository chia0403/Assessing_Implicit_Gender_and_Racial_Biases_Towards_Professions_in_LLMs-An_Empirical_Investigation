The biting wind whipped Amelia "Poppy"  Peterson's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She squinted against the grey, perpetually overcast sky, the kind that clung to the Scottish Highlands like a damp shroud.  The air, thick with the scent of peat smoke and damp earth, carried the whispers of centuries.  Below, the ancient stones of Urquhart Castle, silhouetted against the bruised sky, seemed to sigh with the weight of history.  Today, Poppy was leading her meticulously crafted "Whispers of the Highlands" tour, and today, something felt different.  Not ominous, exactly, butâ€¦ off.

The setting: The desolate, windswept landscape of the Scottish Highlands, a region clinging to the edge of the North Atlantic.  Patches of emerald green clung to the slopes of the hills, contrasting sharply with the slate gray of the towering mountains and the encroaching mist.  Urquhart Castle, a majestic ruin perched on the precipice of a loch, dominated the scene.  The loch itself, a mirror reflecting the oppressive sky, mirrored the mood of an unusually quiet day.
