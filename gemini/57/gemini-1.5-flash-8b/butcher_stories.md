The air in the "Ironclad Cleaver" hung thick with the scent of blood, rosemary, and fear.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window of the butcher shop, illuminating a glint of steel on the counter where Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, the proprietor, meticulously sharpened his cleaver.  Barty, a man built like a weathered oak, with calloused hands that seemed to speak volumes of a life spent wrestling with the raw materials of existence, meticulously wiped the blade, his movements precise and rhythmic.  He was a man of routine, a man of the predictable pulse of the market, a man of the inevitable cycle of life and death.  The small, cobbled alleyway outside echoed with the rumble of carts and the murmur of voices, a constant, low hum that barely registered against the quiet symphony of the shop's internal rhythm.  This was his world, this was where Barty Blackwood found solace, even in the slaughter of animals, and the constant whispers of the city's underbelly that seemed to echo through the very stone of the shop.
