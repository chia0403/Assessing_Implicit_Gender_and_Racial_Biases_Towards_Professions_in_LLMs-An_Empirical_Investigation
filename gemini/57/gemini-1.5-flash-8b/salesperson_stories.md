The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need for a Better Tomorrow" store hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's day.  Dust motes danced in the pale glare, illuminating the rows of gleaming appliances, shimmering cookware, and brightly-colored home d√©cor items.  Amelia, a salesperson in the kitchenware section, sighed, pushing a stack of ceramic mugs further back on the display.  Another slow Tuesday.  The aroma of freshly baked bread, usually a comforting counterpoint to the sterile environment, had been replaced by the pervasive scent of cheap air freshener, a scent Amelia loathed.  This week's sales figures were particularly dismal, and the pressure to perform was mounting.  Her manager, Mr. Henderson, had a reputation for being as sharp as a butcher's knife, and Amelia knew his disapproval was a tangible thing, settling like a heavy blanket over her already anxious shoulders.  Today, the silence was deafening, punctuated only by the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia's heels on the polished linoleum floor.
