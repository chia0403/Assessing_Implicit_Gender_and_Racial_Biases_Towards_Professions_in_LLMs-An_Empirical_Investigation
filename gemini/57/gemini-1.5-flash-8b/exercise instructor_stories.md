The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks.  Below, the sprawling cityscape of New Zenith shimmered, a dazzling display of glass and steel reflected in the perpetually overcast sky.  Amelia, a trim figure in a vibrant turquoise workout jacket, adjusted her neon-pink headband and surveyed the rooftop terrace.  This was her domain, the High Altitude Bootcamp, a haven perched atop the city's tallest skyscraper, accessible only via a private elevator and a winding, exposed stairway.  Today's class, "Urban Ascent," was scheduled to begin in fifteen minutes, and Amelia, with her signature fiery passion and unwavering determination, was ready to inspire a new wave of fitness fanatics.  The faintest strains of upbeat electronic music drifted up from the courtyard below, a prelude to the sweat-soaked energy that would soon fill the space.  The metallic scent of salt and ozone, a familiar aroma of the high-altitude workouts, mingled with the exhaust fumes from the city traffic, creating a unique, yet strangely invigorating atmosphere.
