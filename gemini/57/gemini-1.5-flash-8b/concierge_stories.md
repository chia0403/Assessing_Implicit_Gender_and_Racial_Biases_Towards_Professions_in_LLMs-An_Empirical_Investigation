The rain hammered against the copper-clad awning of the Grand Magnolia Hotel, a rhythmic tattoo that seemed to echo the frantic pulse in Amelia Kensington's temple.  The year was 1938.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the lobby's immense, Art Deco expanse.  A symphony of muted chatter, the clinking of silverware, and the soft whir of the ornate ceiling fan filled the air, a backdrop to Amelia's silent struggle.  A blizzard of urgent phone calls, whispered instructions, and frantic requests to retrieve lost gloves, misplaced passports, and, occasionally, a particularly elusive pet ferret – all clamored for her attention.


Amelia, a petite woman with eyes the color of polished amber and a smile that could disarm a tiger, was the Grand Magnolia's Chief Concierge.  Her immaculate black suit, perfectly tailored gloves, and a signature sapphire brooch glimmered against the opulent backdrop, contrasting starkly with the growing knot of anxiety in her stomach.  Today, the hotel's reputation – and, perhaps, a few lives – depended on her finely tuned ability to navigate the labyrinthine corridors of high society and untangle the silken threads of circumstance.
