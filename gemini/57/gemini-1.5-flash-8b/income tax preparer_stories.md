The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed a relentless, almost mocking, tune.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a rhythmic counterpoint to the incessant clicking of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s keyboard.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of dark brown hair that seemed to defy gravity, hunched over her desk, a mountain of tax forms looming before her.  Today, the usual Monday morning rush was particularly ferocious.  The air in the small, cramped office, crammed with overflowing filing cabinets and the lingering scent of stale coffee, felt thick with anxiety.  Clients, their faces etched with a mixture of apprehension and desperation, shuffled in and out, each one bearing a fresh batch of paperwork.

The Tax Time Express, located in the heart of a small, forgotten industrial park on the outskirts of the city, wasn't known for its elegance.  It wasn't even particularly known at all.  But for those in its orbit, for the families who relied on Amelia's meticulous attention to detail and her surprisingly comforting presence, it was a haven.  A place where the complexities of income tax were somehow transformed into manageable tasks.  From the flickering fluorescent lights, the rhythmic rainfall, to the whispered anxieties of her clients, Amelia knew that this small, slightly chaotic office was her world.
