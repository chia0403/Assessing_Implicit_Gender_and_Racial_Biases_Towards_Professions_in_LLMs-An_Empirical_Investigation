The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned broadcasting studio hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the incessant crackle and pop emanating from the tangled web of wires snaking across the concrete floor.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already faded cityscape outside.  This was Elias Thorne's domain, the desolate heart of Radio Zephyr, a forgotten relic of a bygone era. Elias Thorne, a radio technician with calloused hands and eyes that held the glint of a thousand forgotten signals, knelt beside a towering amplifier, its metal chassis scarred with rust and time.  He traced a weathered inscription on the front panel: "Zephyr 1, 1957."  A faint, almost inaudible hum resonated from within the apparatus, a ghost of broadcasts long since silenced.  The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and decay.  The only other sound was the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water seeping through the broken window.
