The biting wind whipped rain-slicked strands of Amelia "Amy" Harding's hair across her face, stinging her eyes.  The flickering sodium lights of the deserted highway cast long, skeletal shadows around the crumpled metal of a mangled SUV.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of burnt rubber and something acrid, something vaguely sweet and sickening, hung heavy.  Amy, a seasoned firefighter with the Phoenix Fire Department, pressed her gloves deeper into the damp earth, the dampness seeping through her thermal gear.  This wasn't your typical car accident.  This wasâ€¦ different.

Setting: The desolate stretch of Interstate 10, just outside the sprawling, sun-baked metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona.  A late September night, the kind that held a promise of violent storms, yet delivered only relentless, chilling rain.  The deserted highway, usually a concrete ribbon pulsing with life, felt like a cold, empty wound under the unforgiving desert sky.  The faint hum of distant traffic barely pierced the oppressive silence.  Around the wreckage, a silent vigil of emergency vehicles stood in stark contrast to the raging storm.  The very air seemed to hold its breath.  Inside the SUV, the silence was absolute.
