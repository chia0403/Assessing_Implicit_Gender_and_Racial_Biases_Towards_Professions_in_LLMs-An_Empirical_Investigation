The fluorescent hum of the drafting room, a symphony of whirring mechanical pencils and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of fingers on drafting tables, was Elias Thorneâ€™s world.  He was a drafting worker, a precise artist in a world of precise lines.  His workstation, nestled in the cavernous space shared by a dozen others, was bathed in the sterile white light of the high-bay fluorescent fixtures.  Stacks of blueprints, each a meticulously drawn map of a future yet to be built, leaned precariously against the steel-framed drafting tables.  The air hung heavy with the scent of graphite and the faint, acrid tang of old coffee. Elias, hunched over a drawing of a complex bridge support, meticulously traced the curves and angles with a mechanical pencil, a tiny constellation of tiny marks against the white paper.  Outside the large plate-glass windows, the city of Atheria stretched out, a sprawling metropolis of steel and glass, a monument to human ingenuity and ambition, a cityscape that Elias, day after day, played a small but vital role in shaping.
