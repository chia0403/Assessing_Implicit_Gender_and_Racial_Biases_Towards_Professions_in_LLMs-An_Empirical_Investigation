The fluorescent lights of the "All Things Shiny" store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Grace Blackwood's life.  Rain hammered against the corrugated steel roof, mirroring the relentless rhythm of the scanner whirring as she processed another customer's purchase of, inexplicably, a dozen iridescent rubber ducks.  Amelia, perched behind the counter of the dusty, slightly musty store, felt a familiar pang of ennui.  The scent of stale coffee and old paper mingled with the sickly sweet aroma of the store's signature "Glitter-Glaze" nail polish, a potent cocktail that clung to the air like a second skin.  Outside, the grey industrial park stretched out, an expanse of warehouses and deserted loading docks, punctuated only by the occasional flickering neon sign.  Amelia traced the chipped paint on the chipped Formica counter with a fingernail, wishing for something more, something...shiny, in her own life.
