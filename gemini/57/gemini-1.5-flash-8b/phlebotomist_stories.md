The fluorescent hum of the blood bank pulsed through Amelia Nightingale, a low, insistent thrum that mirrored the steady, rhythmic drip of the IV fluid bags hanging from the steel-frame ceiling.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh overhead lights, danced in the sterile air of the New Haven Regional Blood Center.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with five years under her metaphorical, well-practiced bandaged forearm, felt the familiar pressure of the small vein, a fragile, almost invisible thread, beneath her needle.  Her patient, a woman named Eleanor Vance, lay in a hospital bed, her breath shallow, her eyes closed, a faint tremor in her hand clutching the thin blanket.  It was a Tuesday, like any other, except tonight, something feltâ€¦wrong.  The air, usually crisp and antiseptic, seemed thick with an unspoken tension.  The usual chatter of the blood bank staff was hushed, replaced by anxious whispers and the rhythmic beep of heart monitors, each beep a small, punctuating drumbeat against the silence.  The blood center, usually a place of life-giving exchange, felt today like a waiting room for something...uncertain.
