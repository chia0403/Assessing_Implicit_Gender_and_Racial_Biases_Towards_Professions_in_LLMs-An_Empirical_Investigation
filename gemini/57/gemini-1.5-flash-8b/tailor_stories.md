Inside, the worn wooden tables groaned beneath the weight of fabric samples, each a testament to Elias's countless commissions.  This particular day, however, felt heavier than most.  A single, embroidered silk handkerchief lay in the centre of his workbench, an intricate floral design barely visible in the gloom. It was all that remained of a lost commission, a symbol of a missed deadline and a client's simmering frustration.
