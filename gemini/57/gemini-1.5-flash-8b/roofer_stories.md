The biting wind whipped at Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's weathered jacket, stinging his cheeks and rattling the rusted nails in his worn leather work gloves.  He hunched lower, squinting against the relentless grey sky, the icy rain hammering the corrugated iron roof like a frantic drumbeat.  Below, the sprawling cityscape of Aethelgard, a city built on the jagged spine of ancient mountains, stretched out like a tapestry woven from steel and stone.  Towering spires of obsidian, their surfaces etched with the stories of centuries, pierced the clouds.  Aethelgard, a city of impossible heights and echoing silence, was Barty's domain.


The year was 2147.  A creeping dread, a feeling of disquiet, had settled over the city.  News whispered on the wind, carried by the ragged banners flapping from rooftops, spoke of dwindling resources, of fractured alliances.  The great Crystal Mines, the lifeblood of Aethelgard, had become erratic, producing less and less of the precious crystal energy that powered the city's intricate systems.  The shimmering, almost ethereal, aura that usually bathed the peaks in a soft, blue glow had dimmed.  Barty, perched precariously on a narrow ledge, felt the chill in his very bones.  Not just the chill of the relentless rain, but the palpable unease seeping into the air around him. This wasn't just about fixing a leaky roof anymore; this was about fixing a city.
