The flickering neon sign of "Serenity's Touch" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes, hung heavy in the alleyway, a stark contrast to the comforting warmth promised within.

Amelia, her grey uniform pressed against her surprisingly still figure, adjusted the strap of her canvas tote bag.  Inside, nestled amongst aromatherapy oils and warm compresses, lay a small, intricately carved wooden box.  She traced the pattern with a finger, a hesitant smile playing on her lips.  Tonight, the sanctuary wouldn't just offer relief; it might hold the key to something far more profound.
