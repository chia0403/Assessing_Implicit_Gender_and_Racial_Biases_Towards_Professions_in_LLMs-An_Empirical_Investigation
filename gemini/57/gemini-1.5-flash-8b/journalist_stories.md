Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Whispering Pines" diner, a rhythmic counterpoint to the low hum of the conversation inside.  The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale cigarette smoke, a familiar aroma to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, seasoned journalist and resident observer of the quiet town of Oakhaven.  Outside, the autumn leaves, once vibrant hues of crimson and gold, were now a soggy, muted brown, clinging to the branches like damp shrouds.  Oakhaven, usually a picture of tranquil serenity, was perpetually shrouded in a melancholic mist.  Amy, perched on a stool by the window, meticulously sharpened a pencil, the lead shavings dancing in the flickering fluorescent light.  Her notepad, filled with barely legible scrawls and half-formed ideas, lay open before her.  Today's assignment: unravel the mystery of the vanishing wildflowers.  Not just any wildflowers, but the legendary, iridescent blooms that only bloomed once every century, blooming only in the darkest part of the woods.
