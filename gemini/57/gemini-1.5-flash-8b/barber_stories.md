The chipped paint of the "The Razor's Edge" barbershop, a faded crimson now more akin to a bruised plum, reflected the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the cramped space, illuminating a swirling cloud of grey hair clinging to the worn, polished wooden floor.  Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose own salt-and-pepper hair seemed perpetually in a state of rebellion against gravity, leaned over his latest client, a stout woman named Mrs. Higgins, meticulously snipping at a stray curl.  The rhythmic click-click of his clippers, punctuated by the occasional sigh of Mrs. Higgins, was the only sound in the otherwise silent shop.  The air hung thick with the smells of ozone from the old-fashioned ozone machine, and the comforting, slightly cloying aroma of lavender-scented hair tonic.  A few framed, slightly yellowed photographs of past clientele—a grinning Mayor from the 1960s, a glamorous movie star from the 1940s—looked down upon the scene from their dusty perches, silent witnesses to countless stories whispered within the four walls of The Razor's Edge.
