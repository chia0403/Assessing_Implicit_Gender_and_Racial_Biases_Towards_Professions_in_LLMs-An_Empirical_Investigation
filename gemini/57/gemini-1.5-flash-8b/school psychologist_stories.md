The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School guidance office hummed, a constant, low thrum that mirrored the anxiety Amelia Blackwood felt rising in her chest.  The faded floral wallpaper, a relic from a time when the school was a vibrant hub of teenage activity, now seemed to absorb the faint sounds of the hallways, muffling the tremors of fear that vibrated through her.  Empty coffee cups, half-eaten granola bars, and crumpled papers littered her desk â€“ a chaotic reflection of the emotional storms she navigated daily as school psychologist.  The rhythmic *click-click-click* of her fingers against the worn surface of her laptop was the only sound piercing the quiet.  Today, however, it felt like an inadequate shield against the impending storm.  Outside her window, the crisp autumn air whipped the leaves into a frenzy against the glass, mirroring the turbulence swirling inside her.  It was a Tuesday, the day of the school-wide assembly, and Amelia knew the weight of the unspoken was palpable, even in the silence.
