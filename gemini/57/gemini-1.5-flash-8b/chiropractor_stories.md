The rhythmic *click* of the adjusting table echoed through the small, cluttered office of Dr. Amelia Petrova.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating swirling patterns on the faded floral wallpaper.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, guided a hunched, elderly woman, Mrs. Eleanor Vance, through a series of controlled movements.  The scent of lavender oil, a relic from a bygone era, mingled with the faint aroma of antiseptic and the lingering perfume of cheap coffee from the diner across the street.  Ameliaâ€™s small, cluttered office, tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling yet decaying city of Oakhaven, was her sanctuary, her workshop, and her world.  Each *click* of the adjustment was a symphony, a promise of relief, a small victory against the relentless march of time and injury.
