The biting wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor Vance's coat, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the narrow, cobblestone street.  The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the alleyways, obscuring the already-dimly lit corners.  The scent of stale bread and something vaguely metallic clung to the air, a familiar symphony of the city's late-night hum.  London, 1888.  A chill seeped into her very bones, a feeling mirrored by the growing unease in her stomach.  Tonight, a call to the East End meant more than just another emergency. It feltâ€¦ different.  The air, thick with the unspoken anxieties of a city on the precipice of something unknown.  The pressure mounted as she crested the hill, the flickering lights of the workhouse casting a sickly yellow glow on the terraced rows of buildings.  She adjusted her spectacles, the faint reflection of the gaslight glinting on the brass nameplate of her physician's bag: Dr. Eleanor Vance, Emergency Medical Care.
