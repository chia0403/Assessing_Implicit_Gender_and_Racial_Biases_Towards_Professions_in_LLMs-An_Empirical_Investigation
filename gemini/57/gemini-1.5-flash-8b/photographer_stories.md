The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's camera bag around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The grey sky, a bruised canvas painted across the jagged peaks of the Cairngorms, mirrored the despair blooming in her chest.  She was supposed to be capturing the ethereal beauty of the Scottish Highlands, the legendary mists swirling around ancient stones, the vibrant hues of the heather ablaze in the sun.  Instead, she was trapped in a relentless, featureless deluge, the only colours reflected in the churning puddles at her feet.  Milly, a freelance photographer with a portfolio brimming with captivating landscapes, felt like a stranded, grey speck against a canvas painted in shades of gloom.

Setting: A remote, windswept plateau in the Cairngorms National Park, Scotland.  The weather is a relentless, driving rain, reducing visibility to near-zero.  The towering peaks of the mountains are shrouded in mist, and the air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Milly is positioned on a small, windswept outcrop, her only company the relentless roar of the wind and the rhythmic patter of the rain against her waterproof gear. The muted palette of the landscape and the claustrophobic atmosphere creates a sense of isolation and impending doom.
