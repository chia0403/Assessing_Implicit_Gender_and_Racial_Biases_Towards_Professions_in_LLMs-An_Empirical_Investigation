The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Designs" office hummed, a relentless, monotonous drone that echoed the quiet desperation settling in Amelia Hawthorne’s chest.  Eight o'clock sharp.  The digital clock on the reception desk blinked, a cold, impersonal eye judging her lingering contemplation of the chipped paint on the welcome mat.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a practiced smile, adjusted the floral print of her blouse, a desperate attempt to inject some semblance of order into the chaos brewing within.  Apex Architectural Designs, a prestigious firm specializing in high-end residential projects, was, in Amelia’s estimation, a gilded cage.  The polished mahogany reception desk, gleaming under the harsh lights, seemed to mock her worn flats and the ever-present anxiety that clung to her like a second skin.  The city of Zenith, sprawling beneath a bruised, overcast sky, was a constant reminder of the mundane life she led, a life meticulously orchestrated to service the intricate designs of others.
