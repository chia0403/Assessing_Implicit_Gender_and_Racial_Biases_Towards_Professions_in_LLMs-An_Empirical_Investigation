Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated gymnasium, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Em" Hawthorne.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and teenage angst, hung heavy as she surveyed the basketball court.  Broken hoops, scarred by years of errant shots and forgotten rivalries, marked the space like battle wounds.  This was the "Phoenix" â€“ a team more aptly named the "Phoenixes in Peril," if Em had her way.  Tonight, the rival "Steel Sharks" were coming.  Tonight, the fate of the Phoenixes, and Em's carefully constructed season, hung precariously in the balance.

The setting:  The dilapidated, rain-soaked gymnasium of Northwood High School, a small, struggling town nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Appalachian foothills.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the nearly empty building.  The echoes of basketballs bouncing on the worn hardwood floor and the guttural shouts of previous games still lingered in the air.
