Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Reliable Risk Assessment" office, mimicking the frantic tapping of Amelia Penelope Butterfield's fingers on the polished mahogany desk.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, thick enough to taste.  The year was 1937, and the city of New York thrummed with a nervous energy that mirrored the anxious flutter in Amelia's stomach.  She was a rising star at Reliable Risk, renowned for her meticulous assessments and uncanny ability to spot potential disaster before it struck.  But today, even her legendary foresight felt inadequate.

The office, a cramped space on a side street just off Fifth Avenue, was a testament to the Depression's grip on the city.  Dusty files overflowed from overflowing metal cabinets.  The chipped paint on the walls, once a vibrant, confident blue, now seemed to swallow the light, making every shadow seem menacing.  A flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows that danced with the raindrops blurring through the glass.  Amelia's only companion was the relentless rhythm of the rain against the glass.  Each drop seemed to echo the pounding of her heart, a counterpoint to the quiet hum of the city outside.
