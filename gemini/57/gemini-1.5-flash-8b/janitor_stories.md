The fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Museum flickered, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished marble floors.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes.  Elias Thorne, a man whose uniform – a faded navy blue polo shirt and perpetually smudged khaki pants – seemed to absorb the museum's accumulated history, meticulously swept around a bust of a long-forgotten emperor.  The emperor's gaze, sharp and ancient, seemed to follow Elias's every move, a silent judgment of the dust bunnies he carefully displaced.  The Grand Zenith, a monument to a lost civilisation, felt strangely alive, though only in the echoing sighs of the air conditioning and the whisper of the aged exhibits.

**Setting:**  The Grand Zenith Museum, a sprawling, imposing edifice nestled deep within the city's decaying heart.  Built during a golden age of forgotten technology, the museum housed artifacts of exquisite craftsmanship and bewildering complexity, each item a silent testament to a society now vanished.  The atmosphere was heavy with the scent of aged parchment, decaying wood, and something indefinably metallic, a lingering echo of the museum's past.  A perpetual hush hung over the vast halls, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of Elias's broom and the occasional creak of a forgotten support beam.
