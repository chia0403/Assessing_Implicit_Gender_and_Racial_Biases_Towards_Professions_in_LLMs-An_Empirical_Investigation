The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hayes's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, slicing through the hazy air of the small, cramped dental practice tucked away on a side street of the bustling city.  Cobwebs, thin as silken threads, clung to the chipped paint of the ceiling, adding a touch of melancholic artistry to the sterile white walls.  Outside, the relentless cacophony of urban life – the honking of taxis, the screech of brakes, the distant rumble of construction – echoed through the slightly warped windows, a constant reminder of the world beyond the antiseptic embrace of her office. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously worked on a chipped molar, her focused gaze unwavering.  Her name, emblazoned on a faded plaque above the reception desk, proclaimed her profession: "Dr. Amelia Hayes, DDS."  The clock on the wall ticked with a stubborn regularity, each second a tiny hammer blow against the silent tension of the afternoon.
