The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a small, cluttered auto repair shop nestled between a bakery and a used bookstore.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the frantic whirring of the air compressor.  Inside,  Arthur Pendragon, a man whose perpetually stained overalls were a testament to his profession, leaned over a sputtering engine, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The engine, a vintage Ford Model T, coughed and sputtered, a symphony of frustrated mechanical groans.  Arthur, his calloused hands deftly working among the tangle of wires and hoses, muttered under his breath, a blend of curses and muttered diagnoses.  Outside, the rain lashed the street, obscuring the city's usual cacophony, leaving only the rhythmic, almost hypnotic, sounds of the shopâ€™s tools and Arthur's determined struggle with the stubborn machine.
