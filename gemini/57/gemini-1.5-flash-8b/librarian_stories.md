The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting a celestial choir, painted the dust motes dancing in the air of the Blackwood Library a kaleidoscope of amber and emerald.  Books, leather-bound and paper-thin, lined the shelves like silent sentinels, reaching towards the vaulted ceiling.  The only other sound besides the gentle hiss of the kettle was the soft rustle of turning pages.  Amelia, a librarian with eyes the colour of aged parchment and a quiet grace that belied her sharp wit, traced the worn spine of a first edition copy of "The Odyssey". She was in her element.

The Blackwood Library, nestled within the heart of the whispering, cobbled streets of Oakhaven, wasn't just a repository of knowledge; it was a sanctuary.  Built generations ago by a reclusive scholar, the library possessed an almost palpable aura of history, its ancient stones humming with the echoes of countless stories.  The scent of cedar and old paper hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm to the restless city outside.  Today, however, a chill wind had crept in, accompanied by a rumour that circulated between the shelves like a whispered secret: a new book had arrived.  A book that wasn't supposed to exist.
