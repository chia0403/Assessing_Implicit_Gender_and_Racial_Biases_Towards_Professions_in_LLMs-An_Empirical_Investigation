The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something indefinably metallic, clinging to the recycled air of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.  Elara Vance, flight attendant, meticulously straightened the crisp white napkin on the tray table, a practiced gesture masking the tremor in her hand.  Outside, the volcanic peaks of the Indonesian archipelago loomed, jagged silhouettes against the bruised twilight sky.  The rumbling of the plane, usually a comforting lullaby, now sounded like a distant, ominous heartbeat.  Elara knew that feeling – the premonition that something wasn't quite right, a sense of foreboding that had been whispering at the edges of her consciousness since the first tremors had begun, shaking the ground beneath her feet and the foundations of her world.

The flight,  designated  RJ747, was scheduled to land at Denpasar's Ngurah Rai International Airport, but that seemed a lifetime away now.  Elara glanced at her watch, the numbers a blur.  It was almost midnight, and the cabin was eerily quiet, the usual clatter of conversation and chatter replaced by an unnerving stillness.  The passengers, mostly a mixture of Japanese businessmen and families on holiday, were pale, their eyes reflecting the anxious light of the emergency lights flicking intermittently.  The sense of impending doom was tangible.  Elara caught a glimpse of a tear trace on a passenger’s cheek, then quickly turned away, reminding herself that she had to be strong. She was their anchor in this storm.
