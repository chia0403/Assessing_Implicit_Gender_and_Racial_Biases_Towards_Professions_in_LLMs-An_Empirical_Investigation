The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones, painting the alleyway in a lurid, almost ethereal light.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation.  Barnaby "Barney" Butterfield, a man whose face held the map of a thousand late nights and a thousand whispered secrets, wiped down the sticky mahogany bar.  The chipped porcelain mugs, each bearing a different story etched into their glaze, reflected the faint glow of the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling.  Tonight, the clientele was a familiar, if slightly unsettling, mix:  the gaunt, grey-faced merchant with eyes that held the weight of lost fortunes; the boisterous, sweat-stained dockworkers; and the lone figure hunched in the corner, lost in the silent drama of a half-empty bottle.  The year was 1888, and the city of Port Haven, nestled amongst the fog-shrouded hills and the churning, relentless sea, held its breath in anticipation of a storm that felt more personal, more imminent, than any before.
