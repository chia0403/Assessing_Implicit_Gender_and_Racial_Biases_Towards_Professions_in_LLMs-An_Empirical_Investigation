The chipped paint of the gazebo’s railing, the same faded ochre as Bartholomew "Barty" Finch’s worn gardening gloves, reflected the bruised purple light of the approaching dusk.  Barty, hunched over a withered rose bush, felt the damp chill of the late September air seep into his bones.  He’d been tending the meticulously manicured gardens of Blackwood Manor for fifteen years, a lifetime spent navigating the labyrinthine hedges and whispering lawns that cradled the stately estate.  Each year, the season changed, but the patterns remained – the precise rows of petunias, the clipped symmetry of the boxwood, the hushed reverence that seemed to permeate the very air itself.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  A faint, almost imperceptible, humming resonated from deep within the sprawling gardens, a sound that seemed to defy the quiet stillness of the approaching night.
