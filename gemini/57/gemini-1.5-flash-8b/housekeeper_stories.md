The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from decades of lukewarm water and spilled tea, reflected Elara Blackwood’s face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpane of the sprawling Blackwood Manor.  The air, thick with the scent of aged books and faded roses, hung heavy, a tangible weight on her shoulders.  Elara, a woman whose hands, though weathered and calloused, still held an elegant grace, sighed.  Another day, another tedious chore, another lingering whisper of the family’s unspoken history echoing through the echoing halls.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a colossal, gothic-style estate perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the misty valley of Ashwood.  Its towering silhouette, shrouded in an almost oppressive silence, seemed to hold secrets within its creaking timbers and shadowed rooms.  Years of neglect, coupled with the somber reputation of the Blackwood family, had imbued the manor with a palpable sense of gloom.  Dust clung to everything, a testament to the long stretches of emptiness and the occasional, hushed whispers of servants venturing into the unvisited wings.  The vast, echoing halls, once filled with the laughter of a vibrant household, now echoed with the muted footsteps of Elara and the occasional rustle of unseen things in the vast, neglected library.
