Rain lashed against the warped tin roof of the abandoned asylum, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's head.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and something else, something acrid and metallic, like old blood.  Eleanor, her trench coat plastered to her skin, knelt beside a chipped porcelain sink, her gloved hand tracing the smeared residue on the basin's edge.  The chipped paint on the walls seemed to writhe in the flickering gaslight, casting long, unsettling shadows.  This was the Blackwood Sanatorium, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the townsfolk, a place where whispers themselves had become ghosts. Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist, was here to unravel the truth buried beneath the layers of neglect and decay.

The setting was Blackwood, a town clinging to the edge of the whispering pines, a place where the trees seemed to lean into the mist as if listening to the secrets of the wind.  Rain-slicked cobblestones echoed the constant drip, drip, drip of the leaky roof, and the air itself vibrated with a palpable sense of foreboding. Blackwood had become isolated, cut off from the rest of the world not just by geography, but by a collective trauma that had shadowed the community for generations.  The once-grand sanatorium stood as a monument to that trauma, a gaping wound in the heart of the town, and Eleanor, drawn by a mysterious call from a distraught relative of a former patient, was about to step into the abyss.
