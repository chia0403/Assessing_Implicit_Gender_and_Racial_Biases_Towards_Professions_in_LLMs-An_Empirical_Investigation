The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of her pen against the worn, speckled desk.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the faded posters advertising Shakespeare and the disheveled geometry diagrams pinned to the board.  This was Ms. Vance's sanctuary, a temporary refuge from the ceaseless demands of adolescence, the relentless pressure of parental expectations, and the gnawing sense of her own inadequacy.  Her high school, Northwood Academy, nestled in the shadow of the looming, industrial outskirts of the city, felt like a concrete mausoleum, and her classroom, 306, was its echoing crypt.  It was a Tuesday, the same as every other Tuesday, except perhaps for the faint smell of burnt coffee and the peculiar tremor in the air, like an unseen insect had wings of tremor.  The air itself seemed to hold the unspoken anxieties of her studentsâ€”the anxieties of tests, of social circles, of what lay beyond the hazy horizon of their high school years.  The only sound, besides the pen-tap, was the soft rustle of papers and the occasional groan of discomfort emanating from her students, who were huddled over their assignments.  Ms. Vance had to keep reminding herself this was her job, to ignite the sparks of curiosity.  But today, she felt like the sputtering flame of a dying candle.
