The fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed, a relentless, monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's workday.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, reflecting off the polished, slightly-too-warm surfaces of the laminated tables, creating a sterile, almost clinical environment.  Amelia, a bookkeeper with a penchant for meticulously organized chaos, stared at the ledger.  Rows and rows of figures, each one a tiny, silent testament to the financial dealings of the myriad small businesses she served, blurred into an indecipherable ocean.  It was a Tuesday, like any other Tuesday.  Except today, the figures whispered something more than just balance sheets and profit margins. They whispered of secrets.

The firm was located in the heart of a quiet, unassuming suburb, nestled amongst sprawling lawns and brick-fronted houses.  The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and the faint aroma of grilling burgers from the nearby barbecue.  The rhythmic chirping of cicadas, usually a welcome summer sound, grated on Ameliaâ€™s nerves today. She'd been staring at this particular set of accounts from the struggling artisan bakery "Crumbs & Dreams" for nearly two hours now, and the discrepancy just wouldn't resolve.  A nagging sense of unease tightened her chest.  Something felt...off.
