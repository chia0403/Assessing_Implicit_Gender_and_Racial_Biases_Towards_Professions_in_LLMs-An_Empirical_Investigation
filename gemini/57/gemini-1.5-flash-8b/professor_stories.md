The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Cavendish's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air in her cramped, cluttered office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated windowpanes of Professor Cavendish's history department office at the University of Blackwood.  Books, overflowing from shelves that strained against the Victorian-era woodwork, towered around her like a silent, scholarly army.  Papers, crammed into every available space, littered the desk, a battlefield of annotated texts, meticulously-drawn timelines, and crumpled notes scrawled in a hand that could only be described as fiercely academic.  A perpetual, low hum of activity emanated from the unseen, overworked machinery of the university, a background symphony to the quiet, intense focus of Amelia's work.  Blackwood, a town steeped in the melancholic beauty of its centuries-old traditions, and its university, a venerable institution steeped in hallowed halls and dusty archives, were the backdrop to Amelia's quiet quest.  She was searching for the lost manuscript, a crucial piece of the 17th-century philosopher, Elias Thorne, believed to hold the key to unlocking a profound mystery woven into the very fabric of the Blackwood community.
