Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the probation office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the endless paperwork piling on her desk.  Amy, a probation officer for the 18th District, stared at the starkly-lit room, a battlefield of forms and files, each one a potential minefield.  The mug of lukewarm coffee beside her felt as cold as the January wind whipping through the city streets below.  Her schedule, already crammed with mandatory meetings and pre-arranged interviews, was further complicated by a flurry of urgent calls from the court, promising more late-night paperwork and a looming sense of dread.  The district itself was a microcosm of the city â€“ a concrete jungle of opportunity and despair, its edges frayed by poverty, violence, and the ghosts of past mistakes.  Each case was a unique battle fought in the quiet, often-overlooked cornerstones of justice.  This particular morning, however, felt different.
