Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Healing Haven" retirement home, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythmic thudding in Amelia Nightingale's chest.  She, Amelia Nightingale, occupational therapist extraordinaire, stared out at the pewter-grey landscape, the relentless downpour blurring the already overcast sky.  Inside, the aroma of damp wool and forgotten lavender hung heavy in the air.  Her worn-out, but beloved, beige leather briefcase sat beside her, a silent companion in the stillness of the small, sun-drenched office nestled within the sprawling retirement home.  It had been a particularly trying morning.  The constant struggle against the encroaching isolation, the subtle shifts in dementia, and the unyielding resistance to adapting. This was far removed from the bustling physiotherapy clinics and vibrant community centres that once defined her professional life.  The only sound louder than the rain was the quiet ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway, a metronome counting down to something unknown. The home itself, built in the 1950s, had a charm of its own, a faded grandeur punctuated by the quiet desperation of the residents.  Sunlight, when it finally broke through the clouds, would paint the worn, floral wallpaper in the resident's rooms with fleeting, golden highlights, briefly illuminating the quiet battles for normalcy. This day felt like an especially heavy weight, a storm gathering both outside and within.
