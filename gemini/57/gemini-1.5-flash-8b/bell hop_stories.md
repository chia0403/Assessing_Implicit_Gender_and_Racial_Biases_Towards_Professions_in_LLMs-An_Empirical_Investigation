The humid air hung heavy in the lobby of the Grand Imperial Hotel, clinging to the polished mahogany floors and the crisp, starched uniforms of the bellhops.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun filtering through the massive arched windows, illuminating swirling patterns of intricate floral wallpaper.  A faint scent of lilies and old leather permeated the space, a comforting aroma juxtaposed with the ever-present, metallic tang of the nearby valet parking lot.  This was the world of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire, or, as he preferred, the Grand Imperial's "unofficial curator of lost luggage."

Barty, a young man with a shock of unruly brown hair and eyes that always seemed to hold a mischievous glint, meticulously polished the brass handle of a luggage cart.  The squeak of the polishing cloth was the only sound that broke the hushed murmur of the lobby, punctuated by the rhythmic clinking of ice in a nearby cocktail shaker and the distant, melodic strains of a grand piano.  He was a man of detail, a creature of the Grand Imperial, who understood its secrets as well as any long-serving concierge, perhaps even better.  He knew the stories whispered in the shadows of the revolving doors, the whispered regrets exchanged between the departing guests, and the secrets hidden in the forgotten corners of each oversized suitcase. Today, however, a particularly weighty suitcase held a mystery that tugged at his interest more than any previous lost article.
