Numbers, cold and precise, danced across the screen:  assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses.  Each digit a tiny cog in the vast machine of the corporation, a machine that, for Amelia, felt both exhilarating and suffocating.  The year-end audit loomed, a dark cloud on the otherwise sterile landscape of her meticulously organized office.

Rows of cubicles, identical in their sterile white walls and impersonal layout, stretched out to the vast expanse of the open-plan work floor.   Outside, the city thrummed with a relentless, indifferent energy, oblivious to the quiet struggles of Amelia and the countless others within.  The annual audit was particularly intimidating this year, as GlobalCorp faced its highest scrutiny in decades.
