The aroma of burnt toast hung thick in the air, clinging to everything like a persistent toddler refusing to let go. It mingled unpleasantly with the sweet, almost chemical scent of industrial strength disinfectant, the latter a daily necessity in the chaotic kingdom that was the "Little Sprouts" daycare. For Elowen Astrid Bellweather, the smell was less offensive and more...a warning. A prelude to the storm.

Elowen, 24, ran a hand through her perpetually messy braid, pulling a few stray strands of fiery red hair from her face. Her hazel eyes, usually bright and filled with an almost unnerving level of optimism, were shadowed with the fatigue of a thousand sticky fingerprints and a chorus of shrieking renditions of "Baby Shark."

The setting was a sprawling, pastel-colored building in the heart of the bustling university town of Elmwood, Massachusetts. Little Sprouts, as its cheerful sign proclaimed, was a privately owned daycare nestled between a vintage bookstore and a perpetually overflowing laundromat. The building itself was a refurbished Victorian house, its creaky floors and drafty windows a constant battle against the New England climate. The interior, however, was a carefully curated explosion of childhood whimsy. Brightly colored murals depicting friendly animals adorned the walls, while bins overflowed with a rainbow of toys - building blocks, stuffed animals, and enough plastic instruments to start a surprisingly tone-deaf orchestra.

Elowen straightened her slightly-too-small Little Sprouts t-shirt, which featured a cheerful, cartoon sunflower. Today was Friday. Thank goodness. Just one more day until she could trade the chorus of tiny screams for the blessed silence of her tiny apartment and the company of her oversized tabby cat, Professor Fluffington. But first, there were twenty-two tiny humans waiting, and judging by the ominous quiet, a disaster of epic proportions was brewing somewhere within those brightly painted walls.
