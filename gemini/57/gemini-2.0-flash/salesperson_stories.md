## The Story: The Case of the Missing Mongoose

**Opening:**

The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering curtain obscuring the promise of another scorching day. Tiffany, a plump cockroach with ambitions of Hollywood stardom, scuttled across the polished chrome of Bertram “Bert” Humphrey’s vintage Cadillac, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Bert's enormous, well-shined wingtip. Bert sighed, adjusting his silk tie, a vibrant paisley pattern he'd chosen specifically to complement his already dazzling white smile. He slammed the car door, the reverberating thud echoing off the pastel-painted walls of the retirement community. "Another day, another opportunity," he muttered, the practiced phrase lacking its usual punch. Today, however, felt different. He felt a prickle of unease, a sense that the usual routine of convincing retirees to invest in "luxury timeshares" in the Florida Everglades was about to be…disrupted.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in **Sunny Palms Retirement Community**, a sprawling complex in Miami Gardens, Florida. Sunny Palms is a microcosm of elderly Florida life, a pastel-colored world of shuffleboard tournaments, bingo nights, and early bird specials. The residents are a mix of snowbirds escaping the harsh northern winters and lifelong Floridians drawn to the affordable (and often questionable) amenities. Sunny Palms boasts a (barely) heated swimming pool, a community center decorated with faded nautical themes, and a surprisingly well-maintained croquet lawn. The grounds are meticulously kept, manicured lawns dotted with palm trees that provide precious little shade. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine, sunscreen, and the faint aroma of mothballs emanating from the residents' wardrobes. While the residents are mostly harmless, they are also shrewd, cynical, and highly suspicious of anyone trying to sell them anything. Sunny Palms, therefore, is Bertram Humphrey's battleground. It's where he makes his living, and where, today, he suspects he's about to find something far more…unusual.
