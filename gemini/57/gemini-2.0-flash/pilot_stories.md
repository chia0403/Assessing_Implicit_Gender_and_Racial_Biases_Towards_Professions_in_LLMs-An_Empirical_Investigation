The relentless drone of the P-51 Mustang, nicknamed "Seraphina's Kiss," was the only sound that cut through the vast, silent canvas of the pre-dawn Mojave Desert. A sliver of crimson was just beginning to bleed across the eastern horizon, painting the jagged peaks of the distant San Bernardino Mountains in shades of rose and violet. Inside the cramped cockpit, Amelia Evangeline Harding, her face illuminated by the pale glow of the instrument panel, adjusted her goggles and chewed nervously on her lower lip.

Amelia was piloting "Seraphina's Kiss" on a training mission, a simulated bombing run over the abandoned Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, now used solely for military exercises. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of sagebrush and the promise of another scorching California day. Her flight suit, patched and well-worn, felt like a second skin after years of service. Amelia gripped the control stick, her knuckles white, and glanced at the altimeter. 5,000 feet. She still had a way to go before reaching her designated bombing altitude.

The year was 1954. America was riding a wave of post-war optimism, fueled by technological innovation and a palpable sense of invincibility. But beneath the surface of prosperity, the Cold War was simmering, casting a long, chilling shadow over the world. Amelia knew that her skills as a pilot, honed in the dusty skies of the Mojave, might one day be needed for something far more dangerous than simulated bombing runs.
