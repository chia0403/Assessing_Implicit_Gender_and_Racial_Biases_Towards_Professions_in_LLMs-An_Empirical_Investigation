## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering neon sign of "Joe's Eats" cast a greasy, pink glow onto the rain-slicked street in downtown Seattle. It was a Thursday night, late, the kind of late that clung to you like the dampness in the air, seeping into your bones. The air smelled of diesel fumes and desperation, a familiar cocktail for anyone who spent their nights prowling these avenues. Across the street, the skeletal branches of a gnarled oak scraped against the brick facade of the Rainier Building, a mournful symphony in the urban wilderness.

**Story Opening:**

The chime of the buzzer above the door to "Case Closed Investigations" was a jarring intrusion on the rhythmic clack of the Smith Corona. Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan, his fedora casting a long shadow over his tired eyes, sighed and reluctantly dragged himself away from the half-finished crossword puzzle. He’d been stuck on “Five-letter word for deception” for the last hour, and the last thing he needed was another case walking through the door. Not on a night like this, not when the rain was practically hammering the city into submission.

He ran a hand through his thinning hair, adjusted his tie (slightly loosened from earlier wrestling with the crossword), and pasted on a weary, professional smile. "Can I help you?" he asked, his voice gravelly from too much coffee and too little sleep.

The figure silhouetted in the doorway wasn't what he expected. Not a damsel in distress, not a nervous businessman with a cheating spouse, but a woman shrouded in a long, dark coat, her face obscured by the deep shadows of the building's awning. All Bart could see was a sliver of pale skin and the glint of something metallic caught in the light - something that looked suspiciously like a gun.
