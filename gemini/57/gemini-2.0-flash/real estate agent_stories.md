The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Margaret Eleanor Ainsworth's cheeks as she wrestled with the for-sale sign in the overgrown front yard. The wrought iron stake was stubbornly embedded in the rocky soil of the Berkshires, a testament to years of neglect, much like the house itself. 

Margaret, a real estate agent for "Berkshire Blessings Realty," had sworn off fixer-uppers after the last disastrous showing involving a family of raccoons and a collapsed kitchen ceiling. But Mrs. Higgins, the deceased owner, had been a beloved figure in the small town of Lenox, and her estate executors had practically begged Margaret to take on the listing. "Eleanor always said you had a knack for seeing the good in things, dear," they'd chirped, their eyes twinkling with a hope that felt suspiciously like a challenge.

Now, staring at the peeling paint, the sagging porch swing, and the veritable jungle of overgrown rhododendrons obscuring the windows, Margaret was beginning to doubt her "knack." This wasnâ€™t just seeing the good in things, this was conjuring good out of thin air. Still, the view from the front yard, across the rolling hills painted in the fiery hues of autumn, was breathtaking. Maybe, just maybe, she could convince someone to fall in love with the potential, the *bones*, of this neglected gem on Hemlock Lane.
