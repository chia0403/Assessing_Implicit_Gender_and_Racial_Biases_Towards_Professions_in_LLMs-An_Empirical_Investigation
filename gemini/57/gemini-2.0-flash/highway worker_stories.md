The humid Alabama air hung thick and heavy, a wet blanket clinging to everything as Earl Franklin Abernathy wiped his brow with the back of a stained orange work glove. The sun, a malevolent eye in the hazy sky, beat down relentlessly on the cracked asphalt of Highway 431, just north of Dothan. Earl swore under his breath, a familiar litany of complaints against the heat, the gnats buzzing incessantly around his face, and the sheer mind-numbing monotony of patching potholes. This stretch of highway, a two-lane ribbon of misery winding through endless pine forests and scrubland, was Earl's kingdom, and he was its weary, sunburnt king. The only sounds were the rhythmic thump-thump of the distant paving machine, the drone of cicadas in the surrounding woods, and the occasional roar of a semi-truck barreling past, its wake shaking the very ground he stood on. Today's agenda: section 3, mile marker 11, 12, and 13 â€“ three particularly nasty craters that threatened to swallow unsuspecting tires whole. Another day, another pothole, another dollar closer to retirement, Earl thought, his gaze fixed on the shimmering heat haze rising from the unforgiving asphalt.
