The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous lullaby, a soundtrack to Genevieve Eleanor Davies' Tuesday morning. Genevieve, or Gen as she preferred to be called (unless a particularly disgruntled client was on the phone, then it was definitely *Genevieve*), sighed and adjusted her oversized, blue-light-blocking glasses. Outside, the November drizzle had painted the cobblestones of Beacon Hill a slick, melancholic gray.

Her setting was the reception area of "Artemis Innovations," a small but ambitious tech startup specializing in eco-friendly energy solutions. The reception area itself was a carefully curated study in modern minimalism. Stark white walls were punctuated by a single, abstract painting that resembled a tangled mess of green wires (fitting, Gen thought wryly). A sleek, curved desk made of recycled bamboo wood served as Gen's domain. Behind her, a wall of live moss formed a calming, if slightly damp, backdrop. The air perpetually smelled of freshly brewed organic coffee and the faint, almost metallic, tang of ozone from the air purifiers.

While Artemis Innovations was dedicated to saving the planet, Genevieve often felt like she was simply dedicated to saving the sanity of its employees, one phone call, misplaced package, and passive-aggressive email at a time. She glanced at the blinking light on her phone and braced herself. Today, she suspected, was going to be a long one.
