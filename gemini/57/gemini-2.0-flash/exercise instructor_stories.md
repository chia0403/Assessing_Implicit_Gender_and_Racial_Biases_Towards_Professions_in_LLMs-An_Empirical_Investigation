The salt spray kissed Amelia Hernandez's face as she unlocked the heavy metal door to "Sunrise Sweat," her little studio overlooking the choppy Atlantic. It was 5:15 AM, and the pre-dawn darkness still clung to the weathered shingles of the building like a stubborn barnacle. The air, thick with the scent of seaweed and something faintly fishy, always hit her hard this early. Amelia took a deep breath, pushing past the lingering ache in her shoulders from yesterday's advanced TRX class. This was her sanctuary, her sweat-soaked haven. Sunrise Sweat was more than just a fitness studio; it was Amelia's dream realized, carved out of a derelict bait shop on the edge of Starlight Cove, Maine. The peeling turquoise paint outside hinted at the building's former life, but inside, Amelia had transformed it into a vibrant space with bright yellow walls, repurposed lobster traps holding yoga mats, and large windows that, come sunrise, would bathe the room in a golden glow. Tonight, however, it was just her, the hum of the ventilation system, and the ghostly silhouettes of exercise balls waiting patiently in the darkness. The first of her eager (or perhaps, reluctantly dragged-out-of-bed) clients would be arriving in forty-five minutes, ready for "Coastal Cardio," a grueling but invigorating routine set to a playlist of classic sea shanties and surprisingly upbeat electronic music. Amelia Hernandez, exercise instructor extraordinaire, was ready for them.
