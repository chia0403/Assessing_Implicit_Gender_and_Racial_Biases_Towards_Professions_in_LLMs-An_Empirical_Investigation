Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:** A rain-slicked street in the Victorian district of Port Townsend, Washington. Dim light spills from antique streetlamps onto cobblestone sidewalks, reflecting in the puddles. The air hangs thick with the scent of sea salt, damp wood, and brewing coffee. A faint foghorn groans in the distance.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Eleanor Ainsworth adjusted the collar of her wool coat, pulling it tighter against the persistent drizzle that seemed determined to seep into her bones. The November air held a bite that promised a long, gray winter. She quickened her pace, the rhythmic click of her sensible heels against the wet stone echoing in the otherwise quiet street.  She was late. Not disastrously so, perhaps, but Mrs. Gable had a knack for interpreting punctuality as a direct reflection of Evelyn's commitment to her recovery, or, conversely, her inherent worthlessness as a therapist.

Evelyn wasnâ€™t sure which was worse.

She turned the corner onto Water Street, her gaze automatically drawn to the twinkling lights of the Puget Sound. Even on a night like this, there was a stark beauty to the harbor town.  But tonight, beauty was a thin veneer over a disquiet that had been growing steadily stronger over the past few weeks. A feeling that something was deeply, unsettlingly, *wrong* in Port Townsend.

She blamed the weather.  Or maybe the case of young Mr. Henderson, whose spiraling anxiety was beginning to infect her own peace of mind. Whatever the cause, Evelyn needed to be sharp for Mrs. Gable, and that required, first and foremost, a double shot of espresso.
