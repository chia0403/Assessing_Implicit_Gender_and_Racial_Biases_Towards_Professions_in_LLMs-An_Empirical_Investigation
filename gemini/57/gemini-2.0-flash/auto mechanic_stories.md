Inside, the air was thick with the low growl of a struggling engine and the rhythmic clang of a wrench against metal.

This was where Elara Mae Johnson felt most at home.

Her dark hair, usually tied back in a messy ponytail, had escaped its confines and was plastered to her forehead. She peered into the gaping maw of a '67 Mustang, its engine exposed like a patient on an operating table. A symphony of curses, muttered under her breath, accompanied the frustrated tugging at a corroded bolt. This wasn't just a job for Elara; it was a puzzle, a challenge, a whispered conversation with metal that only she seemed to understand. This Mustang, like so many before it, was begging for her help, and Elara Mae Johnson, Master Mechanic, was determined to answer the call.
