The incessant buzzing ripped Arthur Reginald Pennywhistle from the clutches of a surprisingly vivid dream involving a tap-dancing badger and a room full of rubber chickens. He swatted at his bedside table, blindly silencing his alarm clock, the obnoxious ringtone of which was set to a jaunty polka tune. Arthur hated polka. He also hated mornings. And Thursdays.

He groaned, pushing himself up in the bed he'd had since university. It was a twin-sized monstrosity, adorned with a quilt his grandmother had painstakingly crafted from scraps of old trousers and ties. It wasn't exactly conducive to romance, a fact his dating history clearly reflected.

Arthur Reginald Pennywhistle, Certified Insurance Agent extraordinaire (or at least, he aspired to be), lived in a shoebox apartment above "Mario's Authentic Italian Deli" on Bleaker Street in the West Village of New York City. The aroma of garlic and simmering tomato sauce permeated everything, his clothes, his furniture, even his dreams. Heâ€™d initially thought it charming, a perk of the location, but after five years, the constant garlicky fug was starting to feel less like a culinary blessing and more like a persistent, low-grade assault.

Outside, the city was already waking. Sirens wailed in the distance, a cacophony of car horns blared, and the rumble of the subway system vibrated up through the floorboards. Arthur, blinking sleep from his eyes, knew this was just the overture to another day spent battling paperwork, placating irate customers, and praying for a single, glorious policy sign-up that might finally justify his chosen career path. Today, however, held an added layer of trepidation. Today, he had to present a particularly thorny claim denial to Mrs. Mildred Higgins, a sweet old woman who had suffered a truly unfortunate incident involving a runaway chihuahua, a vat of homemade kimchi, and a valuable collection of antique porcelain dolls. He was bracing himself. It was going to be a long, smelly Thursday.
