The squeak of rubber soles against polished linoleum was a constant, familiar sound to Ezekiel Theodore Finch. At 2:17 AM, the only other sound in the echoing halls of the Museum of Whispering Antiquities was the low hum of the climate control, desperately trying to preserve the delicate artifacts from the capricious touch of the outside world. Ezekiel paused, the heavy buffer humming in his hands, and peered down the long, darkened corridor. The “Hall of Forgotten Empires,” as the curator dramatically called it, was his domain tonight.

He disliked this hallway. It felt…unsettled. The exhibits housed fragments of civilizations lost to time, their stories whispered only through dust and crumbling stone. A chipped shard of obsidian, believed to be from a sacrificial dagger. A clay tablet covered in indecipherable glyphs. A tarnished bronze mask, its hollow eyes seeming to follow him in the dim light cast by the emergency exit signs.

Ezekiel Theodore Finch, a man of fifty-two years with a perpetually weary face and a heart that secretly yearned for adventure, usually dismissed such feelings as the product of too much caffeine and not enough sleep. But tonight, the whispers felt louder, the shadows deeper. A shiver, unconnected to the chilly air, ran down his spine. He sighed, adjusted his faded blue uniform, and pushed the buffer forward, the rhythmic whir drowning out the unsettling silence, at least for a little while. He had a floor to polish, and forgotten empires weren't going to clean themselves.
