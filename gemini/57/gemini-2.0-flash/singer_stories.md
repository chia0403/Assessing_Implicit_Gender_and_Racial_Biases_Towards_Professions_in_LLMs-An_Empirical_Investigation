The stage lights, a brutal, blinding kaleidoscope, finally dimmed, leaving Anya Petrova bathed in the afterglow of a thousand tiny stars glued to the theater’s ornate ceiling. Sweat trickled down her temples, plastering strands of her fiery red hair to her forehead. The roar of the crowd, a living, breathing beast just moments ago, had receded to a polite, almost hesitant applause. Anya took a deep, shuddering breath, the scent of dust, old velvet, and nervous expectation filling her lungs.

The setting was the "Grand Palais de Musique" in the heart of Prague. Built in the late 19th century, the theatre was a monument to a bygone era of opulence. Gilded cherubs adorned the balconies, their painted eyes seemingly following Anya’s every move. Heavy, crimson curtains, faded with age but still radiating a regal air, framed the stage. The air itself felt thick with history, whispering tales of countless performances, of triumphant debuts and heartbreaking farewells. This was Anya's debut, and everything hinged on its success.
