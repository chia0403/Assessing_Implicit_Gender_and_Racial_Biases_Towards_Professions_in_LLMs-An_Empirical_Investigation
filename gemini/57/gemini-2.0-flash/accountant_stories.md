## Story Opening:

The smell of stale coffee and impending doom hung thick in the air of Office Block C, a scent Amelia Periwinkle knew as intimately as her own name. A fluorescent bulb flickered overhead, mimicking the frantic flutter in her stomach. It was 6:17 PM, technically overtime, but realistically just another Tuesday for Amelia, Senior Accountant at "Synergy Solutions: Your Dreams, Leveraged." Her dreams, however, felt far more leveraged than anyone else's at the moment.

The email had arrived just after lunch, a blandly worded missive from Harold Billings, the CFO, summoning her to his office first thing in the morning. *Urgent matter requiring immediate attention,* it had said. Translation: Disaster. Billings only used the word "urgent" when something was circling the drain, and Amelia had a sinking suspicion she was about to be tasked with unclogging it.

She ran a shaky hand through her already disheveled bun, dislodging a stray strand of brown hair that clung stubbornly to her cheek. Outside, the city hummed with the promise of evening, of dinners and dates and restful sleep. Inside, Amelia Periwinkle was staring down the barrel of another late night, another spreadsheet, another impending financial apocalypse. She sighed. Maybe she should have listened to her mother and become a florist. At least then, the scent of roses would mask the smell of impending doom.

## Setting:

**Office Block C, Synergy Solutions: Your Dreams, Leveraged, Downtown Metropolis.**

Office Block C is a hulking, grey monstrosity of late 1980s architecture. Its exterior boasts tinted windows and an imposing facade, promising corporate power and innovation. The reality inside, however, is far more mundane.

Synergy Solutions occupies floors 7 through 10. Amelia's workspace on the 8th floor is a standard, soul-crushing cubicle farm. The walls are a drab beige, adorned with motivational posters that have long since lost their impact ("Think Outside the Box!" screams a cartoon drawing of a box). Her desk is cluttered with stacks of invoices, printouts, and half-empty mugs of coffee. A family photo (Amelia, her sister, and their ridiculously fluffy cat, Captain Snuggles) sits perched precariously on the edge, a small island of normalcy in a sea of spreadsheets.

The air is perpetually recycled and slightly too warm, infused with the lingering aromas of microwaved meals and stale perfume. The constant hum of the computers and the rhythmic tapping of keyboards create a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia's day. While the building itself is centrally located in downtown Metropolis, offering stunning views (if you manage to snag a window seat in the lunchroom), Amelia rarely leaves the confines of her cubicle during daylight hours.
