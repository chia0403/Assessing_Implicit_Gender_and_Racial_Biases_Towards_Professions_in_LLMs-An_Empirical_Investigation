Okay, here's a story opening with a concierge named Elara Willowbrook:

**Setting:**

The grand lobby of The Obsidian Crest Hotel in the heart of New York City. Gleaming black marble floors reflect the soft glow of oversized crystal chandeliers. A massive, abstract sculpture, resembling a deconstructed cityscape, dominates one wall. The air is thick with the hushed murmur of conversations, the faint scent of expensive perfume, and the distant tinkle of piano music drifting from the hotel's exclusive lounge. Outside, the cacophony of the city hums, a constant reminder of the energy just beyond the hotel's polished doors. It is a late Tuesday afternoon, the kind where the city's elite trickle in for pre-theater cocktails and clandestine meetings.

**Story Opening:**

Elara Willowbrook smoothed the impeccable lapel of her charcoal grey uniform, the Obsidian Crest's emblem, a stylized raven in flight, subtly embroidered on the breast. Even after five years as head concierge, a nervous flutter always settled in her stomach during the afternoon rush. It wasn't the pressure; Elara thrived on solving the impossible requests of demanding guests. It was the anticipation – the unknown faces, the unfolding dramas, the secrets whispered across the polished granite of her desk.

The air shimmered with a tension she couldn't quite place. The usual hum of arrival and departure had a sharpened edge, a palpable anxiety that prickled her skin. Even Mrs. Vandergelt, whose scheduled poodle walk at 3:15 was as reliable as the setting sun, had rushed past with barely a nod, her beloved Fifi trembling in her arms. Something was definitely off.

Then, a black sedan, sleek and imposing as a predatory shark, pulled up to the porte-cochère. Before the uniformed driver could even open the door, a figure emerged – tall, cloaked in shadow despite the afternoon light, and radiating an aura of contained power that made Elara's breath catch in her throat. This wasn't just a guest; this was a force of nature about to unleash itself within the meticulously crafted sanctuary of The Obsidian Crest. This was going to be interesting.
