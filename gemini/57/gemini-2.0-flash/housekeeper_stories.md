Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a housekeeper:

**Setting:**

The crisp autumn air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and woodsmoke, swirled around Hartigan Manor. Built in the 1890s, the house perched precariously on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the churning, slate-gray Atlantic. A wrought-iron gate, adorned with rusting sea serpents, guarded the long, gravel driveway, a barrier more symbolic than effective. The house itself was a gothic monstrosity of turrets, gargoyles, and stained-glass windows, perpetually shrouded in mist. Inside, the air was damp and heavy, carrying the ghosts of generations of Hartigans – and the lingering aroma of beeswax polish and Mrs. Willowbrook’s lemon-scented cleaning spray.

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of Mrs. Willowbrook's cleaning cart echoed down the long, gallery hall, bouncing off portraits of stern-faced Hartigan ancestors. **Eliza Maeve Willowbrook**, armed with a feather duster and a thermos of lukewarm tea, braced herself before entering the Grand Ballroom. It was her least favorite room. Not because of the cobwebs that always seemed to materialize overnight, or the dust motes that danced in the slivers of sunlight piercing through the grimy windows, but because of the overwhelming sense of sadness that permeated the space. It clung to the velvet drapes, seeped from the aged wooden floor, and whispered on the drafts that snaked around her ankles.

Today, however, the sadness seemed heavier, more oppressive than usual. Eliza shivered, pulling her thick wool cardigan tighter around her. Maybe it was the brewing storm outside, or maybe it was just the knowledge that Mr. Arthur Hartigan, the last of his line, was expected back from his business trip in London that very evening. His presence always seemed to amplify the manor’s peculiar gloom. Eliza sighed, squared her shoulders, and began her daily battle against the dust bunnies and the shadows. She had a house to clean, and a reputation to uphold. Even in a place like Hartigan Manor, order had to prevail.
