Dr. Davies was notorious for his illegible scrawls, and this one looked like a spider had tap-danced across the page.

Outside, the skeletal branches of the old oak tree that dominated the town square clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  Another late night in Harmony Creek.  Another prescription to decipher.  Another day where Rose felt increasingly like a curator of remedies in a museum of forgotten illnesses, rather than a vital healthcare provider.
