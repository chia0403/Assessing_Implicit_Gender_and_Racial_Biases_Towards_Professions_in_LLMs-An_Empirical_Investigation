The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, a pre-storm soup that clung to everything like Spanish moss. Jebediah Isaiah Miller wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smudge of dirt that only made things worse. He squinted at the sprawling estate before him, the late afternoon sun glinting off the impossibly green, manicured lawn. "Oakleigh Plantation," the sign proclaimed, the letters etched in gold against a backdrop of glossy black. Jebediah wasn't usually hired for places this fancy. He mostly stuck to suburban lawns and the occasional neglected community garden, finding peace in the honest work and the quiet satisfaction of coaxing life from the earth.

He adjusted the worn brim of his baseball cap, the faded emblem of "Miller's Greens & Things" barely visible. Oakleigh was different. This was the kind of place where they probably had a full-time team of gardeners, not just a lone landscaper like him, called in to tackle a single problem: the wilting rose bushes along the main drive. They were the prized "Oakleigh Blush" variety, apparently, and their decline was causing quite the stir amongst the wealthy clientele who frequented the estate for weddings and garden parties. Jebediah sighed. He preferred petunias anyway. But work was work, and Mrs. Abernathy, the sharp-tongued owner, had offered a sum he couldn't refuse. Stepping out of his battered Ford pickup, affectionately nicknamed "The Green Machine," Jebediah grabbed his pruning shears and a bottle of his homemade rose tonic. Time to face the blight, and perhaps, the upper crust.
