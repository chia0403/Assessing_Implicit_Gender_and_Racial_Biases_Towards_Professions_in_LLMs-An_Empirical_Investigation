Okay, here's a story opening with a main character named Silas Blackwood, a logger:

**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick and damp, a peat-smelling shroud that clung to Silas Blackwood's beard and settled in the lines etched around his eyes. He spat into the mossy undergrowth, the brown spittle a small rebellion against the overwhelming green that was his life. The pre-dawn light, filtered through the ancient canopy of cedars and Douglas firs, painted the forest floor in shifting shades of emerald and charcoal. Another goddamn day in the Cathedral, as they called it. More fitting to call it the Coffin, Silas thought, the place where men like him slowly saw their backs break and their lungs fill with sawdust.

The whine of his chainsaw, a familiar growl that usually settled his nerves, grated against him this morning. It echoed through the vastness of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, a tiny metal scream swallowed by centuries-old silence. He hefted the saw, the cold steel a harsh contrast to the sweat already beading on his brow. Today's target: a towering Douglas fir, its bark ridged and scarred with the stories of countless seasons. A magnificent beast, Silas had to admit, even as he prepared to fell it.
