Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bell hop:

**Setting:** The Grand Majestic Hotel, Newport, Rhode Island. It's a sprawling Gilded Age relic, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the choppy Atlantic. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater taffy and old money. Chandeliers drip with crystal, hallways echo with hushed conversations, and the entire place hums with a quiet, almost suffocating, elegance. It's late September, just past the height of the season, but the hotel is still bustling with the tail end of summer vacationers and early arrivals for the annual yachting regatta.

**Story Opening:**

Reginald Bartholomew Worthington adjusted the strap of his bellhop cap, its gold braid glinting under the harsh glare of the revolving doors. He hated that cap. He hated the starched uniform, the forced smile, the way some guests treated him like a glorified coat rack with legs. But most of all, Reginald hated the Grand Majestic Hotel. Its opulence felt suffocating, a constant reminder of the life he *didn't* have, the life that shimmered just out of reach like the yachts bobbing in the harbor below. He straightened his back and waited. Another set of guests were being deposited on the marble steps by a black town car, their faces hidden behind designer sunglasses and an air of studied indifference. Business as usual. He plastered on his most charming (and hopefully, most convincing) smile and prepared to usher them into the gilded cage. He just hoped they didn't have too many Louis Vuitton trunks. His back wasn't what it used to be.
