**Setting:** The wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding the Blackwood Asylum, a gothic monolith perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning, grey Atlantic. The year is 1928, and a perpetual drizzle seems to cling to the gargoyles adorning the building's grim fa√ßade, lending an even more unsettling air to the already isolated institution. Inside, the air is thick with the antiseptic tang of carbolic soap, a futile attempt to mask the underlying scent of stale despair and madness that permeates every stone and corridor. The gas lamps flicker intermittently, casting long, dancing shadows that play tricks on the eye, making the whispers of the patients seem even closer, even more insistent.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth paused in the doorway of Ward C, the harsh light from the corridor momentarily illuminating the lines etched into her face. She tightened the belt of her wool coat, the chill seeping into her bones despite the roaring fireplace down the hall. Another night, another parade of fractured minds and broken souls. Eleanor had spent the better part of her adult life within these walls, a beacon of reason in a world increasingly consumed by the irrational. But tonight, even her resolve felt brittle, threatened by the oppressive atmosphere that hung heavy in the air, a palpable weight of suffering. She took a deep breath, steeling herself. She had patients waiting, patients who needed her, patients who clung to the thread of hope she offered, no matter how frayed it might be. And despite the ever-present feeling of futility that gnawed at her, she wouldn't, couldn't, let them down. Tonight, as on every night, she would fight the darkness, one broken mind at a time.
