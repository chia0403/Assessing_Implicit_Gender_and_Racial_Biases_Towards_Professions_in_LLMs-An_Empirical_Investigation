Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the requested elements:

**Opening:**

The scent of ammonia and burnt sugar clung to the air in "Shear Bliss," a familiar, comforting aroma to Bernadette "Bernie" O'Malley. It was the unique alchemy of her livelihood: the sharp tang of peroxide doing its work, mingling with the sugary sweetness of caramel highlights just a shade too close to the heat lamp. Today, though, the sweetness was a little too cloying, a little too insistent, mirroring the nervous flutter in Bernie's own stomach. Mrs. Hawthorne was due any minute for her weekly shampoo and set, and this week, it wasn't the usual gossip about the bridge club that Bernie dreaded. This week, Mrs. Hawthorne had promised "a little surprise" and, knowing the woman, "little" was never truly little, and "surprise" was usually a thinly veiled complaint about someone else's questionable choices in floral arrangements.

**Setting:**

"Shear Bliss," located at 32 Maple Street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Connecticut, was a testament to Bernadette's hard work and a healthy dose of small-town charm. The building itself was a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, daffodil yellow. Inside, the walls were a soothing lavender, adorned with framed prints of vintage hair advertisements and whimsical paintings by local artists. Three well-worn but comfortable styling chairs faced large, beveled mirrors that reflected the sunlight streaming through the lace-curtained windows.

Bernie had painstakingly curated the salon to feel welcoming and approachable. The shelves behind the reception desk were stocked with a carefully selected range of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products, most of them from small, independent businesses, as Bernie believed in supporting her community. A small coffee station offered complimentary tea and coffee, along with a selection of homemade cookies baked by Bernie herself. The overall effect was a cozy, slightly cluttered, but undeniably inviting space where Havenwoodâ€™s residents came not just for haircuts, but for connection and a listening ear.
