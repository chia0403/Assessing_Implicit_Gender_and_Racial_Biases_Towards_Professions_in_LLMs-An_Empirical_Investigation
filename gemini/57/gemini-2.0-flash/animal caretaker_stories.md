Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character who is an animal caretaker:

**Story Opening:**

The stench hit Eleanor Alice Abernathy the moment she cracked the door to the reptile house. It wasn't the usual musky odor of damp earth and basking lamps she’d grown accustomed to in her five years at the Whispering Willows Wildlife Sanctuary. This was something different, sharper, overlaid with a cloying sweetness that turned her stomach. A bad feeling, as cold and slick as a snake’s shed skin, coiled in her gut. She gripped her worn leather clipboard, the scent of her grandmother’s rose-scented hand cream momentarily cutting through the miasma, and stepped inside. “Good morning, everyone,” she called out, her voice sounding hollow in the cavernous space. Only silence answered, a silence deeper and more unsettling than usual.
**Setting:**

The Whispering Willows Wildlife Sanctuary sprawled across fifty acres of rolling hills in rural Vermont. Once a struggling dairy farm, it had been transformed into a haven for injured, orphaned, and abandoned animals, both native to the region and exotic creatures rescued from unfortunate circumstances. The sanctuary was a patchwork of enclosures: spacious, naturalistic habitats for the larger mammals, meticulously designed aviaries for birds of prey, and specialized buildings housing the reptiles, amphibians, and nocturnal creatures. Old barns, repurposed as veterinary clinics and quarantine areas, still bore the faint scent of hay and cows, now mingled with the disinfectant and animal scents of their new purpose. The main building, a renovated farmhouse, served as the administrative hub, housing offices, a small library, and a visitor center. Overgrown willow trees, after which the sanctuary was named, dotted the landscape, their weeping branches providing shade and a sense of quiet tranquility... at least, until a pack of howler monkeys decided to start their morning chorus.
