Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Eliza Mae Harding:

**Story Opening:**

The sickly-sweet scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eliza Mae Harding. Outside, the October wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the old windowpanes of the clinic. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous counterpoint, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing in the sterile room. Eliza, her dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, adjusted the angle of the lamp, her brow furrowed in concentration. Mrs. Gable, her next patient, was notoriously difficult. Veins like whispers, hidden deep beneath a layer of fragile, papery skin.

Eliza had learned patience was her greatest weapon, even more so than her butterfly needles and tourniquets. She took a deep breath, the scent of latex gloves mixing with the antiseptic, and mentally prepared herself. She'd find that vein. She always did.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the **"Pine Ridge Community Clinic,"** located in the small, rural town of **Hemlock Hollow, nestled in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia.**

The clinic itself is a somewhat ramshackle, but functional, building. It used to be an old Victorian house, converted haphazardly over the years. The exterior is painted a faded beige, the paint peeling in places, but the small garden in front is always lovingly tended. The interior is a mix of the original architectural charm and the necessities of modern medicine.

Eliza's workspace, the **"Blood Draw Room,"** is small but efficient. One wall is lined with neatly organized trays of needles, vacutainers, and gauze. A well-worn phlebotomy chair sits center stage, facing a window that looks out onto a small patch of woods. The walls are painted a calming pale green, and a small, framed print of a tranquil mountain scene hangs above the supply cabinet - a small attempt to bring the outdoors in. There's a lingering sense of history within these walls, the echoes of generations of Hemlock Hollow residents who sought healing and comfort there.
