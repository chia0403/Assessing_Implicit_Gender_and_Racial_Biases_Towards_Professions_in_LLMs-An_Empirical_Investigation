Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a reporter as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The smell hit Amelia Grace Harrington first â€“ a cloying sweetness mixed with something acrid and metallic, like burnt sugar and old pennies.  She wrinkled her nose, pulling her scarf higher to ward off not just the olfactory assault, but also the biting November wind that whipped off the East River.  The flashing blue and red of the police lights painted the grimy brick of the abandoned sugar refinery in lurid strokes, adding a theatrical edge to what she suspected would be a very grim scene.  "Another one," she muttered, pulling out her notepad.  The handwritten list inside, entitled "Unanswered Questions - North Brooklyn Division," felt heavier than usual.

**Setting:**

North Brooklyn, specifically the decaying industrial waterfront area between Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Think crumbling warehouses, repurposed factories turned into art studios and pricey lofts, and pockets of stubbornly resistant old-school businesses. The air is perpetually gritty, filled with the hum of traffic and the distant rumble of the elevated train. The East River laps against concrete embankments, carrying with it the ghosts of Brooklyn's manufacturing past.  Specifically, in this scene, it's in front of an abandoned Domino Sugar refinery, a hulking, brick behemoth slowly being reclaimed by nature, a stark reminder of the industry that once defined the neighborhood. The year is 2024. It's late November and a cold, blustery night, with low-hanging clouds obscuring the already dim city lights.
