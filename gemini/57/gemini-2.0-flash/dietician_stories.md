Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a dietician named:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of the "Fresh Start" health clinic hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the sterile white walls. Located in the heart of downtown, the clinic was nestled between a bustling law firm and a greasy burger joint, a constant reminder of the battle against temptation that its patients faced daily. The waiting room, normally a haven of forced cheerfulness, felt particularly somber today. A wilted fern drooped in its pot by the reception desk, mirroring the energy of the patients slumped in the vinyl chairs, each clutching a magazine featuring impossibly toned bodies and recipes that seemed to require a chemistry degree to decipher. The air was thick with a mixture of antiseptic and the faint aroma of microwaved cauliflower.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance sighed, the sound barely audible over the insistent beeping of the weight scale in her office. Outside, she could hear Mrs. Henderson lamenting, for the third time this month, the audacity of her granddaughter’s birthday cake. Eleanor leaned back in her ergonomically-designed chair, the springs groaning in protest. The digital clock on her desk blinked 1:00 PM. Lunch was a distant memory, a hastily consumed apple and a handful of almonds that now felt more like a cruel tease than sustenance. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, trying to massage away the burgeoning headache. Another afternoon of calorie counting, portion control, and the weary sighs of broken promises. Eleanor loved her job, genuinely, but sometimes the sheer weight of other people's eating habits felt like it was crushing her from the inside out. A soft knock at her door announced her next patient. Taking a deep breath, Eleanor plastered on her most encouraging smile. "Come in," she called out, mentally bracing herself for whatever culinary confessions awaited.
