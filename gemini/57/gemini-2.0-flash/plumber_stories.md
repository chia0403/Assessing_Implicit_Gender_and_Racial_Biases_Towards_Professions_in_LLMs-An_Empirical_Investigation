## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, sending a cascade of rust-colored water spraying across Bertram Finch's already-stained coveralls. He hissed a curse under his breath, a low, simmering sound like a leaky faucet. Bertram hated Wednesdays. Wednesdays were always toilet days. And this particular Wednesday found him knee-deep in the putrid underbelly of Mrs. Abernathy's Edwardian porcelain throne, a monstrosity that looked like it belonged in a museum, not a bathroom where it was regularly subjected to the… indignities Bertram was now witnessing.

"Everything alright in there, Mr. Finch?" a frail voice chirped from the hallway, followed by the shuffling sound of slippers.

Bertram wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, transferring a smudge of something unidentifiable to his forehead. "Just peachy, Mrs. Abernathy! Almost got this clog licked. Just... admiring the, uh, antique beauty of your plumbing system."

He could almost hear the skepticism dripping from her tone.

"Well, do hurry," she said, her voice laced with a delicate impatience. "The ladies' luncheon starts in an hour, and dear Agnes simply *must* have a functioning facility."

Bertram sighed. He had an hour to exorcise this porcelain demon and restore peace to Mrs. Abernathy's bowel-obsessed social gathering. This was, undoubtedly, going to be one of those days.

## Setting:

The story opens in **Mrs. Abernathy's bathroom, a sprawling, opulent space that seemed to mock its primary function.** The house itself is a rambling Edwardian mansion in the affluent seaside town of Seabrook Cove, Maine. The bathroom boasts faded floral wallpaper, a clawfoot bathtub that could comfortably house a family of four, and ornate, heavily-gilded mirrors that reflect the gloomy Maine light. Despite the grandeur, a faint, lingering odor of mildew and old plumbing pervades the air, a constant reminder that beneath the veneer of wealth, things were slowly, stubbornly, decaying. Sunlight, filtered through the lace-curtained window, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air and highlighted the chipped paint around the base of the toilet – a stark contrast to the pristine, though outdated, fixtures. It's a place of decaying elegance, a visual representation of the town of Seabrook Cove itself, slowly being swallowed by the relentless grip of time and the harsh Maine winters.
