## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of TaxTime Solutions hummed a weary lullaby, a soundtrack to April's relentless march. Amelia Beatrice Finch, a woman whose face was etched with the fine lines of years spent deciphering deductions and wrestling with W-2s, pinched the bridge of her nose. Outside, a persistent drizzle mirrored the dampness seeping into her soul. She was staring at a particularly egregious return, a tapestry of questionable expenses embroidered with what she suspected was outright fabrication. A ski vacation, claimed as "research" for a new line of luxury thermal underwear? Really? Amelia sighed, the sound lost in the low thrum of the printer spitting out yet another form, a bureaucratic testament to the inescapable reality of the American tax system. Just another Friday night, just another mountain of paperwork separating Amelia Finch from the sweet embrace of her Netflix queue and a lukewarm cup of herbal tea.

## Setting:

The story unfolds primarily in the cluttered confines of TaxTime Solutions, a small, independent tax preparation business located in a slightly rundown strip mall on the outskirts of Grand Falls, Wisconsin. The office itself is a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of manila folders teeter precariously on shelves, threatening to avalanche at any moment. Motivational posters, featuring slogans like "Keep Calm and Calculate On" and "Numbers Don't Lie (But People Do)," hang slightly askew, their ironic message lost on the weary eyes of the staff. The air is thick with the scent of stale coffee, printer toner, and the faint, lingering aroma of desperation. The space is cramped, shared by Amelia and two other tax preparers, Brenda, a chain-smoking woman with a penchant for gossip, and Kevin, a recent college graduate still figuring out the difference between a 1040 and a 1099-NEC. A small, brightly colored reception area, manned by the eternally cheerful but perpetually overwhelmed receptionist, Doris, attempts to inject a sliver of optimism into the otherwise sterile environment. Outside, the grey Wisconsin sky hangs low, casting a perpetual gloom over the bustling parking lot, filled with cars anxiously awaiting their turn to face the taxman.
