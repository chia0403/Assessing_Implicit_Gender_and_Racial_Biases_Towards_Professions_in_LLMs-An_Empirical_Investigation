## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped across the asphalt, stinging Dr. Alistair Finch’s face and snatching the breath from his lungs as he slammed the ambulance door shut. He could taste the grit of salt spray on his lips, a constant reminder that the unforgiving Atlantic was just beyond the thin line of dunes separating the highway from oblivion. Tonight, the ocean felt particularly restless, a churning black beast mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in his gut. He’d seen too much darkness lately, felt the weight of too many lost souls pressing on his chest. Another trauma call tonight, another life hanging by a thread in the unforgiving maw of fate. He pushed the feeling down, a practiced maneuver honed over years of battling against the tide of mortality. Tonight, he wouldn't let the darkness win. Not if he could help it.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Portsmouth, New Hampshire**, a historic coastal city nestled on the Piscataqua River where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. The time is late **December**, on a night thick with the threat of a winter storm. The specific location in this opening scene is a stretch of **Route 1A (Ocean Boulevard)** just south of the city, bordering **Wallis Sands Beach**. The ambient light comes primarily from the flashing red and blue lights of the ambulance and police cruisers scattered along the roadside, painting the churning ocean waves in stark, fleeting hues. The air is frigid, smelling strongly of saltwater and the faint, acrid scent of burnt rubber from the accident ahead. The overall atmosphere is one of urgent chaos and chilling vulnerability, the raw beauty of the winter seascape juxtaposed with the fragility of human life.
