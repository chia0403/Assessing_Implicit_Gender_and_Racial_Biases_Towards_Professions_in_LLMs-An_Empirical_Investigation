The mid-morning sun, filtered through the dusty windows of "The Golden Comb," painted stripes across the checkered linoleum floor. Arthur Pendelton Peabody, a barber of thirty-seven years experience and a disposition as sharp as his straight razor, surveyed his domain. Dust motes danced in the light, reflecting off the chrome of his barber chairs – two relics of a bygone era he refused to part with. The smell of bay rum and the faint metallic tang of honed steel hung thick in the air, a comforting aroma that had permeated his shop for nearly half a century. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Kansas, was just starting to stir. A delivery truck rumbled past, its engine a low grumble that momentarily drowned out the gentle tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a clock Arthur’s grandfather had gifted him when he first opened the shop. The silence that followed was punctuated only by the rhythmic snip, snip, snip of Arthur meticulously trimming the ragged edges of a newspaper, waiting for his first customer of the day. He knew, with a certainty born of decades spent listening to the comings and goings of Harmony Creek, that the silence wouldn't last long. Harmony Creek always had a story to tell, and Arthur Pendelton Peabody, with his sharp ears and even sharper wit, was usually the first to hear it.
