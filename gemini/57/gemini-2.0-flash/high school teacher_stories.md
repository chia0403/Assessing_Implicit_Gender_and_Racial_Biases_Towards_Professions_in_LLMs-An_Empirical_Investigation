The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed with a relentless, unwavering hum, a sound that grated on Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Fairchild's nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard, ironic considering her profession. The last bell had rung twenty minutes ago, yet she lingered in her classroom, the scent of stale chalk dust and teenage anxieties clinging to the air like a persistent cough. Eleanor, a woman whose meticulously organized life could rival a museum curator's, surveyed the battlefield that was her English Literature classroom. Empty soda bottles lay scattered amidst crumpled essays, a rogue pencil rolled across the floor, and a half-eaten bag of cheese puffs peeked out from underneath a desk. It was a landscape of teenage detritus, a physical manifestation of the chaotic thoughts she tried so desperately to corral into coherent arguments about Shakespeare and Steinbeck.

Outside, the grey October sky threatened rain, mirroring the storm brewing in her own mind. Tonight was the annual Northwood High Halloween Fundraiser, a ghastly, glitter-dusted affair where she, as the only faculty advisor for the Literary Club, was expected to participate. The thought of spending another evening surrounded by costumed teenagers, forced to judge the merits of homemade papier-mâché masks and store-bought vampire fangs, filled her with a profound sense of weariness. She much preferred the quiet company of her books, the hushed whispers of dead authors offering solace in their timeless tales. But duty, that pesky, persistent companion, called. And Eleanor Beatrice Fairchild, despite her love for literature and her penchant for solitude, was nothing if not dutiful.
