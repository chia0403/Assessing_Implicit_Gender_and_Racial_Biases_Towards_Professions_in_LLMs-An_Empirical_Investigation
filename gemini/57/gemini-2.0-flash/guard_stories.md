## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The Citadel of Echoes is a labyrinth of obsidian and silver, carved into the face of Mount Cinderheart. Perpetual twilight reigns here, filtered through volcanic dust and the shimmering, magical wards that protect the royal family within. Water trickles constantly down the slick, black walls, echoing through the vast, cavernous corridors. The air smells of damp stone and something else...a subtle, almost metallic tang that hints at the potent magic woven into the very fabric of the citadel. Runes pulse faintly beneath the polished obsidian floors, a constant, low hum vibrating through the bones of anyone who stands for too long.

**Story Opening:**

Sergeant Lyra Valeria Stormwind shifted her weight, the polished haft of her halberd cold against her gloved hand. Another hour on this blasted post. Another hour listening to the drip, drip, drip of condensation and the whispers of wind clawing at the magically reinforced windows. Her breath plumed in the chill air, a stark white against the obsidian walls of the Sapphire Guard Corridor. The Sapphire Guard Corridor. A grand name for what was essentially a damp, drafty hallway leading to the Queen's private library. Lyra sighed, a sound lost in the echoing vastness. She'd been stationed here for three years now, and in those three years, the most exciting thing that had happened was a particularly brazen spider spinning a web across the royal seal etched into the floor. Today felt different, though. A prickling unease settled beneath her skin, a whisper of impending change that had nothing to do with the sputtering torches flickering in their sconces. Lyra Valeria Stormwind, hardened veteran of the Highland Wars and loyal servant to the Crown, didnâ€™t believe in hunches, but she knew, with a chilling certainty, that the monotonous silence of the Citadel of Echoes was about to be shattered. And she had a feeling it wouldn't be by another oversized arachnid.
