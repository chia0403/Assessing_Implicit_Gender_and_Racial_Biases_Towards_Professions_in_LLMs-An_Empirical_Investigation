The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez like a second skin. It smelled of decaying mangrove leaves, brine, and a hint of something vaguely floral, a cocktail unique to the Florida Everglades. Izzy, sweat beading on her forehead despite the wide-brimmed hat shading her eyes, adjusted the microphone clipped to her crisp, khaki shirt. She hated the humidity, but it was part of the Everglades package, a natural element as essential as the alligators and cypress trees.

Her gaze swept across the twenty-or-so faces crammed onto the "Swamp Angel," a flat-bottomed airboat, each a mask of anticipation and a little bit of nervous excitement. Tourists from all walks of life: a Japanese couple clutching matching cameras, a boisterous family from Nebraska, a solitary woman with intense eyes and a worn leather journal. They were here for the same reason - to experience a slice of the wild, to be transported, however briefly, into the heart of one of America's most unique and threatened ecosystems.

"Alright folks," Izzy began, her voice amplified and ringing clear over the idling roar of the massive propeller, "Welcome aboard the Swamp Angel and welcome to the Everglades National Park! My name is Isabella Rodriguez, but you can call me Izzy. For the next hour and a half, we're going to be venturing deep into this 'River of Grass,' as it's been so aptly named. Keep your eyes peeled, your cameras ready, and your hands inside the boat at all times... unless you feel like becoming an alligator appetizer!" She punctuated the last sentence with a wink, eliciting a ripple of nervous laughter from the group. The Everglades, with its murky waters and hidden dangers, was already working its magic. And Izzy, with her passion for its preservation and her encyclopedic knowledge, was ready to show them why.
