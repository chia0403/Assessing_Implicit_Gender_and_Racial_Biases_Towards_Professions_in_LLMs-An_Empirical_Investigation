The July sun beat down on Michaelangelo "Mikey" Esposito’s back, turning the asphalt shingles of the Johnson house into a molten, sticky mess. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. Mikey sighed, squinting at the seemingly endless expanse of roof stretching out before him like a black, scalding ocean.

He was perched precariously atop the Johnson residence, a modest two-story colonial located on Hemlock Drive in the sleepy, semi-rural town of Havenwood, Connecticut. Havenwood, a place where the biggest excitement was Mrs. Higgins’ annual lilac festival and the most scandalous news was Farmer McGregor’s prize-winning pig escaping its pen. Mikey, a born and raised Havenwood boy himself, knew every nook and cranny of this town, every leaky gutter and sagging rafter. He’d spent the last fifteen years, since reluctantly inheriting Esposito Roofing from his ailing father, fixing them, one shingle at a time.

The Johnson house was no different. Mrs. Johnson, bless her heart, had called with a frantic plea about water stains spreading across her dining room ceiling. Mikey had come, inspected, and delivered the bad news: a complete re-roofing job. Now, here he was, knee-deep in asphalt, baking under the relentless summer sun, wondering if he’d ever be able to afford that deep sea fishing trip he'd been promising himself for years.
