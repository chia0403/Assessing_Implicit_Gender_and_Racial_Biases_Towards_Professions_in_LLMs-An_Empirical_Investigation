Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a server named Clara Mae Holloway:

**Setting:** The salty air hung thick and heavy, laced with the scent of frying fish and briny seaweed. The "Salty Gull," a ramshackle seafood shack perched precariously on stilts above the murky waters of Galveston Bay, was bustling with the usual Friday night fervor. Strings of bare, flickering bulbs cast a warm, uneven glow over the weathered wooden tables and the mismatched chairs, barely concealing the peeling paint and the general air of charming dilapidation. Outside, the rhythmic crashing of waves against the pilings provided a constant, low hum, a soundtrack to the cacophony of laughter, boisterous conversations, and the clatter of silverware.

**Story Opening:**

Clara Mae Holloway expertly navigated the crowded dining room, balancing a tray laden with steaming plates of fried shrimp and hush puppies. Her worn, leather-soled shoes squeaked faintly against the linoleum as she dodged a toddler wielding a rogue crab leg and a tipsy fisherman belting out a off-key sea shanty. Sweat beaded on her forehead, plastering a stray strand of her auburn hair to her cheek. "Here you go, folks," she said, her voice a bright, practiced smile cutting through the din. "Enjoy your dinner!"

She deposited the plates with practiced ease, noting the hefty portion of tartar sauce and the extra napkins one of the patrons had requested. Her tips had been…okay, tonight. Not great, not terrible. Just enough to keep the wolf from the door, as her grandmother used to say.

As she turned to head back to the kitchen, her eye caught a flash of something unusual by the window. A sleek, black car – far too expensive for the Salty Gull's usual clientele – had pulled up, and a figure in a dark suit emerged. He scanned the restaurant, his gaze lingering a beat too long on Clara Mae. A shiver, despite the humid air, ran down her spine. Something about him felt…wrong. And wrong had a habit of finding Clara Mae Holloway in the most inconvenient of times.
