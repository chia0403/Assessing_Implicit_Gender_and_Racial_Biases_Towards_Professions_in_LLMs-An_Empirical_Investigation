The clatter of loose tubes was a familiar symphony to Reginald "Reggie" Abernathy. His cramped, dusty workshop, a converted shed at the back of his rambling Victorian house in the small, forgotten town of Havenwood, Massachusetts, hummed with the ghosts of forgotten broadcasts. Shelves overflowing with vacuum tubes, resistors, capacitors, and the skeletal remains of radios long past their prime lined the walls. A lone, bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light over the scene, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the intricate network of wires sprawled across his workbench.

The air itself hung thick with the scent of ozone, soldering flux, and old Bakelite. Reggie, perpetually hunched over his current patient – a hulking, 1938 Philco console radio the size of a small refrigerator – wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his greasy hand. Outside, the late autumn wind howled, rattling the windowpanes and reminding him that Havenwood was, once again, sinking into its seasonal slumber. Inside, the rhythmic hiss and crackle emanating from the radio held a promise, a potential for connection, a whisper from a world beyond Havenwood's sleepy confines. Tonight, Reggie was determined to coax that whisper into a clear voice. He just hoped that voice wouldn't bring more trouble than it was worth.
