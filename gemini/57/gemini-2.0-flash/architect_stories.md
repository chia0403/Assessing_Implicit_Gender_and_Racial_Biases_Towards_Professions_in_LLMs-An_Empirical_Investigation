## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** Venice, Italy. November. The city is draped in a perpetual mist, clinging to the ancient stones and blurring the edges of the canals. The scent of damp earth and salt water hangs heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional sharp tang of espresso from a hidden bacaro. The tourist throngs of summer have thinned, leaving a haunting emptiness in their wake, a feeling that the city is holding its breath, waiting for something.

**Opening:**

Isabella Rossi, her fingers numb despite the thick wool gloves, sketched furiously in her battered leather notebook. The biting wind whipped off the Grand Canal, threatening to tear the pages from her grasp, but she held firm. Before her, the Ca' d'Oro, bathed in the ethereal light filtering through the fog, seemed to float, a shimmering mirage of gilded tracery and delicate stonework.

She squinted, trying to capture the precise angle of the balconies, the subtle asymmetry of the arches. This was her muse, her obsession, the building she had come to Venice to understand. But the cold seeped into her bones, mirroring a growing unease in her heart. The project she had been commissioned for, a modern extension to a crumbling palazzo on the Giudecca, felt increasingly like a sacrilege, a defacement of everything she loved about this city, about this art. The weight of Venice, its history, its beauty, was pressing down on her, threatening to crush her ambition, to bury her dreams beneath the cold, unforgiving waters.
