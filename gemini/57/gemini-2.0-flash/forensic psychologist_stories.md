## The Obsidian Mirror

**Setting:** The air in the interrogation room hung thick and still, reeking of stale coffee and quiet desperation. It was a room built for discomfort, designed to subtly chip away at defenses. Bare white walls, a steel table bolted to the floor, and two unforgiving chairs under the harsh glare of a fluorescent light offered little solace. A one-way mirror, darkened and silent, reflected a distorted image of the room back on itself, a constant, lurking presence. This particular interrogation room resided in the basement of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, a place where truths were coaxed, or dragged, from the shadows.

**Opening:** Dr. Evelyn Grace Blackwood smoothed the lapel of her charcoal grey blazer, a nervous habit she hadn't managed to shake despite years of facing down some of the most twisted minds in the city. Her gaze, sharp and analytical, was fixed on the young man hunched across the steel table from her. Liam O’Connell, barely twenty years old, with the haunted eyes of a cornered animal. He hadn't spoken a word since being brought in, his hands clasped so tightly together that his knuckles were bone-white. Evelyn had reviewed the case files meticulously – the brutal slaying of his girlfriend, the flimsy circumstantial evidence, and the suffocating weight of public opinion already condemning him. But the file couldn't tell her what she needed to know: was this a predator cleverly playing the victim, or a frightened boy caught in a web of circumstance?

Evelyn took a slow, deliberate breath. "Mr. O'Connell," she began, her voice calm and measured, the voice that had peeled back layers of deceit from seasoned criminals, "my name is Dr. Evelyn Grace Blackwood. I'm a forensic psychologist. I'm here to understand what happened."
