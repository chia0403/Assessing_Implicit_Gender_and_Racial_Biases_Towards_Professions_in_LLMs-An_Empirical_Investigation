The biting wind, flavored with dust and the distant scent of snow, whipped at Jedediah Daniel Boone's face as he surveyed his land. The late afternoon sun, a bruised orange disk sinking behind the jagged teeth of the Bighorn Mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows across the Wyoming plains. Jedediah, a man built of sun-baked leather and quiet resilience, squinted, his eyes the color of faded denim, trying to gauge the condition of the grazing land. He'd poured his lifeblood, his sweat and tears, into the Circle B Ranch, a legacy passed down from his grandfather, and another dry spell threatened to bleed it dry.

The ranch house, a sturdy, two-story structure built of rough-hewn logs, stood sentinel against the vast emptiness. Its windows, like watchful eyes, reflected the dying light. A plume of smoke curled lazily from the chimney, promising a meager warmth against the encroaching chill. Beyond the house, the barn, a cavernous structure that had witnessed countless births and deaths, creaked softly under the pressure of the wind. The rhythmic clang of the windmill, drawing water from deep within the earth, was the only other sound in this kingdom of silence, a constant reminder of the precious, dwindling resource that sustained them all. This was the Circle B, Jedediah's burden and his blessing, his anchor and his endless worry. And right now, worry was winning.
