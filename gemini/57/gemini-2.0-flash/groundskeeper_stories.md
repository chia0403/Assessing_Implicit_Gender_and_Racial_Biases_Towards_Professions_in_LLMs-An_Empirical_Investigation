## Story Opening:

The smell of cut grass and damp earth clung to Arthur Finch like a second skin. It was the smell of contentment, the aroma of a job well done, and, if he was honest, the only perfume he truly appreciated. Arthur paused, leaning on the worn handle of his rake, and surveyed his kingdom. The sun, a hazy orange orb sinking behind the ancient oak trees, cast long, skeletal shadows across the perfectly manicured lawns of Bleakridge Manor.

He ran a hand through his thinning, greying hair, leaving a faint green smudge on his forehead. Arthur Finch, Groundsman and caretaker of Bleakridge Manor, had spent the better part of his fifty-two years tending to this sprawling estate. He knew every dip in the lawn, every gnarled root of the ancient rhododendrons, every quirky angle of the crumbling stone walls. Bleakridge was more than just a job; it was his sanctuary, his burden, and, in a strange way, his family.

## Setting:

**Bleakridge Manor** is a grand, gothic estate situated on a windswept hill overlooking the quaint village of Hollow Creek. The manor itself is a hulking, imposing structure built from dark grey stone, its many gables and chimneys reaching towards the sky like grasping fingers. Ivy climbs its walls, blurring the edges of its sharp angles and giving it a sense of both decay and timelessness.

The grounds are meticulously maintained, a testament to Arthur Finchâ€™s tireless efforts. Rolling lawns stretch out in all directions, interspersed with formal gardens boasting sculpted hedges, vibrant flowerbeds, and ornate fountains. A thick forest borders the estate, offering a sense of seclusion and mystery. A winding gravel path, kept pristine by Arthur, leads from the grand wrought iron gates at the entrance up to the imposing front door.

Despite the beauty, a pervading sense of melancholy hangs in the air. The air is often thick with fog, and the wind howls through the branches of the old trees, creating an eerie symphony that echoes through the empty halls of the manor. Bleakridge Manor is a place of stark beauty and unsettling silence, a place where the past seems to linger in every shadow.
