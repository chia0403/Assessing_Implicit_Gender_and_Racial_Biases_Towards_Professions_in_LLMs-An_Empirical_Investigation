## Story Opening:

The dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window of the abandoned theatre. Elara Finch, her Nikon D850 already clutched in her hand, coughed, pulling the tattered scarf tighter around her nose. The air, thick with the scent of decay and forgotten dreams, tasted of mildew and crushed velvet. It was a smell Elara both reviled and adored – the smell of history waiting to be captured.

She’d broken in an hour ago, scaling the rusted fire escape on the back of the building. It wasn't her first act of trespassing, and it wouldn't be her last, not when stories like this one were screaming to be told. The Grand Majestic, once the dazzling heart of the city’s entertainment district, now stood silent and crumbling, a monument to a bygone era. Tonight, it was hers.

## Setting:

**The Grand Majestic Theatre, Oakhaven, Illinois, 2023.**

The theatre itself is a relic of the Art Deco era. The grand lobby, though now littered with debris and pigeon droppings, still hints at its former opulence. Faded murals depicting mythical scenes adorn the walls, their colors barely clinging to the plaster. The once-gleaming chandeliers hang precariously from the ceiling, their crystal pendants missing or shattered.

The auditorium is even more heartbreaking. Rows of plush red velvet seats, ripped and stained, face a stage where countless performers once held audiences captive. The heavy velvet curtains, now moth-eaten and ripped, hang limply, obscuring the backstage area. A single, dusty spotlight, long since disconnected, sits on the floor, pointed forlornly towards the empty stage.

Oakhaven, once a thriving industrial town, has suffered greatly in recent decades. The Grand Majestic, along with much of the town's former glory, has been left to rot, a symbol of a community struggling to hold onto its past. The surrounding streets are quiet and largely deserted, adding to the theatre's sense of isolation and forgotten beauty.
