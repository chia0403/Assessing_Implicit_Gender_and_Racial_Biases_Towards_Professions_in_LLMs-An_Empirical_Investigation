## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun cast long, dusty rays across the cobbled square of "Le Petit Jardin," a charmingly dishevelled marketplace nestled in the heart of Lyon, France. The air hung thick with the scent of roasted chestnuts, freshly baked bread, and, of course, the intoxicating perfume of a thousand blooms. Around the square, wrought-iron tables overflowed with locals and tourists alike, sipping coffee and debating the merits of the afternoon's pétanque match.

**Opening:**

Elodie Marguerite Dubois adjusted the worn leather strap of her apron, a smudge of crimson dahlia pollen clinging stubbornly to her cheek. She stood within the vibrant chaos of "Fleurs Elodie," her flower shop, a riot of color and texture overflowing onto the pavement. The day had been a whirlwind – a last-minute wedding bouquet crisis, a demanding hotel concierge with a penchant for rare orchids, and a steady stream of customers seeking a touch of beauty to brighten their day. Now, as the shadows lengthened and the café au lait aroma intensified, Elodie finally had a moment to breathe. She leaned against the weathered wooden counter, her fingers tracing the delicate veins of a wilting rose petal, a sigh escaping her lips. The end of a perfect, beautiful, and utterly exhausting day. Except, something felt… off. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled. It wasn’t the quiet settling in as the market prepared to close. It wasn't the usual fatigue. It was something colder, something sharper, that seemed to emanate from the depths of her own floral sanctuary. And then, she saw it. A single, black rose, placed perfectly in the center of her most prized arrangement of lilies – a rose that most definitely wasn’t there an hour ago.
