Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and the full name of a clinical psychologist main character:

**Opening:**

The persistent drone of the cicadas outside Dr. Eleanor Grace Harding's office window was, she thought, a particularly cruel irony. She specialized in anxiety disorders, and the incessant buzzing seemed designed to push even the most Zen individual to the brink. Especially when it was coupled with the fact that her new patient, a wiry man with a perpetually hunted expression, had been staring fixedly at the meticulously organized bookshelf behind her for the past fifteen minutes and hadn't uttered a single coherent word.

Eleanor suppressed a sigh and resisted the urge to adjust the position of her diplomas on the wall. They were perfectly aligned. Everything in her office was perfectly aligned, a small island of order in the chaotic sea of human emotion she navigated daily. This was, in itself, a coping mechanism.

Finally, the man shifted, his gaze flickering to meet hers. “It’s… the birds,” he rasped, his voice thin and reedy. “They know. They always know.”

Eleanor leaned forward, a practiced calm settling over her features. "The birds know what, Mr...?"

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Grace Harding’s office is located on the second floor of a renovated Victorian house in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina. The building, once a grand family home, now houses a collection of private practices: therapists, lawyers, a small architectural firm. Her office itself is carefully curated to be both calming and professional.

*   **Color Palette:** Soft, muted blues and greens dominate.
*   **Furnishings:** Comfortable, but not overly plush. A dove grey couch faces two upholstered armchairs separated by a low, dark wood coffee table.
*   **Details:** A large, antique Persian rug covers the hardwood floor. Bookshelves filled with psychology textbooks and academic journals line one wall. Framed prints of botanical illustrations and abstract art adorn the others.
*   **Atmosphere:** Overall, the space aims for an atmosphere of quiet contemplation and professional competence. The sound of trickling water from a small indoor fountain in the corner is meant to further soothe and promote relaxation.
*   **Location Context:** Being in Charleston, there is a particular historic charm. Outside the window, one can glimpse the cobblestone streets and the elaborate wrought iron balconies that define the city's architecture. The air is thick with the scent of honeysuckle and the sound of distant church bells. The Southern heat always lingers.

I hope this is a good starting point. Let me know if you would like more details or adjustments!
