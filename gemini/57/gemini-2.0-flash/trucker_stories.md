## Story Opening & Setting

**Story Opening:**

The air in the cab smelled of stale coffee and desperation. Earl, a phantom pain thrumming in his left knee, swore under his breath as the rain, which had been a polite drizzle just an hour ago, transformed into a biblical downpour. He could barely make out the tail lights of the rig ahead of him, and the wipers, bless their little hydraulic hearts, were fighting a losing battle. "Come on, Bess," he muttered to his eighteen-wheeler, stroking the worn dashboard. "Just get us through this stretch, and I promise, first stop, we get you a wash and I get a double shot of espresso."

He adjusted his grip on the wheel, the familiar groan of the truck a strange comfort in the face of the raging storm. Earl had seen worse, sure, but tonight feltâ€¦ different. Anxious. Like the highway itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. He glanced at the CB radio, static crackling ominously. Maybe he should call it a night. Pull into that greasy spoon back a few miles and wait it out. But the load of frozen shrimp needed to be in Atlanta by sunrise, and Earl Silas Thompson never broke a promise, especially one made to a shipper.

**Setting:**

The story opens on a stormy night in early November. **Earl Silas Thompson**, a man in his late fifties with weathered skin and a salt-and-pepper beard that never quite managed to look neat, is driving his 18-wheeler, "Bess," down a lonely stretch of Interstate 81 in rural Virginia. The landscape is a blur of dark, rain-soaked forests and the occasional, flickering light of a distant farmhouse. The radio crackles with static, punctuated by brief, garbled voices swallowed by the storm. The interior of Bess is a well-worn sanctuary: stained seats, a scattering of road maps and receipts, a thermos of lukewarm coffee, and a lucky horseshoe dangling from the rearview mirror. The overall atmosphere is claustrophobic, isolating, and imbued with a palpable sense of unease, amplified by the relentless storm and the loneliness of the open road. The world outside Bess feels hostile and unknown.
