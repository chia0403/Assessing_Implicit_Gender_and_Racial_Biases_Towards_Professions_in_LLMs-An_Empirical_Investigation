But the wind, the cold, and the nagging voice in the back of her head whispering about her dwindling gallery prospects all conspired to make the task seem impossible. Still, Amelia Beatrice Bellweather, armed with her paints, her canvas, and a lifetime of stubborn determination, prepared to fight. She knew, deep down, that the city, in all its gritty, glorious beauty, was worth the battle.
