Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The dim glow of Edison bulbs cast a warm, amber light over "The Serpent's Kiss," a cocktail bar nestled in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. Outside, the humid night air was thick with the sounds of jazz spilling from open doorways and the murmur of tourists navigating the labyrinthine streets. Inside, the bar was a sanctuary of polished mahogany, velvet upholstery in deep jewel tones, and the gentle clinking of ice. Etched glass panels depicting Art Nouveau nymphs adorned the walls, and the air hung heavy with the aroma of citrus, bitters, and expensive cigars. The year is 1928.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Beauregard, her dark hair slicked back in a stylish bob and a crimson lipstick accentuating her full lips, expertly slid a Sazerac across the mahogany bar top. The ice in the glass chimed a delicate tune as it settled before the burly man with the Stetson. He grunted a thank you without looking up from his newspaper, the headlines screaming about the upcoming election. Eleanor didn't mind; she'd seen it all behind this bar – heartbreak, celebration, whispered secrets, and the occasional drunken brawl. She knew the stories each cocktail held, the confessions spilled with every sip. Tonight, however, the air felt different, charged with a subtle undercurrent of unease. A tension deeper than the usual late-night anxieties hung in the humid air, a feeling Eleanor couldn't quite shake off, like a phantom vibration from a broken piano string. She wiped down the counter with a practiced hand, her mind already calculating the proportions for the next drink – a French 75 for the flapper girl giggling in the corner – but a prickle of premonition danced on the back of her neck. Something was coming.
