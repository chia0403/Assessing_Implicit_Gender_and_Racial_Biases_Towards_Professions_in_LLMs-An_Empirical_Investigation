The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed a relentless, maddening hum that reverberated in Clara Beatrice Hawthorne's skull. It was 7:58 PM on a Tuesday, officially two minutes until sweet, sweet freedom. Clara, slumped against the chipped laminate counter, chewed on the inside of her cheek and stared blankly at the flickering neon sign advertising "Gas Station Gourmet" hot dogs. It was anything but. The Quick Stop was a beige, unremarkable box nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue, a liminal space between suburbia's manicured lawns and the industrial park that churned out widgets and quiet desperation. The air perpetually smelled of stale coffee, lottery tickets, and a vague, unidentifiable something that Clara had long ago decided was the distilled essence of broken dreams. Tonight, however, the usual aroma was overlaid with the slightly sweeter, oddly more disturbing scent of burning popcorn â€“ courtesy of Mr. Henderson, the perpetually bored owner, who apparently thought he could elevate the Quick Stop experience with a questionable snack.
