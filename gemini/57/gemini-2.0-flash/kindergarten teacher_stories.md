The insistent chirp of a robin was the only sound breaking through the pre-dawn quiet as Amelia Rose Hawthorne peeled back her floral duvet. 5:30 AM. Too early, even for her. But the anticipation bubbling in her chest, the familiar flutter that always accompanied the start of a new school year, wouldn't let her stay in bed.

Amelia Rose, Miss Hawthorne to her precious charges, lived in a charmingly ramshackle Victorian house on Primrose Lane in the small, picture-postcard town of Harmony Creek. The house, affectionately nicknamed "The Gingerbread House" by the neighborhood children, was painted a soft butter yellow with gingerbread trim and overflowing window boxes bursting with geraniums. Inside, the aroma of old books and cinnamon hung permanently in the air, a testament to her love of classic literature and her notoriously burnt toast.

Harmony Creek itself was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, the local baker remembered your favorite pastry, and the biggest scandal involved Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning petunias being nibbled on by a rogue rabbit. It was a haven, a safe, predictable world Amelia Rose cherished, and the perfect place to nurture the bright young minds entrusted to her care at the Harmony Creek Elementary School. The school, a stately red brick building with a welcoming oak door and a playground painted with hopscotch grids and vibrant murals, was just a short walk from her house, a journey she relished, especially on days like today.

Today was the first day of kindergarten. And Amelia Rose Hawthorne was ready.
