The aroma of stale coffee and children's hand soap hung in the air, a familiar, comforting perfume to Ms. Elara Thistlewick. It was 6:30 AM, an hour and a half before the first bell, and the fluorescent lights of Room 2B in Willow Creek Elementary School buzzed with a nervous energy that mirrored her own. Elara, a petite woman with perpetually rosy cheeks and a cascade of auburn curls barely contained by a haphazard bun, surveyed her classroom. Construction paper snowflakes, slightly crumpled from eager little hands, still clung to the windows from December, their delicate beauty a stark contrast to the dreary, overcast January morning pressing against the glass.

Willow Creek, a small, quiet town nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York, was blanketed in a thick layer of snow. The kind of snow that muffled all sound and made the world feel hushed and contemplative. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, where Friday night football games were the highlight of the week, and where the biggest news was usually Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s prize-winning zucchini. Elara had moved here five years ago, seeking escape from the frenetic energy of the city, and found a quiet haven in the rhythm of small-town life, and a fulfilling purpose within the brightly-colored walls of Willow Creek Elementary. Today, however, the quiet felt oppressive, the familiar routine suffocating. A feeling of unease, a knot in the pit of her stomach, told her that something was about to change.
