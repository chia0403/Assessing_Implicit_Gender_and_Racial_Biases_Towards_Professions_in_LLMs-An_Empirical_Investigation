The fluorescent lights of "Worldly Wonders Travel Agency" hummed a discordant tune against the backdrop of a relentlessly cheerful Caribbean sunset plastered across the wall. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, illuminated like tiny, restless travelers themselves. For Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, the sight was a constant reminder of the destinations she only helped others reach. The air hung thick with the scent of aging brochures and the lingering, phantom fragrance of duty-free perfume â€“ a concoction as potent as a watered-down mai tai.

Amelia, a woman whose youthful dreams of backpacking through Southeast Asia had been traded for the steady security of a nine-to-five job (and a mortgage), sighed. Her fingers tapped a weary rhythm against the laminate countertop. Outside, the November drizzle mirrored the grayness creeping into her own soul. Another Thursday. Another deluge of emails from clients requesting all-inclusive resorts and complaining about hidden fees. Another day of living vicariously through the carefully curated Instagram feeds of strangers, while her own passport lay untouched in a dusty box under her bed. This Thursday, however, felt heavier, more suffocating than usual, a premonition that something was about to shift, something that might finally pull Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne out of the humdrum orbit of suburban Connecticut.
