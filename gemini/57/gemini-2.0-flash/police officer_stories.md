The biting November wind whipped around Officer Alistair Bartholomew Finch, cutting through his thick, regulation-issued parka like a shard of glass. He pulled the collar higher, the wool scratchy against his neck, and squinted at the swirling snowflakes clinging to the wrought iron gate. This was the notorious Blackwood Asylum, its gothic silhouette a jagged scar against the bruised twilight sky.

Rain lashed against the grimy, arched windows, making them look like weeping eyes. The gargoyles perched precariously along the roofline seemed to leer down at Alistair, their grotesque faces distorted by the accumulating ice. Heâ€™d been called here too many times for comfort, each visit chipping away a little more of his sanity. Usually, it was a missing patient, a disturbed outburst, or a potential suicide. Tonight, however, the call had been vague: "Unexplained incident. Requires immediate police assistance."

Blackwood Asylum stood on the edge of Harrow Creek, Massachusetts, a town steeped in old money and even older secrets. It was a place whispered about in hushed tones, a place where the forgotten and the broken were hidden away, their stories buried beneath layers of ivy and neglect. Alistair had always felt a deep unease within its walls, a chilling sense of something profoundly wrong, something ancient and malevolent.

He took a deep breath, the frigid air burning his lungs. He pulled his service weapon from its holster, the cold steel a familiar comfort in his hand. He pushed open the heavy iron gate, the rusty hinges groaning in protest, a mournful sound that echoed the despair trapped within. Tonight, Officer Alistair Bartholomew Finch was walking into the heart of a nightmare, and he knew, with a sinking feeling, that he might not be walking out.
