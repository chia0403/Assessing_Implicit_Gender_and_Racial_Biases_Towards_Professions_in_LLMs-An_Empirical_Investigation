The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation that permeated Ms. Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne’s life. Her office, nestled between the perpetually overflowing lost and found and the rarely-used computer lab, was a testament to good intentions gone stale. Inspirational posters of mountain vistas and soaring eagles were peeling at the corners, mirroring the fraying edges of her patience. A half-eaten container of yogurt sat congealing on her desk, a monument to the lunchtime she hadn’t had time to eat, because, as usual, a gaggle of sophomores had been locked in a screaming match over prom dresses in the hallway, and Evelyn, bless her overachieving heart, had felt compelled to intervene.

Northwood High, a brick behemoth built in the heyday of post-war optimism, served the sleepy, mostly-affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut. But behind the manicured lawns and pristine Volvo SUVs, Evelyn knew, lurked a different reality: pressure, anxiety, and a suffocating expectation of perfection that crushed her students under its weight. And Evelyn Hawthorne, her title emblazoned in gold lettering on the slightly askew nameplate on her door (a student prank, probably), was their first line of defense. Today, however, even her well-worn arsenal of platitudes and empathy felt inadequate. Today, something felt…different. A low, almost imperceptible hum, deeper than the fluorescent lights, seemed to vibrate through the very foundations of the school. And Evelyn, with a growing unease that pricked at the back of her neck, couldn't shake the feeling that the usual teenage angst she dealt with day in and day out was about to take a decidedly…unusual turn.
