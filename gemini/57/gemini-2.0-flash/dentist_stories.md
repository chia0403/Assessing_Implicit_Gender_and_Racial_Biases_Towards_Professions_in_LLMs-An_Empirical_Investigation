## Story Opening:

The hum of the ultrasonic scaler vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hand, a familiar, almost comforting tremor. She peered into the cavernous maw of Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose teeth seemed perpetually locked in a battle with hard candies and neglect. Eleanor sighed, a tiny puff of air that fogged the small mirror she held in her left hand. "Just a little more scaling, Mrs. Higgins, and we’ll be good to go."

Mrs. Higgins responded with a muffled groan that Eleanor charitably interpreted as agreement. It was days like these, days filled with chronic grinders, fervent sugar addicts, and patients terrified of a simple filling, that made Eleanor question her life choices. Not that she didn't love dentistry. She just sometimes wished the profession involved a little less...bacteria and a little more…adventure. 

That thought, as always, brought a bittersweet pang. Adventure was the reason she'd left Boston in the first place, trading the bustling city and a promising partnership at a prestigious practice for this small, sleepy coastal town. Adventure, and a promise she'd made to her grandfather.

## Setting:

Eleanor's dental practice, "Coastal Smiles Dentistry," occupied the ground floor of a quaint, two-story Victorian house painted a cheerful seafoam green. It sat nestled on a quiet side street in Port Blossom, Maine, a town perpetually bathed in salty air and the cries of gulls.

Inside, the waiting room was deliberately designed to be as un-dental-like as possible. Instead of sterile white walls and clinical posters, the room was decorated with nautical themes: framed prints of old sailing ships, a weathered anchor perched in a corner, and a bubbling fish tank filled with brightly coloured clownfish. A stack of well-worn National Geographic magazines lay on the coffee table alongside copies of local newspapers.

The treatment rooms, while still equipped with all the necessary dental equipment, were equally inviting. Each had a large window overlooking the harbor, offering patients a calming view of the bobbing sailboats and the endless expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. Eleanor believed that a relaxing environment, coupled with a gentle touch and a genuine smile, could conquer even the most hardened dental phobias. Whether she was right or not, she was determined to try.
