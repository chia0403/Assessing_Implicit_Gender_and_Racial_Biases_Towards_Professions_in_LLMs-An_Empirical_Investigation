The relentless Birmingham sun beat down on the dusty hard hat perched atop Michael Anthony Johnson’s head, turning the air inside into a miniature furnace. He swiped at the sweat trickling into his eyes with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime on his already sun-baked forehead. The air hung thick with the smell of diesel, hot asphalt, and the metallic tang of welding – the symphony of progress, some might call it. Michael called it just another Tuesday.

He stood on the skeletal frame of what would soon be the new Birmingham City Museum of Modern Art, a steel and glass monstrosity rising from the red clay just off 20th Street South. Below him, the city sprawled, a hazy tapestry of brick and concrete, punctuated by the green oases of Railroad Park and the Birmingham Botanical Gardens. To the east, the distant rumble of trains echoed from the yards near Sloss Furnaces, a constant reminder of the city's industrial past, a past Michael was actively helping to bury beneath the shiny, modern future. He squinted, trying to make out the figure of his foreman, Big Joe, down on the ground, a red-faced silhouette against the rising midday heat haze. Time for lunch, thank God.
