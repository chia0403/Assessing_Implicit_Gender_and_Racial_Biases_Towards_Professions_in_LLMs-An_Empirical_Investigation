## The Whispering Wild

**Setting:** The small, windswept coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The houses here are painted in faded, cheerful colors, clinging to the rocky coastline like barnacles. The air is thick with the scent of salt and seaweed, punctuated by the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's veterinary clinic, "Finch Veterinary Care," sits on the edge of town, its peeling blue paint a testament to the relentless Atlantic weather. The clinic is a comforting jumble of well-worn furniture, shelves overflowing with pamphlets on animal care, and the ever-present aroma of antiseptic and dog biscuits. Beyond the clinic, a dense, untamed forest stretches inland, the "Whispering Wild" as the locals call it, a place of ancient trees and forgotten paths, rumored to be home to creatures both wondrous and wary.

**Opening:**

The screech of the rusty weather vane atop Finch Veterinary Care sliced through the pre-dawn silence. Dr. Eleanor Finch, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy braid, didn't even stir. Years of practice, of responding to frantic calls at all hours, had honed her ability to sleep through just about anything. It was the frantic, insistent banging on the front door that finally yanked her from the depths of slumber. "Coming, coming!" she mumbled, stumbling out of bed and pulling on a faded blue robe. The digital clock on her bedside table glared 4:17 AM. Whoever was on the other side of that door was in serious trouble, or seriously panicked. As she fumbled with the locks, Ellie couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that the source of her rude awakening wasn't just a simple case of distemper or a run-in with a skunk. The Whispering Wild held its secrets close, and sometimes, they came knocking.
