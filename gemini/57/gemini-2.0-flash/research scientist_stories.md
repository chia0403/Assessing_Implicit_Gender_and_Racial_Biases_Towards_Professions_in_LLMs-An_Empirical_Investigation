The stale, air-conditioned air of the biolab clung to Dr. Vivian Holloway like a second skin, a damp, suffocating layer that mirrored the unease twisting in her gut. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the sprawling campus of the Saguaro Institute of Advanced Botanical Research, turning the desert landscape into a shimmering, mirage-like expanse. Inside, however, the only light came from the harsh fluorescent tubes overhead and the flickering glow of the multiple monitors surrounding her workstation.

Vivian, normally a creature of methodical calm, tapped a nervous rhythm on the polished surface of her desk. The rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* echoed in the otherwise silent lab, a counterpoint to the low hum emanating from the gene sequencer in the corner. Three hours. It had been three hours since she initiated the sequence, three hours since she’d placed the fate of Project Nightingale – and, if she was honest with herself, her entire career – on the shoulders of a long shot. The data should be in. It had to be in.

She swiveled in her ergonomic chair, the soft leather groaning in protest, and fixed her gaze on the main monitor. The screen displayed a progress bar, currently stalled at 98%. Just two more percent. Two more tiny, agonizing percentages that felt like they were stretching into an eternity. Vivian leaned forward, the fine lines around her eyes, a roadmap of countless late nights and scientific breakthroughs, deepening in concentration. The fate of the world might not hang in the balance, but at this moment, the survival of a rare, possibly extinct, species of desert flower felt just as weighty.
