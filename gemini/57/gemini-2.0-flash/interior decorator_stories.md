## Story Opening & Setting

**Opening:**

Penelope Astrid Blackwood hated Mondays. Even Mondays where the sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of a penthouse overlooking Central Park, a view most people would sell their souls for. But this particular Monday morning, the sun's relentless cheerfulness felt like a personal affront. Penelope surveyed the disaster before her: a living room resembling a small, chic bomb site. Cushions eviscerated, designer throws tangled in a heap, and a single, lonely orchid stem lying mournfully across the pristine white rug. Mr. Abernathy's prized Persian cat, Napoleon, was definitely going to be the death of her career.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the sprawling, opulent penthouse apartment of Mr. Silas Abernathy, a reclusive tech billionaire, located on the 70th floor of a newly constructed, ultra-modern skyscraper overlooking Central Park in New York City. The decor, prior to Napoleon's rampage, was minimalist chic, a stark contrast to Mr. Abernathy's eccentric personality. Think clean lines, muted tones of grey and cream punctuated by bold splashes of color in the artwork, and an abundance of natural light. The apartment is a showcase of modern design and expensive taste, reflecting a desire for serene elegance and a sense of untouchable wealth. The air is always crisp, scented with a faint hint of expensive candles and the distant hum of the city below. It's a world of polished surfaces and meticulously curated details, a world where a rogue feline's reign of terror feels particularly out of place.
