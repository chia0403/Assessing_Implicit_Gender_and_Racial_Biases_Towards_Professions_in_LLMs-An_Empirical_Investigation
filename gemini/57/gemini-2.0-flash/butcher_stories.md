The biting wind howled through the gap between Mrs. Henderson's prized hydrangeas and the weathered brick wall of O’Malley’s Hardware, whipping up a miniature vortex of dead leaves that danced across the pavement. Inside, bathed in the warm, reassuring glow of fluorescent tubes, Bartholomew “Barry” Butterfield was expertly trimming the excess fat from a prime cut of ribeye. He hummed a tuneless melody, the metallic scent of blood and beef a comforting aroma that had permeated his nostrils since he was a boy, standing on a milk crate to reach the counter at his grandfather’s shop.

Barry’s Butcher Shop, nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the sleepy, perpetually autumnal town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, was more than just a place to buy meat. It was a landmark, a repository of local gossip, and a haven for those seeking a hearty meal and a kind word. Harmony Creek was a place where everyone knew your name, your mother’s maiden name, and the brand of dog food you bought. It was a place where porch swings creaked in the evenings, fireflies blinked in the twilight, and the most exciting thing that usually happened was the annual pumpkin carving contest. But today, the air felt different, heavier, like a storm was brewing, and Barry, despite his best efforts to ignore it, could feel it prickling at the back of his neck. He finished tying the ribeye with butcher's twine, a knot so practiced and precise it was almost art, and glanced up at the clock. 2:30 PM. Just enough time to prepare the sausage for tomorrow's breakfast rush. He just hoped whatever that unsettling feeling was, it wouldn't ruin Mrs. Abernathy's special order of lamb chops for Sunday dinner. Harmony Creek, after all, was a town that valued its traditions.
