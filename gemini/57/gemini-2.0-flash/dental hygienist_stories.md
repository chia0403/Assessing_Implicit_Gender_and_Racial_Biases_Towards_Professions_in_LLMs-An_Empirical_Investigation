Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a dental hygienist, named Evangeline "Eva" Moreau:

**Story Opening:**

The scream echoed, a raw, guttural sound that sliced through the sterile hum of the dental clinic like a stray filling drill. Evangeline Moreau, usually unflappable even when faced with a molar clinging stubbornly to its root, nearly jumped out of her freshly sanitized chair. She’d been polishing Mrs. Abernathy’s lower incisors, humming along to the Muzak, when the shriek ricocheted down the hallway. Mrs. Abernathy, thankfully, seemed more surprised than terrified, her blue eyes wide behind her bifocals.

“Goodness gracious, Eva, what was *that*?” she asked, a puff of minty saliva spraying gently from her mouth.

Eva tried to maintain a calm, professional demeanor. “I’m not sure, Mrs. Abernathy. Probably just Dr. Henderson’s patient reacting to a little… discomfort.” She hated lying, even a little white lie about dental pain, but she couldn’t very well tell Mrs. Abernathy that the scream sounded suspiciously like a banshee had taken up residence in operatory number three. Still, the hairs on the back of her neck prickled. She hadn't heard a sound like that in all her five years at Gentle Dental.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in Gentle Dental, a small, privately owned dental clinic in the sleepy, seemingly idyllic town of Havenwood, Connecticut. Havenwood is known for its charming New England architecture, its picturesque village green, and its suspiciously low crime rate. Gentle Dental itself occupies a renovated Victorian house on the edge of the village green.

*   **Exterior:** The house is painted a cheerful, yet slightly unsettling, shade of pastel blue. A small, white picket fence surrounds a meticulously manicured lawn dotted with rose bushes that are always, *always*, in bloom, regardless of the season. A small, slightly faded sign reads “Gentle Dental – We’ll Make You Smile!” in cheerful, cursive lettering.
*   **Interior:** The reception area is bright and airy, with floral wallpaper and comfortable, but slightly dated, armchairs. A fish tank bubbles quietly in one corner, containing a collection of oddly sluggish goldfish. The operatories are modern, if a little cramped, with state-of-the-art equipment that contrasts starkly with the building's antique charm. The entire clinic smells perpetually of antiseptic and artificial mint.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any aspect of the opening or setting!
