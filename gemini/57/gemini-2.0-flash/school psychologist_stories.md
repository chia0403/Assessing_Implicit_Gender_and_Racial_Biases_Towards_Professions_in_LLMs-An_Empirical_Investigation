The aroma of industrial-strength floor cleaner mingled with the lingering scent of cafeteria pizza, a combination Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had grown accustomed to, but never fond of. Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, striped the small, windowless office, painting zebra-like patterns on the peeling paint. It was Monday morning at Northwood Elementary, a brick behemoth squatting in the heart of Maplewood, Ohio, and Beatrice, Dr. Beatrice Ainsworth to the smaller inhabitants of this institution, was already on her third cup of lukewarm coffee. Today's agenda included a parent-teacher conference regarding little Timmy Henderson's penchant for biting, a consultation with the fifth-grade teachers about a suspected bullying situation in the playground, and, if she was lucky, a quiet hour to catch up on her overflowing inbox. The low hum of the fluorescent lights and the distant shrieks of children at recess were the soundtrack to Beatrice's life, a life dedicated to deciphering the complexities of young minds in the chaotic ecosystem of elementary school.
