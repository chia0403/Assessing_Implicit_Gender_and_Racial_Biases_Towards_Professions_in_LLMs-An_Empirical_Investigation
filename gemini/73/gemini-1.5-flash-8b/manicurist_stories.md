The scent of lilies and something vaguely chemical hung heavy in the air of "Nail Nirvana," a tiny salon tucked away on a side street in the bustling heart of Oakhaven.  Sunlight, fractured by the tall buildings across the street, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air above the polished chrome implements.  Amelia Petrova, manicurist extraordinaire, meticulously filed a delicate nail, her movements precise and practiced.  Her crimson fingernails, perfectly sculpted, were a stark contrast to the faded, floral wallpaper that lined the salon's walls.  A single, chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring blankly, sat on the counter next to a small vase of wilting sunflowers.  The quiet hum of the city outside mingled with the rhythmic click of Amelia's tools.  Today, however, a different kind of energy thrummed beneath the surface of the salonâ€™s usually peaceful routine.
