The biting wind, a constant companion of the Cascade Mountains, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes with icy needles.  Dust devils, kicked up by the relentless north wind, danced across the skeletal remains of felled trees, painting the landscape in a swirling grey-brown blur.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of blood, a stark reminder of the dangerous work Elias did.  He was a logger, a man carved from the very wood he felled, his hands rough and calloused, his eyes hard-edged, reflecting the unforgiving beauty of the wilderness he roamed.  The year was 1928.

Elias Thorne, 32 years old, stared at the jagged, charred remnants of the old-growth forest.  It had been a particularly brutal winter, and the forest, once a vibrant tapestry of emerald green, now lay broken and silent.  The area, known as the Serpent's Tooth, was already notorious for its treacherous terrain and the whispers of hidden dangers that haunted the local legends.  This particular patch, though, seemed to vibrate with an unsettling energy, the silence humming with an unnerving presence.  A single, untouched red cedar, impossibly resilient, stood sentinel among the wreckage, its gnarled branches reaching towards the sullen sky, a stark contrast to the desolation around it. The river, the Serpent's River, snaked through the valley, its icy water mirroring the jagged peaks that enclosed the valley.  The river, as unforgiving as the forest, was a reminder of the powerful forces that controlled this wild land.
