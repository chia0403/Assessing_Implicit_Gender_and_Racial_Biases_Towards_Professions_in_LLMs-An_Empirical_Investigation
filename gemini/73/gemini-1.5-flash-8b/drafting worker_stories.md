The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was a constant companion to Elara Blackwood.  It was a low, throbbing drone, punctuated by the rhythmic clack of her mechanical pencil across the tracing paper.  Lines, precise and delicate, flowed from her hand, transforming sketches into blueprints.  She worked in the shadowed corner of the sprawling architectural firm, a space dominated by towering stacks of blueprints, their pages filled with intricate diagrams of buildings yet to exist.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun that pierced the gloom, illuminating the fine details of a proposed skyscraper, its glass facade shimmering like a captured rainbow.  Elara, hunched over her drawing board, felt a familiar twinge in her shoulder, a constant reminder of the long hours spent in this sterile, yet strangely beautiful, world. Today, however, something felt different.  The usual monotony was laced with a subtle unease, a prickling sensation at the edge of her awareness.  The air in the room seemed thicker, the hum of the fluorescent lights more insistent.  This was not the usual quiet murmur of a drafting room.  This felt...charged.
