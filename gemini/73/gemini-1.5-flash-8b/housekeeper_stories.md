The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull grey from decades of lukewarm water and countless dish soap suds, reflected Elara Blackwood’s face.  Her reflection stared back, tired eyes hollowed beneath brows etched with lines of worry and years of quiet toil.  The faint scent of lavender, a familiar comfort from the sachets she'd carefully placed around the meticulously maintained drawing-room, offered little solace.  The house, sprawling and imposing, felt colder than usual this morning.  It wasn’t the chill of the autumn air that seeped through the drafty windows, but a palpable, heavy silence.  This silence pressed down on her, a weight akin to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the hallway.

Elara Blackwood, housekeeper to the esteemed Lord Ashworth and his aloof, enigmatic family, had lived in Ashworth Manor for twenty years.  She knew every creak of the floorboards, every shadowed alcove, every secret passage whispered through the ages by the aged stones.  But this morning…this morning felt different.  Unusually still.  Unusually…ominous.

The manor, nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Blackwoodshire countryside, stood as a testament to generations of wealth and power.  Towering above the surrounding landscape, the grand estate was a fortress of dark grey stone, punctuated by intricate, ornate carvings that seemed to watch the world from their imposing heights.  Ivy, thick and emerald, clawed its way up the walls, a creeping, living tapestry.  Within, the air hung heavy with the scent of old wood and faded floral prints.  Dust motes danced in the infrequent shafts of sunlight filtering through the tall, stained-glass windows, illuminating glimpses of opulent furniture and faded tapestries that told stories of long-dead ancestors.  An icy wind whistled through the gaps in the crumbling stonework, a mournful counterpoint to the unsettling stillness that gripped the house.
