The chill of the butcher shop, "The Cleaver's Cut," clung to Bartholomew "Barty"  Grimstone like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the glinting steel of a freshly sharpened cleaver resting on a butcher block stained crimson from the previous day's work.  Barty, a man whose face was as weathered as the oak plank of the counter beneath his calloused hands, felt the familiar ache in his joints, a constant companion since his youth spent amongst the rough-hewn timbers of the old Blackwood Forest.  He sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic thud of the meat cleaver on the block, a counterpoint to the ceaseless drip-drip-drip of water from a leaking pipe.

The shop, nestled in the shadowed alleyway behind the Grand Market, was a testament to both Barty's dedication and the unforgiving nature of his trade.  Rows of gleaming, butchered haunches and glistening sides of pork, beef, and mutton lined the walls, their pungent aromas blending with the coppery tang of blood lingering in the air.  A faint, almost imperceptible smell of pine needles hung heavy as well, a subtle reminder of Barty's connection to the forest, a space he still found solace within, even amidst the relentless demands of his life in the city.  A few stray pigeons, their feathers a patchwork of grey and black, darted amongst the discarded scraps, seeking sustenance in the very refuse of Barty's trade. Outside, the bustling sounds of the Grand Market, a cacophony of hawkers and shoppers, echoed into the shop, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost solemn atmosphere within.  This was Barty's world, and for now, it was enough.
