The biting wind, a relentless predator, clawed at Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s flight suit as the sunrise painted streaks of apricot and rose across the jagged peaks of the Azure Mountains.  Below, the valley floor stretched like a tapestry woven from emerald fields and the sapphire shimmer of glacial lakes.  Amy, her knuckles white around the controls of the single-engine, vintage Piper, felt the familiar thrum of the engine, a heartbeat echoing the frantic rhythm of her own thoughts.  She was late.  Exceedingly late.  And the mountain air, thin and unforgiving, held a certain, unsettling stillness, as if the very peaks were holding their breath.


Setting:

The Azure Mountains, a range of towering, snow-capped peaks, piercing the pale blue sky of the fictional nation of Atheria.  The landscape is a dramatic mix of alpine meadows, glacial rivers, and ancient, gnarled forests.  The altitude is high, the air is thin, and the weather is unpredictable.  Villages, nestled in sheltered valleys, are few and far between.  This particular region was known for its remote, secluded charm, making it a desirable yet treacherous place for pilots like Amy to navigate.
