Oakhaven, a town where manicured lawns met meticulously-maintained picket fences, was typically a haven of tranquility.  But today, even its predictable charm felt strangely oppressive, like a well-worn, but slightly suffocating, cardigan.  The scent of damp earth and petunias, usually a comforting balm, felt heavy, almost cloying.  Eleanor, with her perpetually tired eyes and the faintest hint of a tremor in her hand as she traced a swirling pattern on the desk with a pen, felt a disquieting sense of unease.  A familiar, yet unwelcome, foreboding had settled in.  She knew this premonition wouldn't simply pass, as the rhythmic drumming against the glass continued.  It demanded attention.
