The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated courthouse, a relentless percussion against the already frayed nerves of Amelia Hayes-Sterling.  The air, thick with the scent of mildew and damp earth, clung to her like a second skin.  She wasn't used to this kind of environment. Her polished, city-slicker legal practice in downtown Chicago was a far cry from the rust-colored, forgotten corner of rural Nebraska where she now found herself.

Amelia Hayes-Sterling, a sharp-tongued, thirty-five-year-old lawyer with a reputation for ruthlessly dissecting cases, stared out the window at the swirling grey clouds.  The courthouse, built in the early 1900s, was a testament to forgotten grandeur, now more haunted than grand.  Water streamed down the peeling paint, pooling on the cracked stone steps.  The clock tower, its hands frozen at 2:17, seemed to mock the interminable wait.  This was the heart of the Dust Bowl region, a place where time itself seemed to slow and bend under the weight of drought and despair. Her client, a grizzled farmer named Silas Blackwood, sat hunched in a worn wooden chair in the small, ill-lit courtroom, his eyes mirroring the grey sky outside.  The trial was for land, for the very soil under his feet, a fate hanging as heavy as the oppressive air.
