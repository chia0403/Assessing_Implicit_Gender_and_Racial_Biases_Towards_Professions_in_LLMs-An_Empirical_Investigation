The chipped paint of the mural depicting a sun-drenched meadow, a faded testament to a bygone era of vibrant color, barely held back the relentless grey of the November sky outside the classroom window.  Rain hammered against the panes, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rustling whispers of ten-year-old Amelia, the school janitor, who was quietly sweeping the overgrown corners of the hallway.  Mrs. Evangeline "Evangeline"  Abernathy, kindergarten teacher, meticulously arranged a stack of colourful construction paper, her movements as precise and measured as the meticulous clockwork of a miniature automaton.  The air in the classroom, usually thick with the scent of crayons and freshly-mixed playdough, was unusually still, heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the impending winter break and the unspoken tensions of the children's final day before a long, uncertain vacation.   A single, dusty snow globe sat on her desk, its miniature figures frozen in an eternal, peaceful embrace. The snow globe, a relic from a long-ago visit to a snow-dusted mountain town, was a constant reminder of a world beyond the walls of their little schoolhouse.

Evangeline, with her perpetually tired yet surprisingly bright eyes and a scattering of prematurely-grey strands tucked behind her ears, adjusted her glasses and sighed.  Another autumn had faded into winter. Another year of tiny hands grasping at learning, tiny feet tracing the rhythm of the classroom.  The whispers of the snowglobe echoed the unsaid questions in her own heart: what would the children take with them from this classroom?  What would they remember in the long, cold months ahead?
