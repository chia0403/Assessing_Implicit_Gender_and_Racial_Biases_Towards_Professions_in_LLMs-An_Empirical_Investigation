The sterile white of the lab hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window of Dr. Aris Thorne's research lab.  He hunched over a complex array of interconnected pipes, wires, and glass containers, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and something vaguely metallic, clung to his lab coat, a familiar and unwelcome companion.  His fingers, stained a sickly yellow from countless hours of handling reagents, expertly manipulated a delicate lever.  Outside, the city of Veridian sprawled beneath a perpetual twilight sky, a sprawling metropolis choked by pollution and simmering with an unseen tension.  Aris, lost in the labyrinthine world of his experiments, barely registered the subtle shifts in the ambient hum outside. He was chasing a whisper, a faint echo of something ancient and terrifying, something that lurked just beyond the boundaries of human understanding.
