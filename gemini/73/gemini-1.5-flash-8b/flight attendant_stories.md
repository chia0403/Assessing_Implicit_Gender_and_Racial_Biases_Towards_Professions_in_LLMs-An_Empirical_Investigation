The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the sprawling tarmac of Hong Kong International Airport.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Chenâ€™s brow, clinging to the crisp, navy uniform that felt like a second skin.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the massive, jet engines pounded against the concrete, a constant, low-humming soundtrack to her anxiety.  The scent of jasmine and sizzling wok-fried food mingled with the metallic tang of jet fuel, creating a heady, almost nauseating atmosphere.  Amelia, with her dark, perpetually anxious eyes and a small, nervous tremor in her hand, surveyed the chaos from behind the gleaming, polished stainless-steel boarding gate.

It was 4:17 AM, and her flight, Air Serenity 789, was scheduled to depart for Tokyo in an hour.  Amelia had been assigned to the business class section, a responsibility she usually relished, but tonight, the anticipation felt more like a vise tightening around her chest.  She was on her third, and admittedly, most stressful, year with Air Serenity.  The pressure to maintain a flawless smile and unfailing professionalism while her anxiety simmered beneath the surface was a constant burden.
