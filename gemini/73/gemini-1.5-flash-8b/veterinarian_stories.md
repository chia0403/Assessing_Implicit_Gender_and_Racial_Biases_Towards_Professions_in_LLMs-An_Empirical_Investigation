The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Great Northern Waste, stinging Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's cheeks and rattling the skeletal branches of the lone juniper tree that sheltered her makeshift clinic.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling the dry leaves into a hazy vortex around the battered wooden structure.  Em, a veterinarian with eyes the colour of a hawk's and hands calloused from countless hours tending to the region's resilient, if often-unruly, wildlife, adjusted her thick wool scarf, tucking it further around her chin.  The biting frost had already claimed the last few remaining wildflowers, leaving only a grey-white canvas of nothingness.  This year, the drought had been particularly brutal. Even the hardy bison herds were thinning.

The setting was the High Plains of Montana, a landscape of vast emptiness broken only by the occasional windswept prairie dog town or the silhouette of a distant mountain range.  The year is 1928.
