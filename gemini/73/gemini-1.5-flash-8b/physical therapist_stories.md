The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington’s lab coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted campus of the University of Oakhaven.  Frozen rain plastered strands of her dark hair to her forehead, and the only sounds besides the relentless drumming of the storm were the rhythmic crunch of her boots on the gravel path and the distant, mournful howl of a wolf.  It was a typical November evening in the remote, mountainous region of the Adirondacks, a stark contrast to the bustling physiotherapy clinic she ran in the nearby town of Cedar Creek.  Tonight, though, Amelia wasn't just battling the elements; she was battling a sense of dread that was heavier than the accumulating snow.

The setting:  A secluded, snow-dusted campus of a small, prestigious university nestled deep within the Adirondack Mountains.  The year is 2024.  The university's aging buildings, once vibrant with the energy of students, were now shrouded in a stillness that echoed the weight of Amelia’s anxieties.  The biting wind and encroaching darkness, amplified by the isolation of the mountain location, underscored the loneliness she felt as she made her way toward the abandoned biology lab, the only place capable of holding the truth she sought.
