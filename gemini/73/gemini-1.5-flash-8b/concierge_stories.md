The chipped porcelain of the antique teacup trembled in Amelia Nightingale's hand, mirroring the tremor in her own.  Rain lashed against the oriel windows of the Grand Cavendish Hotel, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Below, the cobbled streets of the historic district were swallowed by an encroaching gloom.  It was the sort of night that whispered secrets to the ancient stonework, and tonight, those secrets were all Amelia could hear.

Amelia, concierge of the Grand Cavendish for the past ten years, found herself staring at the inscription on the teacup â€“ *Memento Mori*.  The phrase, usually a gentle reminder of mortality, felt heavy, pregnant with unspoken anxieties.  The hotel, a symphony of hushed conversations, polished brass, and the subtle scent of aged wood, had never felt so precarious.  Tonight, the symphony was drowning in the storm.

The Grand Cavendish, a grand dame of a hotel perched atop a hill overlooking the city, stood as a stark contrast to the tumultuous weather outside.  Its facade, a harmonious blend of Victorian elegance and Art Nouveau flourishes, was bathed in the pale, sickly light of the street lamps.  Within, the lobby shimmered with an almost supernatural stillness.  The roaring storm created a dramatic backdrop for the polished hardwood floors, the gilded mirrors, and the plush velvet seating. But the air itself was thick with an unspoken tension, a palpable sense of impending disaster that resonated with Amelia's own growing unease.  A single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany desk where she sat, a lone figure in the vast, silent expanse of the lobby.
