Water, the relentless, grey-clad cityâ€™s constant companion, pooled in the uneven paving, reflecting the garish light in a nauseating shimmer.  This was where Amelia "Ash" Ashworth, Private Investigator, found herself, clutching a crumpled manila envelope.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and cheap, burnt coffee.  

Ash, a woman of wiry build and sharp angles, her face etched with a lifetime of city grime and barely-contained weariness, peered into the gloom of the alleyway.  A single, flickering gaslight, perched precariously on a crumbling brick wall, provided her only illumination.  Each rustle of leaves, each distant siren wail, amplified the hushed symphony of the alley's secrets.  The alley, a forgotten artery of the bustling, if not exactly glamorous, metropolis of Newhaven, whispered stories of illicit dealings and hidden lives.  This particular evening, it had a story of its own to tell, and Ash was determined to hear it.
