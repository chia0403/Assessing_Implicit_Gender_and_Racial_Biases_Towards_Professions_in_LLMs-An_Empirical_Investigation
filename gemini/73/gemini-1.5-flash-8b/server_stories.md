The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's face.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of anxiety in her chest.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was unusually busy.  A Saturday night in the sleepy town of Oakhaven usually meant a slow trickle of regulars, punctuated by the occasional tourist wandering in for a lukewarm cuppa.  But tonight, a boisterous throng of people filled the small, smoky tavern, their chatter a chaotic symphony that blurred into a muted hum around Amelia.  Her uniform, a faded crimson polo shirt stained with a faint latte ring, felt like a second skin, binding her to a relentless cycle of orders, refilled glasses, and strained smiles.  The air, thick with the scent of stale beer and burnt sugar, clung to her like a damp shroud.  This particular Saturday night, however, felt charged with an unseen tension, a prickle of something both thrilling and terrifying. Tonight, something was different. The Rusty Mug had never seen anything like it.
