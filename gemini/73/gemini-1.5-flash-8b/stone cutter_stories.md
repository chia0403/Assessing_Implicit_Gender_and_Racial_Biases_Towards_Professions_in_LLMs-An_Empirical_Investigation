The wind, a razor-sharp blade against Elias Thorne's weathered face, whipped icy shards of granite across the desolate quarry.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, choked the air, clinging to the rough-hewn stone and the ragged clothes of the men who laboured in the chasm.  Elias, his hands calloused and cracked like ancient, petrified riverbeds, adjusted the worn leather strap of his mallet.  Sunlight, a weak, fleeting presence, sliced through the swirling mist, illuminating the jagged scar of a colossal, unfinished statue – a colossal, unfinished god.  Elias had been carving this god for seven years, a lifetime in the unforgiving embrace of the Blackstone Quarry.  This was no ordinary mountain; it pulsed with an almost palpable, subterranean energy.  Legends spoke of it – legends of stone whispering secrets, of souls trapped within the very rock itself.  The quarry, nestled deep within the heart of the Whispering Mountains, felt like the end of the world, a place where time itself seemed to lose its rhythm.
