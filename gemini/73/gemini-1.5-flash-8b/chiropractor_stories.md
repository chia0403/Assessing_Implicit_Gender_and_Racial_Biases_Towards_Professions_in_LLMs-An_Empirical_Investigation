The fluorescent hum of the waiting room at "Align & Thrive Chiropractic" was the only sound Amelia "Amy" Hayes could hear above the rhythmic, almost hypnotic, thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  Rain hammered against the glass storefront, a relentless percussion mimicking the throbbing in Liam O'Connell's neck, the man currently sprawled, groaning, on the examination table.  Amy, a chiropractor with a practiced calm that belied the simmering anxiety beneath, adjusted her glasses and focused on the X-ray.

The setting was a quiet, suburban corner of Maplewood, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians.  The quaint, brick buildings, adorned with overflowing flower boxes and well-manicured lawns, seemed to hold their breath in anticipation of the approaching autumn.  But within the sturdy walls of Align & Thrive, a different kind of storm brewed.  The air, usually filled with the gentle clinking of instruments and the soft murmurs of conversation, was thick with the tension of the approaching storm, both outside and in.
