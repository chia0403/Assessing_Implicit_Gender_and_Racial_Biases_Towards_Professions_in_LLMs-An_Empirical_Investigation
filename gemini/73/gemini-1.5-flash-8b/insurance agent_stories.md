The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover Diner" cast a sickly green glow on Amelia Hawthorne's rain-slicked trench coat.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, forgotten strip mall, mimicking the frantic drumming in her temples.  Amelia, an insurance agent with the unpronounceably-named "Prudential of the Plains," sighed, the scent of burnt coffee and stale fries clinging to the air.  She’d been on this desolate stretch of Highway 87 for three hours, chasing a phantom claim.  A claim for a vintage, hand-carved wooden carousel, swallowed by the unforgiving dust storms of the Oklahoma panhandle.

The year was 1938.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, twisting the sparse prairie grasses into grotesque shapes.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened another violent storm.  Amelia, barely twenty-two, had more than a few years to go before her boss, a stoic man named Mr. Grimshaw, would acknowledge her as anything more than a "new face in a tough market."  This was her first truly independent assignment – a single, desperate claim amidst a town largely comprised of stubborn farmers and weathered ranchers, each one seemingly more reluctant than the last to acknowledge any misfortune.  A town clinging to an isolated ghost town named Dust Devil Gulch.
