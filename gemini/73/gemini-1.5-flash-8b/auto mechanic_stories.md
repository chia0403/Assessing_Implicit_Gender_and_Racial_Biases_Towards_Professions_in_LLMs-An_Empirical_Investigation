The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny, cluttered auto repair shop tucked away on a side street of the grimy industrial district.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light above Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's workbench.  Torn fabric scraps, rusted bolts, and the faint scent of burnt oil mingled with the sweet, sickly smell of cheap coffee brewing in a chipped thermos.  Amy, a woman of 32 with calloused hands and eyes that held the weary wisdom of countless engine rebuilds, meticulously tightened a bolt on a sputtering engine block.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of passing trains vibrated through the shop floor.  Tonight, the air was unusually still, a quiet before the inevitable storm that always seemed to brew in this part of town.  The only other worker, a lanky teenager named Leo, was engrossed in his phone, oblivious to the quiet anticipation hanging in the air.  Amy knew, somehow, that tonight was different.  Tonight, a new kind of trouble was coming to Rusty Wrench.
