The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of splashed water and forgotten rinses, reflected the harsh fluorescent light above.  Amelia "Em"  Ashworth,  a woman whose own hair cascaded around her shoulders in a perpetually unruly wave of auburn curls, meticulously snipped at a wisp of blonde escaping a client's meticulously styled bob.  The salon, "Scissors & Smiles," was a testament to its name's inaccuracy.  Smiles, if present, were often fleeting, replaced by the subtle tension of unspoken anxieties.  The scent of stale coffee and cheap hairspray hung heavy in the air, thick and cloying.

Beyond the muted hum of the clippers and the occasional muttered complaint, Em could hear the rhythmic thump of the city outside.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the small, second-floor salon, a relentless counterpoint to the quiet precision of her shears.  This particular Tuesday felt different, though.  The rain was heavier, the silence more oppressive.  A low, ominous growl reverberated from the alleyway below, swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the downpour.  Em pressed a stray curl behind her ear, her mind already drifting towards the day ahead.
