The fluorescent hum of the "Apex Archives" was a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming beneath Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's worn leather work boots.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare of the overhead lights, danced in the air like specters, mirroring the shadows that stretched and writhed along the cavernous corridors of the building.  The Apex Archives, a sprawling, decades-old repository for forgotten lore and arcane knowledge, was a monument to both meticulous preservation and neglectful upkeep.  Amy, its silent guardian, knew every crevice, every shadowed alcove, every dusty shelf groaning under the weight of centuries of secrets.  Tonight, however, the hum had a different, sharper edge. A low, almost imperceptible vibration pulsed through the floor, like a sleeping beast stirring in the bowels of the earth.  This wasn't unusual for the old building, but tonight, it felt different.  An unnatural, expectant tension hung in the air, thick as the accumulated grime on the forgotten maps lining the walls.
