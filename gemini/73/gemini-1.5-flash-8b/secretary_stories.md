The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the third-floor office, reflecting the frantic dance of Amelia Blackwood's fingers as she typed.  The rhythmic *clack* of the keys was a counterpoint to the incessant whirring of the ancient, air-conditioned unit, a sound that seemed to echo the relentless pressure building within her.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of dark curls escaping her bun, was the secretary to Mr. Silas Finch, a notoriously demanding and enigmatic recluse whose existence seemed solely focused on the completion of some unknown, yet colossal, project.

The office itself was a testament to Mr. Finch's peculiar tastes.  Dust motes swirled in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-streaked windows, illuminating a room that had aged along with its occupant.  Leather armchairs, worn to a silken sheen, circled a massive mahogany desk, overflowing with files, charts, and half-eaten bowls of what Amelia suspected was dry, stale cereal.  The air smelled vaguely of old paper and desperation, a scent that had become synonymous with the suffocating routine of her days.  A large, framed map of the world, marked with dozens of cryptic symbols and notes, dominated one wall, hinting at the vastness of the project Mr. Finch was engaged in, a project that Amelia knew, with unsettling certainty, lay at the heart of his insatiable desire for secrecy.
