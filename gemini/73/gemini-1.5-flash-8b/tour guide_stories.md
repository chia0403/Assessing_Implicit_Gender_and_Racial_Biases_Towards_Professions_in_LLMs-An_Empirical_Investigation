The biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the crumbling stone walls of the ancient fortress, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust motes, stirred by the wind, danced in the pale, filtered sunlight slanting through the archway.  Amelia, her name a whisper against the howling wind, adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel.  Today, the only other souls within the sprawling, almost-ghostly fortress were the few tourists who had ventured into the gloom with her, and the echoes of forgotten centuries.  Her tour group, a motley collection of wide-eyed first-timers and jaded history buffs, followed her like a flock of obedient sheep, eager to absorb the tales she wove like a tapestry of threadbare legend.

Amelia Blackwood, Certified Historical Explorer and Tour Guide Extraordinary, had been leading tours of the crumbling fortress of Eldoria for almost a decade.  The fortress, perched precariously on a windswept plateau overlooking the jagged peaks of the Aethelgard Mountains, was her passion and her livelihood.  It was also, she suspected, a place with secrets that clung to the very stones, secrets she was determined to unearth, one carefully crafted narrative at a time.  The rhythmic crunch of boots on the uneven flagstones, the hushed whispers of her group, and the eerie silence that punctuated their footsteps created a symphony unique to the fortress.  But today, even the familiar cacophony held an undercurrent of unease.  A persistent chill, deeper than the wind's bite, settled in the air, mirroring the unease stirring within Amelia's own heart.
