The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's shawl around her as she hurried down the cobbled lane, the scent of brine and decaying seaweed clinging to the air.  The grey stone buildings of the Seabreeze Sanctuary, perched precariously on the cliff edge, seemed to lean into the relentless North Sea gales.  Each gust rattled the ancient windows, a symphony of mournful cries that echoed the lonely solitude of the place.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker extraordinaire and Keeper of the Whispering Woods, knew the cries.  They were the lament of the kelpie, the mythical creature that roamed the sanctuary's hidden depths, and tonight, the cries were particularly insistent.  It was a sign.  Something was amiss.
