The flickering fluorescent lights of the underground bunker cast a sickly yellow glow on Alistair Finch's face, highlighting the intricate network of wires snaking across his workbench.  Alistair Finch, radio technician extraordinaire, wasn't exactly a man of the world, but the world was a fascinating, albeit frustrating, symphony of static and signal humming just beyond those thick concrete walls.  This particular symphony, however, was more like a cacophony.  Static crackled and boomed in his headphones, a torrent of interference drowning out the faint, desperate chirps he was desperately trying to isolate.  He chewed the end of his pen, his brow furrowed in concentration.

The bunker, a hidden citadel beneath the sprawling metropolis of New Zenith, was a labyrinth of cramped corridors and sterile white rooms.  Dusty air hung heavy, the smell of ozone and old electronics a constant companion.  Rows of ancient, meticulously labelled cabinets housed a collection of radio equipment that seemed to have been salvaged from forgotten wars and long-vanished civilizations.  Alistair, his greasy overalls a stark contrast to the pristine environment, was a silent guardian of this technology, a keeper of whispers from across the void.  A low hum, a faint thrumming, emanated from a massive radio antenna buried deep within the bunker, echoing the ceaseless activity taking place within the complex. He was certain the signal was there, hidden amidst the static, a message from somewhere, somewhere beyond the reach of the modern world.  But what, if anything, could it mean?
