The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Never Knew You Needed" mega-store hummed, a low, insistent drone that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's worn-out sneakers.  Dust motes danced in the artificial sunlight, illuminating the endless rows of beige, fluorescent-lit aisles, each crammed with the latest gadgets, gizmos, and gewgaws humanity had yet to deem essential. Amelia, a salesperson for the company's "Novelty and Curiosities" department, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  Her grey uniform, practically invisible against the pale backdrop, felt like a second skin.  This was her second day on the new "Sumptuous Saturdays" shift, a period the management decreed would be filled with a "wave of unprecedented customer enthusiasm".  So far, the enthusiasm was mostly confined to the air conditioning unit.

Amelia knew, with the disheartening certainty only a seasoned salesperson can possess, that this Saturday would be no different from the rest.  Another day of trying to convince uninterested customers that a self-stirring teacup or a miniature, fully functional, self-watering succulent garden was an absolute necessity.  Another day of battling the relentless monotony, the ever-present hum of disappointment and the subtle scent of stale coffee wafting from the break room.  This was her life, a carefully constructed box of pre-packaged routines and lukewarm expectations, and she wasn't quite sure if she'd ever dare to open it.
