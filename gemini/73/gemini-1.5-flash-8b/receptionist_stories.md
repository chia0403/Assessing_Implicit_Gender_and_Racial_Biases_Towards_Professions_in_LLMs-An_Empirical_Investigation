The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" office hummed, a monotonous drone that seeped into Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Five years.  Five years she'd been the silent guardian of this beige-walled fortress of spreadsheets and hushed conversations.  Five years she'd patiently answered the same tired questions about project deadlines and client expectations.  Five years she'd watched the sleek, modern furniture absorb the anxieties and ambitions of her colleagues.

The office was a labyrinth of cubicles, each one a miniature prison of productivity.  Sunlight, a rare visitor, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of identical beige-and-grey desktops.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair, a palpable weight pressing down on everything.  A faint, almost imperceptible, hum of discontent thrummed beneath the surface of the usual office clatter.  Today, though, something felt different.
