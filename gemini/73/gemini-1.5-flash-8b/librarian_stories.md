The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air.  Sunlight, filtered through the towering, dusty oak bookshelves of the Whispering Pines Library, painted intricate patterns on the worn, floral carpet.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the rows and rows of meticulously cataloged volumes, each a silent story waiting to be discovered.  Amelia, a librarian with eyes the colour of faded ink and a perpetually quiet grace, was perfectly content in this sanctuary of hushed whispers and whispered secrets.  Today, however, the usual symphony of rustling pages and hushed conversations feltâ€¦different.  A strange stillness hung in the air, a stillness punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a clock that seemed to be ticking a little faster than usual.
