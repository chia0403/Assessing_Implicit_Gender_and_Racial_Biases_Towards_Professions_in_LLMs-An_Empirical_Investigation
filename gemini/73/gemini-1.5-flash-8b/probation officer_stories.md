The chipped Formica countertop reflected Detective Inspector Alistair Finch's perpetually tired eyes.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the Probation Department office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the relentless drumbeat of paperwork accumulating before him.  Alistair Finch, 37, and already showing the wear of a career spent navigating the treacherous currents of juvenile delinquency, sighed, pushing a stack of reports further into the overflowing in-tray.  Another case, another gamble.  Another teenager on the edge.

The city of Alderbrook, a sprawling concrete jungle draped in a perpetual smog, choked Alistair's lungs as much as the endless paperwork choked his soul.  A grey, unforgiving city, it clung to the past, its grimy alleys echoing with the whispers of unsolved crimes and broken promises.  The rain-slicked streets reflected the city's own melancholy, reflecting the pale, overcast sky and the subdued desperation of the neighborhoods that Alistair patrolled.   He knew the shortcuts through the dilapidated housing blocks, the alleyways where shadows stretched long into the night, and the corners where trouble brewed.  He knew the faces of the boys and girls who walked that line, the ones teetering between hope and despair.  He was a ghost in the machine, a man trying to keep a few fragile lives from spiralling into the abyss. This particular case, however, felt different.  It feltâ€¦ heavier.
