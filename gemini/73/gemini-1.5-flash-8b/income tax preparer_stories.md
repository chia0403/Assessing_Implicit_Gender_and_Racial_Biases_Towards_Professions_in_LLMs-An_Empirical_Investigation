The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Experts" office hummed, a constant, irritating thrum that mirrored the steady rhythm of Amelia Peabody's life.  She, Amelia Peabody, meticulous tax preparer and self-proclaimed master of the IRS labyrinth, sat hunched over a stack of tax forms, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the mood of the office:  a muted gloom punctuated by the occasional, melancholic squawk of a pigeon on the grimy windowsill.  The office, nestled in a strip mall on the edge of the rust-colored industrial park, seemed to absorb the city's quiet desperation.  Paperwork, in varying degrees of disarray and desperation, was everywhere.  A half-eaten bowl of lukewarm instant ramen sat abandoned on a nearby desk, a silent testament to the all-night cram sessions and late-night phone calls that were common occurrences during tax season.  Amelia, in her neatly pressed, but slightly rumpled, gray blazer and sensible shoes, felt the familiar weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.  Today, more than most days, she felt like she was wading through a sea of anxieties, each form a tiny boat carrying a person's financial hopes and fears.
