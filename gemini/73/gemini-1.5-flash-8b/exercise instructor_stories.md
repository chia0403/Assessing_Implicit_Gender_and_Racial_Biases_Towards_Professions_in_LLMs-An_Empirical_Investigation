The fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's meticulously choreographed routine.  Amelia, a woman sculpted from granite and sunshine, led a group of clients through a series of plyometrics, their grunts and gasps echoing in the cavernous space.  Sweat beaded on her brow, highlighting the sharp angles of her jawline, and the rhythmic thump of her own heart pulsed in time with the pounding of her clients' feet.  This was her kingdom, a sweaty, determined microcosm of ambition within the sprawling, suburban sprawl of Meadowbrook.

The setting was a typical, if slightly over-hyped, 24-hour fitness center, its sterile white walls and chrome equipment hinting at a sterile ambition.  Rows of treadmills, stationary bikes, and weight machines lined the walls, a silent testament to the city's relentless pursuit of physical perfection.  Large, almost gaudy, posters depicting impossibly toned bodies urged clients forward, a constant reminder of the standards they were striving, and sometimes failing, to meet.  Outside, the rhythmic whir of traffic and the distant cries of gulls provided a stark contrast to the focused energy inside. Meadowbrook itself was a testament to the American dream, a collection of meticulously manicured lawns, cookie-cutter houses, and the relentless pursuit of material success, a reality Amelia both embraced and questioned.
