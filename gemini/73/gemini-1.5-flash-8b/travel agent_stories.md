The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow where the lukewarm coffee had dripped, reflected Amelia Blackwood's anxious frown.  A half-eaten croissant, resembling a sad, deflated moon, sat beside a overflowing in-tray crammed with travel brochures, flight confirmations, and crumpled hotel reservation slips.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the gloom accumulating in Amelia’s chest.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes of her tiny, cluttered office, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  Her mobile phone buzzed, a jarring interruption, but she ignored it, determined to conquer the chaos before her.

Amelia Blackwood, a travel agent with a penchant for exotic locales and a reputation for flawlessly planned itineraries, was facing a monumental crisis.

He’d demanded, with the curtness of a man accustomed to getting his way, a fully-refundable alternative.  And Amelia, with a carefully cultivated smile and a heart pounding against her ribs, had to deliver.  The pressure was immense, not just from the looming loss of commission, but from Finch's unpredictable nature and the tight deadline for the cruise ship to depart on schedule.  The only thing more daunting than the task at hand was the silent judgment she felt from the swirling chaos around her, a judgment that threatened to swallow her whole.
