Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated school building, a relentless percussion that echoed the anxieties swirling in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and something indefinably metallic, a scent that clung to the worn, peeling paint of the walls and seemed to permeate the very fabric of the school itself.  West Haven Elementary, a relic of a bygone era, stood on the edge of the rapidly gentrifying district, a stark contrast to the gleaming new developments pushing relentlessly towards it.  Each drop of rain felt like a tiny hammer blow against the already fragile social structures within these walls.  Today, Dr. Vance was tasked with assessing ten-year-old Leo Rodriguez, a student who had become increasingly withdrawn, his previously vibrant eyes now clouded with a somber stillness.  The case file, thick with fragmented observations and whispered anxieties, sat heavy in her worn leather satchel, a tangible weight reflecting the immense pressure pressing down on her shoulders.  The oppressive silence of the school, punctuated only by the insistent drumming of the rain, felt heavier than ever before.
