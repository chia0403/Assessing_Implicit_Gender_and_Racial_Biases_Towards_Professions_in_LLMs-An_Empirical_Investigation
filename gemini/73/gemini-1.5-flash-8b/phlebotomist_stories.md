The fluorescent lights of the city hospital hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump* of Amelia Josephine Finch's heart.  It was a sound she'd grown accustomed to, the pulse of the city echoing in the sterile silence of the blood drawing room.  Her small, almost imperceptible movements within the vast, white-walled space were the only visible signs of life.  Amelia, 26, a phlebotomist with a practiced, almost elegant hand, was the architect of those quiet, life-giving rhythms.  Today, the familiar hum seemed to intensify, a frantic buzz that vibrated not only through the walls, but deep within her very bones.


The room itself felt unusually cold, despite the constant hum of the HVAC.  Rows of identical metal examination tables lined the walls, each with a slightly unnerving sterility, gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling.  A faint tremor rippled through the glass-fronted refrigerators, storing the blood bags, as if the contents themselves were stirring.  The rhythmic *thump-thump* of her own heart seemed to amplify, almost threatening to overwhelm the hum of the city outside.  Amelia knew, with a sickening certainty, this wasn't just another day.
