The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate plains of the Northwind Territories, rattling the skeletal frame of Dr. Elara Vance's makeshift clinic.  Snow, the consistency of powdered glass, swirled around the single, flickering kerosene lamp, casting long, dancing shadows on the chipped paint and peeling wallpaper.

A low groan emanated from the cot where a grizzled frontiersman, scarred like an ancient map, lay unconscious.  His ragged breath fogged the frigid air. This was Elara's world, a harsh and unforgiving landscape where survival was a daily struggle, and healing a delicate dance between hope and despair.
