Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Nightingale Clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Carmichael's heart.  The clinic, nestled in the heart of the sprawling, impoverished district of Ashwood, was a testament to the resilience of its inhabitants.  Cracked paint, peeling wallpaper, and the ubiquitous scent of damp earth and frying onions were its defining features.  Yet, within these humble walls, Amy, a seasoned Emergency Medical Care technician, had witnessed the full spectrum of human suffering and, more often than not, the miraculous power of human spirit.  Tonight, however, the air felt thick with a particular kind of dread, a premonition of something beyond the usual broken bones and slashed arteries.  The incessant downpour had isolated Ashwood, cutting off access to the main hospital, and the distant wail of a siren, swallowed by the wind, offered little comfort.  A call, urgent and frantic, had brought her to the clinic, the voice of a young boy barely audible above the storm.
