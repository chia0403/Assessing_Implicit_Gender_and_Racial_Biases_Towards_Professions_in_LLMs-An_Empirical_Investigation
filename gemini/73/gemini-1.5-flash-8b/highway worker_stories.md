The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper, sliced through the exposed skin of Elias Thorne, Highway Maintenance Technician.  He hunched deeper into his oversized, quilted jacket, the frayed edges almost mirroring the ragged edges of the cracked asphalt he was meticulously patching.  The sun, a pale, indifferent disc, barely peeked through the swirling grey clouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the desolate expanse of the Interstate 95 median.  January in the desolate, windswept plains of eastern Nebraska was a relentless, brutal mistress.

The setting was bleak.  A stretch of Interstate 95, just east of the tiny town of Harmony, Nebraska.  The highway, usually a ribbon of metallic sheen, was now a canvas of grey and frost.  The surrounding landscape was a monochrome of brown earth and skeletal trees, the occasional farmhouse disappearing into the swirling mists like distant ghosts.  This particular section, a notoriously problematic stretch prone to frost heaves and winter-induced accidents, was Elias's domain for the next three frigid hours.  He had a particular sensitivity to the whispers of the wind, and a sense of responsibility to the unseen travelers passing through his domain of icy concrete and cracked asphalt.  He had seen too many accidents, too many frozen bodies on these very roads to take it lightly.
