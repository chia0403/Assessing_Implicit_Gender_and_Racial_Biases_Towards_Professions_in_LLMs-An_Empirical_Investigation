The rhythmic thrum of the ancient hardwood floor beneath Amelia Nightingale's bare feet was a familiar lullaby.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the arched window of "Serene Sands," a small, but exquisitely appointed massage therapy studio tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of the old city.  The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the clamor of the bustling streets just beyond the worn wooden door.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of polished jade and hands as gentle as moonlight, closed her eyes, the soft pressure of the clientâ€™s hand in hers a gentle anchor in the swirling tapestry of her thoughts.  It was Tuesday, and the late afternoon light held a particular warmth, hinting at the approaching autumn, a season she cherished for its subtle shift from the vibrant heat of summer.
