The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the ceaseless, quiet rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's life.  The small, but surprisingly well-stocked, pharmacy nestled on the corner of Elm and Maple Streets, a faded Victorian building with chipped paint and a perpetually dusty air, was Amelia's sanctuary.  This wasn't the glamorous world of high-end pharmaceutical companies she'd envisioned as a young woman; rather, it was a sanctuary of smells – the faint, earthy scent of chamomile teabags mixed with the antiseptic tang of rubbing alcohol – and the quiet rustle of paper as she sorted through prescriptions.  The late afternoon sun, filtering through the grimy windows, cast long shadows across the shelves lined with bottles, jars, and boxes, each a miniature universe of potential cures and remedies.  Amelia, with her spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose, meticulously checked a slip of paper – a prescription for a patient named Mrs. Henderson – the patient file in front of her a blur of faded ink and illegible handwriting.
