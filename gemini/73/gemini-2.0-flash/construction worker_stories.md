The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the exposed steel girders, turning them into shimmering, treacherous surfaces. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, spitting grit into the air and coating everything in a fine, reddish film. This was the heart of the Mojave Desert, and this was where Bartholomew "Bart" Reginald Higgins, a man built like a seasoned oak, spent his days.

Bart Higgins adjusted his safety glasses, pushing back the sweat-dampened brim of his hard hat. The project was monstrous â€“ a new, state-of-the-art solar power plant that promised to bathe the West Coast in clean energy. It was also the most challenging and unforgiving job he'd ever taken. He wiped his brow with a calloused hand, the smell of diesel fuel and burnt metal clinging to his skin. This morning, his task was to oversee the securing of the last of the giant parabolic mirrors. One wrong move, one slip of the wrench, and the fragile glass could shatter, costing thousands of dollars and potentially delaying the entire project. But more than that, one wrong move could mean serious injury, or worse. And out here, miles from civilization, under the unforgiving gaze of the desert sun, mistakes were rarely forgiven.
