The clock on the wall of "Synergy Solutions, Inc." ticked with the quiet insistence of a disapproving grandmother. Agatha Pruitt, meticulously filing her chipped, fire-engine red nails, barely registered it. Seven minutes until lunch. Seven minutes until she could escape the muted beige tones of the reception area and the cheerfully insincere motivational posters that plastered the walls. Seven minutes until she could devour her tuna salad sandwich and browse Reddit in blissful solitude in the breakroom. 

Outside, the sky was the oppressive grey of a cheap suit, threatening rain that would likely turn to slush by the afternoon. Agatha hated February in Chicago. Hated the way the wind whipped off Lake Michigan, biting at any exposed skin. Hated the way the city itself seemed to burrow deeper into its concrete shell, bracing itself against the unrelenting cold.

The phone rang, a shrill, demanding interruption to her daydream of sunshine and a margarita on a beach in Cancun. Agatha sighed, smoothed down her perfectly coiffed, auburn beehive, and reached for the receiver. Her smile, practiced and professional, bloomed automatically.

"Synergy Solutions, Inc., this is Agatha Pruitt, how may I direct your call?"
