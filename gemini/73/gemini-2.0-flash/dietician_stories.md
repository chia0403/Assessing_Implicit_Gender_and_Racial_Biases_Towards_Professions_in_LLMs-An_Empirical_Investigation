The lukewarm tap water splashed onto Amelia Grace Sterling's wrist, a jarring contrast to the humid Atlanta air that swirled around her in the tiny, windowless breakroom. Amelia sighed, scrubbing at a smudge of blueberry compote – a rogue splash from Mrs. Henderson's experimental "Brain Boosting Breakfast Bowl" – that clung stubbornly to her lab coat. She was a dietician at the Brookwood Senior Living Community, and today, like most days, felt like a delicate balance between nurturing her patients and navigating the minefield of questionable culinary concoctions the kitchen staff dreamed up. The fluorescent hum of the breakroom light seemed to amplify the persistent ticking of the antiquated wall clock, a constant reminder of the afternoon stretching ahead. Outside, the manicured lawns of Brookwood gleamed under the Georgia sun, offering a deceptive serenity that Amelia knew all too well was often shattered by denture-related crises, medication mishaps, and the ongoing debate of whether prune juice truly counted as a dessert.
