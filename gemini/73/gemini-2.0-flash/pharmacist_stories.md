Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a pharmacist named Amelia Rose Cartwright:

**Setting:** The sleepy town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. It’s early October, and the air is crisp with the scent of burning leaves and damp earth. The town square is dominated by a century-old oak tree, its leaves a vibrant tapestry of red and gold. Facing the square is Cartwright's Pharmacy, a cozy, brick-fronted building with large windows displaying a slightly faded assortment of vitamins, toiletries, and quirky local crafts. Inside, the air is a comforting blend of beeswax polish, herbal remedies, and the faintest hint of licorice from the old-fashioned candy jar Amelia keeps on the counter.

**Opening:**

Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, the sound barely audible over the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner of her pharmacy. Outside, the last rays of the setting sun painted the Havenwood town square in hues of amber and rose. The clock chimed six, signaling closing time. She glanced at Mrs. Higgins, who was slowly perusing the selection of hand-knitted scarves, and offered a gentle, “Just let me know if I can help you find anything, dear.” Mrs. Higgins, a fixture in the pharmacy since Amelia’s grandfather owned the place, smiled back, a knowing glint in her eyes. "Just admiring your handiwork, Amelia. Such a talent you have, balancing pills and yarn.” Amelia chuckled, carefully tidying the prescription counter, her movements as precise and practiced as the mortar and pestle she used for custom creams. Havenwood was a town where everyone knew everyone, and a pharmacist was more than just a dispenser of medication; she was a confidante, a shoulder to cry on, and sometimes, a purveyor of the finest locally spun alpaca wool. But lately, a subtle unease had settled over Havenwood, a feeling as persistent as the autumn chill, and Amelia, with her keen observation and knowledge of the town's ailments – both physical and emotional – felt it more keenly than most. And tonight, that unease felt particularly heavy.
