Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a coach:

**Story Opening:**

The stale smell of chlorine and desperation hung thick in the air, a familiar cocktail that usually soothed Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez. Tonight, though, it just amplified the knot in her stomach. She chewed nervously on a fingernail, a habit she’d sworn she’d kicked years ago. The championship meet was in two days, and instead of fine-tuning strategies, she was staring down a crisis. Not a performance slump, not a rival team’s sudden surge in skill, but a flat-out, unadulterated act of vandalism. Someone had drained the pool.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set at the **Ridgewood High School Natatorium**, a rather drab, utilitarian structure that smells perpetually of chlorine. The pool itself is Olympic-sized, but the aging tiles around it are cracked and stained. The spectator stands are often sparsely populated, except for the big meets where parents and classmates actually show up to cheer. Ellie's small, cluttered office, a cramped space crammed with stopwatches, laminated practice schedules, and motivational posters, is just off the pool deck. There's also a local diner called "The Dive" which Ellie and her team frequented for post-practice meals. The general location is a quiet, fairly affluent suburb of **Hartford, Connecticut**.
