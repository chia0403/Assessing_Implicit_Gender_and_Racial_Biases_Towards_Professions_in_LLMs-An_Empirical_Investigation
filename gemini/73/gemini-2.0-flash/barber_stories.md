## Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The sticky, late-August air hung heavy over Port Blossom, a small, fading coastal town in Maine. The salt spray, usually a refreshing kiss from the Atlantic, felt more like a greasy film coating everything, especially the weathered storefronts that lined Main Street. "The Mariner's Knot" was one of them, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, a testament to years of neglect and the relentless sea.

**Opening:** Elias Theodore Blackwood paused, a half-eaten blueberry muffin perched precariously on the counter beside his coffee. He squinted out the dusty front window of The Mariner's Knot, the only barbershop left in Port Blossom. Another slow day. A fly buzzed lazily around a half-empty bottle of Bay Rum on the shelf. Elias sighed, a sound like the creak of an old ship's mast. He was a barber, not a harbinger of doom, but the quiet desperation clinging to Port Blossom was starting to seep into his bones. He took a bite of the muffin, the sweet burst of blueberries a momentary reprieve from the salty, decaying reality. Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer, and Elias straightened up, forcing a smile onto his face. "Morning," he called out, the word sounding a little too cheerful, even to his own ears. "What can I do for you today?"
