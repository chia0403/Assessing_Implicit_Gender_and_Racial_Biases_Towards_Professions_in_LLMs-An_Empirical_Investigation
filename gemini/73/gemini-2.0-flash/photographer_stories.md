## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn streets of Old Havana, Cuba. The air hangs thick with the scent of diesel exhaust, sweet cigars, and the lingering fragrance of yesterday's mojitos. Buildings, once grand and vibrant, now crumble under the weight of time and neglect, their pastel facades peeling like sunburnt skin.

**Opening:**

The metallic click of the shutter echoed in the almost-silent street, swallowed by the rising hum of a city awakening. Isabella "Izzy" Diaz lowered her vintage Leica M6, her fingers tracing the cool metal. She'd been chasing this light for hours, a sliver of pearly grey that painted the crumbling facade of a baroque building in a hauntingly beautiful glow. The building, she knew, was once a lavish hotel, its ornate balconies now adorned only with threadbare laundry and the occasional drooping plant. It was the kind of beauty only found in decay, the kind that whispered stories of forgotten glory and silent resilience.

Izzy squinted at the image sheâ€™d just captured, a shiver running down her spine despite the sweltering air. It was good. Damn good. The kind of image that spoke without words, a testament to the soul of Havana. But as she adjusted the aperture for another shot, a figure emerged from the shadows of a nearby doorway, a silhouette as stark and weathered as the buildings themselves. He moved with a deliberate purpose, his eyes, even in the dim light, fixed on her. Izzy's pulse quickened. She wasn't afraid, not exactly. But she was suddenly, acutely, aware that she was a stranger in a city that kept its secrets close.
