## Story Opening:

The stale scent of diesel and microwaved coffee clung to the interior of the Kenworth like a stubborn weed. Earl James "Jimmy" Callahan rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the coarse fabric of his flannel shirt scratching against his stubbled jaw. He glanced at the digital clock on the dashboard - 4:37 AM. Another day, another mile. He yawned, a cavernous sound that echoed in the vast emptiness of the cab. Outside, the world was still shrouded in pre-dawn darkness, the only light emanating from the sickly yellow glow of the truck stop's flickering fluorescent signs. He sighed, a low rumble that vibrated in his chest. He hated early mornings, but the load wasn't going to deliver itself.

## Setting:

The story opens in the dusty, sprawling parking lot of a "Truck Stop America" just off I-80, somewhere in the flat, unremarkable landscape of Nebraska. The truck stop itself is a concrete behemoth, promising everything from hot showers to lukewarm buffets. Rows of chrome-laden semis, like slumbering beasts, are parked haphazardly around the perimeter. The air is thick with the low hum of idling engines and the distant drone of passing traffic. A lone, wind-battered American flag snaps defiantly above the entrance, a testament to the only thing truly unwavering in this transient world.
