Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring our main character, a singer named Evangeline Rose Thorne:

**Setting:** A smoky, dimly lit jazz club called "The Velvet Curtain" in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter. The air hangs thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and something vaguely reminiscent of beignets, but undeniably… off. It's a Friday night, late, and the room is packed. Small, round tables are crammed together, leaving barely enough room for the waitresses to navigate in their frilly, faded red dresses. A single spotlight illuminates the small, raised stage, highlighting the worn velvet curtain behind the musicians.

**Opening:**

The trumpet wailed, a mournful cry that echoed the ache in Evangeline Rose Thorne's soul. She stood just offstage, her fingers tracing the cool, smooth surface of her silver microphone. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat competing with the steady rhythm of the bass. The Velvet Curtain was always a nerve-wracking gig, but tonight, it was bordering on unbearable. The heat was oppressive, even for a New Orleans summer, and the faces in the crowd blurred into a sea of expectant eyes. Eyes that seemed to know something she didn’t, eyes that held a secret she couldn’t quite decipher.

Tonight felt… different.

Taking a deep breath, Evangeline adjusted the strap of her emerald green dress, the sequins catching the light like tiny, glittering emeralds. It was her grandmother's dress, a relic from her own days on the stage, a fragile shield against the anxieties that threatened to swallow her whole. She could almost feel her grandmother's cool hand on her shoulder, offering a silent reassurance.

The trumpet solo ended with a flourish, and the drummer tapped out a brief, anticipatory roll. The bandleader, a gruff man named Frankie with a voice like gravel and a heart of gold (sometimes), nodded to her.

It was time. Evangeline Rose Thorne stepped into the spotlight.
