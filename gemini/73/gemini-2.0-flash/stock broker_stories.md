The biting wind whipped across Battery Park, snatching the words right out of Alexander Montgomery’s mouth as he barked into his phone. The sun, a weak, watery smear in the pre-dawn sky, did little to alleviate the January chill. He clutched his cashmere scarf tighter, the silk lining doing little to warm the prickling anxiety crawling up his spine. The ferry horn blared a mournful groan from the distant Staten Island terminal, a sound that usually soothed him, reminding him of the pulse and rhythm of the city. This morning, however, it felt like a dirge.

Alexander, a man who usually exuded the effortless confidence of someone born into privilege, was anything but composed. His charcoal grey, bespoke suit, normally a symbol of his power and success, now felt like a poorly fitting costume. He paced back and forth, leaving faint imprints in the dusting of snow that coated the park benches and the iron railings overlooking the grey churning water of the harbor. He was on the phone with his Head of Trading, a man who usually jumped at Alexander's every whim, now sounded distant and vaguely terrified. The news he was relaying was catastrophic. Devastating. The kind of news that could bring empires, and particularly Alexander’s meticulously built empire, crashing down around his ears.
