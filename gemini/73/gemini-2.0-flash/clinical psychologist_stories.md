**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance had seen it all. Or, at least, she thought she had. Twenty years of listening to the fractured narratives of human experience in her quiet, book-lined office had built a formidable wall of empathy around her. She’d navigated the treacherous currents of grief, the silent depths of despair, and the manic peaks of unbridled euphoria. She’d witnessed the slow, painstaking process of rebuilding shattered lives, brick by painstaking brick. But nothing, not even the most elaborate delusion concocted within the confines of the human mind, had prepared her for the shivering, muddied figure standing on her doorstep.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. Eleanor's practice, "Vance Psychological Services," occupies the ground floor of a Victorian-era house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The house itself is painted a calming shade of seafoam green, trimmed with white gingerbread detailing. Inside, her waiting room is designed to soothe anxieties, with plush armchairs, a crackling fireplace (often lit, even during the milder months), and shelves overflowing with well-worn novels and artfully arranged seashells. Her office, however, is a more practical space. A large, antique desk sits center stage, cluttered with patient files and research papers. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves are packed with textbooks and journals, and a comfortable, yet professional, therapy couch sits discreetly in the corner. The large windows offer a breathtaking view of the ever-changing ocean, a constant reminder of the vast and unpredictable nature of life itself. The air is always thick with the scent of lavender and old paper.
