The chipped ceramic mug warmed Eliza Mae Harrington’s hands as she gazed out the window of "The Healthy Hub," her quaint little office nestled in the heart of bustling Willow Creek, Oregon. Rain lashed against the glass, turning the already verdant landscape into a watercolor masterpiece of shifting greens and greys. Steam curled from the mug, carrying the earthy aroma of chamomile tea, a small rebellion against the sugar-laden temptations that plagued so many of her clients.

Eliza loved Willow Creek. The air was clean, the people friendly, and the produce grown here tasted like sunshine. It was the perfect place, she believed, to plant the seeds of healthy living. Yet, despite the inherent goodness, she was facing an uphill battle. Willow Creek, beneath its idyllic veneer, was a town addicted to comfort food and bad habits, a place where potlucks featured three different kinds of cheesy casserole and the local bakery’s cinnamon rolls were practically a religious experience.

Today, the rain seemed to mirror her own low-level frustration. Her schedule was packed, but she knew a good portion of those appointments would consist of convincing skeptical farmers and reluctant soccer moms that kale wasn’t just “rabbit food” and that dessert shouldn’t be its own food group. A sigh escaped her lips. It was going to be a long day.
