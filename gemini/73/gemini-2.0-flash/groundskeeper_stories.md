## Story Opening:

The dawn arrived grudgingly, painting the eastern sky in hues of bruised plum and reluctant gold. Dew clung to the immaculate blades of grass, shimmering under the weak light. For Ezekiel Silas Wainwright, it was just another Tuesday. He straightened from his task, the familiar ache in his lower back a persistent companion. The scent of freshly cut grass, usually a balm, seemed to mock him this morning, a reminder of the endless cycle of maintenance required to keep this place looking pristine.

Ezekiel glanced up at the looming silhouette of Blackwood Manor, its gothic turrets and sprawling wings silhouetted against the dawn. The grand old estate, perched atop the highest hill overlooking the town of Havenwood, cast a long, cold shadow over his life. It was his domain, his responsibility, his prison.

## Setting:

**Blackwood Manor, Havenwood, Connecticut:** The manor itself is a sprawling, gothic monstrosity, built in the late 1800s by the eccentric Blackwood family. It's a testament to a bygone era, a time of wealth and opulence. Think dark wood panelling, stained glass windows depicting scenes from Arthurian legends, and imposing gargoyles perched precariously on every available surface. The surrounding grounds are meticulously maintained by Ezekiel. The formal gardens are a riot of color in the spring and summer, carefully sculpted hedges form intricate mazes, and ancient oak trees stand sentinel, their gnarled branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. A dense, bordering forest creeps close on all sides, adding an element of wildness to the manicured landscape. The entire property is shrouded in an atmosphere of both beauty and foreboding, whispered to be haunted by the echoes of its long and often tragic history.
