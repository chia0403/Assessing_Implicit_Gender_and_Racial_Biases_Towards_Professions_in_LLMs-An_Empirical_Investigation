The pre-dawn air was a damp, biting thing that clung to the cobblestones outside and seeped, unwelcome, into the bones of even the most seasoned early risers. Fortunately, Augustina Emilia Rossi, owner and head baker of "Rossi's Dolce Vita," was anything but a seasoned early riser. She *loathed* mornings.

But the city of Ravenna, Italy, didn't run on loathing. It ran on strong coffee and even stronger pastries, and Rossi's Dolce Vita was the only place that could provide the latter at 5:00 AM sharp. So, with a groan that echoed through the empty bakery, Augustina wrestled open the heavy wooden shutters, letting in the first sliver of grey light that touched the hand-painted sign above the door.

Rossi's Dolce Vita was tucked away on a narrow, winding street just off the Piazza del Popolo. The building itself was ancient, its terracotta walls stained with the memories of generations of bakers. The aroma of almond biscotti and yeasty bread hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the cold. Inside, the walls were a cheerful, if slightly faded, butter yellow. A long glass counter, currently empty, snaked along one side of the room, ready to showcase the day's delights. Behind it, the heart of the operation: Augustina's enormous, brick oven, its mouth agape like a slumbering dragon, waiting to be fed its daily diet of wood and dough. The floor, worn smooth by years of foot traffic, was covered in a mosaic of vibrant tiles depicting scenes of Roman harvests and overflowing baskets of fruit.

Tonight, or rather this morning, the only light came from a single bare bulb hanging precariously above Augustina's workbench, casting long, dancing shadows that exaggerated the frown etched onto her face as she stumbled towards the coffee machine. Today, the fate of Rossi's Dolce Vita, and perhaps Augustina's sanity, rested on the perfect rise of a single batch of panettone.
