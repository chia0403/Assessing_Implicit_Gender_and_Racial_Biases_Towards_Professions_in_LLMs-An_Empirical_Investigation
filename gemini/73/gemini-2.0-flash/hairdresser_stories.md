The humid air hung heavy with the scent of hairspray and the faint metallic tang of bleach, a cocktail that Beatrice “Bea” Bellwether considered her perfume. Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow film on the salon window, painted the worn linoleum floor in ephemeral swathes of colour. Outside, the incessant honking of horns and the rumble of passing buses vibrated through the plate glass of "Shear Bliss," Bea's little sanctuary in the heart of Brooklyn's bustling DUMBO neighborhood.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically a slower day, but today felt different. The atmosphere thrummed with a strange energy, a pre-storm stillness broken only by the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Bea's scissors. She was meticulously trimming the uneven fringe of Mrs. Petrovsky, a woman whose Russian accent was as thick as her immaculately permed hair. Mrs. Petrovsky was mid-sentence, recounting a particularly dramatic incident involving a rogue pigeon and a freshly baked poppyseed cake, but Bea barely registered the words. Her gaze kept flicking to the dusty antique clock above the reception desk. It was almost three o'clock, and a new client, one with a name she hadn't quite been able to place, was due to arrive. A shiver, not entirely unpleasant, ran down Beatrice Bellwether’s spine. This appointment felt significant, like the first domino in a chain reaction that could change everything.
