**Setting:** The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty blinds of "The Spine Spot," a small, unassuming chiropractic office nestled between a struggling bakery and a pawn shop on Elm Street in the fictional town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The air smelled faintly of peppermint oil and the lingering anxieties of the day's patients. The worn, floral-patterned waiting room chairs were perpetually crooked, a testament to years of fidgeting nervous energy.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Amelia Thorne sighed, running a hand through her perpetually messy bun. The rhythmic whir of the old wall clock was the only sound breaking the silence of The Spine Spot. The last patient of the day, Mrs. Higgins, had hobbled out twenty minutes ago, leaving behind the lingering scent of mothballs and a slightly alarming amount of shed cat hair on the floral upholstery. Evelyn stared out the window, watching the sycamore leaves swirl in the gathering twilight. She knew she should be tackling the mountain of paperwork teetering precariously on her desk, but the thought felt as appealing as facing a root canal. Harmony Creek, despite its name, seemed determined to test her patience and her back adjustment skills daily. And tonight, she just felt... weary. Weary of the town's small-town gossip, weary of the chronic back pain that seemed to be a town-wide epidemic, and weary of the nagging feeling that she was meant for something more than aligning spines in a sleepy Ohio town.
