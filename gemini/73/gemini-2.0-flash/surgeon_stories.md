## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The operating room at St. Jude's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. It's 3:17 AM. The fluorescent lights hum a relentless, sterile melody above. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic, ozone, and a faint, metallic tang that lingers even after the last drop of blood has been mopped. Surgical instruments gleam on a tray under the watchful eye of a circulating nurse, her face etched with a fatigue that mirrors that of the surgical team. Outside, the rain lashes against the windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm of their efforts.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand, leaving a smear of crimson that looked almost theatrical in the harsh light. Her gaze, intense and unwavering, remained fixed on the exposed aortic arch before her. The steady beep of the heart monitor provided a grim counterpoint to the torrential rain hammering against the window. "Suction," she commanded, her voice low and steady, betraying none of the bone-deep weariness that threatened to overwhelm her. This wasn't just another surgery; this was Sarah Jenkins, a vibrant young woman with a whole life ahead of her, and the weight of that life, precariously balanced on a thread of suture, felt impossibly heavy in Eleanor's hands. Failure was not an option. Not tonight.
