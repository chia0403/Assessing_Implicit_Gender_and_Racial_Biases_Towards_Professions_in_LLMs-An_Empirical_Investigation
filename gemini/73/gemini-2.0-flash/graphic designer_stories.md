The insistent buzz of the fly was the only sound that competed with the gentle lapping of the Aegean against the whitewashed walls of Eleni’s taverna. Amelia Isabel Petrova, a graphic designer whose usual canvas was a 27-inch iMac display, sighed and swatted weakly at the offending insect. It dodged with irritating ease, its tiny drone amplifying in the midday heat.

Amelia had imagined Santorini as a vibrant, inspiring kaleidoscope. Instead, after three days, it felt more like a shimmering, overpriced postcard. The caldera, a majestic half-moon gouged out of the sea, was undeniably breathtaking. But the hordes of tourists clutching selfie sticks and clamoring for the perfect sunset shot had sucked the magic right out of it.

Eleni’s was one of the few places in Oia that still felt authentic. Tucked away down a narrow, bougainvillea-draped alleyway, it offered respite from the throngs. The air, thick with the scent of grilled octopus and wild thyme, felt less manufactured, more real. Amelia, nursing a lukewarm Mythos beer, gazed out at the endless expanse of blue, trying to conjure up the inspiration she desperately needed for her next project: a travel brochure for a cycling tour company. Ironically. Maybe the fly knew something she didn’t. Maybe she needed to buzz off and find a different island altogether.
