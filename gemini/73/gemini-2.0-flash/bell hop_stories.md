## Story Opening:

The lobby doors of The Grand Imperial Hotel wheezed open, swallowing a fresh gust of New York City in its swirling embrace. Rain, slicked with exhaust fumes, plastered itself against the marble facade. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of central heating and the murmur of hushed conversations. A small orchestra, tucked into a gilded alcove, was valiantly attempting to coax a melody from their instruments, but the discordant arrival of the storm seemed to momentarily stifle their enthusiasm.

Ignoring the weather, and indeed the general air of disgruntled opulence that permeated the space, **Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins**, his crisp navy uniform suddenly feeling far too thin against the damp chill, plastered a practiced smile on his face. He stood, ramrod straight, next to the revolving doors, his peaked cap perched perfectly on his head.

He hadn't expected the downpour to hit quite so hard, and a small, unwelcome shiver prickled down his spine. Bart hated being cold. It reminded him too much of the cramped, draughty apartment he shared with his mother and three noisy younger siblings in Queens. The Grand Imperial, with its roaring fireplaces and plush carpets, was supposed to be an escape. A stepping stone to something better. Maybe, one day, he wouldn't have to smile at grumpy tourists and haul their luggage to the penthouse suite. Maybe, one day, he'd be *staying* in the penthouse suite.

But for now, he was Bart Higgins, Bell Hop extraordinaire, and his job was to offer impeccable service, regardless of the weather, or the demanding clientele. He adjusted his grip on the luggage cart, steeling himself for the inevitable onslaught of soaked and irritated patrons. Tonight was going to be a long one.
