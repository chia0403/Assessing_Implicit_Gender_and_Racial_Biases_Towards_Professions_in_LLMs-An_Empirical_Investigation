## Story Opening:

The florescent lights of Klein & Harrington hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Josephine Daviesâ€™ life. Another Tuesday, another towering stack of depositions to summarize, another lukewarm cup of coffee threatening to spill onto her meticulously organized desk. Amelia suppressed a groan. At 7:15 AM, the office felt as vibrant and inviting as a tax audit. Outside, the Seattle rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the Space Needle into a hazy, futuristic dreamscape. Amelia, however, was firmly grounded in reality, specifically the agonizingly tedious reality of proving negligence in the case of a dog walker and an overenthusiastic Yorkshire Terrier.

## Setting:

The story primarily takes place in **Seattle, Washington**, specifically in the **Klein & Harrington law firm**, located on the 32nd floor of the **Columbia Center**, the city's tallest skyscraper. The office is modern, sleek, and undeniably expensive, reflecting the firm's reputation for handling high-profile corporate cases. However, Amelia's small corner of the paralegal department feels cramped and utilitarian, a stark contrast to the opulent partner offices she occasionally glimpses. The cityscape visible from her desk is breathtaking on a clear day, offering views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. But on days like today, only the grey, weeping sky serves as a backdrop to her relentless workload.

Beyond the office, glimpses of Amelia's life in Seattle are revealed: her cozy, book-filled apartment in **Capitol Hill**, her favorite independent bookstore, **Elliott Bay Book Company**, and the bustling **Pike Place Market**, where she often escapes for a quick, sanity-saving lunch. These locations provide a contrast to the corporate environment of Klein & Harrington and hint at Amelia's more personal and creative side.
