## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee, patchouli, and desperation hung heavy in the air of the Blackwood Playhouse's rehearsal room, a trifecta that perfectly encapsulated Elias Thorne's current state of mind. He ran a hand, perpetually ink-stained, through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair, the gesture leaving a visible swirl in the already unruly mess. Across from him, Belinda, playing Lady Macbeth, was weeping dramatically (and, Elias suspected, somewhat performatively) into the shoulder of the equally bewildered actor portraying Macbeth. 

"Belinda, darling," Elias began, his voice a careful blend of gentle coaxing and thinly veiled exasperation, "remember what we discussed? The dagger speech is about ambition, not heartbreak. Think Lady Macbeth as a coiled viper, not a wilting daisy."

Belinda sniffled, her mascara threatening to cascade down her cheek. "But Elias," she wailed, "it's just so *sad*."

Elias sighed, a sound that echoed slightly in the cavernous room. He glanced at the looming grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging with the ominous regularity of a judge's gavel. Opening night was in less than two weeks, and 'sad' was the least of his worries. 'Incoherent,' 'under-rehearsed,' and 'potentially disastrous' were much closer to the mark.

## Setting:

The Blackwood Playhouse, a once-grand Victorian theater in the heart of rundown, artsy district of Port Willow, Oregon, was currently in a state of precarious equilibrium between faded glory and impending collapse. The velvet curtains were threadbare and patched, the gilt on the ornate proscenium arch chipped and peeling, and the plumbing had a distinct tendency to gurgle ominously during the quietest of scenes. Yet, despite its dilapidated state, the Playhouse held a certain charm, a sense of history and artistic struggle that clung to its very walls. The rehearsal room, located in the basement, was particularly dismal. A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows on the mismatched furniture and the scuffed wooden floor. Posters of past productions, showcasing Elias Thorne's often-brilliant, often-unhinged, but always ambitious interpretations of classic plays, lined the walls, a testament to the theater's, and Elias Thorne's, unwavering dedication to the art of performance. The air was thick with the ghosts of past performances and the fervent hopes for future success, a potent cocktail that both fueled and tormented Elias in equal measure.
