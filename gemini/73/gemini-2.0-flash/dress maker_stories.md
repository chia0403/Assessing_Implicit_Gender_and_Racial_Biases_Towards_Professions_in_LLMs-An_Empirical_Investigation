## The Seamstress of Whispering Pines

**Setting:** Whispering Pines was a town carved from the belly of the Appalachian Mountains, a place where the air hummed with the secrets of ancient trees and the rhythm of the seasons dictated life’s pace. Nestled amongst clapboard houses and the scent of woodsmoke, clung to the steep slopes was Clementine’s Cottages, a cluster of brightly painted, miniature homes that catered mostly to tourists looking for an escape from the steel and smog of the cities. It was here, in the smallest cottage painted a vibrant sunflower yellow, that Cordelia Beatrice Ainsworth, a dressmaker of extraordinary skill and quiet disposition, ran her small but well-regarded atelier.

**Opening:**

The last rays of the October sun, painting the mountains with streaks of crimson and gold, slanted through the leaded-glass windows of Cordelia Beatrice Ainsworth's atelier, illuminating the swirling chaos of fabrics that perpetually surrounded her. A half-finished gown, shimmering with iridescent emerald sequins, lay draped across a mannequin, its intricate embroidery catching the light like captured fireflies. Cordelia, her silver thimble glinting against her calloused finger, carefully stitched the final bead onto a delicate velvet collar, the rhythmic *snick, snick* of the needle a familiar comfort in the approaching twilight. She sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear, the scent of lavender and beeswax clinging to her skin. Another day nearly done. Another gown closer to completion. And another nagging feeling that something, something significant, was about to unravel in the quiet sanctuary of Whispering Pines.
