The acrid smell of burnt plastic hung heavy in the air, a grim reminder of Thomas "Tommy" Abernathy's last (and spectacularly unsuccessful) attempt at fixing the ancient fuse box. He coughed, waving a hand in front of his face, the grime on his palm making a muddy smear in the already dim light.

The setting: The basement of the "Whispering Pines" Retirement Home, a sprawling, three-story Victorian behemoth perched on a windswept hill overlooking the small town of Oakhaven, Maine. The basement itself was a testament to forgotten utilities and forgotten sins. Pipes snaked across the low, damp ceiling like metallic cobras, hissing occasionally with escaping steam. Dust motes danced in the single, bare bulb illuminating his workspace, a chaotic jumble of wires, tools, and half-eaten blueberry muffins (breakfast on the go). The air was thick with the scent of mildew, decaying wood, and the faint, lingering aroma of disinfectant, a constant reminder of the residents upstairs. It wasn't a place Tommy liked to linger, but the Whispering Pines was his biggest client, and keeping the lights on for a gaggle of demanding, bingo-loving retirees was a responsibility he took seriously. Even if it meant battling a fuse box that seemed determined to single-handedly plunge Oakhaven into the dark ages.
