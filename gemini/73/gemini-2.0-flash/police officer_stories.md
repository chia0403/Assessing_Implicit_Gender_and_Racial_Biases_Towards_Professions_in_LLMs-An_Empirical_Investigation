**Opening & Setting:**

The Miami sun beat down on Lieutenant Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, radiating heat off the shimmering hood of her unmarked Crown Vic. Even through the tinted windows, the air felt thick and heavy, a pre-storm humidity that clung to the skin like a second, unwelcome layer. Izzy squinted, adjusting her aviator sunglasses, as she surveyed the scene. Yellow crime scene tape cordoned off a stretch of Ocean Drive, the iconic art deco buildings providing a vibrant, almost jarring, backdrop to the grim reality unfolding beneath them.

The usual throngs of tourists, armed with selfie sticks and pastel-colored cocktails, were replaced by a hushed gathering of uniformed officers, CSI technicians in crisp white suits, and the morbidly curious, held back by the thin barrier of tape. A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, mingling with the salty scent of the ocean and the lingering sweetness of spilled rum from last night's parties.

Izzy pushed open the car door, the vinyl seat groaning in protest, and stepped out onto the sun-baked asphalt. The heat radiated up from the ground, blurring the already distorted view of the ocean in the distance. Another beautiful Miami day, marred by another senseless tragedy. She took a deep breath, bracing herself. Time to get to work.
