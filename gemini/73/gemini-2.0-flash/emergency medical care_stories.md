The biting wind, smelling of brine and diesel, clawed at Emilia "Em" Rodriguez's exposed skin as she wrestled the heavy defibrillator out of the back of the ambulance. The flashing blue and red lights of the rig cast elongated, frantic shadows across the slick, moss-covered pier in Port Lament, Maine. Normally, the sleepy fishing village was picturesque, a postcard image of New England charm. But tonight, the charm was drowned out by the rhythmic crash of waves against the pilings and the frantic cries of a woman further down the dock.

Em, officially Emilia Rodriguez, Paramedic with the Port Lament Volunteer Ambulance Corps, tightened her grip on the defibrillator and adjusted the headlamp strapped to her forehead. Rain, a fine, stinging mist, plastered strands of her dark hair to her face, blurring the already dim scene. The pier, built on a shaky foundation of rotting planks, groaned under the weight of the ambulance and the gathered crowd â€“ a motley collection of fishermen in oilskins, concerned tourists, and the portly, perpetually worried Mayor Higgins, wringing his hands.

The air hung heavy with the stench of fish and impending disaster. Em took a deep breath, trying to ignore the ominous creaking of the pier and the icy grip of fear tightening in her chest. Someone's life depended on her.
