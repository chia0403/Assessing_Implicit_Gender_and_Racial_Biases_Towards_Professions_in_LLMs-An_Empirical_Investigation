Okay, here's a story opening, featuring a drafting worker named Alistair Finch:

**Opening:**

The rhythmic *snick-snick-snick* of Alistair Finch’s mechanical pencil was the only sound breaking the near silence of the drafting room. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, high windows of the old Garamond Building, laid in hazy, golden bars across the vast, linoleum floor. He barely noticed it. He was lost in the dense forest of lines and symbols that comprised Sheet 37 of the Zenith Dam expansion project.  His brow furrowed, tracing a hairline crack in the proposed concrete reinforcement with the tip of his pinky. Something felt off. The placement of the stress anchors seemed… insufficient.  Alistair chewed on his lip, a habit he’d had since he was a boy puzzling over complex Lego constructions, and reached for his calculator.  His fingers flew across the keys, a quick, practiced dance that belied the growing unease in his gut. The numbers confirmed his suspicion.  There was a flaw, a potentially catastrophic one, buried deep within the architectural blueprints.

**Setting:**

The Garamond Building, a hulking concrete structure erected in the 1930s, exuded an aura of faded grandeur. Once a bustling hub of architectural innovation, it now housed a handful of smaller firms and a perpetually disgruntled building manager named Mrs. Higgins, who perpetually complained about the drafts (both literal and figurative). The drafting room itself, located on the seventh floor, was a cavernous space divided by rows of drafting tables. The walls were a pale, institutional green, peeling in places, adorned with faded posters promoting safety regulations and long-forgotten company achievements. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust, old paper, and the faint, lingering aroma of stale coffee. Rows of meticulously organized blueprints, tied with faded ribbon, stood sentinel in tall metal cabinets along one wall, a testament to years of countless projects.  The windows, tall and narrow, offered a breathtaking view of the sprawling city, a view most of the drafters rarely looked up to see, too consumed by the minute details of the plans before them. It was a place of meticulous precision, of straight lines and right angles, a stark contrast to the chaotic, unpredictable world outside.
