Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Bartholomew Finch:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Esmeralda Grande, nestled in the heart of Vienna's Innere Stadt, pulsed with a low, constant thrum of understated luxury. Outside, horse-drawn carriages clip-clopped along cobblestone streets, their rhythm a counterpoint to the sleek, modern cars that purred to a halt before the hotel's imposing facade. Inside, the lobby was a symphony of gleaming marble, polished brass, and hushed tones. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow on the plush velvet furniture, and the air was subtly scented with a custom blend of sandalwood and bergamot, designed to evoke a sense of timeless elegance. The Esmeralda Grande was known for its impeccable service and its clientele – a mix of European royalty, global business leaders, and the occasional, reclusive celebrity seeking anonymity behind the hotel’s discreet charm.

**Story Opening:**

Bartholomew Finch, the Head Concierge of the Hotel Esmeralda Grande, adjusted his perfectly knotted silk tie and surveyed the lobby with a practiced eye. Not a speck of dust, not a misplaced magazine, not a flicker of discontent on a guest's face escaped his notice. His world was one of meticulous order, of anticipating needs before they were even voiced, of transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. He’d been stationed at his mahogany desk for a little over an hour, answering a flurry of requests. He had secured last-minute tickets to the Vienna State Opera for a Texan oil baron, arranged a private waltz lesson for a newly engaged couple, and even managed to locate a rare, antique music box for an eccentric Russian composer. He prided himself on being able to secure almost anything for his guests - for the right price, of course.

However, this morning felt different. An unusual tension hung in the air, thicker than the usual anticipatory buzz that always surrounded the arrival of new guests. A sleek, black SUV had just pulled up to the entrance, and from it emerged a woman cloaked in mystery.

He watched as the driver opened her door, and he couldn't help but notice the expensive, understated tailoring of her suit, and the way she held herself; both revealed an air of subtle power. She straightened, looking directly at him with a cold gaze, and Bartholomew Finch had a feeling his carefully orchestrated world was about to be thrown deliciously off balance.
