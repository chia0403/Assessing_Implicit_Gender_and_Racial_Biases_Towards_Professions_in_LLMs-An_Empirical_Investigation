The smell of sawdust and cedar hung heavy in the air, clinging to the rough-hewn beams of the workshop like a persistent memory. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic drumming that usually soothed, but tonight, only amplified the gnawing anxiety in Elias Thorne's gut. Elias, a carpenter known throughout the small coastal town of Port Blossom for his intricate carvings and sturdy furniture, hadn't touched a piece of wood in three days. His tools lay scattered across his workbench, glinting dully in the weak light of the single overhead bulb â€“ a testament to his paralysis.

Port Blossom itself was a town etched with the beauty and hardship of the sea. Tucked between the rugged cliffs of the Oregon coast and the churning Pacific, it was a place where the salt spray kissed every surface and the cries of gulls were the morning alarm clock. Fishing boats, their paint peeling under layers of salt and sun, bobbed rhythmically in the harbor. The air was thick with the tang of brine, mingled with the faint scent of pines from the surrounding forests. The buildings, mostly weathered wood and shingle, clung to the hillside as if afraid of being swept away by the unforgiving ocean. Normally, Elias found solace in the town's stoic resilience, a reflection of his own. But tonight, the very air seemed to press down on him, heavy with an unspoken dread.
