The relentless August sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Walker's neck, turning the faded orange of his safety vest into a shimmering mirage. The asphalt, still soft from the morning's application, clung stubbornly to his boots with each step. He squinted, shielding his eyes against the glare reflecting off the endless ribbon of Highway 93, a two-lane blacktop stretching like a sun-baked serpent across the desolate Nevada landscape. 

The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of hot tar and dust, a familiar and strangely comforting scent to Eli after nearly fifteen years with the Nevada Department of Transportation. Even the buzz of the cicadas seemed sluggish, a droning chorus of resignation to the oppressive heat. Off to the west, the jagged peaks of the Toiyabe Range shimmered blue in the haze, a distant promise of coolness Eli knew he wouldn't feel until well after sundown. His work crew, four men and himself, were halfway through repaving a particularly rough section of the highway, just south of the abandoned mining town of Silver Gulch. There wasn't much out here besides the road, scrub brush, the occasional jackrabbit, and the ghosts of prospectors long gone. For Elias Walker, it was just another Tuesday.
