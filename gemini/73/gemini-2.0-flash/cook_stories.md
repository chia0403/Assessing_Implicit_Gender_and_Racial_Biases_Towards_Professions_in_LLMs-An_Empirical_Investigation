The clatter of pans was a familiar symphony in Beatrice Eleanora Thorne's tiny kitchen. Outside, the relentless drizzle painted the slate rooftops of Whitby a uniform gray, but in here, the air hummed with the fragrant promise of rosemary, garlic, and the salty tang of the sea. Beatrice, clad in a flour-dusted apron and a cardigan three sizes too big, hummed along to a crackly Edith Piaf record as she wrestled a particularly stubborn knob of ginger.

This was The Salty Siren, Beatrice's own little haven carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the North Sea. Not much more than a single room with a handful of tables and a sprawling, hand-painted mural of mythical sea creatures, it was her sanctuary, her obsession, and, if she was honest with herself, the anchor that kept her from drifting out with the tide. The walls were a vibrant, almost clashing turquoise, adorned with mismatched nautical paraphernalia: tarnished brass lanterns, lengths of faded fishing net, and framed postcards showcasing idyllic seaside scenes from decades past. 

Beatrice loved the contrast, the chaotic beauty of it all, a reflection, perhaps, of her own life, a whirlwind of spice and simmer, always on the verge of overflowing but somehow always holding together, just like the perfectly balanced bouillabaisse bubbling merrily on the stove. Today, however, the usual joy felt a little…watered down. It was the anniversary. Ten years since… well, since everything changed.
