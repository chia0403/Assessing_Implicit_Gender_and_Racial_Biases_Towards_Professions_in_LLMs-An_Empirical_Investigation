## Story Opening:

The bite of the axe was a familiar comfort against the pre-dawn chill. Elijah Thorne, his breath puffing out in white clouds, swung with a practiced rhythm, the steel meeting the trunk of the ancient Douglas Fir with a satisfying thud. The scent of pine sap, sharp and clean, filled his nostrils, a scent he'd known since he was a boy, clambering over felled trees with his father. This particular tree, however, was putting up a fight. Its bark, thick and gnarly with age, resisted his initial strikes. Elijah shifted his weight, his muscles coiling with renewed effort, a low grunt escaping his lips. He wasn't just taking down a tree; he was providing. He was building. He was surviving.

## Setting:

The setting is the dense, rain-soaked forests of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Towering Douglas Fir and Sitka Spruce dominate the landscape, their canopies so thick they block out much of the sunlight. Patches of emerald moss cling to every surface, softening the harsh edges of the rocky terrain. The air is perpetually damp, carrying the earthy aroma of decaying leaves and damp wood. The year is 1932, deep in the throes of the Great Depression. The logging industry, once a booming cornerstone of the Pacific Northwest, is struggling, and every tree felled is a victory, a small step towards feeding a family. The logging camp, a cluster of rough-hewn cabins and a central cookhouse, is nestled near the Elwha River, its relentless roar a constant backdrop to life. It's a hardscrabble existence, demanding unwavering strength and resilience from those who dare to carve a living from the towering timber.
