**Story Opening:**

The low hum of the fluorescent lights did little to soothe Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's frazzled nerves. He hadn't even finished his first cup of lukewarm coffee and already Mrs. Higgins, bless her cotton socks and her encyclopedic knowledge of local gossip, was on her third retelling of the Great Pothole Debacle of Elm Street. "Bartholomew," she chirped, her voice echoing in the otherwise silent office, "I'm telling you, it swallowed a whole *garbage truck*! It was a tragedy, I say, a tragedy!"

Barty forced a smile, a muscle memory more than a genuine expression of amusement. "Terrible, Mrs. Higgins, truly terrible. Are we still interested in renewing that homeowner's policy, then?"

He knew the answer before she even opened her mouth. Mrs. Higgins was a creature of habit, as predictable as the sunrise and as likely to switch insurance providers as she was to bungee jump off the town hall clock tower. But Barty had to ask. He had a quota to meet, and the aroma of desperation was a potent, and unpleasant, cologne to wear in the insurance business.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolds in the modestly sized office of "Finch Family Insurance," a single-story brick building nestled between the "Happy Wok" Chinese takeout and "Rosie's Roses" florist shop on the main street of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek was the kind of town where everyone knew your business, your grandmother's maiden name, and the exact number of dandelions currently plaguing your lawn. Barty's office was a testament to the town's unassuming charm: a beige color scheme dominated, punctuated by faded landscape prints and a calendar featuring kittens tumbling out of baskets. The linoleum floor, though recently waxed, retained the ghosts of countless tracked-in mud and melting snow. Barty's desk, an imposing oak monstrosity inherited from his grandfather, was perpetually cluttered with policy files, claim forms, and half-eaten bags of stale popcorn, a vice he was desperately trying to break. The air hung thick with the scent of dust, old paper, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Higgins' rose-scented perfume.
