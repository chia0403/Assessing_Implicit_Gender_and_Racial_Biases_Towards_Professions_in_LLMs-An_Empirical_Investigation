The meat cleaver, heavy and worn with the stories of countless slaughtered beasts, sang its familiar song against the thick, maple chopping block. Arthur Bartholomew Finch, proprietor of Finch & Son's Fine Meats (the "Son" having been a purely aspirational title since Arthur's only offspring eloped with a traveling salesman peddling miracle cures), leaned his weight into the swing, splitting a stubborn chicken carcass with practiced ease. The rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* was the soundtrack to his life, a constant, reliable hum in the otherwise quiet, and increasingly bizarre, world of Havenwood.

Havenwood, nestled deep in the verdant folds of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town steeped in secrets thicker than the gravy Arthur ladled over his famous pork chops. Mist clung to the cobblestone streets each morning, obscuring the brightly painted Victorian houses that leaned precariously towards each other, whispering tales of long-forgotten feuds and more recent disappearances. The air, even on the sunniest days, carried a faint tang of woodsmoke and something else... something Arthur couldn't quite place, but which always made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.

His butcher shop, a haven of sawdust and the comforting scent of cured ham, sat on the corner of Main and Hemlock, its windows perpetually steamed from the simmering bone broth bubbling away in the back room. Finch & Son's, with its hand-painted sign depicting a rather portly pig wearing a chef's hat, was more than just a place to buy meat; it was the town's unofficial confessional, a space where Arthur, with his quiet demeanor and uncanny ability to debone a rabbit blindfolded, listened to the anxieties and secrets of Havenwood's residents. And lately, the anxieties had been particularly potent, the secrets particularlyâ€¦meaty. Something was definitely rotten in Havenwood, and Arthur Bartholomew Finch had a feeling it wasn't just the week-old kidneys Mrs. Gable had tried to return.
