The rain lashed against the windows of Leo Maxwell's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. The neon sign across the street, advertising "Rosie's Ribs," flickered erratically, casting a sickly orange glow that painted the chipped paint of his walls in uneven strokes. Leo sat hunched behind his cluttered desk, a half-empty glass of lukewarm whiskey sweating beside a stack of unpaid bills. He was nursing a hangover that felt like a miniature jackhammer attacking the inside of his skull and a case that was as cold as the February air seeping through the drafty window frames.

His office, a cramped space above a dusty pawn shop in the less-than-glamorous district of Old Kensington in Philadelphia, smelled perpetually of stale cigarette smoke, cheap coffee, and a lingering hint of something vaguely…metallic. The walls were adorned with framed (but faded) accolades from his days as a promising young cop – commendations for bravery and detective work that now felt like relics from a bygone era. A threadbare Persian rug covered a floor that groaned under the weight of anyone, let alone Leo’s broad frame. It was a place that reeked of hard luck and broken dreams, a fitting backdrop for the kind of clientele that usually found their way up the rickety staircase. This particular Thursday evening, however, it was just him, the ghosts of past cases, and the relentless drumming of the Philadelphia rain.
