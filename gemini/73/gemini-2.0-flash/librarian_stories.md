## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The Dewey Decibel Library, nestled in the heart of the quaint, perpetually-fog-drenched coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. It’s a sprawling Victorian building, its gabled roof and stained-glass windows hinting at a history far grander than the current collection of chipped teacups and mismatched armchairs within. The air inside smells perpetually of old paper, lavender potpourri, and the faint, lingering scent of Mrs. Gable's notorious tuna sandwiches, which she eats every Thursday at her usual table near the historical fiction section. Rain patters softly against the leaded-glass windows, casting dancing shadows on the overflowing bookshelves.

**Story Opening:**

Winifred Abigail Featherstonehaugh, Head Librarian of the Dewey Decibel, sighed and adjusted her spectacles, the delicate gold frames slipping slightly down her nose. Another Tuesday, another deluge. The meteorological forecast for Port Blossom was perpetually the same: "Chance of drizzle, becoming likely drizzle, possibly evolving into persistent drizzle, followed by a brief interlude of slightly less drizzle." Today, however, felt different. Not simply because Mrs. Gable was humming off-key show tunes while devouring her tuna sandwich with gusto, but because of the subtle, almost imperceptible shift in the atmosphere. A prickling sensation at the nape of her neck, the kind she usually only experienced when a patron attempted to return a book soaking wet.

She straightened the neatly stacked pile of returned novels on her desk, the spines aligned with military precision. “Another slow day,” she muttered to Clementine, her ginger tabby, who was currently draped across a stack of oversized art books, her tail twitching in time with Mrs. Gable’s rendition of “Memory.” Usually, Winifred relished the quietude. It allowed her to catalog new acquisitions, re-shelve misplaced volumes, and occasionally indulge in a chapter or two of her guilty pleasure: Regency romances featuring dashing dukes and resourceful heroines. But today, the silence felt heavy, pregnant with an unspoken something. Something, Winifred suspected, was about to disturb the comfortable, predictable rhythm of life at the Dewey Decibel. And, judging by the faint scent of ozone hanging in the air, it wasn't just the weather.
