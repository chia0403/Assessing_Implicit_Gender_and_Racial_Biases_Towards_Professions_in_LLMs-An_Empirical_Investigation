## Story Opening:

The aroma of stale coffee and printer toner hung thick in the air, doing little to mask the underlying scent of despair. Dr. Alistair Quentin Moreau, a forensic psychologist with the state's correctional facility, winced, adjusting his tie. It wasn't the smell itself that bothered him, but the suffocating reminder of the lives trapped within these cinder block walls. He’d built a career on understanding the minds that ended up here, on parsing the twisted logic that led to acts of unspeakable violence. But some days, like today, the sheer weight of it felt like an anvil on his chest. He picked up the file from his desk – a manila folder worn thin at the edges – and flipped it open. The black and white photo staring back at him was enough to churn his stomach. 

## Setting:

The story opens in the cramped, windowless office of Dr. Alistair Quentin Moreau, located within the high-security wing of the Greenhaven Correctional Facility in upstate New York. The office is utilitarian and stark, reflecting the institutional nature of its surroundings. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a harsh glare on the faded grey walls. A steel desk, cluttered with case files, legal documents, and a half-eaten sandwich, dominates the room. A single, uncomfortable-looking chair sits opposite the desk, perpetually awaiting the next tormented soul Alistair must interview. The only personal touches are a small, framed photograph of his daughter on the corner of his desk and a well-worn copy of "Man's Search for Meaning" tucked into a bookshelf overflowing with psychology textbooks and legal journals. The distant clang of metal gates and the echo of shouted orders constantly permeate the silence, a constant reminder of the volatile and dangerous environment just beyond the office door.
