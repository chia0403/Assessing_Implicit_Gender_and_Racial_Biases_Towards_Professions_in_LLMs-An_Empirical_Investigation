**Setting:** The air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket woven with the scent of motor oil, burnt rubber, and day-old coffee. Inside "Grease Monkeys," a single, buzzing fluorescent light valiantly fought against the encroaching twilight outside. The garage, located on the outskirts of dusty Redemption, Arizona, was a chaotic symphony of mismatched tools scattered across oily concrete, a hulking engine hoist suspended above a perpetually disassembled Ford F-150, and calendars featuring scantily clad women strategically obscuring dents in the walls. This was a place where broken dreams and busted carburetors came to be fixed, or at least temporarily patched up with duct tape and crossed fingers.

**Opening:**

Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window as Bartholomew "Bart" Abernathy wrestled with a seized lug nut on a beat-up '67 Mustang. Sweat beaded on his brow, plastering strands of auburn hair to his forehead. He grunted, the sound lost in the rhythmic clang of a hammer against a breaker bar. "Come on, you stubborn son of a..." he muttered, his breath catching in his throat with each strained push. He wasn't just trying to remove the tire; he was battling the weight of a day that had started with a flat tire of his own, escalated with a flooded carburetor on Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning Buick, and was now threatening to end with this rusting relic refusing to cooperate. Bart, a man whose hands were more comfortable holding a wrench than a fortune, just wanted to go home, crack open a cold beer, and forget about the mechanical misfortunes that seemed to cling to him like grease. But fate, as it often did in Redemption, had other plans. A chime from the front desk signaled a new arrival, and Bart, with a sigh that could power a small engine, knew his evening was just getting started.
