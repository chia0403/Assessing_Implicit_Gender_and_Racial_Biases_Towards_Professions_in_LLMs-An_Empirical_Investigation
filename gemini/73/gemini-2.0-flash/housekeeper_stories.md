The floral-scented air hung thick and still in the entryway, a cloying sweetness that always made Consuela Maria Rodriguez sneeze. She held her breath, balancing a bucket brimming with soapy water and a precarious tower of folded towels, and slipped past the massive marble statue of a nymph clutching a perpetually dripping urn. This was her daily gauntlet, a test of agility and lung capacity before the real work even began.

The setting was Stonehaven Manor, a sprawling, Gothic behemoth perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the jagged Cornish coastline. Built in the 1880s by a shipping magnate with more money than sense, it was a monument to opulence and eccentricities. Turrets scraped the sky, gargoyles leered from every corner, and the interior was a labyrinth of echoing halls and dust-filled drawing rooms. The current owners, the reclusive and equally eccentric Blackwood family, seemed determined to let the place crumble around them, a slow, steady decay that Consuela fought against with every swipe of her feather duster. Stonehaven was more than just a job for her; it was a challenge, a whispered promise that she could hold back the encroaching tide of neglect, at least for a little while longer.
