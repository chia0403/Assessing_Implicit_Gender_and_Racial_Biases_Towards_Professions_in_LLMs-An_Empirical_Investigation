The scent of stale coffee and lemon-scented disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail that always signaled the start of another Monday at Maplewood Elementary. Miss Eleanor Abigail Fairbanks, a woman whose floral-print dresses and perpetually kind smile belied a fierce determination to mold young minds, sighed softly as she adjusted the stack of freshly graded spelling tests on her desk. Sunlight streamed through the window of her brightly decorated classroom, illuminating posters proclaiming the importance of kindness and the wonders of the alphabet. Outside, the familiar sounds of early morning – the chugging of the school bus, the excited shouts of children, the rhythmic scrape of Mrs. Rodriguez sweeping the sidewalk – began to build, a cacophony of youthful energy that Eleanor found both invigorating and slightly overwhelming. Today, more than any other day, she needed to be on her A-game. Today was the day Mr. Henderson, the notoriously grumpy Principal, was scheduled to observe her second grade class. And she had a feeling, a prickle of unease at the back of her neck, that today was going to be... interesting.
