The August sun beat down on the asphalt shingles like a vengeful god, turning the roof of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian house into a sizzling skillet. Sweat dripped from the brim of Elijah Theodore "Eli" Corbin's worn baseball cap, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn, curled-up shingle. He cursed under his breath, a silent prayer for the cool breeze that had been promised but never seemed to arrive.

The setting was Harmony Creek, a small, picturesque town nestled in the rolling hills of Pennsylvania. Harmony Creek was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, and gossip spread faster than kudzu. Its charm lay in its quaint, well-maintained houses, most dating back to the late 1800s, each with its own unique architectural character. This made Eli a busy man; old houses, especially their roofs, required constant attention. Mrs. Henderson's house, painted a dignified shade of lilac with intricate gingerbread trim, was one of the grandest in town, but its age was starting to show, and Eli knew this wasn't just a simple patch job. This was a full-on re-roofing, a sweaty, backbreaking endeavor that would take him the better part of the week. He just hoped he could finish before the late summer thunderstorms decided to roll in and turn his workspace into a slippery, dangerous nightmare.
