The biting wind howled a mournful dirge, lashing against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Alistair Humphrey Cavendish's study. Outside, the Northumberland coast was a roiling tempest of grey and white, the waves crashing against the jagged cliffs with the force of a battering ram. Inside, however, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the oak-paneled walls lined with leather-bound volumes. Alistair, a man whose youthful exuberance had been tempered by years of medical school and the grim realities of rural practice, sat hunched over his cluttered desk, a half-empty glass of scotch sweating beside him. The flickering lamplight illuminated the fine lines etched around his kind, hazel eyes and the silver already threading through his otherwise dark, neatly trimmed hair. He was a man out of place, a product of Eton and Oxford thrust into a world of craggy fishermen, stoic farmers, and the ever-present threat of the sea. He preferred the sterile precision of his operating theatre, the logical deductions of diagnosis, to the untamed power of nature that surrounded him. But here he was, the only doctor for miles, responsible for the health and well-being of this isolated community, and tonight, that responsibility weighed heavily on his shoulders. A telegram, its thin paper crinkling in his hand, lay open before him, the stark black ink screaming its message: "URGENT. ELIZA STONE UNWELL. COME IMMEDIATELY. STONE COTTAGE, NORTHCOVE."
