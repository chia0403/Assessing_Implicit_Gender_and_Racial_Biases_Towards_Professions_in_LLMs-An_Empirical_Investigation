The sterile, minty air of "SmileBright Dental" hung heavy, a desperate attempt to mask the real scent of fear and decay that clung to every chair. Eleanor Rose Ainsworth, impeccably dressed in her starched, pale blue uniform, ran a gloved hand along the cool, stainless steel tray. She double-checked her instruments â€“ the ultrasonic scaler, the explorer, the suction tip, each gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights.

Eleanor, despite working here for five years, still got a small knot of anxiety in her stomach before her first patient of the day. Mrs. Higgins, notorious for her tightly-lipped resistance to flossing and her equally tight-fisted opinions on everything from fluoride to government conspiracies, was scheduled for 9:00 AM. Eleanor sighed internally. Today was going to be a long one. The digital clock on the wall blinked 8:57 AM. She took a deep breath, reminding herself of her purpose. Clean teeth, healthy gums, one patient at a time. She just had to survive Mrs. Higgins first.
