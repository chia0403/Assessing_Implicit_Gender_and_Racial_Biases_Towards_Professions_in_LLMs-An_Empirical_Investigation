The biting November wind, smelling sharply of damp leaves and impending snow, rattled the ancient windows of Room 203. Ms. Genevieve Eleanor Ainsworth, a history teacher at Northwood High, shivered despite her thick, cable-knit cardigan. She chalked a bold "1848" onto the blackboard, the dust motes dancing in the anemic afternoon light. Outside, the sky was the color of old dishwater, mirroring the lukewarm interest radiating from the twenty-three students sprawled before her. Genevieve sighed, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic tapping of someone's pen and the rustling of crumpled notebook paper. Sheâ€™d been staring at the same faces for the past ten weeks, trying, and often failing, to ignite a spark of curiosity about the French Revolution, or the Industrial Revolution, or, hell, anything beyond the latest TikTok trend. Northwood High, a brick behemoth built in the 1920s, stood on the edge of the rapidly declining mill town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania. The town, once a vibrant hub of industry, was now a patchwork of boarded-up storefronts and pawn shops, its glory days long gone, leaving behind a lingering scent of disillusionment and a population clinging to the faded promise of a better future. And within the worn walls of Northwood, Genevieve felt increasingly like a relic, a keeper of stories no one wanted to hear anymore. This year, more than ever, the apathy seemed to be seeping into her very bones.
