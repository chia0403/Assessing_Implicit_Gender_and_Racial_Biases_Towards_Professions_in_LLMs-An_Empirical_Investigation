The sickly sweet scent of burnt popcorn clung to the air, a persistent reminder of last night's disastrous screening of "Space Hamsters 7: Return of the Squeak." Reginald "Reggie" Perkins sighed, his breath misting slightly in the chilly air-conditioned lobby of the Galaxy Multiplex Cinema. Outside, the Atlanta sun beat down with the ferocity of a thousand stage lights, but in here, amidst the plush velvet ropes and discarded candy wrappers, it was perpetually early morning.

Reggie, all five-foot-eight of him crammed into a faded blue janitorial uniform that threatened to swallow him whole, gripped his industrial-sized mop a little tighter. He hated popcorn, hated sticky floors, and secretly loathed the entire Galaxy Multiplex, a hulking chrome and neon beast that never seemed to sleep. He much preferred the quiet solitude of his small apartment, filled with the comforting weight of his encyclopedic collection of vintage science fiction novels. But bills were bills, and the Galaxy Multiplex, with its endless supply of spilled soda and forgotten dreams, paid them. This morning, though, even the promise of a paycheck couldn't quite shake the feeling that today was going to be different. Maybe it was the lingering popcorn smell, maybe it was the unsettling quiet, or maybe, just maybe, it was the faint humming sound emanating from Theater Seven, the one where "Space Hamsters 7" had so spectacularly flopped.
