Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the main character's full name and profession:

**Opening:**

The scent of hay, damp earth, and something vaguely resembling wet dog clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, the familiar aroma a comfort against the biting November wind that whipped through the gap in the barn door. Outside, the world was a monotone canvas of grey sky and skeletal trees, but inside, the animals hummed with life, a symphony of soft snuffles, contented chews, and the occasional impatient stomp. Amelia pulled her thick wool scarf tighter, her breath misting in the air as she surveyed her domain. Something wasn't quite right.

**Setting:**

The story takes place at *Havenwood Animal Sanctuary*, a sprawling, slightly ramshackle farm nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York. Havenwood is a haven for neglected, abandoned, and otherwise unwanted animals. It consists of:

*   **The Main Barn:** A large, weathered structure divided into stalls for horses, cows, goats, and sheep. It's drafty and smells strongly of hay and manure, but Amelia does her best to keep it clean and comfortable.
*   **The Chicken Coop and Duck Pond:** Located a short distance from the main barn, this area houses a variety of fowl, some rescued from factory farms and others simply abandoned as unwanted pets.
*   **The Small Animal Building:** A smaller, more insulated building where Amelia cares for rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, and dogs, some awaiting adoption, others permanent residents due to disabilities or behavioral issues.
*   **Amelia's Cottage:** A cozy, one-bedroom cottage a short walk from the main barn, where she lives a simple but fulfilling life surrounded by her animal companions.
*   **The surrounding land:** Miles of pasture and wooded areas, offering space for the animals to roam and providing a beautiful, albeit sometimes harsh, backdrop to their lives. Havenwood is somewhat isolated, requiring a significant drive down winding country roads to reach the nearest town.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne
*   **Profession:** Animal Caretaker and Sanctuary Manager at Havenwood Animal Sanctuary. She is responsible for the day-to-day care of all the animals, including feeding, cleaning, administering medication, and providing enrichment. She also manages the sanctuary's finances, coordinates with volunteers, and oversees adoptions.
