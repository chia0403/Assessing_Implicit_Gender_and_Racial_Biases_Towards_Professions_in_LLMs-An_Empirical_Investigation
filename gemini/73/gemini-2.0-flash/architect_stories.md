The wind howled like a banshee, clawing at the meticulously rendered sketches spread across Eleanor Vance's drafting table. Rain lashed against the enormous, floor-to-ceiling windows of her temporary office, turning the towering skyline of Neo-Kyoto into a blurred, Impressionist painting. This was *not* how she’d envisioned the evening going. A quiet night with a bottle of chilled sake, poring over the final blueprints for the Kuroda Museum of Ceramics. Instead, she was battling a rogue typhoon and trying to ensure her precious drawings – representations of months of painstaking work – didn't become origami by accident.

Eleanor Vance, thirty-four years old, and already a rising star in the world of architectural design, wasn't easily intimidated, but the sheer ferocity of the storm was unnerving. She tugged her thick, woolen sweater tighter around her, the faint scent of lavender clinging to the fibers, a comforting reminder of her small apartment back in Chicago, a world away from this sleek, futuristic metropolis.

Her temporary workspace was located on the penthouse level of the Kuroda Corporation's headquarters, a glass and steel behemoth that seemed to dare the storm to do its worst. The space, normally reserved for visiting dignitaries, was minimalist to a fault. Polished concrete floors echoed the drone of the building's emergency generators, and the only decoration was a single, perfectly formed bonsai tree struggling to maintain its composure in the face of the storm.

Eleanor straightened, a familiar surge of determination coursing through her. She wasn't going to let a little weather – even a Category Five typhoon – derail her. The Kuroda Museum was her magnum opus, the project that would cement her place among the greats. She just needed to secure those drawings…and maybe find a stronger paperweight.
