Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a guidance counselor named Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez:

**Setting:**

The air in the guidance office of Northwood High School hung thick with the faint scent of dried-up whiteboard markers and teenage anxiety. Sunlight, filtered through the blinds, cast striped patterns across the worn, institutional carpeting, doing little to alleviate the feeling of perpetual dusk. Framed posters promoting college preparedness and mental wellness adorned the walls, their brightly colored slogans offering a silent, almost mocking, contrast to the emotional turmoil that often swirled within these four walls. Stacks of pamphlets about everything from scholarship applications to dealing with social pressures overflowed from the corner of Esme's desk, threatening to topple at the slightest tremor. The rhythmic tick-tock of the outdated wall clock served as a constant reminder of the relentless passage of time, each second a fleeting opportunity to make a difference in a student's life.

**Story Opening:**

Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, Northwood High's resident guidance counselor, stifled a yawn as she scrolled through yet another college essay about the transformative power of summer camp. Honestly, how many epiphanies could one kid have while braiding friendship bracelets? The late afternoon sun was casting long shadows across her desk, and the list of students waiting to see her seemed to stretch into the infinite. A persistent throbbing had taken root behind her left eye, a familiar companion during application season. Just as she was about to close the laptop and reach for her lukewarm cup of coffee, a hesitant knock echoed from the doorway. "Come in," she called, forcing a bright, welcoming smile onto her face. The door creaked open, revealing a figure she hadn't seen in her office before: a quiet, withdrawn boy with a messy mop of dark hair and a nervous energy that practically vibrated off him. Esme recognized him immediately, despite having never spoken to him directly. This was Leo Maxwell, the subject of whispered rumors and concerned glances from teachers. He was a puzzle Esme hadn't yet had the chance to unpack, and something about the urgency in his downcast eyes told her that puzzle was about to explode.
