The low hum of the fluorescent lights in the Metropolitan Probation Office on Grand Avenue vibrated through every bone in Sergeant Eleanor Vance's body. It was a symphony of bureaucratic drudgery, a constant, low-level thrum that mirrored the anxiety churning in her gut. 8:57 AM. Three minutes to go. Three minutes until the first of her parolees would be shuffling through the chipped doorway, bringing with them their baggage, their excuses, and the ever-present risk of relapse. The air hung thick with stale coffee and the faint, lingering scent of disinfectant, a futile attempt to sanitize the chaos that permeated the building. Eleanor, a woman built like a sturdy oak and weathered like one too, adjusted her glasses, the cheap frames pinching the bridge of her nose. Outside, the cityscape of Chicago was a vibrant tapestry of grit and ambition, a stark contrast to the confined world of her office â€“ a space defined by hope, despair, and the Sisyphean task of trying to keep people on the right side of the law. Today, however, felt different. An unnerving premonition, like static on an old radio, buzzed at the edge of her awareness. It wasn't just the usual Monday morning dread. Something was coming. And Eleanor Vance, with twenty years on the force and a heart as calloused as her hands, knew better than to ignore it.
