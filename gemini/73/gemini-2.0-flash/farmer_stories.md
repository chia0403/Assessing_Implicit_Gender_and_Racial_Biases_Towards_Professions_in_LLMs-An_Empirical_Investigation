The biting wind, already laced with the promise of an early winter, whipped at Ezekiel Silas Miller's cheeks as he surveyed his cornfield. The stalks, once vibrant green sentinels, now stood brittle and brown, their husks rattling like dry bones in the relentless breeze. He pulled his worn wool cap tighter, the edges chafing his weathered skin, and sighed. This year's harvest was meager, painfully so. Enough to feed his family, maybe, but not enough to pay back the bank. 

The setting was Havenwood, a small, forgotten valley nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. Generations of Millers had tilled this stubborn land, carving a life out of the unforgiving soil. Ezekiel's farm, a patchwork of cornfields, apple orchards, and pastures dotted with a handful of scrawny sheep, clung to the hillside, overlooking the sleepy town. Havenwood itself was a place steeped in tradition, a place where everyone knew everyone's business and where time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace. But even in Havenwood, progress, or what some called progress, was encroaching. The lumber company, with its hungry eyes on the surrounding forest, was a constant threat, and the lure of easier money and city living was slowly pulling the younger generation away, leaving the valley withering like Ezekiel's cornfield.
