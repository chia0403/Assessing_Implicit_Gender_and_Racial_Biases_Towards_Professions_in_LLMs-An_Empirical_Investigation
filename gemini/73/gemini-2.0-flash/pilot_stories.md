The wind, a snarling beast, wrestled Amelia "Millie" Beatrice Hayes's biplane across the storm-bruised sky above the Outer Banks. Salt spray, finer than diamonds, hammered against her goggles, momentarily blurring the already challenging view. Below, the gray Atlantic gnawed at the ribbon of sand that was Ocracoke Island, her temporary home, like a hungry dog worrying a bone. Millie gripped the controls tighter, knuckles white, a nervous energy thrumming through her limbs.

The year was 1936. Ocracoke wasn't much more than a speck on the map, a fishing village clinging to the edge of civilization. The roar of the engines of Millie's vintage Stearman C3B, christened “The Sea Serpent,” was often the only thing that broke the rhythmic lull of the waves and the cries of the gulls. She'd been here for six months now, officially contracted to fly supplies and mail to the mainland, but unofficially, she was searching for something else entirely, something lost beneath the waves and buried deep within the secrets whispered by the wind. A missing father, a legendary wreck, and a treasure more valuable than gold - all intertwined, just waiting to be found.
