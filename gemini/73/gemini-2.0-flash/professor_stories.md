## Story Opening:

The chipped, ceramic mug warmed Professor Alistair Finch's hands, but did little to thaw the gnawing unease that had settled in his gut. He stared out the rain-streaked window of his office, the grey November sky mirroring the mood inside him. The familiar scent of old paper and pipe tobacco usually offered comfort, a nostalgic balm against the pressures of academia, but today it only served as a weak distraction. It wasn't the looming deadline for his manuscript on Early Modern Cartography, nor the demanding students filling his office hours with increasingly outlandish requests. No, this feeling was different, heavier, laced with a peculiar dread that he couldn't quite explain. He took a slow sip of his Earl Grey, the bergamot a sharp counterpoint to the dull ache behind his eyes. He just knew, with a certainty that bordered on the unsettling, that something was about to change.

## Setting:

The story is set within the hallowed, gothic confines of **St. Augustine's College, Oxford**. Alistair's office, located in the oldest section of the library, is a testament to a life dedicated to scholarship. Towering bookshelves, crammed with leather-bound volumes and crumbling maps, line the walls. A heavy oak desk, cluttered with manuscripts, research notes, and a half-dissected globe, dominates the room. Sunlight, when it deigns to penetrate the perpetually overcast English skies, streams through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Augustine, casting colorful patterns on the worn Persian rug beneath his feet. The air is thick with the scent of aged paper, pipe tobacco, and the faint mustiness of centuries-old knowledge. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation, academic rigor, and a subtle undercurrent of forgotten histories that whisper from the very stones of the ancient building.
