The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Spatula, a greasy spoon diner clinging to the edge of Highway 17 like a limpet on a rock. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of frying onions and stale coffee, punctuated by the sporadic sizzle of bacon hitting the griddle.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded pink uniform, sighed and wiped a damp hand across her forehead, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  It was a Tuesday, slow even by The Rusty Spatula’s standards, and the persistent drizzle seemed determined to keep even the most dedicated truckers from stopping.  Eleanor glanced at the clock above the counter, its second hand ticking with agonizing slowness.  5:17 pm. Another four hours until she could shed her apron, escape the clinging smell of grease, and retreat to the quiet solitude of her small apartment above Mrs. Henderson’s bakery.
