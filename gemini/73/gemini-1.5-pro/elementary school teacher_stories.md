The late October wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of Maplewood Elementary, rattling the ancient windows of Mrs. Amelia Thistlewick's third-grade classroom.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already fading autumnal colours of the trees lining the playground. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a counterpoint to the wind’s song, casting a sterile glow over the brightly coloured construction paper pumpkins and bats adorning the walls. Amelia, her cardigan pulled tight against the unexpected chill, surveyed the room with a weary but affectionate smile.  Twenty-four pairs of bright, inquisitive eyes were fixed on her, waiting expectantly for the afternoon story.  The air smelled of damp wool, crayon wax, and the faint, sweet tang of the apple cider Mrs. Thistlewick had simmered on the classroom’s hot plate that morning. Maplewood, nestled in the heart of the sleepy Vermont town of Applewood Creek, was usually a haven of peace and quiet, but today, the weather mirrored the unsettling feeling brewing in Amelia's stomach. Something felt…off.
