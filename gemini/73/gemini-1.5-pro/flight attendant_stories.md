The stale, recycled air hummed a monotonous tune inside the cabin of Flight 427 from Chicago O'Hare to Reykjavik. Amelia "Amy" Reyes smoothed down the wrinkles of her navy blue uniform skirt, a practiced gesture she'd perfected over five years of soaring through the stratosphere.  Outside, the sky was a bruised purple, the last vestiges of a Midwestern sunset bleeding into the encroaching twilight.  Inside, fluorescent lights buzzed, casting a sterile glow on the sleepy faces of passengers settling into their seats. Amy adjusted the small, silver wings pinned to her lapel, a familiar weight that always grounded her, even thousands of feet above the earth. Tonight, however, a prickle of unease danced beneath her skin. It wasn't the usual pre-flight jitters; it was something colder, something that whispered of a storm brewing not in the atmosphere, but somewhere far deeper, somewhere hidden within the secrets of the passengers she was about to serve.  The boarding process was nearing completion, and as the last stragglers shuffled down the aisle, Amy caught the glint of something metallic tucked beneath the worn leather jacket of a man with eyes as dark and turbulent as the approaching night.
