The biting wind whipped around Dr. Alistair Finch, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the edges of his thick tweed coat.  He pulled his collar higher, the rough wool scratching against his skin, and squinted through the swirling snow at the ramshackle barn that clung precariously to the hillside.  The late November sky above the Scottish Highlands was a bruised purple, threatening more snow.  The only sound besides the wind was the frantic bleating of a sheep, thin and reedy, echoing from within the barn.  Alistair stamped his feet, trying to dislodge the icy clumps that clung to his boots, and muttered, "Right then, let's see what trouble we have tonight."  The air smelled of damp earth, pine needles, and, faintly, the metallic tang of blood.  Crofthead Farm was isolated even by Highland standards, miles from the nearest village, and Alistair knew from experience that whatever awaited him in that barn wouldn't be simple.
