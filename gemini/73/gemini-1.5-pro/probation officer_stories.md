The relentless Florida sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air thick and heavy.  Cicadas buzzed a frantic symphony from the live oaks lining the perimeter, their song a counterpoint to the low rumble of traffic on nearby US-1.  Inside, the Delray Beach Probation Office felt like a refrigerated cave, a stark contrast to the sweltering world outside.  Eleanor Vance Holloway, a woman with eyes the colour of faded denim and a perpetually tight bun, sat at her desk, the fluorescent lights reflecting harshly off her wire-rimmed glasses.  Stacks of files threatened to engulf her workspace, a papery testament to the sheer volume of lives she monitored.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich sat forlornly on a paper plate, forgotten amidst the chaos.  This Thursday morning had already brought two no-shows, a positive drug test, and a frantic phone call from a judge demanding an updated report on a repeat offender. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray lock of grey hair behind her ear.  She had a feeling this day was only going to get worse.
