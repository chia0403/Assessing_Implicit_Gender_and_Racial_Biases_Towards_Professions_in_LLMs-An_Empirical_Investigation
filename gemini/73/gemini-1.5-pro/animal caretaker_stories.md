The biting wind whipped Elara Thistlewick's auburn braid across her cheek, stinging even through the thick wool of her scarf.  Dawn hadn't quite broken over the sprawling, frost-kissed fields of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, painting the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges.  Elara, clad in her worn, olive-green parka and sturdy boots, trudged through the knee-high snow towards the wolf enclosure, a plume of her breath trailing behind her like a ghostly white ribbon. The air, crisp and sharp with the scent of pine and damp earth, vibrated with the distant, mournful howl of a lone timber wolf, a sound that both thrilled and saddened her in equal measure.  Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, was a sanctuary for animals who could no longer survive in the wild, and Elara, the head caretaker, considered it her life's work to ensure their comfort and well-being. Today, however, held a particular weight in her heart â€“ the arrival of a rescued arctic fox, a creature as fragile and elusive as the first snowfall of winter.
