The salt spray kissed Amelia Thorne’s face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her rented cottage porch.  Seafoam Green, the realtor had called the paint colour, though Amelia suspected it had once been a cheerful turquoise, bludgeoned into submission by years of Atlantic gales.  Perched precariously on the edge of the dramatic cliffs of Howth, Ireland, the cottage boasted a view that could steal the breath from a seasoned sailor, let alone a romance novelist like Amelia.  Below, the Irish Sea churned and roiled, a restless beast gnawing at the rocky shore. The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, mirrored the turmoil in Amelia's soul.  Her latest manuscript, "The Earl's Elusive Embrace," lay discarded on the wicker table inside, the crisp white pages now curled and damp from the ever-present sea mist.  She’d come to Howth seeking inspiration, a cure for the crippling writer's block that had clung to her like the damp Irish air.  Instead, she'd found only the echo of her own doubts, amplified by the mournful cry of the gulls.
