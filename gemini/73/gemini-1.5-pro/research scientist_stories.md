The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  The sun, a pale ghost in the perpetually twilight sky, cast long, distorted shadows across the jagged expanse of the Erebus Ice Tongue.  Evelyn, her breath clouding the air before her, adjusted the heavy thermal gloves encasing her hands and surveyed the scene.  The prefabricated research station, Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, loomed in the distance, a cluster of interconnected modules resembling a giant metal insect clinging to the unforgiving ice.  For six months, this desolate, windswept landscape would be Evelyn's home, her laboratory, her entire world.  She was here to study the strange anomalies detected deep beneath the ice, anomalies that defied conventional scientific explanation and hinted at something extraordinary, something potentially world-altering.
