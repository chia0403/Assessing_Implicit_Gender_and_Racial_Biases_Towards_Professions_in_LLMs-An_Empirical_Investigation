The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Rose Hawthorne as she wrestled with a length of BX cable, its armored skin slick with freezing rain.  Perched precariously on the third rung of her aluminum ladder, she could see the whole of Port Blossom laid out beneath her: the shingle-clad houses huddled together against the coming winter, the skeletal fingers of the fishing pier reaching out into the churning grey Atlantic, and the lighthouse, its beam a feeble stab against the gathering dusk. Amelia swore under her breath as the wind snatched the cable again, nearly pulling her off balance. This wasn't how she'd envisioned spending her Tuesday afternoon.  She was supposed to be rewiring Mrs. Henderson's attic, a simple, dry, indoor job.  Instead, she found herself battling the elements, trying to restore power to the town's Christmas tree â€“ a towering spruce perched atop the windswept cliff overlooking the harbor.  And Christmas, much to Amelia's chagrin, was still three weeks away.
