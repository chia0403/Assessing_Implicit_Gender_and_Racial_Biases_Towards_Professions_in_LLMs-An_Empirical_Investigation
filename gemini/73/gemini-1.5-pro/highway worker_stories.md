The sun, a malevolent orange eye low on the horizon, baked the asphalt of Interstate 40 until it shimmered like water.  Heat haze danced above the cracked surface, distorting the view of the endless New Mexico desert stretching out on either side.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of reddish brown, whirled across the scrubland, occasionally venturing onto the highway itself, momentarily blinding drivers with grit.  The air, thick with the smell of hot tar and diesel fumes, crackled with the static of approaching thunder.  This was Amelia Reyesâ€™s office, her kingdom of rumble strips and flashing arrow boards.  Today, Amelia, clad in a fluorescent orange vest that practically glowed in the oppressive light, wrestled with a recalcitrant jackhammer, its rhythmic pounding a counterpoint to the distant rumble of thunder.  Her task: break up a section of particularly stubborn concrete for repaving.  Sweat plastered strands of her dark hair to her forehead, and her safety glasses were smeared with a mixture of dust and sunscreen.  She hadn't seen another vehicle in over an hour, a blessing and a curse in this desolate stretch of highway.
