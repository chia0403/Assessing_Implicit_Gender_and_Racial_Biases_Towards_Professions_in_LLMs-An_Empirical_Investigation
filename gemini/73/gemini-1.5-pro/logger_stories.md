The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the towering pines, whistling a mournful tune that echoed through the Clearwater National Forest.  Frost crunched under the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood as he trudged through the pre-dawn darkness, his breath puffing out in ghostly white plumes.  The air, crisp and smelling of pine resin and damp earth, held a stillness broken only by the distant rumble of the logging truck making its way up the winding mountain road.  Jedâ€™s thermos, clutched tight in his gloved hand, offered the only warmth in a world rapidly turning from grey to the bruised purple of a winter sunrise. He paused at the edge of the clearing, a vast expanse of frosted ground where giants once stood, now littered with the remnants of yesterday's felling:  a tangle of branches, sawdust, and the lingering scent of freshly cut wood.  This was Jed's domain, a place both brutal and beautiful, where he wrestled a living from the heart of the Idaho wilderness. The whine of the approaching truck grew louder, signaling the start of another day in a life etched in the rough grain of timber and toil.
