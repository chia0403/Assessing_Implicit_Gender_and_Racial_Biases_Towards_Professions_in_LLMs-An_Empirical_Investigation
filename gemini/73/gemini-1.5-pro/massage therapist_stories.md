The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly green glow across the rain-slicked street. Inside "Kneadful Things Massage," the scent of lavender and eucalyptus fought a losing battle against the damp, musty odor clinging to the worn velvet drapes. Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the view of the deserted Gas 'N' Grub across the street.  Elara Juniper Finch, LMT, sighed, kneading her own tense shoulders.  It was a slow Tuesday night in Harmony Creek, Oregon, the kind of night where the only sound louder than the rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner, a morbidly cheerful reminder of the minutes draining away, unpaid.  Elara glanced at the clock â€“ 8:53 pm. Seven more minutes until she could officially call it a night and lock up.  Seven minutes until she could escape the oppressive quiet and the nagging feeling that something was about to happen.
