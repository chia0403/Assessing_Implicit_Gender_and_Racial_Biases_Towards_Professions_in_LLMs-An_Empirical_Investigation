The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, stinging Amelia "Amy" Reyes's cheeks despite the thick knit scarf wrapped around her face.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, spiralling towards the ramshackle structure that clung precariously to the hillside. This was Radio Repeater Station Charlie-7, Amy's lonely domain for the next six months.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and ozone, punctuated by the rhythmic hum and click of the vast array of equipment that lined the walls.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, clinical glow on the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the sun was beginning its slow descent, painting the vast, empty landscape in hues of burnt orange and deep purple.  Amy tightened her grip on the heavy toolbox, the metal cold against her gloved hand. Tonight, the silence would be broken only by the crackling static of the long-wave radio and the howl of the wind.  Tonight, she was alone, 200 miles from the nearest town, and something was interfering with the signal.
