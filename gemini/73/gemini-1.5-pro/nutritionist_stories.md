Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Thorne's small, but impeccably organized, office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The aroma of ginger and lemon, usually a comforting presence diffused from her essential oil burner, felt suffocating tonight.  Amelia Thorne, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, prided herself on her calm demeanor, her ability to guide clients through the choppy waters of dietary change.  But tonight, the normally serene harbor of her practice on the windswept, seaside town of Port Blossom, Oregon, felt more like the eye of a hurricane.  Her last client, a perpetually frowning bodybuilder obsessed with obscure protein powders, had just stormed out, declaring Ameliaâ€™s advice "hogwash."  The clock ticked towards 7 pm, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain, and Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. The small town, normally a haven of quaint shops and friendly faces, felt oppressive tonight, closing in on her.
