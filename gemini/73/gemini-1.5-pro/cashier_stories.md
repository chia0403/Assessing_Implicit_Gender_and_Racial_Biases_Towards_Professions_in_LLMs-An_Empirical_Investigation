The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Reyes.  Outside, the New Mexico desert stretched in all directions, a vast expanse of ochre and burnt sienna punctuated by the occasional gnarled juniper. Inside, Amelia’s world was considerably smaller, confined to the cramped cashier’s booth of the only gas station/convenience store for fifty miles in either direction.  The air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, hot dogs rotating endlessly on greasy rollers, and the faintly chemical perfume of the pine-scented air freshener dangling precariously from the rearview mirror of a dusty Ford Bronco parked out front.  It was a Tuesday, a slow Tuesday, the kind where the only customers were tumbleweeds chased across the highway by the desert wind.  Amelia chewed on the end of her pen, idly watching the second hand on the wall clock tick its slow, agonizing path towards her five o’clock break.  Little did she know, the monotony was about to be shattered.
