The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  Elias, with his salt and pepper hair neatly slicked back and a permanent half-smile etched on his face, adjusted the headrest for the incoming customer.  His shop, "Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour," sat nestled between a dusty antique store and a perpetually bustling bakery on Oakhaven Avenue, the main thoroughfare of the sleepy town of Alder’s Bend.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating the swirling patterns of dust motes dancing in the air, the worn leather of the waiting chairs, and the gleaming array of razors, clippers, and scissors hanging on the wall like gleaming surgical instruments.  Alder’s Bend, population barely tipping over 1,200, wasn't known for much, but it was known for Elias and his steady hand with a straight razor.  This Wednesday morning, however, felt different.  A thick fog had rolled in overnight, clinging to the town like a damp shroud and muting the usual cheerful sounds of the morning commute.  The air crackled with a strange energy, an unsettling stillness that had even the bakery across the street unusually quiet.  Elias, wiping his hands on his crisp white apron, couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change.
