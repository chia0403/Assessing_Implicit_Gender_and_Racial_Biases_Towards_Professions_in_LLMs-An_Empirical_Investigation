Rain lashed against the single, grimy window, blurring the already bleak November landscape into a watercolour wash of grey. Soggy leaves plastered themselves against the glass like desperate pleas for entry, mirroring the emotional state of the students who shuffled in and out of Eleanor’s cramped sanctuary.

The irony wasn't lost on Eleanor, who, at that particular moment, felt anything but bright. The pungent aroma of instant ramen, emanating from a forgotten lunch container under a student’s discarded backpack, permeated the air, a testament to the tight budgets and even tighter schedules that defined life in this small, struggling town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains.
