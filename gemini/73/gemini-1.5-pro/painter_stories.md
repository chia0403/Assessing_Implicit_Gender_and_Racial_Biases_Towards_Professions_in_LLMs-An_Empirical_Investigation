The biting November wind whipped through the cobbled streets of Montmartre, carrying the scent of roasted chestnuts and the melancholic strains of an accordion.  Flakes of snow, hesitant at first, began to pirouette down from the iron-grey sky, dusting the rooftops and the already-frosted branches of the sycamore trees lining the Place du Tertre.  In a small, attic studio overlooking the square, illuminated by the weak northern light and the flickering glow of a kerosene lamp,  Genevieve Aurelie Dubois stood before her easel, her breath clouding the air in front of the canvas.  Her fingers, stained with cerulean and crimson, tightened around a well-worn brush.  The painting before her, still in its early stages, depicted the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, its white domes almost ethereal against the gathering storm, but Genevieve's focus wasn't on the majestic building.  It was on the lone figure huddled beneath its steps, a figure she had seen there every day for a week, wrapped in a threadbare shawl, a silent sentinel against the grandeur of the basilica.
