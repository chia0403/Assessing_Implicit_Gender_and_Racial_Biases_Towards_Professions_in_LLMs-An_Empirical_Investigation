The insistent London drizzle seemed determined to seep through the cracks in the aging brickwork of Beatrice Amelia Thorne's studio, a converted stable tucked away in a cobbled mews just off Portobello Road.  Bea, as everyone called her, shivered, pulling her oversized cashmere cardigan tighter around her.  The scent of damp wool and the faint, metallic tang of rain mingled with the aroma of the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe brewing in her French press.  It was a Thursday morning in late November, the kind of morning that felt both cozy and oppressive, a perfect reflection of the creative block that had held her captive for the past week. Her Mac glowed invitingly, displaying a half-finished logo design for a new artisanal cheese shop, but the elegant Gouda font just didn't feel *right*.  Outside, the muffled sounds of the market setting up – the clatter of stall frames, the rumble of delivery vans, and the melodic cries of vendors – usually invigorated her, but today they merely added another layer to the pervasive sense of unease that had settled over her like a damp blanket. Something was off, and it wasn't just the cheese logo.
