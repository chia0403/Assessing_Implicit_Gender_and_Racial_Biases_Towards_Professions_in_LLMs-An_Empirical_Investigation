The fluorescent lights of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Michael Scott’s “World’s Best Boss” mug against his desk.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the Scranton Business Park’s desolate parking lot.  Eleanor Vance Pritchett, regional paper salesperson extraordinaire (or so she liked to believe), stared out at the deluge, a deep sigh escaping her lips.  Another Tuesday. Another day of battling indifference, navigating Michael’s cringe-worthy antics, and trying to convince clients that, yes, they *did* need that extra ream of premium-weight copy paper.  Today, however, felt different.  A knot tightened in Ellie's stomach, a feeling of unease that had nothing to do with the looming sales quota and everything to do with the unmarked manila envelope that had appeared on her desk just before lunch.
