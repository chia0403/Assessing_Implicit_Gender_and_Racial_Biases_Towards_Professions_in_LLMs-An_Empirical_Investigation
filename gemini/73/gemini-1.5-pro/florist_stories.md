The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a sound Eliza Jane Wilder found infinitely more soothing than the incessant honking outside on Bleecker Street. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and daffodils displayed there.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and the subtle sweetness of Eliza's signature rose-and-lavender potpourri.  The small shop, nestled between a bustling Italian deli and a dusty antique bookstore, was Eliza's sanctuary, a pocket of fragrant tranquility in the chaotic heart of Greenwich Village.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late April, the kind of day that promised the imminent arrival of spring, even if the weather hadn't quite gotten the memo yet.
