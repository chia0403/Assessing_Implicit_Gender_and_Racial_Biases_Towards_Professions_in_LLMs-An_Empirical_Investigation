Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating a whirlwind of finger-paint masterpieces in progress, block towers teetering on the brink of collapse, and a chorus of shrieks and giggles that echoed off the brightly colored walls.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, knelt amidst the controlled chaos, mediating a heated dispute over a particularly shiny red toy truck. Outside, the crisp October air rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree that gave the daycare its name, hinting at the approaching chill of winter. Bumblebrook, nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Alder Creek, Oregon, was usually a haven of peace, but inside, it was perpetually springtime â€“ a season of vibrant energy and constant growth.
