The biting November wind whipped off the East River, tugging at the edges of Amelia Hayes’s charcoal grey scarf.  She hunched deeper into her tailored coat, the crisp wool doing little to ward off the chill that seemed to seep into her bones.  New York City, usually a symphony of honking cabs and chattering pedestrians, was subdued beneath a blanket of pre-snow gloom.  Amelia, however, felt a flicker of excitement, a nervous energy that pulsed beneath her apprehension.  Across the churning water, the skeletal frame of the Roosevelt Island Lighthouse, a stark silhouette against the bruised sky, stood sentinel over the abandoned smallpox hospital – her canvas.  Amelia Hayes, architect extraordinaire (at least in her own mind), had been tasked with transforming the crumbling relic into a state-of-the-art museum and research facility.  It was her biggest project to date, a chance to make her mark on the city's skyline and, hopefully, finally step out of the shadow of her notoriously successful father. The ferry horn blared, a mournful sound that echoed the doubts swirling in her stomach. This wasn't just bricks and mortar; this was history, a place steeped in suffering and resilience. Could she do it justice? Could she breathe new life into these forgotten walls?
