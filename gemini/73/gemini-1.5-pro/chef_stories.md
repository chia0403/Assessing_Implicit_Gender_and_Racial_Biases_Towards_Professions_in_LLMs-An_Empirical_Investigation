The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Ainsworth's ankles as she hurried down Rue Cler, the scent of roasting chestnuts vying with the briny tang of the nearby Seine.  Her chestnut-brown hair, usually pinned neatly beneath her chef's toque, had escaped its confines and now danced around her face in unruly curls.  Eleanor clutched a bulging canvas bag overflowing with fragrant herbs and vibrantly colored vegetables procured from the bustling market stalls.  Her destination:  "Le Papillon Bleu," her tiny, but increasingly renowned, bistro tucked away in a quiet alley just off the bustling street, a hidden gem in the heart of Paris's 7th arrondissement. Inside, the warmth of the kitchen beckoned, promising a sanctuary from the chill and the canvas for Eleanor's culinary artistry.
