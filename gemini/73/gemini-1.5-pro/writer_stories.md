The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Cornish coast a soothing counterpoint to the frantic tapping of keys echoing from within her small cottage.

Inside, amidst stacks of books, overflowing ashtrays, and half-finished mugs of tea, Amelia wrestled with the opening chapter of her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the very village she called home. The wind howled around the eaves, a mournful sound that mirrored the rising tension within the story, and within Amelia herself.
