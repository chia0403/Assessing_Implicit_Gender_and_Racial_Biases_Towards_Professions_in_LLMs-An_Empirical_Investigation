The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Reyes, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  Gargoyles perched atop the gothic revival building leered down at her, their frozen expressions mirroring the tight knot in her stomach.  Built in 1888, the hospital, nestled in the heart of the historic district of Port Blossom, Maine, exuded an old-world charm that belied the cutting-edge medicine practiced within its walls.  The air, thick with the scent of salt and decaying leaves, held a melancholic stillness, broken only by the distant foghorn moaning from the harbor.  Amelia pulled her threadbare wool coat tighter around her and glanced at the luminous dial of her watch.  6:58 AM.  Two minutes until her shift started in the bustling Emergency Department, where calm was a fleeting luxury and chaos the reigning monarch.  Today, however, a different kind of unease settled over her.  Something feltâ€¦off.
