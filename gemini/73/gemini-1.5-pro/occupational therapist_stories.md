The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of brine and damp cedar.  Rain lashed against the windows of the cozy Craftsman home, a rhythmic counterpoint to the quiet clinking of ceramic mugs.  Inside, the warm glow of lamplight painted a comforting scene: a fire crackling merrily in the hearth, a half-finished jigsaw puzzle sprawled across the coffee table, and the aroma of cinnamon-laced apple cider hanging heavy in the air.  This was Eleanor Vance's sanctuary, her respite after long days spent navigating the intricate landscape of human lives, piecing together broken routines and rediscovering lost abilities. Eleanor, a registered occupational therapist with a decade of experience, found solace in the quiet predictability of her evenings, a stark contrast to the often unpredictable nature of her work at the Evergreen Rehabilitation Center. Tonight, however, the storm brewing outside seemed to foreshadow a disruption to her carefully constructed calm.  A frantic knock at the door, sharp and insistent against the backdrop of the wind and rain, sent a shiver of anticipation – or perhaps apprehension – down her spine.
