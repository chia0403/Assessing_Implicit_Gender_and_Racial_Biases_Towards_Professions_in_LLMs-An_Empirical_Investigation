The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Yukon Territory, carrying with it the sting of ice crystals and the low rumble of distant machinery. Dawn painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and hesitant orange, barely illuminating the frozen landscape.  Temperatures hovered around twenty below, turning exhaled breath into fleeting ghosts.  This was Agnes Amelia Blackwood’s office, a vast, snow-covered plateau overlooking the nascent gold mine at Thistle Creek.  Perched in the heated cab of her Komatsu D575A-3 Super Dozer, the largest bulldozer in the world, Agnes felt a familiar thrum of power beneath her. The massive machine, a behemoth of steel and hydraulics, dwarfed even the towering spruce trees scattered across the frozen terrain.  Today, her task was to carve a path through the permafrost, a frozen artery leading to the heart of the Klondike's newest – and possibly richest – gold deposit.  Agnes adjusted her thick knit cap, her breath misting the inside of the cab. It was going to be a long day.
