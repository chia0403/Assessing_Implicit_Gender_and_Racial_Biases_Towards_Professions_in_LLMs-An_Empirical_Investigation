The clatter of trams and the cries of street vendors formed a familiar symphony outside Elias Thorne's cramped tailor shop.  Nestled between a bustling fishmonger and a perpetually dusty antique shop on Grimshaw Lane, the shop, "Thorne's Threads," was a pocket of quiet industry in the heart of New Birmingham.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that sliced through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating bolts of richly coloured fabrics stacked precariously high against the wall.  Elias, his silver thimble glinting on his index finger, meticulously stitched the final button onto a midnight-blue waistcoat, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the gas lamps flickered to life, painting the cobbled streets in a warm, orange glow, heralding the approach of dusk and the secrets it held within the sprawling metropolis.
