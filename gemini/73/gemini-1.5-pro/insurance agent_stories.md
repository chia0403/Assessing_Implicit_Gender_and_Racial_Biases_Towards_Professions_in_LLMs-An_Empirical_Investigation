The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on Mrs. Henderson's mailbox, seemed to leer at Arthur Finch as he trudged up the cracked concrete path. The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange disc sinking behind the clapboard houses of Oakhaven, Illinois, cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the humid air. Arthur adjusted his tie, the polyester clinging uncomfortably to his damp shirt collar.  He hated house calls, especially on swelteringly hot July days like this, but Mrs. Henderson was insistent.  She'd called his office at Finch & Sons Insurance no less than six times that week, fretting about her prize-winning begonias and the supposed inadequacy of her homeowner's policy in the event of a hailstorm.  Arthur sighed, a puff of hot air escaping his lips.  This was going to be a long one.
