The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, stinging Amelia Thorne's cheeks and turning her fingers clumsy inside her fingerless gloves.  Grey cliffs, streaked white with guano, plunged dramatically into the churning, iron-grey sea below. The air, thick with the salty tang of seaweed and the cries of unseen gulls, vibrated with a raw, untamed energy.  Amelia, perched precariously on a windswept outcrop of rock on the remote island of Foula, Shetland, braced herself against the gusts, her Canon EOS R5 clutched tightly in her numb hands.  This, she thought, as a rogue wave exploded against the rocks below, sending a spray of icy mist skyward, was exactly the kind of desolate beauty she craved.  She was here to capture the essence of the island, its wild spirit, its defiant isolation, for her upcoming exhibition, "Edges of the World."
