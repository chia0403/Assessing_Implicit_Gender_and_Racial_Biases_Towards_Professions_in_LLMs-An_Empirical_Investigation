The biting wind whipped at Captain Elias "Eli" Thorne's turnout coat as he surveyed the scene.  Broken glass crunched under his boots, reflecting the flickering orange glow cast by the inferno consuming the old Majestic Theatre.  Flames licked at the ornate, crumbling facade, once a beacon of art and culture in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine.  Now, only a skeletal framework remained, the velvet curtains and plush seats reduced to ash.  Thick, acrid smoke billowed into the pre-dawn sky, painting the low-hanging clouds a sickly yellow.  The air vibrated with the roar of the fire and the frantic shouts of Eli's crew battling the blaze.  He squinted through the swirling smoke, a knot of unease tightening in his gut.  This fire was behaving strangely, too hot, too fast, for a building largely constructed of wood and brick.  Something wasn't right.
