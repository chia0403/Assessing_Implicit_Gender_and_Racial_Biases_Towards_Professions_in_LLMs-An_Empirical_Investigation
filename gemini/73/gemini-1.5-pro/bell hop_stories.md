The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of warm, jasmine-scented air onto the bustling Chicago street. Rain slicked the pavement, reflecting the neon glow of the marquee that proclaimed the hotel's name in elegant, cursive script.

Whispers of lavish parties and clandestine meetings filled the air, a symphony of clinking champagne glasses and hushed conversations weaving through the opulent lobby. Archibald, barely nineteen and fresh off the farm, felt utterly adrift in the sea of silk and diamonds, his starched uniform a stark contrast to the finery surrounding him. He clutched a telegram in his sweaty palm, its contents a cryptic message that had arrived only moments ago, addressed to a guest whose very name sent shivers down his spine.
