The neon glow of the "Finch Investigations" sign, barely visible through the downpour, cast a lurid green sheen across the water-streaked glass.  Inside, the only illumination came from a single desk lamp, pooling its light over Silas's worn mahogany desk, cluttered with half-empty coffee cups, crumpled cigarette packs, and a scattering of faded photographs.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale tobacco and desperation, a familiar aroma in Silas Finch's corner of 1940s Los Angeles, a city teeming with broken dreams and even more broken people.  He sat hunched over a chipped porcelain ashtray, the embers of his cigarette glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom, his fedora pulled low over his brow.  The ringing telephone sliced through the silence, its insistent jangle an unwelcome intrusion on his contemplation of the rain-slicked streets below.
