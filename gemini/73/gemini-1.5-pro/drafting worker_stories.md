The flickering fluorescent lights of the Darrow & Sons Drafting office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Holloway's Tuesday afternoon.  Dust motes danced in the anemic sunlight filtering through the grime-streaked windows that overlooked the perpetually congested I-95 in Providence, Rhode Island.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the slightly metallic tang of blueprint ink. Amelia, hunched over her drafting table, meticulously rendered the cross-section of a bridge abutment with a 2H pencil, the graphite whispering against the textured vellum. The rhythmic scratch was the only sound that broke the oppressive quiet, save for the occasional sigh escaping her lips as she wrestled with a particularly tricky angle.  Outside, the world rushed by, a blur of steel and glass, but within the confines of her small cubicle, time seemed to stretch and distort, each minute measured by the steady progress of her pencil across the page.  This was Amelia's world: a world of precise lines, exacting measurements, and the quiet satisfaction of bringing grand designs to life, one painstaking detail at a time.  But on this particular Tuesday, something was about to disrupt the predictable rhythm of her existence.
