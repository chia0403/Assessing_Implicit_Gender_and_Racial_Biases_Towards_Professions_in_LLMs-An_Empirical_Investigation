The biting November wind whipped off the East River, plastering Amelia "Amy" Reyes's thick, dark hair across her face. She tugged a wool beanie further down, its edge catching on the headphones clamped over her ears, blasting Vivaldi’s “Winter” concerto.  Ignoring the sting of the cold and the cacophony of city noise bleeding through the music, Amy focused on the scene unfolding before her. From her perch on a fire escape above Delancey Street, the vibrant chaos of the Lower East Side pulsed beneath a bruised, pre-dawn sky.  Steam curled from overflowing garbage bags, neon signs flickered their final breaths of the night, and a lone vendor set up his fruit stand, the rhythmic thump of his knife slicing through mangoes a counterpoint to Vivaldi's strings. This was her canvas. This was the opening shot of "Manhattan Rhapsody," the film that Amy hoped would finally catapult her from indie darling to bona fide cinematic force.
