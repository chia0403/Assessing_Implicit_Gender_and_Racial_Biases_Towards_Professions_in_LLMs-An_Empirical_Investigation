Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned cannery, a relentless metallic drumming that mirrored the tension knotting Dr. Elias Thorne's stomach. The air hung thick and cold, heavy with the cloying sweetness of decay. Rusted machinery loomed like skeletal giants in the flickering beams of his flashlight, casting distorted shadows that danced across the grime-covered concrete floor.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, pulled his collar higher around his neck.  He wasn't accustomed to crime scenes this raw, thisâ€¦visceral. He preferred the sterile environment of his office, the detached analysis of case files, the comforting distance between himself and the brutality of the act. But this was different.  This was personal. The Sheriff had specifically requested him, Dr. Elias Thorne, by name.  And the reason why chilled him to the bone more than the November wind whistling through the broken windows of the cannery.
