The rusty scissors, affectionately nicknamed Snippy by Elias Thorne, snicked rhythmically, punctuating the humid air of the Magnolia Street Barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that sliced through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a tableau of faded glory.  The shop, nestled between a perpetually closed pawn shop and a laundromat humming with the relentless drone of spin cycles, was a relic of a bygone era in the small, sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Georgia.  Elias, a man whose own salt-and-pepper hair was meticulously styled, surveyed his latest masterpiece – a perfectly sculpted flattop on young Timmy Jenkins – with a critical, yet ultimately satisfied, eye.  Outside, the cicadas buzzed their relentless summer song, a backdrop to the quiet drama unfolding within the barbershop’s faded green walls.  The air, thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, held a secret, a tension that had nothing to do with haircuts and everything to do with the stranger who had just walked through the door.
