Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the neon-drenched cityscape of Neo-Kyoto.  The forty-second floor offered a breathtaking view, usually. Tonight, it was just a swirling canvas of grey and electric blue. Inside, the apartment was a stark contrast to the chaos outside. Minimalist and meticulously organized, the space hummed with the low thrum of servers stacked against one wall, their blinking lights casting a ghostly glow across the polished concrete floor.  Elias, clad in a worn grey hoodie and fingerless gloves, hunched over a holographic display projected from his wrist-mounted computer.  Lines of intricate code scrolled past, a language only he seemed to fully understand. Tonight, he wasn't working on his usual freelance projects â€“ designing AI interfaces for corporate clients.  Tonight, he was chasing a ghost in the machine, a digital phantom that whispered of secrets buried deep within the city's interconnected network.
