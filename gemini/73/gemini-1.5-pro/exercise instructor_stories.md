The rhythmic thump of 80s synth-pop vibrated through the polished wooden floor of "Elevate," a boutique fitness studio nestled amidst the gleaming high-rises of downtown Chicago.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the churning grey waters of Lake Michigan, blurring the city lights into a hazy, impressionistic painting.

Her dark ponytail swung in time with the music as she surveyed the room, her sharp brown eyes scanning the faces of her dedicated (and slightly damp) clientele.  "Five, six, seven, eight, and pulse it out!  Feel that burn, warriors!"  Her voice, amplified and invigorating, cut through the driving beat.  Tonight's class, a high-intensity interval training session aptly named "Inferno," was nearly at its peak.  The air hung thick with the scent of sweat and determination, a testament to Amy's unwavering motivational prowess. But beneath her bright smile and infectious enthusiasm, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  Something felt…off.
