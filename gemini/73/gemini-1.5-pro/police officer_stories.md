Tonight, that darkness had spilled onto Pier 3, where a lone figure lay sprawled beneath the flickering glow of a security light.  Izzy's breath plumed in the cold air as she approached the body, her boots crunching on the frost-covered concrete.  The scene was eerily quiet, save for the distant groan of a foghorn and the rhythmic slap of waves against the pilings.  This was Izzy's city, and tonight, it was whispering a story she was determined to hear.
