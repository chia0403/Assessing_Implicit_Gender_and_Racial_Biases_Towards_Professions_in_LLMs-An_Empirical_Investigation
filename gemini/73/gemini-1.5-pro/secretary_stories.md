The rhythmic clatter of typewriter keys punctuated the otherwise stagnant air of the Grimshaw & Sons Legal Offices.  Eleanor Vance, with her perfectly coiffed auburn hair and a pencil perpetually tucked behind her ear, barely registered the noise anymore.  It was the soundtrack to her existence.  The office, located on the fifth floor of a pre-war building on a quiet, tree-lined street in Boston's Back Bay, exuded an air of faded grandeur.  Dark wood paneling, heavy velvet drapes the color of dried blood, and the pervasive scent of aged paper and pipe tobacco spoke of a bygone era, a time when secrets whispered in hushed tones held more power than shouted pronouncements.  This Tuesday, however, felt different. A thick fog clung to the streets outside, muting the usual morning cacophony, and an unsettling stillness had settled over the office, a stillness that prickled the hairs on the back of Eleanor's neck.
