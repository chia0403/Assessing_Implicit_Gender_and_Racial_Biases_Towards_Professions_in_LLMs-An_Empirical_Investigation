The biting November wind whipped sawdust into Elias Thatcher's eyes as he wrestled a warped cedar plank onto his workbench. The small coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, was hunkering down for winter, and the air held the sharp tang of salt and impending snow.  Grey shingles, weathered by sea spray and time, clad the tightly packed houses that lined the harbor, their windows glowing warmly against the deepening twilight.  Elias's workshop, a ramshackle shed nestled behind his modest two-story home on the edge of the docks, offered little protection from the chill. The only light came from a bare bulb hanging precariously from the rafters, casting long, dancing shadows across the rough-hewn walls, cluttered with tools and half-finished projects.  Tonight, Elias was working on a particularly intricate commission: a miniature replica of the town's beloved lighthouse, a Christmas gift for the aging lighthouse keeper.  The tiny structure, barely a foot tall, was taking shape on his workbench, a testament to his meticulous craftsmanship and deep connection to the sea that provided both his livelihood and solace.
