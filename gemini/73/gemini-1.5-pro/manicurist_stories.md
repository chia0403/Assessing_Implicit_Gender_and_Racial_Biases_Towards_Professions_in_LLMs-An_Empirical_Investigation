The fluorescent hum of the "Happy Nails" sign buzzed like a trapped insect, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Cartwright's cuticle nippers.  Outside, the late afternoon sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the Magnolia Plaza strip mall, baking the air thick and heavy with the scent of exhaust fumes and stale churros. Inside, the air was cool and thick with the chemical tang of acrylic and acetone. Eliza Jane, perched on her rolling stool, meticulously shaped a client's almond-shaped nails, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Magnolia Plaza wasn't exactly Rodeo Drive, but it was Eliza Jane's corner of the world, and she ruled it from behind her small, immaculately organized manicure station.  The peeling, flamingo-pink wallpaper and slightly off-key wind chimes that tinkled whenever the door opened were as familiar to her as the lines on her own palm.  This Tuesday, however, felt different. A low thrum of unease vibrated beneath the surface of the usual Tuesday afternoon lull, a feeling Eliza Jane couldn't quite put her finger on.
