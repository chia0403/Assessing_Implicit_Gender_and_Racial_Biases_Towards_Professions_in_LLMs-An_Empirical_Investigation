The rusty squeak of the ceiling fan was the only sound competing with the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's fingers on the adding machine. Outside, the humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Amelia's office, tucked away on the second floor of the Charleston Tea Plantation's main building, was a sanctuary of order amidst the sprawling chaos of the estate. Ledgers lined the shelves, meticulously organized by year, each page filled with Amelia's precise, looping script.  Sunlight, filtered through the plantation shutters, cast long shadows across the polished wooden floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the otherwise still air. It was July 1923, a time of flapper dresses and whispered secrets, but in Amelia's world, numbers reigned supreme, offering a comforting predictability in a world that felt increasingly uncertain.
