The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of snow and stale beer, and rattling the oversized window of Dr. Elias Thorne’s chiropractic clinic.  Inside, the “Adjustments and Alignment” neon sign buzzed softly, casting a flickering crimson glow across the waiting room.  It illuminated dust motes dancing in the air and the slightly frayed edges of the inspirational posters extolling the virtues of spinal health.  The clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Polish bakery on Milwaukee’s south side, wasn't much to look at. But for Elias, it was home, or at least as close to it as he'd gotten since leaving Green Bay five years ago. The only sound besides the wind and the buzzing sign was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging with a hypnotic monotony.  It was 7:58 pm on a Tuesday, two minutes before closing time, and Elias was already envisioning a quiet evening with a microwaved burrito and a rerun of his favorite crime drama.  That was before the bell above the door jingled, announcing an unexpected, and potentially problematic, late arrival.
