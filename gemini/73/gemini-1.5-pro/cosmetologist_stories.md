The biting November wind whipped around Genevieve "Gen" Dubois, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes along the cracked sidewalks of Vieux Carré.  She tucked a stray strand of her vibrant purple hair behind her ear, the chill seeping through her stylishly distressed denim jacket. Gen clutched her oversized, faux-leather satchel closer, its contents – a well-worn copy of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and a half-eaten beignet – offering little comfort against the sudden drop in temperature. Above her, wrought-iron balconies overflowed with tangled ivy, casting intricate shadows across the faded pastel hues of the French Quarter buildings.  It was a Tuesday, typically a slow day at "Le Papillon," the vintage-inspired salon Gen owned and operated on Rue Royal.  But today, a strange uneasiness prickled at her skin, a feeling as unsettling as the persistent scent of jasmine and decay that hung heavy in the air.  Something was different, something was…off.
