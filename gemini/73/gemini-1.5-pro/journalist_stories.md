Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Chronicle's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered desks and overflowing ashtrays.  Crumpled newspapers, coffee-stained and smelling faintly of stale ink, littered the floor. The air hung thick with the scent of cheap instant coffee and impending deadlines. Amelia, a stringer with a nose for a story and a penchant for trouble, tapped a bitten-down nail against her chipped mug.  Bay City, California, in the fall of 1978, wasn't exactly a hotbed of international intrigue, but tonight, something felt different.  A chill, deeper than the damp coastal air, snaked its way down her spine.  The phone rang, a jarring trill in the otherwise quiet room. It was the kind of ring that meant bad news, or a damn good story.  Maybe both.
