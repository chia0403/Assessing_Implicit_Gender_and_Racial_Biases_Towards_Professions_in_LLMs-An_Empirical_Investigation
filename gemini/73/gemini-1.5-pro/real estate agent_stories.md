If she could flip this behemoth, her name would be on everyoneâ€™s lips, solidifying her place amongst the city's elite agents.  The key finally clicked, the heavy gate creaking open with a mournful groan, as if warning her away.  Amy ignored it, her ambition a far louder voice than any rusty hinge.
