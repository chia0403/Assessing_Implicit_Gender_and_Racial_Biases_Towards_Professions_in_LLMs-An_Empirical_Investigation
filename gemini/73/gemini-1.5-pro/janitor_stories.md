The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped insects, their sickly glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floors. Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his cleaning cart down the deserted hallway. The air hung heavy with the antiseptic tang of bleach and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling, that clung to the back of his throat. It was well past midnight, the only sounds the rhythmic squeak of his cart’s wheels and the distant hum of the building’s ventilation system. Zenith BioTech, a sprawling complex nestled amidst the rolling hills just outside of Alder Creek, Oregon, prided itself on its cutting-edge research, pushing the boundaries of genetic engineering. Elias, however, primarily concerned himself with ensuring the gleaming sterility of the labs after the scientists had retreated to their homes, leaving behind their world of microscopes, petri dishes, and secrets he couldn’t begin to comprehend.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A prickle of unease ran down Elias’s spine, a feeling he couldn’t shake, that something was profoundly wrong.
