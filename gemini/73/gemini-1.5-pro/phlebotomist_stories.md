The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist.  It was 6:00 am, the pre-dawn quiet broken only by the rhythmic beeping of IV pumps and the hushed murmur of nurses exchanging reports.  Outside, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to etch itself against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky, the skeletal silhouettes of skyscrapers hinting at the bustling metropolis waking beneath.  Amelia, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white lab coat, pushed her phlebotomy cart down the deserted corridor of the oncology ward, the squeak of its wheels echoing in the stillness. The air hung heavy with the antiseptic scent that permeated every corner of the hospital, a smell Amelia had long since ceased to notice, replaced by the more nuanced, often bittersweet, scents of hope and despair that clung to the air in this particular wing.  Today, her first patient was a little girl in room 304.
