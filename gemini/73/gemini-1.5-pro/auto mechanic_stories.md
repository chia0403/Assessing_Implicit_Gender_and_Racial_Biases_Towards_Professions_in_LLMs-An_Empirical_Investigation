The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Pick-A-Part salvage yard, rattling the rusted hoods of the long-deceased vehicles.  Flakes of snow, prematurely born and destined to melt before hitting the ground, danced in the swirling gusts.  Eleanor Vance, her name embroidered in faded pink cursive on her grease-stained overalls, hunched deeper into her worn flannel jacket. Her breath plumed out in white puffs as she surveyed the engine compartment of a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, her calloused fingers tracing a line of corrosion along the intake manifold. The air, thick with the metallic tang of rust and the faint sweetness of decaying antifreeze, was Eleanor's preferred perfume. This chaotic graveyard of forgotten metal wasn't just her workplace; it was her sanctuary, a place where she could lose herself in the intricate puzzle of pistons, gears, and wires.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the yard, transforming the hulks of metal into slumbering giants.  A crow cawed from its perch atop a disemboweled Cadillac, the sound echoing in the desolate quiet.  Eleanor knew she had maybe an hour of daylight left to find what she needed â€“ a specific carburetor for a '67 Mustang, a promise she'd made to a nervous teenager saving up for his first car.  And Eleanor Vance never broke a promise.
