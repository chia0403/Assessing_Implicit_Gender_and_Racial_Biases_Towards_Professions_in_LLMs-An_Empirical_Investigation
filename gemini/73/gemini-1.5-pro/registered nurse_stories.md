The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital Emergency Room hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors and the occasional pained groan echoing from behind curtained cubicles. The air, thick with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant and the subtle metallic scent of blood, crackled with a nervous energy. It was 11:57 pm on a Tuesday, the kind of night where the city outside slept soundly, oblivious to the dramas unfolding within these sterile walls.  Eleanor Vance, RN, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, revealing the slight lines of exhaustion etched around her hazel eyes.  Sheâ€™d been on her feet for twelve hours straight, and the double shift was starting to take its toll.  Still, her movements were precise and efficient as she reviewed the chart of a newly admitted patient, a young boy with a suspected concussion.  Outside, a siren wailed, its mournful cry signaling another arrival, and Eleanor braced herself.  The night was far from over.
