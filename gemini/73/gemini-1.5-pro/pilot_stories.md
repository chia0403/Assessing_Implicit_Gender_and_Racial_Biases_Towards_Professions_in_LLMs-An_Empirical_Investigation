The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's parka as she wrestled the pre-flight checklist against the gale.  Snow crunched under her heavy boots, the sound swallowed by the thrum of the idling de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver.  The sky above Denali National Park was a bruised purple, hinting at the imminent dawn struggling to break through the perpetual twilight of late November.  Frozen spruce trees clawed at the horizon, their skeletal branches dusted with a fresh layer of snow that glittered like crushed diamonds under the plane’s wing-mounted landing lights.  Ace, her breath clouding the frigid air, ran a gloved hand along the Beaver’s worn fuselage, a familiar ritual that offered both comfort and a silent prayer to the machine that was her lifeline in this unforgiving wilderness. This morning's flight was particularly precarious – a mercy mission to a remote research outpost nestled deep within the unforgiving Alaska Range, carrying vital medical supplies and a replacement generator.  The weather reports crackled with warnings of impending blizzards and treacherous crosswinds, but the desperate plea from the isolated scientists left Ace with no choice.  She climbed into the cockpit, the familiar scent of aviation fuel and worn leather a welcome embrace.  This was her domain, her kingdom – the vast, unforgiving, and breathtakingly beautiful Alaskan wilderness.
