The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that matched the thrumming anxiety in Elias Thorne's chest.  The Mug sat hunched and solitary at the edge of Dustbowl, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Nevada desert, its only lifeline the shimmering black ribbon of highway that stretched endlessly towards a future nobody in Dustbowl seemed interested in reaching. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and despair.  Elias, his salt and pepper hair plastered to his forehead by the humidity, wiped down the already spotless mahogany bar with a practiced hand. It was a Tuesday night, which in Dustbowl meant maybe two or three patrons nursing the same lukewarm beer for hours.  Tonight, however, even that meagre company was absent, leaving Elias alone with the flickering neon sign advertising "Coldest Beer in Town" â€“ a bold-faced lie in a town where the ice machine had given up the ghost three summers ago.
