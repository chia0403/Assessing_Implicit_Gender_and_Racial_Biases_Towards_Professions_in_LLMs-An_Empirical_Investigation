The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery window.  Salt spray, frozen mid-air, clung to the glass like intricate lace.  The small fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled precariously between the unforgiving sea and the towering, slate-grey cliffs of the Yorkshire coast, was shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  December had arrived with a vengeance, bringing not only the shortest days of the year, but a chilling, unsettling quiet that settled deep in Elias's bones.  He stared out at the churning grey expanse, the rhythmic crash of waves a constant, almost hypnotic drone.  The only other sound was the faint, rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a stark reminder of the dwindling hours and the growing unease in his heart.  Something was different about Port Blossom this winter, a palpable shift in the familiar rhythm of the village, and Elias couldn't shake the feeling that it was a harbinger of something ominous.
