The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Wyoming plains, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Vance Holloway.  His weathered face, etched with the lines of a life spent under the unforgiving sun, remained impassive as he surveyed his land.  The Holloway Ranch, a sprawling tapestry of rolling hills, ochre-colored grasses, and the dark green smudges of pine forest clinging to the distant foothills of the Bighorn Mountains, stretched out before him.  It was a harsh, beautiful land, and Elias, all six foot four of him, stood as a testament to its enduring spirit.  The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the lone cottonwood that stood sentinel near the weathered, grey-planked ranch house.  Smoke curled lazily from its chimney, promising the warmth of a crackling fire and the comforting aroma of coffee brewing within.  But Elias wasn't heading home just yet.  Something was amiss.  The low, mournful bellow of a cow carried on the wind, a sound laden with distress that sent a shiver down his spine â€“ a shiver not from the cold, but from a deep-seated unease.
