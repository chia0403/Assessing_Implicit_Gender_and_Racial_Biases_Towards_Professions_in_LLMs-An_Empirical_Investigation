The biting November wind whipped at Elias Finch's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson leaves he was raking into a neat pile.  Frost crunched beneath his worn work boots as he surveyed Mrs. Henderson's sprawling backyard in the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut.  Towering oaks, their branches bare and skeletal against the pewter sky, dominated the landscape, casting long, melancholy shadows across the manicured lawn. A stone fountain, now silenced for the winter, stood as a centerpiece, a thin layer of ice clinging to the cherubic faces of the sculpted figures. Elias tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind his ear, the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves thick in the air. He had one last job to finish before the true grip of winter settled in â€“ preparing Mrs. Henderson's prized rose bushes for the coming freeze. And beneath the seemingly placid surface of Oakhaven, Elias knew something else was coming too, something colder and far less predictable.
