The biting November wind whipped around Evangeline "Eva" Moreau, plastering strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her threadbare scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chin as she surveyed the dilapidated Majestic Theatre.  Built in 1923, it had once been the jewel of downtown Aurora, Illinois, its marquee glittering with the names of vaudeville stars and silent film idols.  Now, chipped paint peeled from the facade like sunburnt skin, and the grand marquee advertised nothing but its own slow decay with a single flickering bulb illuminating the letter "M." Eva, however, saw not decay, but possibility.  Beneath the dust and disrepair, she saw the ghosts of applause, the echo of laughter, the potential for magic.  This was where she, Evangeline Moreau, would stage her comeback.  This was where she would prove, once and for all, that she wasn't finished.
