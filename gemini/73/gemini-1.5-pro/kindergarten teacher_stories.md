The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of safety scissors attacking construction paper.  Sunshine, filtered through the whimsical stained-glass depiction of a grinning caterpillar on the window, painted kaleidoscopic patterns across the tiny tables and chairs.  The air buzzed with the quiet industry of five-year-olds: the concentrated furrow of brows, the occasional triumphant giggle, the rustling of crayon boxes. Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Glade, seemed a picture of idyllic childhood.  But Mrs. Vance, with a prickle of unease she couldn't quite place, felt a subtle dissonance beneath the surface of this carefully constructed world of glitter glue and finger paint.  Something was off.
