Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's tiny office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the Berger & Kleinman law offices buzzed overhead, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming on the glass.  Files stacked precariously on her desk swayed slightly with each gust, threatening to topple like dominoes. Located on the 27th floor of a monolithic skyscraper in downtown Chicago, Amelia’s office, barely bigger than a walk-in closet, offered a breathtaking, if somewhat impersonal, view of the city – a view she rarely appreciated, especially on nights like this. Tonight, the glittering cityscape was obscured by a curtain of grey, swallowed by the storm.  It was 7:48 pm on a Friday, and Amelia was the only soul left in the office, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic clicking of her keyboard and the occasional, mournful groan of the ancient building. The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air.  The deadline for filing the Peterson brief was looming, a mere twelve hours away, and a crucial piece of evidence was still stubbornly elusive.
