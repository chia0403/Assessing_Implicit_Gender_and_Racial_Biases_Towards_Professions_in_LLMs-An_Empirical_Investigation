The wind howled a mournful ballad through the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, spitting pellets of ice against Elias Thorne's weathered face.  He squinted, the grey sky blurring into the equally grey granite cliff face he was currently scaling. Elias, all sharp angles and calloused hands, clung to the rock like a lichen, his iron pitons ringing against the stone with each upward thrust.  He was high above the valley floor, the clustered roofs of the village of Duskhaven a mere scattering of toy houses far below. His goal, a vein of shimmering moonstone, lay just another twenty feet above him, nestled in the heart of the mountain like a frozen teardrop.  The air was thin and biting, clinging to his lungs with icy claws, but Elias pressed on, driven by the vision of the luminous stone and the warmth of the forge waiting for him back in his workshop.
