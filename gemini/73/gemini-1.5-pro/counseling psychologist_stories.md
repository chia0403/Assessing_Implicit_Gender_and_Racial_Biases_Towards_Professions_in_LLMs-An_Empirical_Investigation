The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  Her office, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually felt warm and inviting with its plush armchairs, crackling fireplace, and the faint scent of lavender from the diffuser on her desk.  Today, however, a chill permeated the room, mirroring the unease that gnawed at Eleanor.  The empty chair opposite her, still bearing the imprint of her last client, seemed to amplify the silence.  The session had beenâ€¦ unsettling, to say the least. Mr. Hemlock, a new patient, had spoken of things that brushed against the edges of sanity, weaving a tapestry of paranoia and whispered fears that left Eleanor with a prickling sensation at the back of her neck.  The wind howled outside, sounding almost like a mournful cry, and Eleanor shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her.
