The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, clinging to Elias Thorne's trowel like molten licorice.  Heat shimmered off the corrugated tin roof of the old cannery, baking the small coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon, in a thick, fishy aroma. Below, the clang of fishing boats unloading their catches mingled with the cries of gulls and the distant, rhythmic thump of the waves against the jetty. Elias, sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead, adjusted his worn leather work gloves and squinted at the ragged line of the horizon, where the steel-grey Pacific met a bruised, lavender sky.  He knew a storm was brewing.  Not just the kind that rolled in off the ocean, but the kind that simmered beneath the surface of this quiet town, a storm that had been gathering for a long, long time.
