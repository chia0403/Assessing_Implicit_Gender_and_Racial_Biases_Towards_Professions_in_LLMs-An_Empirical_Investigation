The Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt, baking the air until it shimmered above the highway.  Eighteen-wheeler tires hummed a monotonous lullaby, a sound Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez knew as well as her own heartbeat.  Her Kenworth T680, nicknamed "The Wanderer," roared beneath her, its chrome gleaming like a beacon against the rust-colored desert.  Inside the cab, Amy adjusted her worn leather gloves, the turquoise rings on her fingers catching the light.  Mile marker 147 flashed past, another notch in the long, lonely stretch between Las Vegas and Reno.  Amy squinted at the shimmering horizon, a dust devil dancing in the distance, and wondered what this leg of the journey held.  Her CB radio crackled, spitting out static punctuated by snippets of trucker jargon, a familiar and strangely comforting soundtrack to her solitary existence.  This time, though, something felt different. The air hung heavy, not just with the desert heat, but with a sense of anticipation, like the calm before a storm.
