The rain hammered against the arched windows of the Hotel Magnifique, each drop a tiny explosion of sound against the backdrop of the Parisian night.  Inside, the lobby glittered, a sanctuary of polished marble and shimmering chandeliers.  Amelie Dubois, her name tag pinned neatly to her impeccably tailored midnight-blue uniform, surveyed the scene with an experienced eye.  It was just past ten on a Tuesday, the quiet hour between the pre-theatre rush and the late-night arrivals.  A single couple lingered by the fireplace, whispering over glasses of champagne, and a lone businessman tapped away on his laptop in the plush velvet armchair.  The air was thick with the scent of lilies and old money, the familiar perfume of the Magnifique.  Amelie, poised behind the polished mahogany of the concierge desk, adjusted the pearl earrings that were a gift from her grandmother and waited, a small, knowing smile playing on her lips. Tonight, she sensed, would be anything but quiet.
