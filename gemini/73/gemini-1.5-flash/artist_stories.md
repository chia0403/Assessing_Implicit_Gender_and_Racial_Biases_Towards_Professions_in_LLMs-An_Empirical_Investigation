The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's face as she wrestled her easel onto the unsteady deck of the *Sea Serpent*, the tiny fishing trawler groaning beneath the weight of the churning Atlantic.  The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped her auburn hair across her vision, threatening to snatch her palette – a riot of vibrant blues, greens, and angry greys – right into the unforgiving waves.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine, diesel, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – the lingering scent of the day's catch, a grim counterpoint to the breathtaking beauty of the storm-tossed coastline before her.  Sera, a landscape artist known for her breathtakingly realistic depictions of tempestuous seascapes, was in her element. Or rather, she would be, once she'd secured her easel and managed to avoid being swept overboard.  The jagged cliffs of Cornwall, their granite faces etched by centuries of wind and wave, clawed at the sky, a dramatic backdrop to the tempestuous drama unfolding before her.
