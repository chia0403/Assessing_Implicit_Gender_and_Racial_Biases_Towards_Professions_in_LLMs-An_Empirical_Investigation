The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a fine mist clinging to the lenses of his Leica M6 as he braced himself against the relentless wind.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and decaying seaweed, tasted of the approaching storm.  Below him, the jagged cliffs of the Île de Sein plummeted into a churning, grey Atlantic, the waves a frothing, angry mass that clawed at the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned lighthouse.  Elias, his worn leather jacket pulled tight against the chill, adjusted his tripod, the rhythmic click of the legs a counterpoint to the roar of the ocean.  This was it. The perfect, terrifying, utterly breathtaking moment he'd travelled thousands of miles to capture.  The storm, a wild, untamed beast, was his muse, and the Île de Sein, with its treacherous beauty, was his stage.
