The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her charcoal coat to her skin, mirroring the grimness settling in her gut.  The sprawling Victorian mansion, Blackwood Manor, loomed before her, a gothic behemoth silhouetted against the bruised twilight sky.  Its once-proud turrets were now chipped and stained, like decaying teeth, their elegance swallowed by an oppressive blanket of overgrown ivy and encroaching shadows.  Shattered glass glittered on the manicured lawn – a macabre confetti scattered around a pool of viscous, dark crimson that bled into the sodden earth.  The air hung heavy with the cloying sweetness of decaying lilies and the metallic tang of blood, a perfume of death that Mia, forensic psychologist for the Hampshire Constabulary, knew intimately.  This wasn't just another crime scene; this was a tableau, meticulously arranged, a twisted performance staged for an unseen audience.
