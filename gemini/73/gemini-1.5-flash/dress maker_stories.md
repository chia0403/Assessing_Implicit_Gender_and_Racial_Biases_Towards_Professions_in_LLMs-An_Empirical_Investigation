The scent of lavender and aged silk hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume clinging to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn wooden floors of Amelia Thistlewick’s atelier.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated panes of the tall, arched windows, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the shafts of light.  Outside, the relentless London rain hammered against the leaded glass, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle snip-snip-snip of Amelia’s scissors as she meticulously worked on a delicate lace overlay, the ivory fabric almost translucent against her nimble fingers.  Her shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the less fashionable part of Bloomsbury, was a haven of quiet creativity, a world away from the bustling, gas-lit streets outside.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, was completely oblivious to the storm raging beyond her sanctuary.  She was lost, as she often was, in the intricate dance of needle and thread, transforming simple fabric into breathtaking works of art.
