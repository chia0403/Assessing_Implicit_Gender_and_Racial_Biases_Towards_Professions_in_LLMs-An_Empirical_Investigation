The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a spectral shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of emerald grass and the glossy leaves of rhododendrons.  It was a damp, early October morning, the kind that seeped into your bones and made even the most ardent coffee lover crave a second, stronger cup.  Elias Thorne, owner and operator of Thorne Landscaping, wasn't an ardent coffee lover, but he was certainly craving something stronger than the lukewarm brew currently sloshing around in his thermos.  He grunted, a low rumble in his chest, as he wrestled a recalcitrant wheelbarrow laden with peat moss across the dew-slicked cobblestones of the estate's driveway. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, held a promise of crisp autumn days to come, but for now, Elias felt only the chill bite of the pre-sunrise hour.  His breath plumed briefly in the frigid air, a small white cloud against the backdrop of the sprawling, opulent houses.  Today's task: the complete overhaul of Mrs. Vandergelt's notoriously demanding rose garden.
