The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of lilies and roses, clinging to the damp cobblestones of Willow Creek Lane.  A fine drizzle, the kind that clung to everything like a whispered secret, plastered Amelia Katherine Hawthorne’s auburn curls to her forehead.  Amelia, or Amy as most people called her, shivered, pulling her worn denim jacket tighter around her as she unlocked the heavy oak door to “Petal Pushers,” her small but beloved flower shop.  The bell above the door jingled a melancholic welcome, its sound swallowed by the steady drumming of the rain against the leaded glass windows. Inside, the air was a vibrant contrast to the dreary outside, a riot of color and fragrance that promised warmth and escape.  Rows upon rows of vibrant blooms – from delicate orchids to robust sunflowers – filled the shop, their beauty a defiant act against the grey, weeping sky.
