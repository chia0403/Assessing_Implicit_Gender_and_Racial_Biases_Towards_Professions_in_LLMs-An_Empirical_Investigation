The fluorescent hum of the waiting room lights was a constant, low thrum against the backdrop of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's meticulously organized desk.  Amelia, or Millie as she preferred, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the pristine surface, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the muted chatter of patients shuffling in and out of Dr. Albright's office. Sunlight, fractured by the tall, art deco windows of the building, painted shifting patterns across the polished mahogany reception desk, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the otherwise immaculate air.  The scent of antiseptic and lilies – a strangely comforting combination – hung faintly in the air, a familiar aroma that had become the olfactory signature of her life for the past five years.  Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease, a subtle discord in the usual harmonious chaos of the waiting room, settled on Millie's shoulders like a stray feather.  It was a quiet Tuesday morning at the prestigious Albright Medical Clinic, and yet, something was terribly, unsettlingly wrong.
