The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled with a recalcitrant oak branch.  Fallen leaves, the colour of rust and decay, crunched under his worn boots, a brittle symphony accompanying the rhythmic rasp of the saw.  Elias, a man whose life was as deeply rooted in the earth as the ancient trees he tended, was groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The manor itself, a brooding silhouette against the bruised sky, seemed to exhale an air of melancholic grandeur, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the autumnal garden Elias tirelessly cultivated.  The sea’s relentless roar provided a constant, ominous soundtrack to his solitary work, a reminder of the untamed power that constantly threatened to reclaim this windswept corner of the world.
