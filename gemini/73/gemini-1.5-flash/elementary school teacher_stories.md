The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk felt familiar beneath her fingertips, a comforting roughness against the smooth, worn surface of her wedding ring.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Room 207 at Hawthorne Elementary, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous sprites.  Outside, the rhythmic screech of tires on asphalt battled with the shriller cries of children unleashed from the confines of their final afternoon lessons.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, chalk dust, and something vaguely floral – probably the wilting bouquet of sunflowers a particularly enthusiastic student had gifted her earlier that week.  It was the end of a long, exhausting, yet oddly satisfying Friday at Hawthorne, a place Eleanor had called her second home for the past fifteen years, a place etched into the very fabric of her being, despite its peeling paint and leaky roof.
