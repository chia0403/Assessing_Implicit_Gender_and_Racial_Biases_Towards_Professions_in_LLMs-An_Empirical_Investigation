The chipped porcelain sink wept a steady stream of lukewarm water, mirroring the persistent drizzle drumming against the leaded-glass windows of Blackwood Manor.  Agnes Periwinkle, her hands gnarled and red from years of scrubbing stubborn stains from antique surfaces, paused mid-wipe, the damp cloth forgotten in her grasp.
