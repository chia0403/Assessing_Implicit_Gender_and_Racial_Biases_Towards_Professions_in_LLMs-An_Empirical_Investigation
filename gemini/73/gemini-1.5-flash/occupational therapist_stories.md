The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from the grasp of the barnacle-encrusted piling.  The wind, a relentless, keening cry off the Atlantic, whipped her already damp hair across her eyes.  She squinted, the grey November sky mirroring the churning grey of the sea below.
