The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Davies’s hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher door closed.  Rain, sleeting with a viciousness that only a Michigan autumn could muster, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin.  The ambulance, its siren wailing a mournful counterpoint to the howling wind, lurched forward, its headlights cutting twin swaths through the near-whiteout.  Amelia gripped the side rail, her knuckles bone-white against the cold metal.  The flashing red and blue lights painted the swirling snow in strobing hues, illuminating the desolate landscape outside: a lonely stretch of two-lane highway, flanked by skeletal trees clawing at the bruised, grey sky. Ahead, the distant glow of a lone gas station offered a fragile promise of warmth and shelter, a stark contrast to the icy grip of the emergency unfolding in the back of the ambulance.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard Michigan; this was the raw, unforgiving heart of winter, and tonight, it was Amelia’s battleground.
