The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clung to the air, mingling with the pungent aroma of animal musk emanating from the barn's shadowed interior.  Pine needles, scattered by a recent storm, crunched under her worn boots as she navigated the muddy path leading to the weathered wooden structure.  Amelia, head zookeeper at the sprawling, somewhat ramshackle, Blackwood Zoological Sanctuary, shivered, pulling her thick woolen scarf tighter around her neck.  The sanctuary, nestled in the remote valleys of the Oregon Cascades, was a place of both breathtaking beauty and relentless, unpredictable weather â€“ a perfect reflection of the creatures she dedicated her life to caring for.
