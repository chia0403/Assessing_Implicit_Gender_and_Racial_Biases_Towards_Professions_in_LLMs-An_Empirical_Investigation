The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind that howled outside the window of her cramped office.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Amelia, a senior account executive at Stellar Solutions, a company that sold – to put it mildly –  dubiously effective productivity software to equally dubious clients, stared at the spreadsheet on her laptop screen.

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous dirge above her, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the cramped space cluttered with half-empty coffee cups and motivational posters that had long since ceased to motivate.  Outside, the city of Chicago grumbled, a concrete jungle shivering under the relentless assault of the storm, mirroring the turmoil in Amelia’s own professional landscape.  This month’s quota was a mountain, and she was still at base camp, miles from the summit, with only a lukewarm mug of coffee and a dwindling supply of hope for company.
