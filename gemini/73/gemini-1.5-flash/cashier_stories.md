The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Wednesday afternoon.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of artificially ripened bananas and the faint, metallic tang of stale coffee.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway stretching beyond the parking lot.  Amelia, twenty-two and perpetually tired, leaned against the chipped Formica counter, her gaze fixed on the swirling vortex of dust motes illuminated by the harsh overhead lights.  The only sound besides the hum was the rhythmic *click-whirr* of the ancient cash register, a relic of a bygone era that seemed to perfectly mirror her own feeling of being stuck in time.
