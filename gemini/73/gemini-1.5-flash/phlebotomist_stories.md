The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own heartbeat.  It was a sound she’d grown accustomed to, a constant companion throughout her ten years as a phlebotomist.  Tonight, however, the usual calm predictability of the evening shift felt…off.  A tension, thick and cloying like the antiseptic smell clinging to the air, hung heavy in the air of the nearly deserted phlebotomy lab.  Amelia, wiping down the already spotless countertop with a clinical precision born of years of practice, could feel the prickle of unease crawl up her spine. Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful dirge against the hospital windows, rattling the panes with a ferocity that mirrored the unsettling quiet within.  The only sound besides the humming lights and her own shallow breaths was the erratic whirring of the centrifuge in the far corner, a mechanical heartbeat struggling to keep pace with the unsettling rhythm of the night.
