The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful song around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's rig, a tune as familiar to him as the rasp of his own worn-out boots.  The cab of his eighteen-wheeler, a battered but beloved Kenworth named Betsy, was a sanctuary from the blizzard raging outside.  Snow piled high against the tires, transforming the desolate rest stop into a snowdrift-encased island.  Only the flickering neon sign of the "Lone Star Oasis" – now mostly obscured by the storm – offered any hint of civilization amidst the swirling white chaos. Bart, his face etched with the lines of countless miles and harsh sun, sipped lukewarm coffee, the steam momentarily clouding his already weary eyes.  The radio crackled with static, punctuated by the occasional panicked voice warning of near-zero visibility on I-80.  He wasn't worried – not yet.  He'd weathered worse. But tonight, even Bart Higgins, a man who considered the open road his only true home, felt a prickle of unease settle in his gut.  Something felt…off.
