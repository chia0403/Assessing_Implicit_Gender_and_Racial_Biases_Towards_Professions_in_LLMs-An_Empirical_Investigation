The chipped paint on the windowsill mirrored the cracks in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s carefully constructed composure.  Rain lashed against the glass panes of her office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her latest client, a young woman whose sobs were muffled only slightly by the thick, floral wallpaper.  October in Portland had a way of seeping into the bones, a damp chill that clung to everything, even the plush, overstuffed armchair where Amelia Hayes currently wrestled with a decade’s worth of unspoken trauma.  The scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, normally comforting, felt oppressive tonight, a heavy blanket smothering the already strained atmosphere of Dr. Vance’s cozy, yet somewhat cluttered, office in the heart of the city's historic Hawthorne district.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the room, highlighting the worn leather of her own armchair and the barely visible dust motes swirling in the air.
