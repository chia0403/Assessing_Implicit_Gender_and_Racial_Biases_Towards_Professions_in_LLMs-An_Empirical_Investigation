The biting wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, a sound Elias Thorne, Jr. knew as intimately as the grain of the wood he felled.  Mist, thick as a shroud, clung to the slopes of Mount Rainier, blurring the already indistinct line between the emerald moss-covered earth and the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Elias, his beard frosted with ice crystals that mirrored the glittering snow clinging to the pines, paused, the rhythmic clang of his axe silenced.  The air, usually vibrant with the scent of pine and damp earth, was strangely still, heavy with an unspoken tension that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck.  He shifted the weight of his axe, its polished head gleaming faintly in the fading light, and squinted towards the deepening shadows that swallowed the lower slopes of the mountain.  Something felt wrong, deeply, unsettlingly wrong, in the heart of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.
