The biting wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Grace Sinclair’s charcoal grey coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted hospital courtyard.  November in Edinburgh had a particular bite, a damp chill that seeped into your bones and lingered long after you’d found shelter.  The neo-Gothic spires of the Royal Infirmary, silhouetted against the bruised purple twilight, seemed to loom over her, their gargoyles watching with stony indifference as she fought the gusts.  Rain, a fine, icy drizzle, began to fall, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the ancient building.  Evelyn pulled her collar higher, the metallic tang of antiseptic still clinging faintly to her scrubs beneath her coat. Inside, the operating theatres held their own hushed urgency, a stark contrast to the howling wind that seemed intent on tearing the very fabric of the city apart. Tonight, however, the quiet belonged to her.  Tonight, the city, the hospital, even the ever-present weight of her responsibilities, felt a million miles away.
