The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Relia” Dubois truly appreciated.  Her salon, "Shear Genius," nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually twilight city of Porthaven, was a haven of controlled chaos.  Mismatched velvet armchairs, chipped porcelain teacups perched precariously on precarious stacks of hairdressing magazines, and the constant whir of clippers created a vibrant, if slightly overwhelming, atmosphere.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, mirroring the tempestuous energy of Relia herself, as she expertly sculpted a cascade of fiery red curls, her nimble fingers a blur against the client’s head.  Outside, the city’s mournful siren song – a blend of distant church bells and the cries of gulls – fought a losing battle against the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears.
