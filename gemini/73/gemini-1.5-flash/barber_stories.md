The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, its faded lettering barely announcing "Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, Barber."  Barty himself sat perched on a worn leather stool behind his ancient barber chair, the scent of bay rum and stale coffee clinging to him like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of his tiny shop, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the faded photographs of smiling, long-gone customers tacked haphazardly to the wall.  Outside, the cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony, a soundtrack to the sleepy, sweltering afternoon in the forgotten corner of Bayonne, Louisiana.  The only sound inside, besides the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock that had probably seen better days, was the soft, almost imperceptible rasp of Bartyâ€™s honed shears, silently sharpening themselves on his worn leather strop.  Today, however, the shears remained idle.  A storm was brewing, both outside and within the walls of Bartholomew Blackwood's humble barbershop.
