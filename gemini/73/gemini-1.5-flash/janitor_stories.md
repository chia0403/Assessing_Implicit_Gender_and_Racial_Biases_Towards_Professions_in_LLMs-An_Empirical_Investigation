The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Elara Vanceâ€™s mop against the polished linoleum.  It was 2:17 AM, the hour when the imposing edifice of the Zenith Corporation headquarters shed its corporate skin and revealed its skeletal frame: echoing hallways, deserted offices radiating the cold breath of forgotten ambition, and the faint, metallic tang of stale coffee lingering in the air. Elara, armed with her mop, bucket, and a weariness etched deep into her face like a roadmap of sleepless nights, was the sole inhabitant of this concrete labyrinth, a silent guardian of the sleeping giant.  The only sound besides her work and the hum of the lights was the distant, rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock somewhere deep within the building's bowels, a solemn metronome marking the passage of time in this deserted kingdom.
