The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom!" sign threatened to peel off entirely, mirroring the frayed edges of Eleanor Vance's patience.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Room 2B, danced in the hazy air, a silent, chaotic ballet matching the current cacophony emanating from her kindergarten class.  Crayon shavings littered the brightly coloured, yet somehow perpetually messy, carpet.  A half-eaten apple core lay abandoned near a tower of wobbly blocks, testament to the morning's tumultuous construction project.  Outside, the playground echoed with the shriller cries of children, a soundtrack to the gentler, but equally insistent, demands of her twenty-five five-year-olds.  Today, however, the usual joyous chaos felt amplified, a discordant symphony threatening to overwhelm even Eleanor's practiced calm.
