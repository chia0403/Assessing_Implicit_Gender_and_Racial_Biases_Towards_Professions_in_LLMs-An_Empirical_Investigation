The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Reed's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The moon, a chipped silver coin in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the parched chaparral that clawed at the edges of the sprawling Santa Clarita valley.  Dry brush crackled underfoot, a nervous whisper against the roar of the inferno that raged a mile ahead, its orange glare painting the clouds a hellish crimson.  Evie, her Nomex jacket damp with sweat despite the cool night air, adjusted the weight of her axe on her shoulder. The air itself vibrated with the heat, a tangible force that pressed down, heavy and oppressive.  The smell wasn't just smoke; it was the scent of fear, of desperation, and of a battle against nature's unforgiving fury that they were, once again, hopelessly outmatched.
