The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stubborn oak beam into place.  The wind, a relentless sculptor of the Cornish coast, howled a mournful tune around the half-finished cottage perched precariously on the cliff edge, its foundations gnawed at by the relentless sea.

The air, thick with the scent of brine and pine, carried the distant cries of gulls, their keening a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of Elias's hammer against the wood.  This wasn't just any carpentry job; this was a battle against the elements, a testament to human will pitted against the raw, untamed power of the ocean.
