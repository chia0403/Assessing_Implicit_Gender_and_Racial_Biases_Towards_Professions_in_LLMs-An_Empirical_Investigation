The wrench slipped, a metallic shriek echoing in the cavernous gloom of Benny’s Auto Repair. Grease, thick as molasses in January, clung to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hands like a second skin.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered workshop, a chaotic symphony of discarded parts, half-finished projects, and the ghosts of a thousand engine repairs past.  Outside, the relentless Texas sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, the heat radiating through the thin insulation and adding to the already oppressive atmosphere.  The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt oil, gasoline, and the faint, almost sweet tang of ozone, a lingering reminder of a near-miss electrical fire last week.  Amy wiped her brow with the back of her greasy hand, leaving a smudged streak of grime across her forehead.  Another day, another challenge in her battle against entropy and the relentless march of mechanical decay.  Today’s adversary: a 1967 Mustang with a temper as fiery as the desert sun itself.
