The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s already wind-chapped cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the high school football field.  Stark, unforgiving grey skies mirrored the mood clinging to the air like the lingering smell of damp earth and decaying leaves.  The bleachers, normally vibrant with the roar of Friday night crowds, were deserted, swallowed by the encroaching twilight.  Only the rustle of wind through the skeletal branches of the bordering oaks punctuated the silence, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of Amy’s worn leather football boots against the muddy turf.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard setting one might associate with a winning season; this was the harsh reality of coaching the perpetually underperforming Northwood High Wildcats.  And tonight, Amy Hawthorne felt the weight of that reality pressing down on her like the November gloom itself.
