The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Rella” Montenegro seemed capable of conjuring.  Her salon, "Shear Perfection," wasn't perfect in the traditional sense.  The faded turquoise walls were chipped in places, the vintage Hollywood vanity mirror was speckled with age, and a single, slightly askew framed poster of Veronica Lake hung above the styling station.  But it was *Rella's* perfect.  Nestled on a quiet, cobbled street in the heart of San Francisco's North Beach, it was a haven from the frenetic energy of the city, a sanctuary where anxieties melted away under the weight of expertly applied hair dye and soothing conversation.  The afternoon sun, slanting through the dusty window panes, illuminated the fine dust motes dancing in the air, each one shimmering like a tiny, forgotten dream.  Today, however, a dream – or rather, a nightmare – was about to shatter the peaceful calm.  The insistent ringing of the salon bell, a discordant clang against the gentle hum of the hairdryer, announced its arrival.
