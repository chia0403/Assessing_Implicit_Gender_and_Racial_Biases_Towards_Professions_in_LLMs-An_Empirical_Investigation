The wind, a rasping, unforgiving hand, clawed at the weathered face of Silas "Whip" Blackwood as he surveyed his ranch.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red earth, danced across the parched landscape of the Devil's Tooth Ranch, swirling around the skeletal remains of long-dead mesquite trees.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down mercilessly on the sprawling property, baking the cracked earth to a near-molten state.  The air, thick with the scent of sun-baked dust and the faint, acrid tang of creosote, hummed with the oppressive silence of a land pushed to its limits.  Whip squinted, his eyes, the colour of faded denim, scanning the horizon, a landscape as familiar and unforgiving as his own hardened heart.  This land, carved from the unforgiving heart of Arizona Territory, had claimed many a man, but Whip Blackwood, stubborn and as resilient as the cactus clinging to the rocky hillsides, refused to be one of them.  This year, however, even his grit was being tested. The drought, relentless and pitiless, threatened to swallow Devil's Tooth Ranch whole.
