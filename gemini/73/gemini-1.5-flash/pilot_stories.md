The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already fading light.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, jagged teeth against the bruised purple sky, clawed at the last vestiges of daylight.  Evie shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The radio crackled with static, a mocking counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engine â€“ a sound that, usually a comfort, now felt strained, almost desperate.  She was overdue, way overdue, and the storm was brewing faster than any weather report had predicted.  The small, isolated village of Knik nestled somewhere down there, a pinprick of hope in the vast, unforgiving wilderness, and she was the only thing standing between it and a long, dark night without vital supplies.
