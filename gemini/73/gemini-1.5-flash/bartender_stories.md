The chipped Formica bar top felt slick beneath Elara Jean Blackwood's fingertips as she polished a already gleaming glass.  The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation – a familiar perfume Elara had come to tolerate, even somewhat appreciate, over the past five years.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a shimmering, hazy smear.  Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering neon sign above the bar, its "RUSTY MUG" spelling out a promise of something stronger than the storm raging outside, something to dull the edges of a long, hard day.  Tonight, however, even the promise of potent cocktails felt flimsy against the weight of the silence that had settled over the usually boisterous regulars.  The only sound, besides the relentless drumming of rain, was the rhythmic clinking of ice in Elara’s own glass – a solitary amber drink, untouched, reflecting the city’s stormy mood.
