The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Amelia Hernandez's fingertips, a familiar texture in the humid, fluorescent-lit haze of the "Rusty Mug Diner."  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the motel sign across the street.  Amelia, her nametag slightly askew, wiped down the counter with a rag that had seen better decades, the scent of stale coffee and burnt bacon clinging stubbornly to its fibres.  Outside, the storm raged, a tempestuous symphony that mirrored the chaotic swirl of orders and disgruntled customers that Amelia navigated nightly at the diner.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A strange stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic sizzle of the grill and the low hum of the refrigerator â€“ a stillness that felt heavier than the humidity.
