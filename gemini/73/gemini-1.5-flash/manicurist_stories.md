The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clung to the plush velvet chairs and the chipped porcelain sink of Serenity Nails.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the tiny salon, blurring the neon glow of the "OPEN" sign into a hazy halo.  Inside, amidst the muted chaos of drying fans and the rhythmic whir of the electric file, sat Esmeralda “Esme” Rodriguez, meticulously shaping a client’s already-perfect almond nails.  Esme, with her impossibly long, obsidian-black braid cascading down her back and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, was a master of her craft, capable of coaxing breathtaking designs from the simplest of polishes. But tonight, the usual soothing rhythm of her work was disrupted by a tremor of unease, a premonition clinging to her like the lingering scent of cherry blossom remover.  Something was about to shatter the fragile serenity of her little salon.
