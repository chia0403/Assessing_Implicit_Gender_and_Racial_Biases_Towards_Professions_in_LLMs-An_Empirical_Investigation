The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick as Spanish moss draped across the gnarled oaks lining Highway 190.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic rhythm, a soundtrack to the slow, agonizing crawl of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's beat-up Ford pickup.  Barty, a man whose life insurance sales were as slow as the traffic, wiped sweat from his brow, the cheap polyester of his company polo shirt clinging uncomfortably to his skin.  The setting sun cast long shadows that stretched and distorted the already surreal landscape, transforming the familiar bayou into something vaguely threatening, something that mirrored the unsettling feeling churning in Barty's gut.  He was on his way to see Mrs. Evangeline Dubois, a client whose policy was overdue, and something about this visit felt… different.  He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but the air crackled with an unspoken tension, a premonition that hung heavier than the humid air itself.
