The chipped paint of the "Guidance Counselor" door seemed to sigh under the weight of another Monday morning.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sunlight filtering through the grimy window, danced in the air like tiny, anxious spirits.  Inside, Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines spoke volumes about the years spent listening to the woes of teenagers, sorted through a precarious stack of college brochures, their glossy surfaces dulled by countless fingertips.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of teenage angst, a familiar perfume in the halls of Northwood High.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient windowpanes, a fitting soundtrack to the storm brewing inside Eleanor's office â€“ a storm not of weather, but of teenage heartbreak, academic pressure, and the ever-present, gnawing fear of the unknown that clung to the hallways like a persistent shadow.
