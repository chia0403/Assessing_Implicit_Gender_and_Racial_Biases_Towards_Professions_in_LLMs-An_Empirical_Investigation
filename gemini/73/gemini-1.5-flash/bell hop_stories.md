The brass spittoon glinted under the dim, gaslight-flickering lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Dust motes, disturbed by the languid sweep of a feather duster wielded by a weary chambermaid, danced in the shafts of light.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigars, expensive perfume, and something indefinably melancholic – the lingering aroma of forgotten dreams.  Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his bellhop uniform – a crisp navy blue jacket straining slightly at the seams –  perfectly pressed, adjusted the leather strap of his luggage cart.  His cap, perched jauntily on his head, hid a lock of unruly auburn hair that perpetually escaped. He surveyed the scene with a practiced eye, a mixture of weariness and anticipation etched onto his youthful face.  Tonight, like every night, held the promise of the unexpected at the Grand Majestic, a promise that both thrilled and terrified him.
