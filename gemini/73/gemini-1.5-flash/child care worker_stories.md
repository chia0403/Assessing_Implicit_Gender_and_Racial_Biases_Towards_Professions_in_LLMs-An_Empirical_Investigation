The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overflowing overflowing flowerpots flanking the front steps, a testament to the relentless summer heat baking Amelia Hernandez’s small town of Harmony Creek.  Amelia, 24 years old and armed with a perpetually optimistic smile that felt increasingly strained, wrestled a giggling four-year-old named Leo into his car seat.  The air hung thick and heavy, scented with the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle and the faint, underlying tang of exhaust fumes from the highway that sliced through the heart of town.  Inside the daycare, the usual chaotic symphony of tiny voices and clattering toys already filled the air, even though it was only 7:15 AM.  Another day in paradise, Amelia thought wryly, adjusting the rearview mirror to check on Leo’s contented, drool-covered face.
