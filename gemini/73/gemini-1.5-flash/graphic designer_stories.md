The chipped paint of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s studio apartment windowsill was a surprisingly pleasing shade of faded teal, a colour she’d probably once considered for a client’s logo.  Outside, the relentless London drizzle blurred the already indistinct outlines of the brick buildings across the alleyway.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of strong coffee and the faint, chemical tang of printer ink – a familiar perfume to Amelia, a comforting counterpoint to the relentless pressure of the looming deadline.  Empty takeaway containers littered the scarred wooden desk, a testament to the all-nighters fuelled by lukewarm noodles and existential dread that had become her recent companions.  On the desk, amidst a chaotic scattering of colour swatches, design sketches, and half-empty mugs, her laptop glowed with the sickly yellow light of a creative crisis. The cursor blinked mockingly, awaiting the inspiration that seemed to have vanished along with the last dregs of her caffeine supply.  Tonight, it wasn't just a logo she was battling; it was a whole campaign, a campaign that could make or break her fledgling freelance career.
