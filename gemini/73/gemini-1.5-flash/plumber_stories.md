He was knee-deep in the murky depths of the Blackwood Manor's plumbing system, a labyrinthine network of pipes that seemed to have been designed by a particularly sadistic goblin with a penchant for cast iron and right-angle bends. The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth, mildew, and something vaguely metallic that prickled the back of Barty's throat.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb dangling precariously overhead, danced in the stagnant air like tiny, mocking spirits.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient windowpanes in their decaying frames.
