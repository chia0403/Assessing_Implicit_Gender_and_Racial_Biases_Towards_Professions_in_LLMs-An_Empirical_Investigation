The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Finch’s fingers, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November wind that howled outside the window of her tiny office.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering bulb overhead, danced in the weak light like disgruntled spirits.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of meticulous habits and even more meticulous accounting practices, sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her pen against the ledger. The ledger, bound in faded green leather, lay open before her, its pages filled with the spidery script of transactions – the lifeblood of Hemlock Hollow, a town as quaint as it was economically precarious.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth drifted in from the street, a constant reminder that her office, perched above the dusty general store, was as much a part of Hemlock Hollow as the gnarled oak that stood sentinel at its edge.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting familiarity of the town felt…off. A prickling unease, sharp as a splintered twig, settled in Amelia's stomach.  Something wasn't right in Hemlock Hollow, and her perfectly balanced ledgers were about to be thrown wildly out of whack.
