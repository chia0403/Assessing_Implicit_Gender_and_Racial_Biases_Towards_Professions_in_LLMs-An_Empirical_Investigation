The chipped paint of Amelia Blackwood’s writing desk flaked onto the worn manuscript in front of her, a silent commentary on the state of her career.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, weak bulb dangling precariously above, danced in the stagnant air of her attic studio.  Rain lashed against the dormer window, a relentless percussion against the backdrop of Amelia’s simmering frustration.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune through the eaves of her ancient, rambling Victorian house, a house as creaky and temperamental as its inhabitant. The scent of damp wool and old paper hung heavy, a fitting aroma for a writer whose latest novel was currently languishing in the rejection pile – a pile that, sadly, had become a rather substantial piece of furniture in its own right.
