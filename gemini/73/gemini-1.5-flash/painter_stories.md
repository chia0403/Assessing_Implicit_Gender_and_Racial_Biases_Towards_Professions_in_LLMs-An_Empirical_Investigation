The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort he welcomed as a counterpoint to the stifling humidity clinging to the air like a damp shroud.  He stood on the weathered wooden planks of the rickety jetty, the rhythmic slap of waves against the pilings a hypnotic backdrop to the vibrant chaos unfolding before him.  The sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, dramatic shadows across the fishing boats bobbing gently in the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea.  This small, forgotten cove on the island of Serifos, with its crumbling whitewashed houses clinging precariously to the cliffs and the scent of brine and bougainvillea heavy in the air, was Elias's sanctuary, his muse, and the canvas upon which he painted his life.  Tonight, however, the canvas felt strangely blank, a stark contrast to the fiery spectacle before him.  His palette, usually a riot of colours, lay untouched, the brushes stiff with dried paint.  The creative well, usually overflowing with inspiration, felt alarmingly dry.
