The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton’s office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  He sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the weak light from a single bare bulb barely illuminating the overflowing ashtrays and stacks of dog-eared case files.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap tobacco, and something faintly floral – the lingering scent of the last client, a distraught opera singer with a voice like shattered glass and a secret she’d paid handsomely to keep.  Outside, the neon glow of a rain-slicked Chinatown spilled onto the grimy windowpane, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours struggling against the encroaching gloom.  This was Jack Stratton’s domain: the shadowed alleys and neon-lit backstreets of San Francisco’s Tenderloin, a place where secrets festered like mold in the damp corners and justice was a luxury few could afford.
