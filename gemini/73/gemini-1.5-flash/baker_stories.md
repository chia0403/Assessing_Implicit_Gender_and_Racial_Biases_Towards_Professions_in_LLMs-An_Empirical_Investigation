The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Genevieve Thistlewick's cheeks as she unlocked the bakery door, the rusty hinges groaning a mournful counterpoint to the cheerful jingle of her keys.  Dust motes, disturbed by the sudden influx of frigid air, danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windowpanes of "The Flour Child," a small, independent bakery nestled on the cobbled, almost forgotten, side street of Bleakwater Lane.  The air inside, however, was a haven of warmth, a comforting aroma of yeast and cinnamon battling valiantly against the lingering scent of yesterday's burnt sugar. Elara shivered, pulling her thick wool shawl tighter around her shoulders, and smiled, a genuine, if slightly weary, smile.  Another day, another batch of sourdough, another chance to coax magic from flour and water.  Bleakwater Lane might be forgotten by most, but The Flour Child, and its fiercely independent baker, were far from it.
