The cleaver, honed to a razor's edge, sang a thin, high-pitched whine as it sliced through the glistening fat of the Berkshire pork belly.  Blood, a dark, ruby tide, pooled in the chipped enamel sink of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's butcher shop, a comforting aroma mingling with the earthy scent of sawdust and the metallic tang of iron.  Barty, a man built like an oak tree with hands as rough as bark and eyes the colour of faded denim, barely registered the slickness of the meat against his calloused fingers.  The rhythmic chop, chop, chop was a meditative mantra, a familiar comfort in the chilly pre-dawn hours of a November morning in the cobbled, slightly-dilapidated town of Oakhaven.  Outside, a thin veil of mist clung to the thatched roofs of the cottages, promising a day as grey and unyielding as the granite countertop before him.  The only sound beyond the steady rhythm of his cleaver was the distant caw of a crow, a solitary note in the quiet stillness of the sleeping town.
