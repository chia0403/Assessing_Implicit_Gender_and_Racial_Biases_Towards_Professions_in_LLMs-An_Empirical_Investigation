On the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis of Currenwell, where the city lights slowly fade into the tranquility of endless fields, stood an old brick building covered in ivy and shrouded in history. This was the Harrington Institute for the Arts, a once-renowned institution now partially forgotten by time. It was a place where dust began to rival the paint on the walls, and the echoes of past symphonies whispered through its empty halls.

The morning light filtered gently through the stained-glass windows, casting colorful shadows that danced across the tiled floors. It was here, in the silence of dawn, that Donovan “Don” Pritchard began his day. Donovan was a janitor, and as far as anyone was concerned, he was as much a part of the Institute as its creaking floorboards and ancient tapestries.

With the keys to the building jangling softly in his pocket, Donovan moved with a quiet rhythm, his every footstep a part of a well-practiced routine. At fifty-seven, he bore the mark of a life spent in the shadows of others, yet his eyes gleamed with a hidden knowledge, the sort possessed by those who observe more than they are observed.

Donovan wasn't just any janitor; he was the custodian of memories, the overseer of forgotten stories. He knew each creak and groan of the building as well as he knew the back of his own hand. But there was a sense of mystery about him, a gentle enigma that clung to his plaid shirt and well-worn jeans like an old, trusted friend.

As he swept the grand foyer, Donovan paused for a moment to look at the portraits adorning the walls, remnants of Harrington's illustrious past. His gaze lingered on one painting in particular, a portrait of Meredith Harrington, the brilliant composer and conductor who founded the Institute. Her eyes seemed to follow him, understanding and questioning all at once.

"Good morning, Meredith," Donovan murmured with a nod, as he did every day. And then, he continued his work, knowing full well that while the building's stories might remain unspoken to most, they sang out to him loud and clear, a silent symphony that only he could hear.
