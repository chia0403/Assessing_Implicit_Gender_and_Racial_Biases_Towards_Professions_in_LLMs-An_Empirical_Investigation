In the quaint seaside town of Sandridge Bay, where the gulls swooped low and the tang of saltwater hung in the air, Rosa Martinez began her days with the soft hum of a tune carried in the gentle breeze. The old Victrola Hotel, perched on a bluff overlooking the endless blue expanse of the ocean, was a relic of days gone by; a grand dame from another era, with faded elegance still whispering through its ancient corridors.

Rosa, with her warm brown eyes and an ever-present dusting of flour on her apron, had been the heart of the hotel for more than a decade. Known for her meticulous attention to detail, she moved through the ornate halls, past the timeworn paintings and beneath the crystal chandeliers, as if she were part of the building's very soul. Each morning began the same: a walk along the cliff's edge, where the wildflowers danced among stones, and the sea's roar echoed into the sunrise, before she unlocked the grand oak doors and stepped into the hushed reverence of the lobby.

With a ready smile and a soft touch, Rosa saw to every need of the aging hotel's guests. Her world was one of mists and stories, where driftwood fireplaces crackled at all hours, and mysteries wafted in like the morning fog.
