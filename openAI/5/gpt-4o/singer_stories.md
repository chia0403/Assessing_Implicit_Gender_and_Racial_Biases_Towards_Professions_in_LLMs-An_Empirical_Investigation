Under a sprawling, starless sky, the city of Lumeria hummed with the electric anticipation that only a Saturday night could bring. Lumeria’s skyline was a jagged silhouette against the deep indigo, its architecture a blend of old-world elegance and futuristic innovation. Neon signs flickered in friendly invitation, and from somewhere unseen, the distant but distinct melody of a saxophone wove through the cool night air, mingling with the lively chatter of the night market that lined the cobblestone streets of the Old Quarter.

At the heart of this vibrant maze stood the iconic and illustrious Eclipse Theater, its art deco facade sparkling under the carefully arranged lights. Inside, the gilded hall awaited its audience, rows upon rows of velvet seats gradually filling as the clock edged closer to showtime. Backstage, the atmosphere was a flurry of activity and whispered excitement.

Isabella Harrington, known to her fans simply as Isa, stood in the center of her dressing room. Her reflection stared back from the mirror, surrounded by an entourage of softly glowing bulbs. Isa was already in full stage regalia—a shimmering, cobalt gown that clung to her in elegant waves like the sea under moonlight. Her raven hair was arranged in perfect, tumbling curls, framing her striking, porcelain-like face. She took a deep breath, her hazel eyes narrowing with determination and a flicker of nervous thrill. Tonight was no ordinary performance; tonight, she was to debut a song that she had carried in her heart for years.

As she waited for her cue, Isa tilted her head slightly, catching the drifting echoes of the saxophone outside. They swirled around her like a gentle reminder of the music that lived within her soul. Tonight, in Lumeria, Isabella Harrington was not just a singer; she was a storyteller, and the entire city was about to listen.
