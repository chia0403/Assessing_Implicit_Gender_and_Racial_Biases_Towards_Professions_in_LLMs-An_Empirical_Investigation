**Story Opening:**

It was a dreary Monday morning when the first hints of rain began to whisper against the windows of the Sterling & Co. Law Firm. A gray sky loomed overhead, casting a dull light over the polished marble floors and brass fixtures of the reception area. The comforting scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from a nearby break room, mingling with the faint aroma of leather and paper that filled the air.

At the reception desk, nestled between two towering potted plants, sat Tessa Margaret Caldwell. With her tousled chestnut curls pulled back into a loose bun and an ever-present smile that could illuminate the gloom of the stormy day, Tessa had a knack for making the most mundane of mornings feel a little brighter. She adjusted the delicate silver necklace that hung around her neck as she glanced at the clock. 

"Just another day in paradise," Tessa whispered to herself, albeit with a hint of sarcasm. The days flowed into each other in a stream of phone calls, messages, and the sometimes frantic shuffle of attorneys and clients. Yet, there was something about this particular Monday that tingled in the back of her mind, a whisper of imminent change that left her slightly on edge.

As she flicked through the stack of messages that had piled up over the weekend, the beads of water began to slide down the glass, distorting the world outside. Tessa couldn’t shake the feeling that today might bring an unexpected visitor—one who would shatter the monotony of her routine. Little did she know, as she prepared to answer the phone and greet whoever entered through those glass doors, that the rain was more than just a backdrop; it carried with it someone who would forever alter the course of her life.
