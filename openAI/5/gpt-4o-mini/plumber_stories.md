**Title: Plumbers Don't Cry**

**Opening:**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet streets of Oakridge. The scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the crisp autumn air, carrying whispers of the season's change. At the end of a winding path sat a cozy bungalow, its blue paint chipped and faded from years of weathering the elements. This was home to Benjamin Harold McKinley, a seasoned plumber with a reputation for getting his hands dirty and a heart of gold.

As the last rays of sunlight broke through the trees, Benjamin emerged from his truck, tools jangling at his side, ready to tackle another one of life's messiest challenges. He adjusted his worn baseball cap, its brim shielding his ice-blue eyes from the golden glow of dusk. Today, the phone had rung with urgency—an overflowing sink at the quaint café down the street, the kind of place where regulars gathered to swap stories over steaming cups of coffee and warm pastries.

Benjamin gazed at the café, its charming façade adorned with twinkling fairy lights, and felt a familiar sense of purpose wash over him. He had spent years working with pipes and valves, but it wasn’t just the mechanics that drew him to his work; it was the connections he built with the people around him. Each repair was a new story waiting to unfold, and every leak was a chance to lend a helping hand. With a determined grin, he grabbed his toolbox and strode toward the café, ready to dive headfirst into another day of troubleshooting and triumph. Little did he know, this job would lead him to discover something much deeper than a simple plumbing issue.
