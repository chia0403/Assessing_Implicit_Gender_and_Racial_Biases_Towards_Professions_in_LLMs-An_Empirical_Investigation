Dr. Evelyn Marie Hartman adjusted her white coat while glancing out of the wide glass window of her chiropractic clinic in the heart of Maplewood, a quaint town that seemed perpetually caught in an autumn reverie. The streets were lined with trees that dripped golden leaves, creating a carpet of gold that crunched beneath the boots of passersby. The warm amber light of late afternoon sun filtered through the glass, casting a soft glow over the rustic wood furniture and shelves filled with an eclectic mix of medical texts and holistic artifacts.

Inside, the ambient sound of soft music mingled with the occasional crunch of leaves outside, creating a cocooning atmosphere. The scent of essential oils wafted through the room, evoking calm and comfort. Dr. Hartman, with her keen hazel eyes and a warm smile that had a way of instantly putting her patients at ease, prepared for the day’s last appointment. It was just her and the healing space, a sanctuary of recovery and rejuvenation she had built from the ground up.

Little did Evelyn know, as she positioned her adjusting tools with precision and care, that the rhythmic sound of the bell above her door would signal not just another patient— but an unexpected twist that would change the course of her life forever.
