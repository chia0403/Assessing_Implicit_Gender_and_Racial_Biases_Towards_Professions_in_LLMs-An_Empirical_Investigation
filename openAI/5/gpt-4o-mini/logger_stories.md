Title: Everwood Echoes

Setting: The dense, sprawling forests of the Pacific Northwest, where towering Douglas firs and ancient redwoods punctuate the horizon, casting long shadows on the forest floor. It’s early morning, and a mist clings to the earth, heavy with the scent of damp earth and pine. The only sounds are the rhythmic chirping of birds and the occasional rustle of a deer moving cautiously through the underbrush.

Opening:

The sun had barely begun to creep over the jagged skyline when Mason Joshua Hale swung his legs over the side of his weathered cot. In the half-light of his cabin, he rubbed sleep from his eyes and breathed in the musky scent of the cedar walls, mixed with the faint whiff of sawdust that lingered from his long days logging. 

Mason was a man of the woods, forged by years of labor under the canopy of towering trees and skies that changed from azure to brooding gray in the blink of an eye. He had learned the secrets of the forest—in the way the wind whispered through the branches and how the light filtered down, teasing the floor with patches of gold. Each day, the rhythm of his chainsaw became a part of that symphony, a rocks-and-rhythm dance against nature’s quiet hum.

But today felt different. As he donned his thick flannel shirt and tugged on his worn boots, a tingle of unease ran down his spine. The forest seemed to stir with a restless energy, as if it too sensed that something was about to change. Mason stepped out into the crisp morning air, his breath a ghostly fog before him, and made his way toward his truck, parked among a scatter of tools and gear. The quiet was unsettling, and the woods, usually alive with the sound of birds and small creatures, felt eerily still.

Mason shook off the feeling. It was just another day in Everwood, where routines were as familiar as the trees stretching towards the horizon, each one an old friend, each cut a step deeper into the heart of the ancient wilderness that fed his soul. But as he turned the key in the ignition, the echoing growl of the engine pierced the silence, and for the briefest moment, he couldn't shake the sensation that the forest was watching, waiting, as if it knew secrets even he had yet to uncover.
