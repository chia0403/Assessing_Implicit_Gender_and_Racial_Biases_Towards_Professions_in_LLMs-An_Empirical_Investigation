As the first light of dawn began to spill over the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and soft pink, Elizabeth "Liz" Montgomery found herself standing on the deck of a small ferry cutting through the still waters of Puget Sound. The crisp autumn air nipped at her cheeks, and she pulled her scarf a little tighter around her neck, savoring the invigorating chill that signaled the arrival of fall. Islands dotted the landscape around her, their evergreen silhouettes rising like quiet guardians against the awakening sky.

Liz was no stranger to early mornings like this. As an investigative journalist for the Seattle Tribune, her days often began before the city stirred to life. Today, however, the destination was Whidbey Island—a place shrouded in local lore and whispered tales that scarcely made their way to print. She clutched her worn leather satchel closer, its contents promising the allure of a story untold, a mystery waiting to be unfurled.

Rumors of peculiar events had been surfacing from the island—a series of unexplainable disappearances matched only by the island's own enigmatic reputation. A few locals dismissed them as mere campfire fables, yet sources that Liz trusted spoke with an undercurrent of tension, a thread of unease that pulled her towards uncovering the truth.

As the ferry approached the docking point, Liz took a moment to soak in the scene—the mist rolling off the water, the quaint harbor, the distant call of a seagull. It was serene, almost deceivingly so. With a deep breath, she squared her shoulders, her journalistic instincts tingling. There was a story here, buried amidst the whispers and shadows, and Elizabeth Montgomery, with her unyielding curiosity and pen poised, was determined to unravel it.
