Under the perpetually cloudy skies of Crestwood City, where the shadows seemed to stretch a bit longer and the rain never stopped for long, life had an unmistakable rhythm — one that thrummed with secrets and unsolved mysteries. The city, with its art deco façades and narrow cobblestone alleys, was a labyrinth of history, whispered legends, and hidden truths. It was here, amidst the echo of drizzle against the windows and the wavering glow of flickering neon signs, that Samuel "Sam" Hollister carved out his modest living as a private detective.

Sam's office was nestled on the third floor of an aging building on Hargrove Street, where the creak of the stairs was a personal symphony that played him to his desk each day. The walls there were adorned with faded maps of Crestwood, annotated and marked with years of unsolved cases. A faint aroma of coffee and aged paper lingered in the air, mingling with the stronger scents of rain-dampened fabric and lemon polish.

Sam Hollister, a man of deliberate movements and keen observance, was not the type to blend into a crowd. His attire was as unwaveringly classic as his nature — a tailored suit, fedora, and wire-rimmed glasses perched on a nose that had seen its fair share of bar fights. Behind those spectacles lay eyes that missed nothing. He had spent a lifetime learning the language of those around him, spoken in hushed tones and furtive glances, and had come to know that everyone in Crestwood had something to hide.
