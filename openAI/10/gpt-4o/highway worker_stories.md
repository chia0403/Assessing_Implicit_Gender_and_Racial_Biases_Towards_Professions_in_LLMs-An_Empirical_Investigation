The first light of dawn broke over the rugged hills, casting long shadows across the deserted stretch of Route 74. An owl's hoot echoed in the distance before being swallowed by the steady hum of insects that marked the beginning of another sweltering day in the foothills of the Appalachians. It was a Monday, that much was certain; Donnie J. Marshall didn’t need a calendar to tell him that. He felt it in his bones, as sure as he could feel the warmth of the asphalt beneath his boots.

Donnie adjusted the brim of his weathered cap and took a deep breath, the crisp morning air tinged with the scent of tar and pine. The landscape was vast and unforgiving, with mountains towering in the distance, their peaks kissed by mist and mystery. Here, the highway wove through rolling green hills and along rocky outcrops, a lifeline of cracked concrete that connected sleepy towns and wandering lives.

The sun peeked over the horizon, painting the world in shades of gold and orange, casting Donnie in silhouette as he stood by the side of the road. His vest, a neon orange beacon of safety, reflected back the light in dazzling bursts. The truck behind him rumbled gently, the only other sound in the quiet morning, laden with cones and signs warning of work ahead.

Today, there were miles to be paved, cracks to be sealed, and the endless grind of keeping the world moving forward. Donnie liked it that way — the rhythm of work was something he understood, a melody as old as the land itself. It was a job that came with its own kind of satisfaction, seeing the path laid out behind, smooth and unblemished, a testament to perseverance and purpose.

"Same old, same old, eh, Donnie?" his colleague Greg called out, his chuckle punctuating the gentle silence as he climbed out of the cab.

Donnie grinned, shading his eyes from the rising sun. "Wouldn't have it any other way, Greg," he replied, his voice a gravelly drawl warmed by years of friendship and shared toil. Together, they began to unload the truck, their shadows stretching long along the quiet, expectant road.
