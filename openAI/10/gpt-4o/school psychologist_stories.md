On an overcast morning in the small town of Brooksville, the incessant drizzle tapped rhythmically against the windows of Oakridge Elementary School. The sky, a canvas of muted grays, cast a soft, diffused light over the well-tended lawns and the rows of vibrant marigold flowers lining the school's entrance. The air was crisp with the scent of rain and freshly cut grass, a familiar aroma that heralded the arrival of autumn. 

Inside the cozy walls of the school, the sound of children's laughter and the muffled echoes of teachers' voices formed a warm, comforting symphony that could be heard even through the thick doors of the administrative wing. Down a quiet corridor, past the bustling front office and tucked just beyond the faculty lounge, was a small, inviting room where Dr. Eliza Hartman began her day. 

Dr. Hartman, the dedicated school psychologist, sat at her desk, her fingertips grazing over the textured surface of a manila file folder. Her workspace was a sanctuary of calm amidst the chaos of elementary school life, with shelves lined with brightly colored books, stackable games, and cozy beanbags that hinted at her visitors—students seeking an oasis from the turbulent seas of growing up. With her deep auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun and her reading glasses perched on the bridge of her nose, Eliza was the embodiment of warmth and understanding, traits that endeared her to everyone who passed through her door.

Her role was an essential one, weaving the threads of empathy and support through the fabric of the school community, and on this particular morning, she felt a twinge of excitement as she prepared for her first appointment of the day—a young boy who'd recently moved to Brooksville and whom she was meeting for the first time. Little did she know that this encounter would unravel a set of events that would challenge her own understanding of the very essence of childhood and change the course of her year.
