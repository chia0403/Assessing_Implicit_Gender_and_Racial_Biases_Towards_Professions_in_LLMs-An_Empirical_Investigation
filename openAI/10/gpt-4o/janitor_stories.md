Title: *Echoes of the Midnight Hallways*

In the heart of the sprawling city of Halcyon Grove, where the skyline clawed timelessly at the stars, stood the venerable Pendleton Tower. It was a testament of architecture from an era of ambition and yet, in its twilight years, it stood mostly forgotten. Amidst the relentless tide of progress, the tower had become a shadowed relic, its grandeur dulled by decades of unfeeling time.

As the vibrant pulse of the city life slowed to a whisper, and the world beyond the glassed walls of the tower retreated into quietude, Owen Merrick began his nightly rounds. Owen was the unsung custodian of Pendleton, the stoic guardian of its silent corridors. Though unseen by the day-bound bustle, every corner of the colossal structure bore the touch of his earnest labors.

Years of routine had etched the building’s layout into his bones; he could traverse its hallways with his eyes closed, guided solely by memory and the subtle, comforting hum of its aging infrastructure. The hour was late, the city cast beneath a midnight shroud, but to Owen, this was the time when the building came to life—whispering its forgotten tales and gently murmuring its secrets, carried on the echoing footsteps of a solitary janitor.

Owen Merrick, with his graying hair hidden beneath a worn cap and his uniform clean yet threadbare, moved with the steady rhythm of the assured. His keys jingled softly in his hand, a familiar symphony accompanying the task of tending to the needs of his silent companion—the Pendleton Tower. This night promised nothing out of the ordinary, or so he thought. Yet, like the unfurling of a forgotten dream, something unusual lurked amidst the shadows, waiting for Owen to find it.
