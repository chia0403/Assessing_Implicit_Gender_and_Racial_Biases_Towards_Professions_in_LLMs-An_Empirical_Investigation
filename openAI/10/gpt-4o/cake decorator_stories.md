Amelia Cartwright awoke to the gentle patter of rain against her bedroom window, the soft lullaby of a sleepy Sunday morning in Summerset, a quaint seaside town known for its cobblestone streets and vibrant flower markets. The air, tinged with the salty scent of the nearby ocean, carried the promise of a peaceful day, and Amelia couldn't help but smile as she stretched lazily, already envisioning the possibilities that awaited her in her cozy kitchen.

Amelia, a cake decorator whose artistry had made her something of a local celebrity, lived above her boutique bakery, Sugar & Sea, located at the corner of Maple and Wharf. The shop, with its baby-blue façade and large, bow-fronted windows, was a haven of creativity where delicate pastel-colored confections lined the shelves, each whispering tales of celebrations and sweet moments crafted with precision and love.

Today, she was to create a masterpiece. A towering five-tier wedding cake adorned with intricate sugar blossoms for a couple exchanging vows at the historic lanthorn-lit chapel nestled at the heart of town. It was to be a lavish affair, and Amelia was determined to bring their dreams to edible life, each petal, each swirl of icing capturing their story with just the right amount of whimsy and romance.

The air inside Sugar & Sea was warm, filled with the comforting aroma of vanilla and chocolate, intermingled with the faintest hint of orange zest — Amelia’s secret ingredient. As she tied her apron, a cherished heirloom passed down from her grandmother, Amelia felt the hum of anticipation. This was her sanctuary, her canvas, and every cake an opportunity to stir joy and nourishment to the soul.
