In the small, mist-veiled town of Aberwood, nestled between dense, ancient forests and the glistening expanse of Lake Eydis, lay the centuries-old Harrington Manor. Its grey stone facade was draped in ivy, and its tall, arched windows often flickered with the warm glow of candlelight. Despite its grand stature, the manor bore an air of melancholic solitude, a relic of a bygone era where whispers of its past drifted like ghosts through its opulent halls.

Amelia Thorne, the manor’s dedicated housekeeper, had long since lost count of the number of rooms she tended to, each filled with heirlooms and memories like delicate tapestries woven into the fabric of the house. Her hands, though gentle and aged, moved with practiced precision over the dust-covered shelves and intricately carved banisters. She was a quiet soul, someone who preferred the company of the manor’s secrets to the bustling commotion of the outside world.

The early morning fog clung to the windows as Amelia started her day, her presence as much a part of Harrington Manor as the creaking boards and timeworn portraits. Her chestnut hair was pulled back tightly, a neat bun that mirrored her inclination for orderliness. Though the hours were long and the work demanding, she had come to find a comforting rhythm in the silence, a steadfast guardian of the manor’s history and its forgotten stories.

As Amelia dusted a brass candlestick in the dining room, her mind wandered to the enigmatic Lady Evelyn Harrington, whose portrait dominated the southern wall. The lady's sharp eyes seemed to follow her around, as if silently questioning why time had been kind to the wood, the stone, and perhaps even to Amelia, but not to her. In this house, echoes of laughter and the soft hum of music were remnants of an era that had slipped beyond the reach of the present, waiting patiently for Amelia to uncover their long-hidden truths.
