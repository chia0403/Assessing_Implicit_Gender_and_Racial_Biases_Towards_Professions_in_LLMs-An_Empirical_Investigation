The sun hung low over the horizon, casting a warm golden glow on the endless stretch of asphalt that wound its way through the rolling hills of Dakota County. Here, the air was thick with the scent of fresh pavement and wildflowers, a peculiar blend that marked the onset of another long shift for the men and women who worked tirelessly to keep the roads safe for the travelers passing through.

At the forefront of this everyday brigade was Thomas Everett Jenkins, a dedicated highway worker whose sun-kissed skin bore the marks of years spent toiling under the open sky. Clad in a faded orange vest that fluttered like a flag of duty in the gentle breeze, Thomas adjusted the brim of his hard hat, his eyes scanning the horizon for the distant rumble of oncoming traffic. He had spent the better part of two decades on this very stretch of road, witnessing countless sunrises and sunsets from the narrow shoulders he called his office.

Today, however, felt different. The sun's warmth was accompanied by an unusual heaviness in the air, as if the earth itself was holding its breath, preparing for something unexpected. Thomas couldn't shake the feeling that this routine day would spiral into an adventure far beyond the yellow lines that defined his world. As he bent down to tie his work boots—a simple act that felt more significant than usual—a cloud of dust danced through the air, swirling around him like whispers of foreboding. Little did he know, the first chapter of a life-altering journey was about to begin on that very road.
