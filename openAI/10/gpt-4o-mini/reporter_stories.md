Title: **Echoes of the Past**

Setting: The sun dipped low behind the jagged skyline of Eastwick, casting long shadows over the cobblestone streets as a light rain began to fall, creating a soft patter against the aged rooftops. The scent of damp earth mingled with the distant aroma of roasted coffee from a nearby café, where familiar voices murmured in hushed tones. Towering Victorian buildings, with their ornate facades, flanked the narrow alleyways, hiding secrets best left undisturbed. Flickering streetlamps cast a warm glow, illuminating the painted wooden boards of long-abandoned storefronts, each with stories tangled in time.

Opening: Underneath the dripping eaves of a crumbling brick facade, Eleanor Mae Grayson adjusted the collar of her trench coat, her sharp eyes scanning the rain-soaked street for the usual hints of life - an elderly man walking his bulldog, a group of youths laughing as they splashed through puddles. But tonight, Eastwick seemed to hold its breath, as if anticipating something about to unfold. Eleanor’s pulse quickened; she had received an anonymous tip that the city's long-buried secrets were waking from their slumber. As a seasoned reporter for the Eastwick Herald, she had made her name uncovering stories that others dared not touch. This one promised to be the biggest yet, and she could practically taste the adrenaline as she pulled out her notepad, eager to document whatever mysteries lay hidden beneath the surface of her once-familiar town.
