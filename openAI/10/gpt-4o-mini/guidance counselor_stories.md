**Title**: Beneath the Stardust

**Setting**: The quaint town of Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and vast, emerald forests. It's the kind of place where everyone knows each other, and the air is thick with the scent of pine and blooming wildflowers. The heart of the town is a historic brick courthouse, surrounded by charming cafes and family-owned shops. At the edge of town sits Willow Creek High School, a sprawling building of ivy-covered brick, its red-tiled roof peeking through the trees. Inside, the hallways are lined with colorful student art, and the air buzzes with the laughter and chatter of teenagers navigating the complexities of adolescence.

**Opening**: 

Evelyn Marie Hart stood in the bustling hallway of Willow Creek High School, her keen emerald eyes scanning the crowd of students that swirled around her like a current. As the school’s guidance counselor, she was both a confidante and a beacon of hope for many of the children who passed her by. In her late thirties, with chestnut hair drawn into a practical bun and a warm but no-nonsense demeanor, she had a unique way of making each student feel seen without overshadowing their unique stories.

Today, the walls seemed to echo with an undercurrent of anxiety—the soft murmurs of whispered worries about college applications, friendships fraying at the edges, and a prom fast approaching, which seemed to loom larger than life. Evelyn held a stack of brightly colored pamphlets on mental health in one hand, while the other absently tapped on the clipboard that swung at her hip, filled with the names and appointments of students she would meet throughout the day.

But as she turned toward her office, a small sanctuary cloaked in the comforting scent of fresh coffee and vanilla-scented candles, a sudden flash of movement caught her eye. A figure stood at the edge of the hallway, his expression masked with trepidation. It was Leo Taylor, a quiet junior with a passion for astrophysics and a penchant for avoiding eye contact. She could sense the weight of a hidden struggle in his posture. Evelyn’s heart quickened; she knew that for many students, the path they walked was not just about grades and college applications, but the tumult of their inner lives. Today felt like a day for discovery, as if the universe whispered secrets waiting to be unveiled. 

“Leo?” she called gently, her voice slicing through the noise. “Want to come talk?” 

In that inviting moment, beneath the flickering fluorescent lights and the warm hues of the setting sun filtering through the windows, a new chapter was about to unfold between a counselor and a young man hovering on the brink of something profound—something that would change them both forever.
