The city of Luminaris thrummed with a vibrant pulse, its skyline a jagged silhouette against the mauve horizon as the last rays of sunlight flickered like fireflies. Nestled at the heart of this urban tapestry stood the opulent Silver Crest Hotel, its marble façade glistening under the touch of evening lights. Inside, the scent of polished wood and fresh orchids enveloped guests as they entered, a promise of luxury and comfort.

Behind the grand mahogany desk, Etienne Maxime Lavoie, the hotel’s renowned concierge, moved with the grace of a seasoned performer. With his impeccably tailored suit and a carefully groomed mustache that curled like an artist’s signature, Etienne embodied the spirit of elegance. His sharp hazel eyes, bright with curiosity, scanned the bustling lobby where guests mingled, laughter mingling with the soft clink of crystal glasses. 

Etienne’s role was more than just offering directions or booking theatre tickets; he was the unseen architect of unforgettable experiences. When guests walked through the ornate doors of Silver Crest, they didn't just check into a room; they entered a world where every wish was whispered into existence. He thrived on the stories unfolding around him, knowing that each request was a chance to craft a moment that would linger in memory long after the stay ended.

As the clock chimed six, signaling the commencement of evening festivities, a figure dressed in a striking scarlet coat caught Etienne’s attention. There was something unusual about this newcomer—an air of intrigue draped around them like a cloak. Shifting his posture slightly, Etienne felt that the vital threads of the hotel were momentarily tangled, waiting for him to unravel them.
