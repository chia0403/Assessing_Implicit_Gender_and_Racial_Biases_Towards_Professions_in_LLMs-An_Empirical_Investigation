Dr. Margaret Elise Waverly stood in her bright, cozy dental office, the faint smell of antiseptic mingling with a hint of lavender from the essential oil diffuser perched atop her cluttered desk. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the cheerful yellow walls that were decorated with colorful dental-themed artwork, each piece aiming to ease the fears of her younger patients. It was a quiet Tuesday morning in the small coastal town of Seabreeze, where the sound of gentle waves lapping against the shore served as a calming backdrop to her busy practice.

As she adjusted her white coat, she glanced at the framed photograph on her desk—her late father, a beloved dentist in the community for over three decades, smiling back at her. Since taking over his practice, Margaret had become determined to uphold his legacy, blending traditional care with modern techniques. However, beneath her confident exterior, she struggled with the pressures of managing the practice while trying to carve out her own identity in a profession that constantly reminded her of her father's shadow.

The morning light poured onto the polished floor as she prepared for her first appointment. Outside, seagulls cried overhead, while the scent of salty air wafted through the open window, reminding her of serene moments spent beachcombing as a child. But today, as she straightened her dental instruments and reviewed her schedule, a sense of unease curled in her stomach. There was something in the air—an unsettling shift that hinted at the arrival of a patient who would change everything.
