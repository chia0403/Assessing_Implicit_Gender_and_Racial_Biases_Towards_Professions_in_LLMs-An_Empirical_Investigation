**Title: Miles of Silence**

**Setting:** The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting golden hues across the endless stretches of the Montana plains. Dust kicked up in the wake of passing trucks, swirling in the warm evening air. The small town of Blue Sky lay nestled at the edge of an expansive valley, a cluster of weathered buildings and storefronts, each one with tales etched into their facades. The sound of gravel crunching underfoot could be heard alongside the distant murmur of the flowing river that meandered lazily through the landscape.

**Opening:** 

Under the vivid canvas of the sunset, Casey James Hawthorne tightened his grip on the steering wheel of his rig, a fabled Freightliner that had seen more miles than most dream of. As he cruised down Highway 87, the roar of the engine drowned out his thoughts, but the solitude that enveloped him was a familiar companion. A subtle hum of classic rock played softly through the cab’s speakers, the last vestiges of daylight casting long shadows in the cramped space.

To most, truck driving was just a job—a means to an end—but for Casey, it was a way of life. He reveled in the rhythm of the road, the sense of freedom that came with each stretch of asphalt. Yet, something was different today. As he drove through the fading light, a nagging feeling coiled tight in his gut. 

With a sigh, he shifted gears, the truck roaring as it picked up speed, the tires thumping against the pavement. In his rearview mirror, the town of Blue Sky disappeared behind him—a place that felt both like home and a memory. Casey had promised himself a good night’s rest at the diner when he arrived in the next town, but that promise felt heavy now, dragging on his spirit like a lead weight.

He had always been a solitary figure, a ghost on the highways, but tonight, the open road felt less inviting. glancing at the digital clock on the dashboard, he noted the creeping hour. The light on the fuel gauge flickered ominously. Just as he contemplated pulling over for a quick break, the radio crackled to life with a news bulletin, an unsettling edge creeping into the anchor's voice. 

Something was stirring in the distance—a shift in the wind that even the strongest trucker couldn’t ignore. Casey’s heart kicked into gear, and the adventure he thought he was simply trucking through suddenly felt like it was about to take a wild turn.
