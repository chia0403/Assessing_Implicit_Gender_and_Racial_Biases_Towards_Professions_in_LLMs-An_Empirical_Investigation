In the remote foothills of the Cascade Mountains, where the air was thick with the earthy scent of pine and damp moss, the sun was just beginning to rise, casting a golden hue over the dense forest. The early morning mist clung to the trees, swirling lazily in the cool breeze that rustled the leaves and whispered secrets of the woods. Birds called to one another, heralding the dawn as shadows danced in the patches of light filtering through the branches.

Amidst this tranquil beauty stood a weathered logging camp, a cluster of modest cabins readily assembled from the sturdy timber harvested from nearby stands. The central hub of the camp was a sturdy wooden bunkhouse, its walls adorned with faded photographs of past crews, memories of camaraderie etched into the grain of the wood. A soft clanging echoed from the cookhouse, where the rich aroma of fresh coffee and sizzling bacon mingled with the crisp morning air.

At the heart of the camp, with his hands calloused from years of labor, was the main character—Matthew Elijah Thornton. With tousled dark hair and a face kissed by the sun, Matthew was a man of the woods, finding both solace and purpose beneath the towering evergreens. He had grown up among these mountains, the son of a logger himself, and had inherited a deep respect for the land and its rhythms. 

As he emerged from his cabin, the sun broke through the mist, warming his face and illuminating the rugged landscape around him. Matthew took a moment to breathe in the serene beauty before the day’s work began. Little did he know that the tranquility of the morning would soon be shattered, as something unseen began to stir within the depths of the forest, threatening the delicate balance between man and nature that he had always cherished.
