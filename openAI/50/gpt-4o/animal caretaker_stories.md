In the heart of the verdant Appalachian foothills, where morning mist weaves lazily through ancient trees, lies Greenwood Sanctuary. A hidden refuge for animals both wild and domesticated, the sanctuary is a patchwork quilt of meadows, woodlands, and gently bubbling streams. Here, nature reigns supreme and whispers secrets to those willing to listen.

Amidst the soothing harmony of chirping birds and rustling leaves, Harper Linwood makes her rounds each morning. A dedicated animal caretaker, Harper embodies the spirit of the sanctuary itself—nurturing, resilient, and infinitely kind. Her days are a tapestry of tasks, woven with threads of compassion and expertise as she tends to the creatures under her care.

Whether it's bottle-feeding orphaned fawns at sunrise or ensuring the peregrine falcons have ample perch to survey their domain, Harper's routine is a labor of love. Her keen eyes, the color of a stormy sea, reflect the natural world that surrounds her. Even on the busiest of days, a sense of serene purpose guides her every step, grounding her in the sanctuary's rhythms.

Today, as the first golden rays stretch across the dew-kissed grass, the air is thick with anticipation. A new addition to Greenwood is expected—a rescued red-tailed hawk with a broken wing. Harper feels the familiar thrill of challenge rise within her, eager to welcome another soul into the fold and begin the journey of healing.
