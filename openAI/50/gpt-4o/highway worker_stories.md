In the hushed prelude to dawn, when the sky was still an inky blue bruised with the first traces of gold, Thomas Avery Keller was already at work. The highway stretched endlessly before him, an asphalt artery that pulsed with the promise of the journeys to come but was now quiet and deserted, a momentary pause before the day's fevered rush.

Nestled within the rolling plains of Kansas, Route 87 was Thomas’s canvas, a long stretch of road that arched over gentle hills and snaked through fields of whispering wheat. To him, this patch of tarmac was more than infrastructure; it was a testament to endurance and progress, a silent witness to countless stories played out beneath its tire-worn surface.

Clad in his neon orange vest that shone even in the dusky morning light, Thomas carried his thermos of coffee, its warmth seeping through his gloves. Around him, the early morning mist clung to the edges of the pavement and the air was crisp, filling his lungs with a vitality that invigorated him, despite the early hour. The world was still asleep, save for the occasional bird that dared to break the silence with its early chirping, testing the tranquility of the new day.

Years spent working these roads had etched the rhythm of the highway into Thomas's soul. His hands bore the calluses of countless hours spent in service of the road, yet his spirit remained gentle, a testament to his unyielding dedication. As he began his task for the day, inspecting and repairing the scarred surface of Route 87, Thomas knew every crack and bump by heart. To him, each imperfection called out for attention, and it was his job — his promise — to ensure that travel would remain smooth and safe for the strangers who would soon traverse this stretch of America.

Today, like every day, Thomas Avery Keller worked alone in the quiet morning light, a guardian of the highway, illuminated by the pastel glow of a nascent sun.
