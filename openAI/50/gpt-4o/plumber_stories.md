In the small, sleepy town of Millridge, where the hum of cicadas serenaded the lazy summer afternoons, Wesley “Wes” Jacobson was known as the man who could coax even the most stubborn pipes into submission. His reputation was a point of pride in a place where everybody knew everybody else's business. The town sat nestled at the edge of Cedarwood Forest, its narrow streets lined with charming, albeit time-worn, Victorian houses that mirrored the quiet and steadfast nature of its residents.

Wes, a robust figure of a man at six foot two, with sun-weathered skin and hands roughened by years of honest work, had opened Jacobson & Sons Plumbing in the heart of Main Street. The name was a hopeful gesture towards a future he imagined filled with bright-eyed progeny, though for now, it was only him. His shop, a haven of copper piping and clinking wrenches, was his second home, replete with the unmistakable scent of earth and metal.

On this particular morning, the horizon was painted with the gold and pink hues of dawn, casting a warm glow on the sleepy facades of Millridge. As Wes sipped his morning coffee on the rustic wooden bench outside his shop, the world slowly came to life around him. Birds twittered jovially, and the soft rustle of leaves whispered secrets in the gentle breeze.

Wes was only half-listening to the morning symphony, his mind already tackling the problems of the day ahead. His first call was just down Ash Street, at the old Fletcher residence, a quaint if not slightly dilapidated manor that had seen more than its fair share of plumbing woes. As the coffee's warmth slipped through him, hinting at the promise of a good day, Wes couldn't shake the feeling that the town had its own secrets buried beneath the years of quiet, unassuming life. Secrets that, perhaps, he would one day uncover.
