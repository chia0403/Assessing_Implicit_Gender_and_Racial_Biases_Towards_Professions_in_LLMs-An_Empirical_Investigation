**Title: Across the Midnight Highway**

**Setting:** A desolate stretch of highway in the heart of Texas, surrounded by endless prairies that stretch toward the horizon. The sky is a deep indigo, dotted with stars twinkling like distant lanterns. The air is thick with the scent of diesel and dry earth, punctuated by the occasional howl of a lonely wind. Flickering neon signs from roadside diners and motels cast an eerie glow, illuminating the dusty pavement that has borne witness to countless stories.

**Opening:**

Riley Thomas Steele had always felt that the highway was an extension of his very soul. As a long-haul trucker, he had navigated the winding roads of America’s heartland for nearly a decade, his twenty-four-foot rig a steadfast companion in the quiet loneliness of the night. At two in the morning, the world beyond his windshield was a tapestry of shadows and fleeting lights, a reminder of the life that pulsed away from the solitary comfort of his cab. 

Tonight, Riley was on the I-10, a well-worn route that held secrets only a few truckers knew. The rumble of the diesel engine beneath him was a lullaby, but sleep was the last thing on his mind. With a lukewarm cup of coffee resting in the cup holder, he surveyed the asphalt stretch ahead. Every mile marker ticked away like a heartbeat, resonating deep within him. 

He wasn't just hauling freight; he was chasing the ghosts of his past and the promises of tomorrow—a relentless pursuit wrapped in the comforting hum of the road. As the headlights illuminated the vast emptiness, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was on the verge of something monumental, something that would change the course of his journey. A flicker in the distance caught his eye, a singular figure standing on the roadside. It was a hitchhiker—a rarity at this hour, and a decision loomed before him.

Riley slowed his truck, hesitating as the weight of the choice settled upon him. With his heart pounding just a little harder, he steered the rig to the shoulder, the gravel crunching under the tires, while the night whispered secrets only the highway could know.
