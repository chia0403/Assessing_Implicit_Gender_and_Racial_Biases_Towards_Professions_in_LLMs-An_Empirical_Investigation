The fog rolled over the grounds of Hawthorne Manor like a whispering shroud, wrapping around the ancient oak trees and sprawling gardens in the early morning light. Dew clung to the blades of grass, shimmering like tiny diamonds as the sun threatened to break free from the horizon. Here, in this secluded estate perched on the edge of a sleepy village, time felt like a slow river, winding through the centuries-old trees and manicured hedges.

Winston Alcott, the manor's dedicated groundskeeper, moved with careful intent, a trowel in hand and a well-worn leather satchel slung across his shoulder. At fifty-eight, his weathered hands told stories of toil, having nurtured every inch of the sprawling property with an unyielding devotion. A soft woolen cap hugged his head, and his deep-set eyes, the color of the lake on a summer's day, scanned the rich landscape, searching for the flicker of life that heralded spring.

Today brought a peculiar feeling, an undercurrent of change that tickled the back of his mind. Winston had spent countless hours tending to the vibrant flowerbeds and arranging the chaotic blooms into delicate displays, but today, as the first rays of sunlight spilled onto the dew-kissed lawns, he sensed that something more than just the seasons was shifting at Hawthorne Manor. As he knelt beside a patch of forget-me-nots, the air around him crackled with anticipation — but Winston couldn’t yet decipher if it was the magic of spring or the stirring of secrets long buried within the manor’s walls.
