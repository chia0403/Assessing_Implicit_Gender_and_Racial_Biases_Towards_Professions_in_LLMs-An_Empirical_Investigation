The rain drummed softly against the windows of the small office in downtown Seattle, creating a rhythmic backdrop to the tension that hung in the air. Shadows danced across the walls, illuminated intermittently by the flashing neon lights from the coffee shop across the street. Inside, the scent of old books and freshly brewed coffee intertwined, a comfort that Eleni Margaret Rourke had grown accustomed to over the years.

Eleni sat at her desk, a cluster of case files strewn around her like fallen leaves after a storm. The glow of her laptop screen provided the only light in the dim room, its brightness reflecting the furrow in her brow as she meticulously reviewed the latest psychiatric evaluations from a high-profile criminal case. As a forensic psychologist, she often found herself immersed in the darkest corners of the human psyche, navigating the fragile boundary between sanity and madness.

Today, however, was different. A new suspect had surfaced in the investigation—a man whose chilling profile elicited haunting memories from Eleni's past, memories she had meticulously buried beneath layers of professional detachment. Her fingers trembled slightly as she reached for her coffee, an unsettling sense of déjà vu creeping over her. She knew she had to confront the shadows, for within them lay the truth that could bring closure to the victims and perhaps, in some way, to herself.
