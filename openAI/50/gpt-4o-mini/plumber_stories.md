The sun was dipping below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the small town of Maplewood, where the autumn leaves danced in crisp, cool breezes. On the edge of town, tucked between a family-owned bakery and an old hardware store, stood a modest brick office with a weathered wooden sign that read “Harris Plumbing Services.” As the last customers of the day stepped out into the street, a familiar clanking of tools echoed from inside.

In the cramped back office, a young man named Samuel Gregory Harris sat hunched over a cluttered desk, scribbling notes in his worn ledger. With tousled dark hair and a smudge of grease on his cheek, Samuel was a picture of determination. Despite having spent most of the day toiling under sinks and in basements, he thrived in the world of pipes and water flow, unraveling the mysteries of broken bathrooms and faulty faucets. 

As the evening wore on, an unexpected knock echoed through the office, pulling Samuel from his thoughts. He glanced at the clock, registering the late hour, but curiosity tinged with concern compelled him to answer. Little did he know, beyond that office door lay a plumbing emergency that would challenge everything he thought he knew about his craft—and himself.
