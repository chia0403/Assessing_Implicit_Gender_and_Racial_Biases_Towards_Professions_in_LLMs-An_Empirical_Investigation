**Story Opening and Setting**

The sun dipped low on the horizon of coastal Montserrat, spilling molten gold across the cerulean waters and casting a warm glow over the bustling town of Plymouth. Nestled between vibrant bougainvillea and swaying palm trees stood **Adeline Margaret Thorne’s** quaint travel agency, “Wanderlust Expeditions.” The charming little shop was awash in bright colors and adorned with maps from far-flung corners of the globe, each waiting to unveil secrets and adventures to eager travelers.

Inside, the scent of fresh coffee blended with the sweet aroma of coconut and sea salt wafting in through the open windows. Adeline, a spirited woman in her late thirties with a penchant for adventure, was sorting through a stack of brochures, her fingers dancing over the glossy pages depicting distant lands. With her warm brown eyes sparkling with enthusiasm, she often found herself daydreaming about the exotic destinations she peddled—places like ancient temples in Peru and the pristine beaches of Thailand.

As the last customers of the day filtered out, Adeline circled the desk, her well-worn leather satchel slung over her shoulder, ready to close up shop. Just as she reached for the door, a sharp gust of wind rustled through the open window, carrying with it a peculiar flyer that landed gracefully at her feet. Bending down to pick it up, she noticed it wasn’t one of the usual travel promotions, but rather a mysterious invitation to a hidden island rumored to hold treasures from a forgotten era. Intrigued, Adeline felt a spark of excitement light up her core—perhaps this was a sign, a call to adventure that she simply couldn’t ignore.
