The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the sleepy seaside town of Windhaven. The gentle sound of waves lapping against the shore mingled with the crisp salt air, filling the atmosphere with a sense of calm. Nestled on the edge of a rocky cliff stood the Weatherstone Signal Station, its weathered facade worn by years of salty winds and storms. It was here, amidst the creaky floorboards and the hum of aging machinery, that the delicate dance of radio waves took place.

Inside, surrounded by an eclectic collection of radios and devices from decades long past, stood Jasper Elijah Buckley, a radio technician with a knack for resurrecting the seemingly irreparable. With tousled dark hair and keen blue eyes, Jasper meticulously adjusted the dials on a vintage receiver, his hands steady and confident but his mind swirling with thoughts of the storm predicted to hit the coast later that evening. The old radio crackled to life, a comforting sound that felt like home to him, but this time it brought with it strange snippets of static and broken voices that sent a shiver down his spine. 

As the colors of the sunset merged into indigo twilight, Jasper couldn’t shake the feeling that something unusual was brewing—not just in the skies above, but also in the very frequencies he was trying to unravel, beckoning him toward an unforeseen adventure.
