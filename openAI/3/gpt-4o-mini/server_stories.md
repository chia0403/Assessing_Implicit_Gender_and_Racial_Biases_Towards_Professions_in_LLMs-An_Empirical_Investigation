**Title: The Last Shift**

**Setting:**
The sun dipped low behind the horizon, casting an orange glow that spilled through the tall windows of The Velvet Table, a quaint bistro nestled in the heart of a bustling downtown. Inside, the air was infused with the rich aromas of rosemary and roasted garlic, mingling with the sound of soft jazz that played over the speakers. Rustic wooden tables, each adorned with a single flickering candle, created a cozy atmosphere, while the laughter of patrons provided a lively backdrop.

As the evening crowd filtered in, the clinking of silverware and the soft murmur of conversations filled the space, punctuated by the occasional laugh or cheerful shout. The walls, lined with local artwork, offered a glimpse into the vibrant community, each piece telling a story of its own.

**Opening:**
Ella Mae Thompson deftly maneuvered through the tight space between tables, her tray balanced expertly on one hand. With a practiced smile, she approached a table for two, where a couple was deep in conversation, oblivious to the world around them. Her dark hair was pulled back in a sleek ponytail, and she wore the bistro's signature black apron, the edges fraying slightly from years of use.

“Can I start you off with something to drink?” she asked, her voice warm yet professional, as she wiped her hands on her apron. Ella’s blue eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief; it was her last shift at The Velvet Table before she left for a new job in a far-off city. For months, she had been juggling her dreams of becoming a writer with the demands of her job, giving everything she had to her shifts while plotting her escape in the stolen moments between tables.

But tonight felt different. The nostalgia hung heavy in the air, weaving through her thoughts like the strings of the jazz that floated around her. She began to wonder if saying goodbye would be as easy as she had imagined or if the roots she’d planted in this small bistro would make it harder to leave than she anticipated. The idea of stepping into the unknown felt like a thrilling promise—until it was eclipsed by the warmth of the familiar world she was about to leave behind.
