In the small, fog-draped village of Eldergrove, nestled between the dense, whispering woods and the serpentine river that glimmered like silver under the moonlight, stood a rustic butcher shop known as "Harris & Sons." The establishment, with its creaking wooden sign swaying gently in the bracing autumn breeze, was both a cornerstone of the community and a place of whispered tales. 

It was here that Leland Everett Harris, a man in his late thirties with a sturdy build and hands calloused from years of work, crafted his trade. Leland’s face was framed by a tangled beard, speckled with gray, and his deep-set blue eyes held the keen sharpness of someone accustomed to observing the intricate dance of life and death. Each morning, as the first light broke over Eldergrove, he would unlock the door to his shop, the familiar scent of aged wood and raw meat mingling in the air. 

As the townsfolk began their day, they’d shuffle in, greeted by the soft chime of the brass bell above the door, exchanging pleasantries with Leland as he expertly sliced and prepared cuts of pork, beef, and lamb. Yet beneath his congenial exterior lay a restless spirit; Leland was haunted by the secrets of his craft.  Rumors whispered in the shadows, tales of the old woods that flourished just beyond the village's edge, spoke of strange rituals and lost souls, and though Leland tried to shake them away, he couldn’t help but feel their tug on his heartstrings, like the pull of the tide. 

The sun dipped low, casting long shadows through the shop's window, when he noticed an unfamiliar figure standing in the doorway—clad in a tattered cloak, their face obscured in the evening gloom, they seemed to carry the weight of untold stories. Leland felt a chill crawl up his spine; this was not just any customer, he sensed, but perhaps a harbinger of a change that could shake the very foundations of Eldergrove and his world as a butcher.
