The fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead in the empty corridors of Westwood High School, casting a stark glow on the polished linoleum floors. It was late in the evening, and the clatter of students had long since faded, leaving behind a silence that felt almost heavy in the air. The walls were lined with colorful student artwork, depicting everything from abstract shapes to vibrant landscapes, but now, in the fading light, they seemed to cast silent shadows of their former life.

In the heart of this quiet building, 43-year-old Leonard Gregory Phelps moved methodically through the hallways with a well-worn mop in hand. Dressed in a faded navy-blue jumpsuit that had seen better days, he paused to catch his breath, leaning against the graffiti-tagged bathroom door. A thin layer of dust shimmered in his wake, the gentle sound of his mop swishing against the floor breaking the stillness. Leonard had spent the better part of two decades maintaining this very school, and while some might see his role as menial, he viewed it as crucial—a guardian of sorts, keeping the laughter and learning from becoming drowned in chaos.

The scent of bleach mixed with the remnants of lunch—taco Tuesday, his least favorite day to clean. Yet, he found solace in this routine, the predictability of it. Lost in his thoughts, he reflected on the dreams he had shelved long ago—aspirations of becoming a painter, ideas of penning his own stories. But life had a way of settling into a rhythm, and Leonard's was one of cleaning up after others, all the while crafting small artful moments of his own in the way he lined up the chairs in the library or arranged the art supplies just so in the classroom.

As he rounded a corner, the echo of a distant laughter reverberated down the hall. Leonard paused, the sound drawing him out of his solitude. Something felt out of place. He squinted down the corridor, half-expecting it to be a trick of the mind, a ghost of the school’s vibrant past. But the laughter continued—a tinkle like glass breaking through the stillness. Setting down his mop, he cautiously approached the source, curiosity piqued, heart racing ever so slightly. What he found behind the art room door would change not only his night but perhaps the course of his life entirely.
