**Story Opening:**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm, golden hue over Crestwood High School. The once-bustling hallways were now quiet, the echoes of laughter and the clicking of lockers replaced by the soft rustle of papers in the guidance office. It was here, amidst the comforting chaos of college brochures and motivational posters, that Eleanor Ruth Morgan, the school’s dedicated guidance counselor, prepared for another day of listening and helping.

Eleanor pushed her round glasses up the bridge of her nose and surveyed the cluttered desk in front of her, a splash of color on the wall behind her that featured a giant poster reading “Every Journey Begins with a Single Step.” She had always believed in the power of that mantra, for each student who walked through the door carried a story waiting to unfold. Today, however, felt different. The air was thick with unspoken tension, a sense of anticipation that made Eleanor’s heart race just a bit faster. 

As she organized her notes for the day’s sessions, she caught sight of the clock, its hands creeping toward 9 AM. There were whispers in the hall, an undercurrent of anxiety buzzing among the students, and Eleanor couldn’t shake the feeling that something significant was about to happen. 

She opened her notebook and began to jot down her thoughts, reminding herself that she was more than just a guide; she was a confidante, a beacon of hope for those struggling to find their path. Little did she know, the day would test not only her skills but her very belief in the resilience of the human spirit.
