**Setting: Willow Creek Estates, an expansive, decaying estate nestled in the heart of the countryside, enveloped by dense woods and sprawling meadows. The once-majestic mansion stands as a testament to a bygone era, with ivy creeping up its crumbling stone walls and ornate gardens now choked with wild weeds. The air is thick with the fragrance of damp earth and the distant sound of chirping birds, though a sense of quiet melancholy hangs in the atmosphere. It is late autumn, and the leaves are beginning to flutter down, carpeting the grounds in shades of amber and crimson.**

**Story Opening:**

As the first rays of dawn broke over Willow Creek Estates, casting golden light on the tangled remnants of its once-pristine gardens, a figure emerged from the shadows of the old stone shed. Thomas Edgar Finch, groundskeeper and solitary guardian of this fading grandeur, adjusted the worn cap on his head and squinted against the brightening sky. At fifty-two, Thomas bore the weathered countenance of a man deeply intertwined with the land he tended—a life etched in the lines of his face and the earth beneath his fingernails. 

In his hands, he held a rusted pair of shears, the familiar weight offering him comfort as he stepped across the overgrown lawn, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind. Each snip of the shears and rustle of leaves resonated with echoes of laughter from gatherings long past, and the careless joy of children playing beneath the now-barren branches of ancient oak trees. 

Today felt different, though. The air crackled with an energy that sent a shiver down his spine. As he moved deeper into the grounds, past the sagging rose trellises and wildflower patches, Thomas couldn’t shake the sense that something was waiting just beyond the edge of his vision—something that would change the fate of Willow Creek forever.
