The sun dipped low behind the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the grand facade of the Evercrest Hotel. The historic structure, with its ivy-clad balconies and ornate wrought-iron details, stood proudly against the backdrop of the rolling hills of Silverwood Valley. Inside, the lobby buzzed with the low hum of conversations and the clinking of glasses from the bar, where guests mingled after a long day of adventures.

In the midst of this lively atmosphere was Edgar Maximilian Bellamy, a wiry young man of twenty-four with an ever-present twinkle in his green eyes. Dressed in a crisp black uniform adorned with the Evercrest insignia, Edgar moved gracefully from one guest to another. With a practiced ease, he offered a warm smile and a courteous bow before taking up their luggage, ready to whisk them to their rooms. The whispers of velvet curtains and the scent of polished wood enveloped him as he navigated the hotel halls, each echoing step a reminder of the stories woven into the very fabric of the Evercrest.

But today felt different. As Edgar entered the service elevator, he glanced down at an old brass key he had found buried in the innermost pocket of one of the suitcasesâ€”a key that seemed far older than the hotel itself. The worn engraving shimmered in the fading light, hinting at the secrets locked away in the shadows of the past. With the key clenched tightly in his palm, Edgar's heart raced with the thrill of mystery, igniting a yearning for adventure that had always simmered just beneath the surface. Little did he know, the echoes of the past were about to collide with his present, unveiling a tale far beyond the mundane life of a bellhop.
