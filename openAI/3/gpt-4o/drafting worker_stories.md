In the sleepy town of Ormsby, nestled between sprawling oak forests and shimmering lakes, the morning sun spilled its golden light over neat rows of red-bricked houses. Birds chirped cheerfully, heralding the start of another day, as gentle breezes carried the scent of dew-kissed earth through open windows. On Maple Street, the air was filled with the soft hum of industry from the small, unassuming building at the corner. Inside, draftsman Harrison Lloyd sat at his wide, wooden workstation, the surface cluttered with pencils, rulers, and crisp sheets of drafting paper.

Harrison, with his sleeves rolled up and a pencil tucked behind his ear, embodied quiet diligence. His fingers moved deftly over the paper, guided by years of experience and the practiced ease of familiarity. He was a man in his element, surrounded by the muted colors of mechanical blueprints and architectural sketches that soon would transform into tangible structures.

The drafting room was an organized chaos of ideas and dreams, filled with the smell of graphite and the faint whir of a nearby ceiling fan cutting through the early heat. A soft light filtered through the tall windows, illuminating the dust particles that floated lazily in the air, creating an atmosphere where imagination met precision.

Harrison Lloyd—meticulous and steady—found solace in the consistency of his work, a stark contrast to the unpredictable nature of the world outside. Yet, even in this tranquil setting, the winds of change were beginning to stir; whispers of a new project had reached him, one that promised to be unlike any he had tackled before. As he sharpened his pencil and glanced at the clock, something in the air told him that today would not unfold as any ordinary day.
