On a blustery autumn morning in the heart of Willow Creek, a quaint coastal town known for its cobblestone streets and whispering pines, Samuel "Sam" Everhart trudged along the narrow lane leading to Millward House. The legendary manor, perched atop a hill overlooking the churning gray sea, had seen better days but remained the talk of the town thanks to its elaborate architecture and mysterious past. With storm clouds gathering on the horizon, Sam knew he had little time to fix the faulty wiring before the weather worsened.

As an electrician and one of the few tradespeople willing to take on work in the notorious manor, Samâ€™s reputation as a skilled and fearless professional had become well-deserved. He was known around Willow Creek for his unwavering dedication and meticulous work. His overalls, though worn and stained from years of labor, were a testament to his relentless passion for keeping the town well-lit and powered despite its old-world charm.

Sam paused momentarily at the gates of Millward House, reflecting on the task ahead. Rumors swirled like the leaves in the wind about the ghosts that roamed its shadowed halls, and though Sam didn't believe in such stories, the house did have an undeniable presence. With a resolute nod to himself, he pushed open the rusted iron gate, the sound echoing through the still air, and stepped onto the overgrown path that led to the front door, ready to uncover whatever secrets the old circuits held.
