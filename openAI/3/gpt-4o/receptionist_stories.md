The morning sun cast a golden hue over the bustling streets of downtown Portland, reflecting off the glass facades of modern skyscrapers. Serena Caldwell stood in front of the entrance to the Meridian Building, her scarf fluttering slightly in the crisp autumn breeze. She took a moment to appreciate the russet and amber tapestry of leaves that decorated the trees lining the avenue. Reassured by the familiar sights and sounds of the city waking up around her, she pushed open the heavy glass doors and stepped inside.

The lobby of the Meridian Building was a symphony of polished marble and soft, ambient lighting. As the receptionist for London and Owen Associates, headquartered on the 18th floor, Serena was the first face many people saw each day. Her desk, a neat island amidst the grand expanse, was strategically placed beneath the warm glow of pendant lights. She took her seat, organizing her workspace with the precision of an air traffic controller, ensuring every paper clip and pen was in its rightful place.

The steady hum of the elevator and the distant clatter of heels on the marble floor signaled the beginning of another day. Serena adjusted the nameplate on her desk, smiling at the familiar black letters that spelled out "Serena Caldwell." Her job was more than just answering phones and greeting visitors; she was the invisible hand that kept the complex gears of the office turning seamlessly. With a deep breath, she embraced the day with her signature poise and professionalism.
