In the heart of the bustling city of Skelton Bay, where neon lights cast vibrant reflections on rain-slicked streets, stood a small, dimly lit bar known as The Silent Eel. Tucked away in a forgotten alley, it was the kind of place where secrets were whispered over clinking glasses and time seemed to lose its grip. The aroma of aged whiskey and polished wood lingered in the air, blending with the soft hum of a vintage jukebox playing jazz standards in the background.

Behind the polished oak bar, Johnathan "Jack" Sullivan worked his craft with an easy dexterity born of years spent tending to the whims of thirsty patrons. Jack was a man of few words, his quiet demeanor contrasting sharply with the lively conversations buzzing around him. His eyes held stories untold, and his hands moved with the assured precision of someone who’d found his place in the ebb and flow of nightly exchanges.

Tonight, as the rain drummed steadily on the pavement outside, Jack poured a glass of smoky bourbon for a regular seated at the end of the bar. His attention, however, was drawn to the new face walking through the worn wooden door—a solitary figure, silhouetted against the vibrant glow of the street beyond, searching for refuge from the storm.
