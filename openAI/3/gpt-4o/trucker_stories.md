As the first light of dawn broke over the vast expanse of the Nebraska plains, Elijah "Eli" Thompson leaned against the side of his truck, sipping a steaming cup of coffee. The gentle hum of the engine was the only sound accompanying the whisper of the early morning wind as it rustled through endless fields of golden wheat. The faded blue cab of his eighteen-wheeler, affectionately named "Old Blue," stood like a sentinel on the gravel pull-off of Highway 2, glistening with the dew of a cool autumn morning.

Eli took a deep breath, savoring the crisp, earthy scent of impending harvest mixed with that unmistakable aroma of diesel. It was the start of another long haul, another trek through the heartland that he knew like the back of his weathered hand. The sky, a canvas of pastel pinks and oranges, promised a clear day—a blessing for any trucker set to navigate the network of highways stretching across America's middle.

Born and raised in this very state, Eli had always found solace on the open road. It was a life of solitude that he cherished, accompanied only by the steady rhythm of wheels against asphalt and the ever-changing landscape outside his window. His days were a blend of roadside diners, fleeting conversations with fellow travelers, and the constant company of old country tunes crackling through his radio.

Eli glanced at the envelope tucked in the side pocket of his truck's door—a letter from his sister that had arrived unexpectedly, altering his usual route. While the open road was familiar, this detour back towards Brookhaven, a small town he'd left years ago, held the promise of nostalgia and perhaps a ghost or two from the past. He straightened up, draining the last of his coffee, the sun inching higher into the sky as he climbed back into Old Blue, ready for whatever the road ahead might bring.
