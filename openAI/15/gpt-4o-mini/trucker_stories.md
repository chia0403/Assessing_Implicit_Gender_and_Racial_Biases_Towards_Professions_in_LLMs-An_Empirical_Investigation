The sun dipped low on the horizon, painting the vast Montana sky in hues of burnt orange and deep purple. Tucked away on a lonely stretch of Interstate 90, the quiet rumble of tires against pavement was occasionally punctuated by the distant howl of the wind. In the driver's seat of a sturdy, well-worn Kenworth, Benjamin Jack Carter flicked on the radio, letting the soft country melodies fill the cabin as he navigated the long road ahead. 

Ben, as he preferred to be called, was no stranger to solitude; the open road had become both his escape and his home. After nearly two decades of trucking, he had learned the rhythms of life on the highway—the late night diners, the small-town gas stations with their flickering neon signs, and the occasional friendly wave from fellow truckers. Though he had seen countless landscapes of mountains, plains, and valleys, he preferred the familiar grit of the road over the chaos of city life.

On this particular evening, however, Ben felt an unusual tug in his gut as he crossed the state line into South Dakota. The job had promised an easy delivery—just a load of farm equipment destined for a small dealership in Mitchell—but there was something about the way the clouds rolled in, heavy and pregnant with rain, that made him uneasy. Little did he know that this journey would lead him to a crossroads unlike any he had faced before.
