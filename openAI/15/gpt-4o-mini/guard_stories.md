In the shadow of the ancient stone walls of Eldermere Castle, the air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and moss. Twilight draped itself over the sprawling grounds, painting the sky in hues of indigo and gold as the day relinquished its hold. Flickering torches illuminated the path leading to the castleâ€™s entrance, casting elongated shadows that danced like phantoms upon the cobblestones.

Roderick Braithwaite, a burly man in his thirties, stood resolute at his post, the weight of his armor pressing against his broad shoulders. He adjusted the grip on his spear, its polished shaft glinting in the evening light. The faint sounds of a distant revelry echoed from within the castle walls, where lords and ladies celebrated, blissfully unaware of the watchful eyes that kept them safe.

A chill breeze whispered through the trees lining the castle grounds, rustling the leaves like secrets too fragile to be spoken aloud. Roderick's keen gaze swept the darkening horizon, searching for any signs of trouble while his mind wandered to the tales of peril that often slipped through the lines of his duty. He had spent eight years safeguarding Eldermere, dedicating his life to the legends that had grown around its towering spires, yet none had prepared him for what awaited that fateful night.
