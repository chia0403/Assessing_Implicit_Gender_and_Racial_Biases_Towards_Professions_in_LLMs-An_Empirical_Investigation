In the heart of the small town of Ravenswood, where the fog clung to the earth like a secret too heavy to share, stood the sprawling estate of the late Lord Thaddeus Wainwright. The once-magnificent grounds, now tangled in vines and wildflowers, were tended to by a solitary figure known to few but whispered about by many. 

Maxwell Edgar Thompson, a groundskeeper of twenty years, swept the grounds with a practiced hand, his calloused palms molding the handle of his trusted rake like a second skin. Each morning, as the sun broke through the fog, painting the dew-kissed grass in shades of gold, he would arrive before the dawn chorus of birds began its daily performance. The estate, with its weathered gargoyles and crumbling stone pathways, had once been alive with laughter and music, but now it sat in an eerie silence, echoing only the rustling leaves and the distant call of a lonely crow.

Maxwell had long learned to embrace the solitude of his life among the overgrown hedges and forgotten alcoves, finding solace in the rhythm of his work. As he cleared away the tangled weeds that sought to reclaim the land, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was stirring within the shadows of the estate—an energy both haunting and inviting. It wrapped around him, a tapestry of whispered secrets and half-formed memories, begging to be unearthed. Today, he sensed, was the day the past would begin to intertwine with his quiet existence.
