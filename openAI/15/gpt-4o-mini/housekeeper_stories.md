In the early hours of a misty November morning, the quaint village of Elderwood stirred slowly to life. It was a small place, cradled between rolling hills and thick woods, where the cobbled streets whispered tales of old and the air was perfumed with the tang of damp earth and wood smoke. At the edge of this idyllic hamlet stood the grand estate of Thornfield Manor, a sprawling structure with ivy-clad stone walls and towering chimneys that reached toward the sky like ancient sentinels.

Inside, the soft creak of floorboards echoed through the dimly lit halls as Evelyn Clara Hargrove, the manor’s dedicated housekeeper, moved silently from room to room. With her chestnut hair pinned neatly at the nape of her neck and her crisp white apron bearing evidence of her toil, Mrs. Hargrove was a figure of both grace and resilience. She had spent the better part of two decades in service to the enigmatic Lord Alistair Blackwood, whose presence loomed as large as the manor itself.

As the first rays of sunlight broke free from the horizon, filtering through the heavy draperies of the grand drawing room, Evelyn paused for a moment, taking in the beauty surrounding her. Dust motes floated lazily in the golden glow, and the portrait of Lord Blackwood loomed above the fireplace, his gaze eternally fixed on an unseen plummet beyond the walls of his estate. Today, however, there was a tremor in the air, a sense of anticipation that made Evelyn’s heart race as she prepared for the day’s tasks. Little did she know that this morning would unravel secrets long buried, forever changing the course of her life at Thornfield Manor.
