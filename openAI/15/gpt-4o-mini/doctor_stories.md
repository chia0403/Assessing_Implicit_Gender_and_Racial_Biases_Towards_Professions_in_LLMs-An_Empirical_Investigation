The rain fell in relentless sheets over the small coastal town of Ravenswood, each drop drumming a steady rhythm against the hospital’s weathered roof. The air was heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed, mingled with the sterile smell of antiseptic that clung to the walls of Ravenswood Medical Center. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, illuminating the bustling corridors where nurses hurried past, their soft chatter punctuated by the distant echoes of medical machines.

Dr. Eliana Harper stood at the nurses’ station, her dark hair pulled into a messy bun, revealing a few stubborn strands that had escaped the confines of her workday. She glanced at the clock—a minute until 8 PM—and braced herself for another long night shift. Outside her window, storm clouds loomed, casting an ominous shadow over the town she had called home for the past five years. The crashing waves were a constant reminder of nature’s power, much like the weight of her responsibilities here at the hospital.

Eliana’s heart raced as she flipped through a patient’s chart, her brow furrowing in concentration. The emergency room had been unusually busy today; a mixture of seasonal flu, minor accidents, and the occasional panic attack had kept her on her toes. But it wasn't just the medical challenges that concerned her — it was the whispers she'd overheard, lurking among the staff. Murmurs of an uptick in something more dangerous, something darker, happening in Ravenswood as the storm approached.

The wind howled outside, rattling the windows. Eliana took a deep breath, focusing on the task at hand. She had always believed that medicine was a blend of science and compassion, and tonight, as she stepped towards the examination room, she reminded herself of the lives she was meant to save—storm or no storm.
