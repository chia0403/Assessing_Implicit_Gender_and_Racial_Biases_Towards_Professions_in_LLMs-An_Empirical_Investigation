In the heart of the bustling town of Eldershire, where cobblestone streets wind through vibrant markets and fragrant bakeries, stood a modest yet renowned establishment—Grandel's Butchery. The shop was an unassuming structure, its weathered wooden sign creaking in the afternoon breeze, adorned with hand-painted images of cuts of meat and hanging sausages. Inside, the rich aroma of aged leather and freshly cut herbs enveloped customers like a warm hug.

At the center of this world was Edgar J. Grandel, a stocky man with a salt-and-pepper beard that could have told tales of its own. He wore a blood-red apron stained with the marks of a day’s work, and his hands, thick and calloused, skillfully wielded a cleaver that seemed almost like an extension of his being. Edgar had inherited the shop from his father and prided himself on sourcing only the best cuts from local farms, believing that good meat came from animals raised with care.

Every morning, just as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Edgar would open the heavy wooden door of his butchery, a ritual that marked the beginning of another day filled with the sounds of sizzling, chopping, and laughter. The bell above the door chimed cheerfully as customers filtered in, many of them greeting him by name, sharing stories of their families over the counter lined with glistening cuts of beef and pork.

But as the shadows lengthened in the late afternoon sun, a different energy began to stir in Eldershire. Whispers of strange happenings and shadowy figures had recently begun to weave their way through the streets, and Edgar couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was lurking just beyond the edges of the bustling marketplace, watching.
