**Setting:**

The early morning sun filtered through the large windows of a modest but tidy office located on the outskirts of a small, bustling town. The room was filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the faint rustle of papers as the hum of computers filled the air. Tax season had officially begun, and the office was already buzzing with activity. Stacks of client files lined the desk, each one holding the hopes and anxieties of individuals and families eager to secure their refunds.

**Story Opening:**

At her cluttered desk, Evelyn Marie Jenkins meticulously sorted through a mountain of paperwork, her brow furrowed in concentration. With a quick glance at her wall clock, she noted that it was barely 8:30 AM—yet already, the phone had rung twice, and the waiting area was starting to fill with anxious clients flipping through tax brochures. Evelyn had always loved this time of year, a bittersweet mix of chaos and camaraderie, where every number told a story, and every deduction brought relief.

As an experienced income tax preparer, she had learned to read people much like she read tax forms. She could sense the nervous energy of a single mother seeking every possible credit for her family, or the quiet desperation of a retiree worried about an unexpected tax bill. Evelyn thrived on the challenge, careful to uphold the balance between professionalism and empathy. Today, however, felt different. There was an electricity in the air, as if the weight of an unspoken concern hovered just beneath the surface—an anxious whisper echoing through her small office.

Taking a sip of her coffee, Evelyn prepared for another day of transforming numbers into resolutions, unaware that a client's return was about to change everything.
