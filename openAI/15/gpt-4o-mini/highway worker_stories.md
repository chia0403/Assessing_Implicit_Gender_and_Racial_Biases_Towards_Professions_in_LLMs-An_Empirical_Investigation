**Title: The Last Call**

**Setting:**

It was a sprawling stretch of highway that cut through the arid welcomes of Arizona, dotted with the occasional saguaro cactus reaching up to the sun. The pavement shimmered with heat, creating a mirage that danced in the distance near the rugged mountains. The air was dry, buzzing with the distant hum of a passing car and the occasional rattling of gravel as a truck rolled over a pothole. A solitary rest stop, with peeling paint and faded signs, stood stark against the relentless sun, offering weary travelers a brief respite.

**Story Opening:**

As the sun climbed higher into the cobalt sky, casting long shadows from the roadside signage, Thomas Gabriel Miller tightened the grip on his shovel. Hours had melted away in the relentless heat, sweat trickling down his brow as he dug out a tire-splitting pothole that had claimed more than one unsuspecting vehicle that week. With each scrape of metal on asphalt, he felt himself slipping further into a routine that had become both lethargic and comforting—an intricate dance of labor that allowed him to forget the world beyond the orange safety cones and “Men At Work” sign.

Thomas had been a highway worker for nearly a decade, finding solace in the rhythms of his job, despite the monotony that sometimes threatened to engulf him. He was well-acquainted with the highway, each bend and curve etched into his mind like a familiar song. But today, something felt off. The air was thick with an undercurrent of anticipation, a flutter at the edges of his consciousness that he couldn’t shake. As he paused to wipe the sweat from his forehead, his gaze pivoted towards the horizon, where dust clouds were beginning to billow.

It was then that the radio crackled to life, piercing the silence with an urgent dispatch. “All units, we’ve reported a traffic incident at Mile Marker 132. Multiple vehicles involved. Requesting immediate assistance.” A frown creased Thomas’s rugged face. Beyond the mundane tasks of paving and patching, a gravitational pull towards emergencies stirred his instincts. He knew he should stay at his post, but curiosity lured him like a moth to flame.

With a resigned sigh, Thomas leaned the shovel against the roadside barrier, the promise of a new adventure igniting a flicker of excitement deep within—a rare glimmer beneath the weight of the day. With one last glance at his tools, he turned and started down the highway, the sound of engines revving and sirens in the distance calling him towards the unknown.
