**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting:** 

The small coastal town of Willow Bay is nestled between rugged cliffs and the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. With its cobblestone streets lined with quaint shops and vibrant blooms spilling from window boxes, it appears idyllic at first glance. The salty breeze carries the scent of the sea, mingling with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the local café. At the heart of the town stands a cozy wellness center, painted in soothing shades of blue and green. The gentle sound of wind chimes and the splash of water from a nearby fountain create an ambiance of serenity, making it a refuge for those seeking respite from the world.

**Opening:**

In the back room of the Willow Bay Wellness Center, the warm glow of soft lighting illuminated the delicate space, filled with the subtle scents of lavender and eucalyptus. The room was a sanctuary, where time seemed to suspend and worries melted away under the skilled hands of Felicity Mae Harrington. At thirty-two, Felicity had carved out a life that resonated with purpose and passion, her days filled with the rhythm of healing and rejuvenation.

As she prepared her massage table, meticulously arranging her essential oils and fluffy towels, Felicity couldn’t help but feel a sense of calm wash over her. This was her sanctuary, her safe haven in a world that often felt overwhelming. The ocean's roar echoed in the distance, a soothing reminder of nature’s power and beauty. She took a deep breath, inhaling the calming aroma around her, and closed her eyes for a moment.

But today was different. As she opened her eyes, she noticed a small envelope tucked beneath the corner of the table, its edges worn and yellowed with age. Intrigued, Felicity picked it up, her heart racing slightly at the prospect of discovering something hidden. Little did she know, this envelope held a message that would unravel the threads of her calm existence and lead her on a journey where the deep waters of her past would collide with the present she cherished.
