The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden glow over the rugged cliffs of the Amalfi Coast. The salty breeze carried the distant sound of waves crashing against the rocks, a soothing backdrop to the vibrant chatter of tourists wandering through the picturesque village of Positano. Colorful bougainvillea cascaded from terracotta rooftops, and the sweet scent of lemon groves hung in the air, a promise of the refreshing limoncello to come.

As she adjusted the straps of her backpack, she couldn’t help but feel a thrill surging through her—a day full of adventure awaited. 

Little did she know, this particular tour would uncover secrets that had long been buried beneath the layers of her beloved Positano, drawing her deeper into a mystery that would change her life forever.
