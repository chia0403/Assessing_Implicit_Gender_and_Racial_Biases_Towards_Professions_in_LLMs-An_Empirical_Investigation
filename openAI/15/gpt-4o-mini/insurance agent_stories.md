Title: **The Fine Print**

**Setting:** The small, quiet town of Maplewood, surrounded by lush forests and rolling hills. The golden rays of the autumn sun filter through the colorful leaves, casting a warm glow over the charming streets lined with historic brick buildings. The air carries the faint scent of cinnamon and woodsmoke, as local shops bustle with weekend activity. In the heart of this picturesque town is a modest office building, its sign reading "Maplewood Insurance Services" in faded blue letters.

**Opening:**  
The morning had begun like any other for Jasper Elliott Thompson, a thirty-something insurance agent with tousled brown hair and a penchant for plaid button-ups. Nestled behind his sturdy oak desk, chaos was a familiar companion. Stacks of paperwork teetered precariously on one side, a series of colorful sticky notes clung to his computer monitor, and a ceramic mug boasting the slogan “Keep Calm and Get Insured” handle a strong enough brew to fuel his day. 

Jasper took a deep breath, allowing the aroma of freshly brewed coffee to awaken him fully. Outside, children laughed as they traversed the sidewalk on their way to school, their backpacks bouncing with each step. For most, it was just another tranquil Saturday in Maplewood, but for Jasper, something felt off. 

He glanced up from his cluttered desk, peering out the window. A flicker of movement caught his eye—a figure dressed in a long coat, pacing back and forth in front of his office. The stranger’s face was obscured by the shadows of the brim of their hat, but the uneasy energy radiating from them sent a shiver down his spine. Unbeknownst to Jasper, this encounter would shatter the stillness of his life, leading him down a path where policies and terms were the least of his worries. 

As the town faded into the background of his mind, Jasper couldn’t shake the feeling that today would be unlike any other.
