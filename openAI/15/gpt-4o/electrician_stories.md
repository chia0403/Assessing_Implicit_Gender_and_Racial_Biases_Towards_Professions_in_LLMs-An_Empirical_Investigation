The sun had only just begun to filter through the sprawling canopy of oak and pine when Thomas Everly pulled his battered pickup truck into the gravel driveway of Maconville’s oldest grand mansion, Crescent Manor. The dew-laden grass shimmered under the morning light, casting a magical aura around the grand estate. Thomas, a skilled electrician known for his meticulous work and easy-going nature, stepped out of his truck and paused for a moment, taking in the sight before him.

Crescent Manor stood as a testament to another era, its ornate façade rich with stories of the past. Towers stretched toward the sky, the brickwork elegant yet weathered under the steadfast march of time. The structure was grand yet slightly foreboding, a reminder of both prosperity and the ghosts of history. Ivy clung to the stone like memories refusing to let go, refusing to be obscured by the relentless spread of modernity.

Thomas adjusted his tool belt and sighed contentedly, a small smile playing at his lips. He had always enjoyed working on these old buildings, unearthing their secrets through worn wires and time-tested circuits. He felt connected to the history embedded in their walls, a history that spoke not just of electricity but of the lives it illuminated and the stories it hid.

Today, as he shouldered open the back door marked “Service Entrance,” Thomas knew he was stepping into more than just a job. This place, with its whispers and creaks, was as much a character as the people he'd met over the years, and he couldn’t help but feel he was about to uncover something truly unique.
