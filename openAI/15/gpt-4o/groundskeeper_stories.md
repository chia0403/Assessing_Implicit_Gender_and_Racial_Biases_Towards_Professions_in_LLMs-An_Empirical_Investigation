On the outskirts of the sleepy town of Willowspring, nestled among towering pines and sprawling oaks, lay Greenwood Cemetery—a verdant resting place steeped in history, its silent stone sentinels bearing witness to the passage of time. It was here that Oliver Thatch had devoted his life's work, a groundskeeper by both trade and calling.

Each morning, as dawn's golden light kissed the dewy earth, Oliver would unlock the rusted iron gates, their creaky protest a familiar greeting. With a well-practiced stride, he wandered the cobblestone paths, greeting each gravestone as an old friend. From the newest marble plaques to the weathered, moss-covered markers barely legible with age, Oliver cared for them all with equal reverence.

Oliver, a man of quiet strength and gentle disposition, wore his years like a comfortable old coat. His hair, a shock of white against his tanned complexion, bore testimony to countless sunrises observed from this sacred ground. He moved with careful deliberation, tending to the sprawling grounds, ensuring each plot was as immaculate as the last, the vibrant blooms providing a fragrant tapestry of color amidst the sea of green.

This particular morning, as the mist lingering over the cemetery began to lift, Oliver paused by an ancient oak. Its gnarled roots insinuated themselves through the earth like the fingers of time itself. Here, he stood still, allowing the timeless whisper of the wind to envelope him, feeling the deep connection to this hallowed place—a place that held more secrets than the town beyond could ever fathom. With a deep, contented sigh, Oliver Thatch prepared for a day much like any other—or so he thought.
