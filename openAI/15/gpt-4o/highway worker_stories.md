In the cool, muted light of dawn, when the sky was wrapped in a soft, lavender hue, Jackson Morrow stood on the edge of Route 69, a well-worn thermos of coffee cradled in one hand. The rising sun was just beginning to peek over the rolling hills that flanked the highway, casting long shadows that danced across the asphalt. To his left, the thick pines whispered secrets to one another in the gentle morning breeze, their needles shimmering with a silver coat of dew.

Jackson adjusted his hard hat and wiped the lingering traces of sleep from his eyes. The familiar scent of fresh earth and distant diesel filled his lungs, and for a brief moment, he paused to savor the solitude before the symphony of the workday began. The air was crisp, carrying with it the promise of early spring.

This particular stretch of highway lay nestled in the heart of Appalachian country, where the land undulated like a giant's breaths, rising and falling beneath the wheel-trodden paths. Wildflowers—bluebells, daisies, and buttercups—dotted the roadside grasses, nodding cheerfully as if welcoming the few early birds on their morning commute. It was here that Jackson felt most at home, amidst the hum of engines and the rhythm of routine, where his work turned strangers' paths into stories.

As foreman of the road crew, Jackson was a guardian of sorts—a sentinel who ensured safe passage through the wild beauty that surrounded them. Today, as with many others, promised new challenges with its patchwork of fractured tarmac and potholes deep enough to swallow a truck tire. But Jackson had learned to see beyond the cracked surfaces. He understood that beneath those flaws lay the soul of the road—a pathway binding communities, connecting lives, and bearing witness to countless journeys.

He finished his coffee, the warmth spreading through him like a slow wave, and turned to face his approaching crew, each member a veteran of the highway with stories only the rumble of engines could truly appreciate. Jackson Morrow was a highway worker, yes, but in this moment, more than anything, he was a keeper of tales caught in transit, waiting under the watchful gaze of the mountains.
