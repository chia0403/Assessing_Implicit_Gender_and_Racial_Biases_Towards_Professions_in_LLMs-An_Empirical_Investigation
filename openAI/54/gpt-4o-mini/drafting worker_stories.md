In the heart of Dutton City, under the sprawling shadows of steel skyscrapers, the air buzzed with the low hum of machinery and the rhythmic tapping of keyboards. It was early morning, and the sun struggled to break through the layers of industrial fog that hung over the town like a heavy curtain. Inside the bustling offices of Bennett Architectural Firm, the scent of fresh coffee mingled with the faint odor of graphite and paper, creating an atmosphere charged with creativity and purpose.

At a long, oak table cluttered with blueprints and technical drawings, twenty-eight-year-old Oliver Lennox meticulously revised the detailed plans for the new Greenway Transit Station. His thick-rimmed glasses slid down his nose as he leaned closer to the intricate designs sprawled before him, a combination of old-world craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology. Oliver's dedication to his craft was undeniable; every detail mattered to him, and each line he drew was more than just a part of the projectâ€”it was a piece of his passion.

Outside the window, the city was waking up, vibrant with the promise of a new day. The sounds of horns honking and people chattering offered a stark contrast to the focused silence within the drafting room, where Oliver and his colleagues immersed themselves in the world of structures and designs, transforming abstract ideas into tangible reality. To Oliver, sketching was not just a job; it was the bridge between dreams and the skyline, and today, he felt particularly inspired to create something that would stand the test of time.
