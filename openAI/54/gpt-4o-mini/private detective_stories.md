The rain fell in a steady rhythm, drumming against the pavement like a secret Morse code that only the city could decipher. Neon lights flickered in the early evening gloom, casting haunting reflections onto the slick streets of New Bordeaux. In an unassuming office on the second floor of a dilapidated brick building, the smell of stale coffee mingled with the warm aroma of old paper. The room was cluttered with half-opened case files, which clung to the dim light pouring in from a dusty window.

At the heart of this organized chaos sat Arthur Lennox, a private detective with a knack for uncovering truths better left buried. With his dark hair tousled and a shadow of stubble lining his jaw, Arthur was a man who wore the city’s grit like a comfortable old coat. He leaned back in his creaking chair, fingers steepled under his chin, contemplating the latest case that had landed on his desk—a missing person report that tugged at his instincts.

As he stared out into the rain-soaked streets, watching the reflections shift and dance, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. Just then, the shrill ring of the telephone sliced through the atmosphere like a knife, dragging Arthur back to reality. He reached for the receiver, his mind already racing with the possibilities of what awaited him on the other end. Little did he know, this call would lead him down a winding path of danger and intrigue, where the shadows held more than just whispers of the past.
