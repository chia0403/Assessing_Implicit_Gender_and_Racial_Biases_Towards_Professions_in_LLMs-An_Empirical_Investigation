The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the sprawling grounds of Eldermoor Estate. Tucked away in the quiet countryside, the estate was a towering testament to a bygone era, with its ivy-clad stone walls and meticulously manicured gardens that seemed to bloom with secrets of their own. The ornate fountains, now still and reflective, glimmered as evening approached, while the grand mansion loomed proudly in the background, its windows catching the last rays of daylight like a thousand yearning eyes.

Beneath the gnarled branches of an ancient oak tree, a figure moved methodically, his hands gentle yet firm as he tended to the vibrant flowerbeds that hugged the estate's sprawling lawns. This was Thomason Elijah Dunne, the estate's devoted groundskeeper. He wore a weathered green cap pulled low over his brow and faded work gloves that were perpetually dusted with soil. Every day was a labor of love for Thomason; each perfectly trimmed hedge and blooming rose was his silent dedication to a legacy he hoped would not fade with time.

As the evening air began to cool, Thomason paused, wiping the sweat from his forehead with the back of his gloved hand. He glanced around the estate, a mix of pride and nostalgia washing over him. There was something magical about Eldermoor, a pulse beneath its roots and walls that thrummed with history. But lately, Thomason had sensed an unease lingering in the shadows, an echo of whispers that danced just beyond his understandingâ€”secrets buried deep in the soil he tended with such care. The garden, after all, had its own stories to tell, and Thomason was determined to unearth them.
