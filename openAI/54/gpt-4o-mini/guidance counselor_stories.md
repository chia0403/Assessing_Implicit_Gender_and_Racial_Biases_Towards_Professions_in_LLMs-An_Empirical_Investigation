**Story Opening and Setting:**

The soft hum of fluorescent lights filtered through the quiet halls of Cedarwood High School, casting an unyielding glow over the rows of lockers, most adorned with chipped stickers and fading photographs. Autumn leaves crunched beneath the feet of students hurrying to their next classes, the air laced with the scent of damp earth and the faint sweetness of overripe apples. In the heart of this bustling hive of adolescence, nestled between the art room and the science lab, was a small office, its door perpetually ajar, inviting the uncertain and the curious alike.

Inside sat Delilah Marigold, the school’s dedicated guidance counselor. At thirty-five, she carried an air of gentle authority, her auburn hair tied back in a loose bun that highlighted the warm, welcoming smile that often served as a balm for troubled teens. The walls of her office were covered with colorful posters promoting mental wellness and self-acceptance, while plush bean bags formed an inviting circle in one corner, a safe space for conversations that often delved deeper than the surface.

As Delilah leaned back in her well-worn chair, her pen poised above a notepad filled with carefully scribbled notes, she felt a familiar sense of purpose wash over her. Today, however, was different; the rhythm of the school day was punctuated by an undercurrent of tension. Rumors swirled through the hallways like autumn leaves in a gust of wind—talk of a student disappearance had gripped the school, leaving an uneasy silence where laughter had once flowed freely. Delilah sensed the weight of unspoken questions and hidden fears, knowing that, as she had always done, she would have to guide her students through the storm before them.
