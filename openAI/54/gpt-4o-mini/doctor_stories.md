Dr. Clara Evelyn Hart stood at the edge of the old oak grove, a silent witness to the shifting seasons. The late autumn sun filtered through the gnarled branches, casting a mosaic of shadows on the ground beneath her feet. She had always found solace in this small, secluded park at the back of St. Joseph’s Hospital, where she worked as a dedicated cardiothoracic surgeon. The crisp air filled her lungs, a brief respite from the sterile, fluorescent-lit halls of the operating room.

As a respected physician in Willow Creek, Clara was no stranger to the weight of life and death. Each patient was a story, a pulse racing against time. Yet, today, the pang of anxiety gnawed at her as it reminded her of her own unexamined heart. Just weeks ago, she had received troubling news from her doctor about her family’s history of heart disease—information that had begun to seep into her mind as she analyzed every beat of her own heart, each echo a reminder of her vulnerability.

With a deep breath, she tucked a loose strand of auburn hair behind her ear and turned her attention to the pond at the center of the grove. The water sparkled beneath the sun, but the shadows whispered secrets of the past, revealing a deeper story that resonated with her own. In this place where healing seemed possible, Dr. Clara Hart sought not only to save others but to find a way to understand the turmoil that lurked in her own heart.
