On the gentle outskirts of the sleepy town of Hillcrest, where the rolling hills met patches of thick woodlands, there stood an old Victorian house with a turret and arched windows. Its age was showing, with shingles peeling away like pages of a forgotten book, and weary gutters barely clinging to the eaves. This house had weathered countless storms and sunny days, each leaving its mark. It was atop this creaky weather-beaten roof that Thomas “Tommy” Larkins found himself early one brisk autumn morning, the scent of damp leaves and chimney smoke wafting through the crisp air.

Tommy was a man of habit. He arrived in his battered blue pickup just as the first rays of dawn stretched across the sky, painting a canvas of pink and gold. Approaching the house, he took a moment to appreciate the tranquility that only early mornings could offer—a silence broken only by the distant call of a mourning dove. Known around town as a meticulous craftsman, Tommy had spent years honing his skill, a legacy passed down from his father and grandfather before him. His hands, calloused yet gentle, were well acquainted with the art of roofing, each shingle laid with precision and care.

From his vantage point atop the ladder, Tommy had a view of the town slowly waking up, its inhabitants still tucked away in their warm beds, dreaming of simpler times. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, with the kind of charm that drew people in and made them reluctant to leave. As he began pulling the old shingles free, a light breeze rustled through the surrounding oak trees, scattering acorns onto the grass below—a promise of another day in Hillcrest.
