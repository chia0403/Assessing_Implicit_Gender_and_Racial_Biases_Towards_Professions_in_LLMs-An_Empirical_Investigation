In the heart of bustling New York City, where the streets hummed with the ceaseless energy of a metropolis that never sleeps, stood The Carleton Hotel—a grand yet charmingly antiquated establishment. Its red-bricked facade and gilt-edged awnings offered a nostalgic nod to the Roaring Twenties, transporting its visitors to an era when elegance was a way of life, not just a fleeting pursuit.

As dawn light began to gild the skyline, casting warm golden hues across the city, a familiar figure emerged from the antique revolving doors of The Carleton. Matthew Everett Hayes, a steadfast fixture of the hotel for the better part of a decade, adjusted his maroon cap before stepping onto the polished marble floor of the lobby. The muted clatter of his luggage cart accompanied him as he navigated the early morning quiet, the wheels whispering on the plush crimson carpet.

Matthew, or "Matt" as he preferred, was The Carleton's senior bellhop—a role that, despite its unassuming title, held the tales and secrets of a thousand travelers. His dark blue uniform was pristine, buttons gleaming like small suns, and his shoes shone with a mirror finish that reflected the glittering chandelier above. At thirty-five, with the build of an athlete and the aura of one who has lived through stories untold, Matt was the embodiment of professional grace under pressure.

The hotel lobby, a cavernous space of Italian marble columns and velvet drapes, was still waking from its slumber. Sunlight broke through the towering arched windows, spilling onto the grand piano in the corner, where Alicia, the resident pianist, often serenaded guests in the afternoon. Matt's mornings always began in this tranquil interlude before the day's tide of visitors flowed in, each carrying their own dreams, dramas, and destinies.

As he crossed the room, nodding a greeting to the night clerk, Matt's thoughts wandered. Today, something felt different—an inexplicable anticipation hung in the air, almost as tangible as the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the hotel's cafe. Perhaps it was just another day at The Carleton, yet Matt couldn't shake the feeling that the city, with all its mystery and magic, held a surprise waiting for him beyond the pale morning light.
