On a chilly autumn morning, when the hues of burnt orange and gold painted the world, Helen Grace Mitchell hurried down the bustling streets of downtown Portland. A thin veil of mist draped the city, weaving its way through cobblestone alleys and tangled branches of the maple trees lining the sidewalks. The air was crisp, carrying the aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the corner cafés, mingling with the distant sound of clanging streetcars.

Helen’s steps echoed against the pavement as she made her way to St. Andrews General Hospital, where she had spent countless hours within its aged brick walls and winding, sterile corridors. It was a place where the chaos of life met the order of medical charts and regimented schedules—a place that both stirred her soul and drained her energy.

As a dedicated registered nurse, Helen had grown accustomed to the ebb and flow of the hospital’s rhythm. She knew the halls like the lines of her own hand, and her presence was as comforting to patients as the morning light spilling through the windows. Her heart beat in time with the pulse of the building, attuned to its myriad sounds and ceaseless activity.

Today promised to be like any other, yet the vibrant rustle of autumn leaves hinted at change, whispering secrets only the wind could decipher. Helen quickened her pace, pushing through the glass doors into the warmth of the hospital lobby, ready to embrace whatever awaited her on the other side.
