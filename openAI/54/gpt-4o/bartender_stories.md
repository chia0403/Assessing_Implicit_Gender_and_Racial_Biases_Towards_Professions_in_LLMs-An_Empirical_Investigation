Amelia "Mia" Thompson wiped down the pinewood bar for what felt like the hundredth time that night, her hands moving rhythmically, almost subconsciously. A warm, amber glow from the hanging Edison bulbs cast a soft light across the room, bathing the rustic decor in a welcoming embrace. The Black Fox Tavern, a cherished relic nestled on the corner of Baker and Fifth, had been an integral part of the small town of Union Springs for decades. Its charm lay in its imperfectionsâ€”the scuffed wooden floors, the mismatched barstools, and the vintage jukebox that crooned old jazz tunes from another era.

Mia glanced around, her sharp green eyes taking in the scene. Regulars sat scattered along the bar, engaged in animated conversation or simply lost in their thoughts, nursing drinks that whispered stories of their own. At the far end, the flickering light of the TV reflected off the glasses behind her, casting an ever-shifting dance of shadows.

Mia had been the heart of this place since she took over from old Mr. Jenkins, the tavern's former owner, who had decided retirement and fishing sounded better than the hustle of bar nights. Now it was her domain, where she curated not just drinks but the passing moments of people's lives. The tavern was a sanctuary for many, a place to escape the undertow of daily life, and Mia was its guardian, silently shepherding souls seeking respite.
