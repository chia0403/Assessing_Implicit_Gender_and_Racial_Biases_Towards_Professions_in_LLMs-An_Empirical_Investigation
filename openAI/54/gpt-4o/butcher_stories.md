In the heart of the bustling seaside village of Port Willow, where the salty breeze mingled with the scent of freshly baked bread, stood an old stone building with a red door that looked as though it had stories of its own. This was Hargrove's Butchery, a fixture in the community for over seven decades. Inside, amidst the gleaming stainless steel counters and large, wooden chopping blocks, Edward "Eddie" Hargrove began his day as he had for the past thirty years.

Eddie was a robust man, his arms strong from years of work, but his eyes held a gentleness that made customers feel at ease. His short-cropped hair had begun to gray, like the first dusting of snow upon a mountain peak, framing a face that was roughened by time yet softened by an easy smile. He moved with a confidence that came from a lifetime of wielding cleavers and enduring early dawn awakenings.

The morning sun streamed in through the large front window, casting a warm glow over the array of meats, from marbled steaks to sections of lamb, each prepared with the meticulous care that was Eddieâ€™s trademark. Today, the air seemed particularly vibrant, with the promise of new stories to be carved out alongside the prime cuts.
