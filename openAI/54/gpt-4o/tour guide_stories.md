Amelia Greenway stood at the edge of a rugged cliff, the salty sea breeze tousling her auburn hair beneath a well-worn sunhat. The golden light of early morning bathed the jagged coastline in warmth, transforming the restless waves below into a glittering mosaic. The Isle of Skye never failed to leave her breathless, and today was no exception. As she waited for her group of eager tourists to arrive, she took in the sprawling vistas that unfurled before her like a living canvas—rolling hills spotted with heather, age-old stone walls tracing the landscape, and the distant outline of the Old Man of Storr peering through the mist.

Amelia had always felt a deep connection to these lands, having been raised among the myths and legends that clung to every stone and shadow. It was her job, and privilege, as a tour guide to breathe life into those tales for the weary travelers who ventured here seeking more than just beautiful scenery. Her voice, infused with the lilt of the Highlands, would soon echo around them as she shared stories of ancient clans, faerie folklore, and the vibrant history that made this place so much more than a mere tourist destination. For Amelia, each tour was a journey, not just over land, but into the heart of the human spirit—a spirit forever intertwined with the wild beauty of Skye.
