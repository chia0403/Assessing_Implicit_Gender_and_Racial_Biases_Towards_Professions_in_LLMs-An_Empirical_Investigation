In the serene embrace of the Pacific Northwest, where the dense canopy of towering evergreens competes only with the whisper of the wind and the gentle murmur of a distant stream, lived a man defined by the forest he called home. Theodore "Teddy" Holloway, a seasoned logger, had risen with the dawn, the tips of his boots brushed with the mist that clung stubbornly to the forest floor.

Teddy stood at the edge of a clearing, the familiar, earthy aroma of pine and soil circling around him, grounding him in a world he understood better than his own dreams. This verdant expanse, a sprawling patchwork of Douglas firs and western red cedars, had been the backdrop to Teddy’s life since his father first placed a calloused hand over his own smaller one, guiding his grip on the handle of an axe many years ago.

Today, the morning light streamed through breaks in the foliage, casting intricate patterns upon the mossy ground, illuminating the promise of another day’s hard work. The forest felt alive with possibility and shadow, as if the trees held ancient stories they might, on the rarest of days, be willing to share. Teddy’s blue work shirt, faded from countless sunrises and stubbornly resistant to the onslaught of pitch and sap, bore the marks of years etched in threads and patches.

To the west, Mount Rainier peaked above the treeline, its snow-capped summit a stoic witness to the relentless rhythm of time. Teddy watched as a hawk circled above, its silhouette cutting gracefully against the brightening sky. It was moments like these that etched themselves into his soul, a reminder of the delicate balance of nature's beauty and its yearning for survival.
