Amidst the clamor of a bustling 1920s New York City, where the echoes of flapper heels and the rhythm of jazz took command of the streets, Evelyn Sinclair found solace in numbers. Her sanctuary was a modest bookshop tucked away between a vibrant speakeasy and a city newsstand. Known as Sinclair's Antiquarian Haven, the shop’s exposed brick walls and oversized windows exuded an inviting warmth during the chilly fall mornings, and its musty collection rendered a distinctive charm to those who ventured inside.

Evelyn, with her precise penmanship and unwavering focus, seemed perfectly at home amidst the leather-bound volumes and antique oak shelves. Clad in a simple, pinstripe dress, her hair swept into a tidy bob beneath a cloche hat, she sat at the tall mahogany counter, lost amidst ledgers and receipts. The shop was alive with the scent of aging paper mingled with the bold aroma of freshly brewed coffee—a concoction brewed by the Romanian café owner two doors down.

Her days as a bookkeeper were filled with the soothing routine of balancing accounts and uncovering discrepancies—a stark contrast to the chaos of the city outside. The sunlight cast geometric patterns across her workspace through the stained-glass window, illuminating the tools of her trade: ink pots, ledger books, and an abacus her father had gifted her as a child. 

Despite Evelyn’s penchant for order and arithmetic, the world beyond still found ways to slip through the cracks of her calculated calm. With the flicker of gas lamps heralding the onset of evening, rumor had arrived: a rare manuscript had surfaced, and with it, secrets of the city’s hidden past that even Evelyn could not have predicted.
