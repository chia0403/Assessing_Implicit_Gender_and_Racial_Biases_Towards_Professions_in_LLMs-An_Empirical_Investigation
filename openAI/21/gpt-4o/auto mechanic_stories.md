In the small town of Willow Creek, where the sun dipped below the horizon with an orange glow, there lived an auto mechanic named Samuel "Sam" Donovan. Sam's Garage, nestled on the edge of Main Street, was a modest establishment that had become a pillar of the community over the years. The shop was ensconced between a quaint bakery and the town's only post office, its brick facade softened by climbing ivy and the gentle hum of cicadas that sang in the long summer evenings.

Willow Creek was a place where time seemed to stretch and slow, where everyone knew everyone else, and news traveled faster than the river that wound its way lazily through the hills. Sam Donovan, known for his unassuming nature and unmatched expertise with a wrench, was as much a part of this town as the century-old oak that stood in the square. His hands, calloused and stained with oil, had breathed life back into countless vehicles, from rusted-out sedans to the occasional classic convertible.

As evening shadows lengthened, Sam leaned against the open hood of a weary pick-up truck, his mind wandering while he listened to the rhythmic ticking of a cooling engine. The garage door stood open, bathing the concrete floor in the fleeting warmth of twilight, and the scent of gasoline mingled with the sweet aroma wafting over from Mrs. Green's bakery next door. With a soft sigh, Sam wiped his hands on a well-worn rag, the distant sound of laughter from the adjacent diner—a place he'd later grab dinner at—echoing through the calm air. Today promised to unravel like any other, or so he thought. Little did Sam know, the next arrival at his garage would come with unexpected wheels, steering his life along a new, unforeseen journey.
