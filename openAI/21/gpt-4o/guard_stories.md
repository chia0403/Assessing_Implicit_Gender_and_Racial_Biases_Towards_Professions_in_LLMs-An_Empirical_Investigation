In the dim, amber glow of the gas lamps that lined the cobblestone streets of Elderhawke, the brisk autumn wind whispered secrets through the ancient oaks that bordered the town square. The moon hung low and heavy in the ink-black sky, casting long shadows that danced along the weathered stone walls of the castle perched on the hill, its turrets piercing the heavens with an air of silent majesty.

Guarding the northern gate of this storied fortress stood Isaac Caldwell, a steadfast figure clad in a dark green tunic, the emblem of a silver falcon embroidered upon his chest. His armor, though worn, gleamed beneath the moonlight, a testament to years of diligent service. His gaze, sharp and attentive, scanned the horizon, as if deciphering the mysteries written in the stars. Isaac's breath puffed into the cold night air in small, visible clouds, his posture unwavering despite the chill that bit through his woolen gloves.

Elderhawke was a town with secrets buried beneath each flagstone, whispers of forgotten legends and ancient pacts that echoed through its narrow streets and moss-covered pathways. The townsfolk held a quiet reverence for the tales of yore, stories passed down through generations that spoke of guardians and heroes, of darkness and redemption. Isaac Caldwell, though a man of few words, knew those stories well, for his father had told him of the great Seraph Guard and their timeless vigil.

As the last notes of the church bell faded into the night, marking midnight with an almost sacred finality, Isaac's heart quickened, the hour when the veil between present and past felt thinnest. It was in these solitary moments that the weight of his role struck with sudden clarity, the guardian of histories both celebrated and unknown, pledged to defend against shadows lurking beyond the veil of night.
