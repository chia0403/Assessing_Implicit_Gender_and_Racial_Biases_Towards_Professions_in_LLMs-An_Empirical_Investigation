In the small, mist-shrouded village of Elderwood, where cobblestone paths wound through ancient oak trees and lanterns flickered with the dim glow of orange against the cool twilight, there stood a modest little shop. Its wooden sign, swaying gently in the evening breeze, read “Henrik's Finest Cuts.” Inside the warmly lit interior, the air was rich with the savory, earthy scent of cured meats and the sweet, metallic tang of fresh cuts, a comforting haven from the chill that had begun to settle outside.

Henrik Voss, the proprietor and skilled butcher of this humble establishment, stood behind a polished oak counter. He was a man of few words but many talents, renowned for his precision with a blade and his dedication to his craft. With hands steady and deliberate, he expertly prepared the evening's orders, each slice of his cleaver a rhythmic dance of shadows and whispers in the fading daylight.

Tonight, as the town clock tower struck seven, sending echoes through the quiet streets, Henrik paused to gaze out of the shop's wide, mullioned window. The view that greeted him was one of swirling fog and the silhouettes of townsfolk hurrying home, their laughter softly trailing behind. It was a night like any other in Elderwood—a small haven seemingly untouched by the hurried pace of the world beyond its border of towering trees. But Henrik felt an unfamiliar stirring in his chest, a sensation that something out of the ordinary was just beyond the horizon, waiting to tumble into his methodical world. And as always, he was ready to meet it, cleaver in hand and butcher's apron stained with the day's labors, his heart beat steady as the passage of time itself.
