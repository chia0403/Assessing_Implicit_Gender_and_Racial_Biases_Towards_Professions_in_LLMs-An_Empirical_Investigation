In the soft glow of an early November dawn, a solitary eighteen-wheeler rumbled along a deserted stretch of Route 66, cutting through the heart of the American Midwest. The vast expanse of golden prairie stretched out on either side like a sea of endless whispers, interrupted only by the occasional silhouette of a distant farmstead or an ancient, creaking windmill. The sun, a molten globe just cresting the horizon, painted the sky in slate blues and fiery oranges, casting long shadows over the cracked and venerable highway.

The truck’s chrome grille gleamed in the morning light, its deep rumble a constant companion to the otherwise still morning. In the cab, Johnnie Ray Sawyer, a seasoned hauler with thirty years of highway stories etched into the lines of his weathered face, adjusted his trucker cap and squinted into the sunrise. His hands, calloused and strong, gripped the steering wheel with practiced ease as the CB radio crackled softly in the background, offering snippets of conversation from fellow travelers.

Johnnie Ray's world was this ribbon of asphalt, stretching endlessly through time and memory. He had traversed it all—soaring mountain passes, bustling cities, and the quiet backroads where stories seemed to linger like the scent of rain on the wind. This morning, the road held a particular promise, a sense of change whispered to him by the cold, crisp air—a reminder that the open road was as much a path to discovery as it was a familiar journey.
