The sun had barely begun its ascent over the sleepy coastal town of Seabrook, casting a gentle golden hue across the churning waves and illuminating the narrow cobblestone streets. Nestled between the creaky, weathered boardwalk and a cluster of quaint, centuries-old buildings stood the Seaview Inn, an unassuming, butter-yellow structure with white trim and an inviting wraparound porch adorned with wicker rocking chairs. The inn exuded an old-world charm that beckoned tourists and weary travelers in equal measure.

Inside, the warmer air carried the subtle scent of fresh coffee mingling with the sea breeze, wafting through a petite reception area where soft jazz played from a vintage radio. At the heart of this serene setting was Clara Beaumont, the inn's receptionist and quietly observant guardian of its secrets. Clara, with her chestnut hair pulled back into a neat bun and a pair of tortoiseshell glasses settled on her nose, was a figure of calm amidst the gentle bustle of the morning.

With a smile that could dispel the morning fog, Clara greeted each guest with an effortless warmth that made them feel less like strangers and more like old friends. Her desk, a polished mahogany expanse, was neatly organized with stacks of brochures, a brass bell, and a shimmering glass bowl filled with candies for those who needed a small comfort. As she settled into her chair, her fingers dancing over the worn keys of an ancient typewriter, Clara reflected on the stories hidden behind each guest's eyes and the mysteries their brief visits would weave into the narrative tapestry of Seaview Inn.
