Dr. Evelyn Clara Hart stood in the bright, sterile light of her dental practice, Hart & Smile Dental Care, in the small coastal town of Crestwood. The walls were adorned with cheerful ocean-themed murals, a comforting nod to the waves crashing just beyond the windows. A soft hum of the overhead fluorescent lights mixed with the gentle whisper of the sea breeze wafting through the open windows, offering a refreshing contrast to the antiseptic scent that lingered in the air.

It was a typical Tuesday morning, and the rhythm of the day had begun with the familiar sound of dental instruments being prepared for the appointments ahead. Despite the tranquil setting, Dr. Hart harbored a growing anxiety beneath her composed exterior. The town had recently been shaken by a series of mysterious disappearances, and though her focus was typically on keeping teeth healthy and smiles bright, the gnawing tension in Crestwood had seeped into her thoughts, making it difficult for her to concentrate on root canals and cleanings.

As the doorbell chimed, signaling the arrival of her first patient, Dr. Hart adjusted her white coat, steeling herself for the day ahead. With emerald green eyes catching the morning light, she took a deep breath, reminding herself that her true calling was to care for those who walked through her door, even as the tide of uncertainty roiled just beyond the shoreline of her practice.
