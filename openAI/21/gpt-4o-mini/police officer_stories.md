In the heart of Eldridge, a small coastal town that clung to the jagged cliffs of Nova Scotia, an unrelenting fog rolled in from the Atlantic. The air carried the briny scent of the sea, mingling with the bittersweet aroma of pine trees that surrounded the unpaved roads. At dawn, the town came alive with the soft clinking of lobster traps being unloaded at the docks, and the distant calls of gulls perched on weathered fishing boats. 

In the midst of this morning ritual, Officer Marissa Elaine Thatcher stood sentinel at the edge of a crowded marketplace, her navy-blue uniform crisp against the muted colors of the awakening town. With a badge glinting under the half-hidden sun, she was a figure of authority and calmness amidst the clamor of vendors setting up their stands. Yet, beneath her composed exterior, a storm was brewing. Just three days ago, a local fisherman had disappeared without a trace, leaving behind nothing but curiosity and whispers among the townsfolk.

Marissa, a ten-year veteran of the Eldridge Police Department, had always felt a deep connection to her community—its ups and downs woven into the very fabric of her being. But now, as the fog rolled in thicker and time slipped away, she sensed the shadows of uncertainty creeping into her beloved town, and she was determined to uncover the truth. As her gaze swept across the vibrant market stalls, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something dark lurked just beneath the surface of their quaint coastal life.
