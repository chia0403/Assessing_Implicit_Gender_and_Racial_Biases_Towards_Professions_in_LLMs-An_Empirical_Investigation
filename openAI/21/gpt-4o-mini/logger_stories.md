In the heart of the sprawling Cascade Mountains, where towering pines kissed the sky and the air was thick with the scent of moss and damp earth, the small town of Timberwood lay nestled among expansive forests. It was here, amidst the whispering trees and the symphony of chirping birds, that Ethan James McAllister forged his existence as a logger.

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden glow over the rugged landscape as Ethan finished up another long day of work. With calloused hands and a weathered face etched by years spent battling the elements, he moved through the forest with the grace of a man who understood its secrets. The dull roar of chainsaws echoed in the distance, a familiar sound that reverberated in his bones while he prepared for his next task—felling an ancient cedar that had stood sentinel for centuries.

The ground was soft beneath his steel-toed boots, and the rustling leaves formed a natural backdrop to his thoughts. For Ethan, logging was more than just a job; it was a way of life, an unbreakable bond with the land he cherished. As he surveyed the area, he could see the outlines of the mountains illuminated by the last rays of sunlight, painting the world in hues of orange and purple. But beyond the beauty, an unsettling change lingered in the air, a sense of foreboding that the forest itself seemed to whisper to him—a warning he couldn’t quite decipher.

Adjusting his hard hat and gripping his chainsaw tightly, Ethan inhaled deeply, as if trying to capture the essence of the woods one last time before he severed the bond of wood and earth. Today, he could sense that fate was about to carve a new path not just for him, but for the very forest that had given him purpose.
