In the heart of a bustling metropolis, where the skyline sliced through the clouds like jagged glass teeth, stood the sleek, modern building of Darnell & Co. Advertising Agency. The lobby was a symphony of polished marble and understated elegance, where soft lighting danced across the surfaces, creating an atmosphere that was both inviting and professional. Potted ferns lined the entrance, adding a touch of life to the otherwise sterile environment. 

At the front desk, surrounded by a myriad of screens that flickered with messages and calls, sat Seraphina Mae Whitaker. With her chestnut curls meticulously pinned back, she exuded a sense of confidence in her crisp white blouse, cinched by a tailored black skirt. Seraphina was the linchpin of the agency, the warm smile that greeted everyone—clients, vendors, and colleagues alike. She knew the rhythm of the place, the pulse of its creativity, but she also harbored a secret yearning for a life beyond the endless rotation of phone calls and appointments.

As the clock struck nine, the daily rush began. The sound of high heels clicking against polished floors mingled with the low hum of conversations, while the scent of fresh coffee drifted in from the nearby break room. Little did Seraphina know, this day would bring an unexpected twist that would challenge everything she thought she knew about her world—and herself.
