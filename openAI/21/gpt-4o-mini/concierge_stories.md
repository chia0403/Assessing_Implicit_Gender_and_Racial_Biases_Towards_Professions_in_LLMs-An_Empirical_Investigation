In the heart of the bustling city of Valestia, where the cobblestone streets wound like ribbons through a tapestry of high-rises and historic townhouses, stood the opulent Grand Alaric Hotel. Built over a century ago, its sprawling marble lobby shimmered under the golden glow of crystal chandeliers, welcoming guests from every corner of the world. The air was infused with the rich scent of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the sweet notes of pastry from the adjacent café.

Behind the polished mahogany desk, surrounded by ornate decor and bustling activity, stood Lucian Maximilian St. Clair, the hotel’s chief concierge. With a perfectly tailored navy suit and a silver watch that glinted in the light, Lucian was a quintessential figure in the nearly surreal atmosphere of the Grand Alaric. His warm hazel eyes sparkled with a combination of wisdom and mischief, a testament to his years of navigating the complex demands of an eclectic clientele. 

The day had begun just like any other, with a torrent of arrivals and departures, and Lucian was in the thick of it, orchestrating a delicate ballet of requests. But as he glanced out the tall windows that framed the entrance, he felt an unusual shift in the air, a whisper of anticipation that promised something unexpected. The sun dipped low, casting long shadows that danced across the polished floor, as a figure cloaked in mystery approached the entrance, clutching an old leather suitcase that seemed almost too heavy for the slender arms that bore it. This encounter would change the course of Lucian’s day—and perhaps his life.
