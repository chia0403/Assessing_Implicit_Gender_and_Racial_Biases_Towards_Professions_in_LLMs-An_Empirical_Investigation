In the quaint coastal town of Alder Grove, where the salt-kissed air mingled with the scent of cedar, a solitary workshop stood at the edge of a sun-dappled forest. The building, with its weathered gray shingles and a faintly peeling sign that read “Harris Woodworks,” was a testament to the generations of craftsmen who had poured their souls into every beam and board. Inside, the rhythmic sound of a hammer striking nails echoed, harmonizing with the distant crash of waves against the rocky shore.

In the heart of this workshop was Benjamin Asher Harris, a skilled carpenter known for his meticulous attention to detail and an innate ability to breathe life into wood. With tousled chestnut hair and deep-set hazel eyes that mirrored the forest outside, he embodied the spirit of the land. Dressed in a well-worn apron splattered with paint and sawdust, and with calloused hands that spoke of years spent shaping raw timber, Benjamin found solace in his craft.

As the sunlight filtered through the grime-covered windows, casting a warm glow on the myriad pieces of furniture and sculptures he had crafted, he paused, resting his weary hands on the smooth surface of a nearly completed dining table. This particular piece was destined for the old lighthouse keeper’s daughter, a local who had recently returned to Alder Grove after many years away. Benjamin hadn’t met her yet, but he had heard whispers of her fierce spirit and the stories she carried, tales spun from the very fabric of the town’s history. 

But on this particular morning, as the breeze danced through the open door, a sense of unease tugged at him. There was a shift in the air, a whisper of change that seemed to echo through the wood that surrounded him. Little did Benjamin know, that change was on the horizon, and it would soon come knocking at the door of his workshop, forever altering the course of his life in Alder Grove.
