**Story Opening and Setting**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the small town of Maplewood as the end of summer approached. The air was thick with the scent of engine oil mixed with the faint fragrance of blooming wildflowers that dotted the neighboring fields. Nestled on the corner of Maple and Main, Jenson's Auto Repair stood out like an old friend against the quaint but bustling town square. Its brick facade, adorned with faded hand-painted signs, had been the backdrop of countless mechanic stories for over three decades.

Inside, the rhythmic clank of wrenches and the low hum of machinery created a symphony of industriousness. Tools hung from pegboards, while grease-smudged posters of classic cars lined the walls, a testament to the passion that fueled the shop. J.L. "Jace" Thompson, a thirty-two-year-old mechanic, wiped his hands on a rag, his dark hair tousled and cheeks dusted with the day’s labor. His denim overalls, patched in places, told tales of late-night repairs under the dim glow of fluorescent lights, while his hands were calloused and stained, a result of years spent building a connection with machines.

Jace was known for his meticulous attention to detail and unwavering honesty, traits that made him a beloved figure in the community. The steady hum of customers finding their way in and out of the garage created a familiar rhythm, but on this particular afternoon, everything felt different. As he leaned over the hood of a vintage Mustang, its chrome parts gleaming in the sunlight, Jace could sense that a storm—both literal and metaphorical—was about to roll into Maplewood, bringing with it secrets that had long been buried.
