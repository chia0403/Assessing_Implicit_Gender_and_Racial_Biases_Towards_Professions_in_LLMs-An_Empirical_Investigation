In the heart of the quaint town of Eldridge Hollow, where the autumn leaves danced in vibrant hues of orange and gold, stood Eldridge High School—a place where laughter echoed along the halls and futures were forged amidst the clamor of lockers slamming shut. It was here, in a cozy corner office adorned with motivational posters and the faint scent of cinnamon from an ever-present candle, that Sophie Marie Jensen dedicated her days to guiding young minds through the turbulent seas of adolescence.

Outside, the first gentle snowflakes of the season began to fall, blanketing the world in a soft, serene hush. Inside, however, the atmosphere buzzed with the anxious energy of students navigating their final year, each grappling with questions about college, friendships, and identity. Sophie, with her warm smile and approachable demeanor, had a talent for uncovering the hidden struggles behind the bravado of her clients. Each morning she donned her signature oversized cardigan, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, and prepared for the myriad of stories and secrets that would find their way into her office.

Today, as she sipped her steaming cup of chamomile tea, Sophie noticed a new name on her schedule—Liam Carter, a quiet boy from the back of the class known for his artful sketches and introspective nature. There was something in her gut that hinted this meeting was going to be different, perhaps even pivotal, for both of them. As the clock ticked closer to 10 am, she steeled herself for the conversation that would unfold, unaware that it would intertwine their fates in ways neither could foresee.
