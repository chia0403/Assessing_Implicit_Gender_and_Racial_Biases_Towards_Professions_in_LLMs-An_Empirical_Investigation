The sun dipped below the horizon, casting an amber glow over the bustling city of New Haven. The ornate façade of the Grand Emerald Hotel loomed majestically at the corner of Maple and Third, its towering spires reaching for the last rays of daylight. A constant stream of guests poured through the revolving doors, their laughter and chatter mingling with the cheerful notes of a jazz band playing in the lobby.

In the midst of the flurry, Emerson James Calloway adjusted his navy blue uniform, ensuring the brass bellhop cap sat smartly atop his head. At twenty-four, he was the youngest bellhop at the Grand Emerald, a job he cherished for its unique blend of excitement and unpredictability. Every day brought new stories, each suitcase held a mystery, and every encounter with guests taught him something invaluable.

As he leaned against his cart, his brown eyes scanned the lobby, searching for any chance to lend a helping hand. The polished marble floors sparkled under the shimmering chandeliers, reflecting a world of opulence and charm. But behind the grandeur lay stories of burnt toast in the hotel restaurant or guests getting locked out of their rooms—Emerson relished every twist and turn of the day.

He remembered his mother’s words as a child: “Every person has a story worth telling.” Today, standing in the heart of the city’s most prestigious hotel, he was determined to listen to as many stories as he could, hoping that in each narrative, he could find a piece of himself.
