The soft hum of low-lit jazz intertwined with the clinking of glasses and the muffled laughter of patrons at the Velvet Hour, a cozy speakeasy tucked away in a narrow alley of downtown New Orleans. The air was thick with the scent of aged bourbon and citrus, mingling with hints of smoke that wafted from a nearby cigar lounge. Flickering candlelight cast playful shadows on the exposed brick walls, each flicker revealing an intimate corner where secrets exchanged and dreams were spun.

Behind the polished mahogany bar stood Aria Elise Fontaine, her dark curls cascading over one shoulder as she expertly crafted cocktails with the flair of a seasoned alchemist. Her amber-brown eyes sparkled with mischief as she poured top-shelf spirits into a shaker, shaking it rhythmically to the beat of the music. Emblazoned with a crescent moon tattoo on her right wrist, Aria embodied the spirit of the city, a blend of enchantment and grit.

As she served a whiskey sour to a regular—the retired jazz musician who always occupied the same stool—she couldn’t shake off the feeling that tonight would be different. The air crackled with anticipation, and uncertainty pulled at her insides like a tide. Little did she know that a simple transaction across the bar would soon unravel the last year of her life, challenging everything she thought she knew about love, loyalty, and the mysterious past that haunted her.
