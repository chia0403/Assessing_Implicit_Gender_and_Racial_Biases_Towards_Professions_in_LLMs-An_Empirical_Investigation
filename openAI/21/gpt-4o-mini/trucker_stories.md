Title: Miles of Solitude

The sun slowly dipped below the horizon, painting the vast Nevada desert in hues of crimson and gold. Dust swirled softly in the air as the last light of day struggled to hold its ground against the encroaching evening. Along the long stretch of Route 95, where the asphalt ribbon seemed to disappear into the endless sky, the low rumble of an engine grew louder. 

Inside the cab of his well-worn 18-wheeler, a rig known affectionately as "Big Betty," Burke Samuel Jenkins adjusted the rearview mirror and watched the landscape blur into shadows. The clock on the dashboard ticked steadily, a reminder that time was both his friend and foe. Burke was no stranger to the whispers of the open road; it had been his home for nearly a decade. But tonight felt different, as if the very air was charged with an unspeakable tension, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that change was just around the bend.

As he pulled into a rest stop, the fading sunlight reflected off the chrome accents of his truck, giving it an almost ethereal glow. Burke stepped out into the cool desert air, his muscular frame silhouetted against the vibrant twilight. He had a weathered face, etched with lines from years of squinting against the sun and the wind, but his blue eyes held a spark of determination—a flicker of hope that, perhaps, the road would lead him somewhere unexpected tonight.

The rest stop was eerily quiet, with only the soft chirping of crickets breaking the silence. A lone semi sat idling in the corner, its driver lost in a world of his own. Burke walked to the small diner nestled beside the lot, the neon ‘Diner’ sign flickering, casting a surreal glow against the night. He stepped inside, ready to grab a black coffee and a greasy burger, unaware that tonight would unravel secrets that lay hidden under the endless stars above, drawing him deeper into the fabric of the road he thought he knew so well.
