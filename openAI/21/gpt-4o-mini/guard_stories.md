On the outskirts of the ancient city of Eldoria, where cobblestone streets twisted like serpents beneath the towering spires of a long-abandoned castle, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and moss. The sun hung low on the horizon, casting golden rays that filtered through the gnarled branches of the surrounding forest, creating a flickering dance of light and shadow. This was the realm of the forgotten, where whispers of bygone eras echoed amid the crumbling ruins.

In the heart of the city, standing resolutely at the massive oak doors of the castle, was a guard named Seraphin Aeloria. Clad in weathered leather armor embossed with the insignia of the Eldorian crown, he shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his sharp green eyes scanning the thickening twilight. The chill in the evening air wrapped around him like a cloak, but Seraphin remained vigilant.

With his shaggy dark hair and a beard that hinted at both youth and hardship, he bore the weight of a decade of duty etched into the lines of his face. Each day, he stood watch over the remnants of a kingdom still clinging to its dignity, despite the shadows that encroached ever closer. Tonight, as a gathering storm brewed on the horizon, Seraphin felt an unsettling change in the air, as if the very stones of the castle whispered secrets long forgotten, waiting for the right moment to be unleashed.
