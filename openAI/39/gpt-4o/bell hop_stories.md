In the heart of the bustling city of Chicago, where the skyscrapers touched the clouds like towering sentinels and the river wound lazily through the urban sprawl, stood the opulent Grand Meridian Hotel. Built in the early 20th century, this architectural marvel boasted a majestic facade that whispered tales of a bygone era. Its marbled floors gleamed under the polished brilliance of grand chandeliers, and the rich scent of polished mahogany filled the air.

It was here, amidst the elegant symphony of clinking glasses and soft laughter, that Jasper Donovan began each day. As the hotel’s most trusted bell hop, Jasper was the invisible hand guiding the seamless choreography of guests arriving and departing. Dressed in a crisp uniform of deep burgundy, trimmed with gold piping, he moved with a practiced grace borne from years of dedication.

This particular morning, the air outside was sharp with the promise of snow, casting a silver veil over the city. Inside, the hotel lobby buzzed with the gentle hum of activity. Jasper adjusted the polished brass buttons of his jacket, his fingers brushing the small nameplate pinned over his heart, and allowed himself a momentary glance around the lobby. To him, each face told a story, each bag carried secrets waiting to be uncovered—a world wrapped in leather and fabric, entrusted to his care.

With a subtle nod to the doorman, Jasper took his place at the concierge desk, ready to assist guests with their every need. Little did he know, today would unravel events that would change not only the rhythm of his days but the very foundation of the Grand Meridian itself.
