In the heart of the quaint coastal town of Seabrook, where the scent of saltwater intertwined with the blooming lavender in untamed gardens, Margaret "Maggie" Caldwell went about her morning ritual, preparing for the day ahead. The gentle hum of the early-morning tide lulled the small, weathered houses lining the narrow, cobblestone streets, each one brimming with tales of bygone eras.

Maggie, with her ebony hair tied up in a neat bun and her well-worn apron wrapped securely around her waist, stepped out of her modest cottage. Her surroundings were as familiar to her as the back of her hand. The cozy neighborhood of Driftwood Lane was a tight-knit community where the sun cast golden hues over the ocean and local fishermen tended to their boats like clockwork.

As the housekeeper for the esteemed Seabrook Inn, a stately Victorian manor perched atop the cliffs overseeing the Atlantic’s restless horizon, Maggie had become an integral part of the seaside town’s quiet pulse. Her days were filled with the gentle sway of her broom, the rhythmic strokes of dusting, and the patient artistry of arranging flowers in guest rooms.

With each step she took, the morning mist clinging to her sturdy boots, Maggie headed towards the grand house that would soon awaken with the chatter of travelers and whispers of its creaking wooden floors. The inn was more than just an old house with grand parlors and winding staircases; to Maggie, it was a living entity, a guardian of the many stories crafted within its walls.

Yet today, as the first rays of sunlight pierced through the gray clouds overhead, Maggie Caldwell had a peculiar feeling. There was something different in the salty air—a whisper of unease, a hint of mystery beckoning her beyond the routine of tidying rooms and polishing antiques. Little did she know, the events that would soon unfold would challenge everything she believed about the sleepy town she called home.
