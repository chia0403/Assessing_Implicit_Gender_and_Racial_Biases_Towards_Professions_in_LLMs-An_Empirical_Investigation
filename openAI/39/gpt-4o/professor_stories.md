Professor Evelyn Hartwell stood at the wide, arching windows of her office in the creaky old Victorian building that housed the History Department of Allerton University. The panes of glass were wavy and distorted, a testament to the building’s age, casting fragmented shadows across the polished oak floors. Outside, the autumn leaves danced in the brisk wind, painting the grounds in hues of amber and crimson. Evelyn's deep brown eyes traced the familiar path that wound through the university's arboretum, where she often took solace during her midday breaks. 

Her office was a testament to both her passion and profession. The towering bookshelves were crammed with tomes on ancient civilizations, their gilt titles glinting in the afternoon light. Artifacts from her many field expeditions lined the walls and tabletops—delicate pottery from Etruscan digs, sun-bleached scrolls, and a meticulously reconstructed Roman mosaic. In the far corner, a massive globe, worn and faded with use, stood testament to her scholarly pursuits.

Professor Hartwell turned from the window, her mind shifting away from the papers awaiting her review back to the enigma that had captured her interest. A recent discovery in the depths of the university’s own archives—a collection of ancient letters written in an unidentifiable script—had stirred the academic community. Yet, whispers of danger and intrigue seemed to follow the artefacts, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that they would change everything she thought she knew.
