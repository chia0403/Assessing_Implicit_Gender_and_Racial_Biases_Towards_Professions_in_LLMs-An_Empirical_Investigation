On the outskirts of the sleepy town of Willow Creek, where mist hung low over rolling fields and ancient oaks whispered secrets to the morning breeze, lay the sprawling estate of Elmwood Manor. Its once-grand façade now gently surrendered to the embrace of ivy and time, yet still held an irrefutable charm that captivated all who passed its wrought-iron gates.

At the break of dawn, when the world was still painted in shades of soft lavender and cool gray, George Arthur Whitfield began his day as he had for the past twenty years. Known affectionately to the townsfolk as "Old Whit," he was the steadfast groundskeeper of Elmwood Manor, a man whose steadfast dedication mirrored the rhythms of the seasons. With a weathered cap perched atop his graying hair and his hands wrapped around a steaming mug of tea, George would pause a moment on the manor's porch, overlooking the dew-kissed grass, assessing the day's work.

His connection to the land was almost mystical; George had walked every inch of the grounds, knew each blade of grass, and could recount the history of every ancient tree dotting the landscape. As the sun began its leisurely ascent, casting golden trails on the cobblestone paths, George made his way towards the gardens, where riotous blooms promised the vibrancy of life amid the stillness of history.

In the deeper reaches of the estate, behind the manicured hedges and flowerbeds bursting with color, lay the hidden corners that George cherished most—wild, untouched nooks that hummed with the echo of forgotten stories. Here, under a towering oak, George would often find inspiration as he tended to his duties, quietly observing nature’s quiet majesty.

Today, however, seemed different. There was a whisper in the air, a tension vibrating through the stillness of the morning, as if Elmwood was holding its breath, waiting for something unforeseen to unfold.
