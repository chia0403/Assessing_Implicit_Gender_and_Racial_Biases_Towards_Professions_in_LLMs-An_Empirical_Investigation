In the heart of the towering city of Azure Valley, amidst the cacophony of bustling marketplaces and the distant wail of distant steam engines, stood the formidable structure of Everwatch. This imposing citadel, with its weathered stone walls and spires that seemed to pierce the very heavens, served as both a symbol of protection and a beacon of vigilance over the sprawling metropolis below.

The morning sun struggled to break through the blanket of mist that clung stubbornly to the city, casting a shrouded glow over cobblestone streets and the labyrinthine alleys winding between ancient buildings. It was here, in the damp shadows of Everwatch’s ramparts, that Callum Graves fulfilled his solemn duty as the city's sentinel.

Callum Graves, whose presence was as unyielding as the fortress he protected, had been part of the city's guard for over two decades. He wore his uniform with a sense of quiet pride; the polished steel of his chest plate glinting dully in the muted light, and the deep blue of his cloak swirling like the ocean's depths around his muscular frame. He was a man carved from stone and resolve, with eyes the shade of overcast skies that missed nothing and forgave even less.

Callum’s morning patrol was a ritual as familiar to him as the rising sun. He paced the length of the battlements with a measured stride, listening intently to the world awakening around him. The squawking of gulls flying in from the coast, the distant murmur of ship horns from the old docks, and the sharp bark of a vendor selling freshly baked bread all reached his ears, their sounds weaving seamlessly into the city's morning symphony.

Yet today, beneath the ritualistic comfort of routine, Callum sensed a whisper of unease threading itself through the dawn. He paused momentarily, gazing over the city with an intensity that went beyond sight, letting the sensation settle in his bones. Perhaps it was nothing, the mere conjuring of a weary mind. Or perhaps it was the soft prelude to something far more sinister unfurling from the horizon.
