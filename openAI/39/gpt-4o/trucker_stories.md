In the misty haze of early dawn, as the first threads of daylight began to weave through the sprawling tapestry of the Montana plains, Jackson "Jax" Trenton climbed into the cab of his weathered but faithful Kenworth W900. The truck, affectionately dubbed "Ol’ Reliable," had seen its fair share of the American landscape, each dent and scratch a testament to countless miles conquered and stories lived. This morning, the air was crisp with the promise of autumn, the scent of pine mingling with diesel as Jax adjusted his seat and settled in for the long haul ahead.

The world around him was slowly waking, a sleepy town nestled between rolling hills and endless sky. Emmaville had been Jax’s home for the better part of a decade, a quaint and unassuming place where everyone knew each other's business. The main street, with its row of brick storefronts and the ever-swinging sign of Maisie's Diner, was still in half-shadow, waiting for the sun to fully unveil its trappings. This was where his journey began—not just today, but years ago, when the open road called to him like an old friend whispering secrets only he could decipher.

Jax's mind wandered as he turned the ignition, the low rumble of the engine sending a familiar vibration through the cabin. He was a seasoned trucker, a man whose life was measured not in days or weeks, but in the rhythmic pulse of tires against asphalt, the endless stretch of white lines unfurling beneath him. Behind him, the trailer was loaded with precious cargo bound for a distant city—yet to Jax, it was just another delivery, another mark on his logbook.

As Ol’ Reliable roared to life, he set his cap straight, allowed a moment for a fleeting glance in the rearview mirror, and then pulled onto the empty highway. The world spread out before him, vast and open, an expanse of possibilities beneath the everwatchful sky. It was here, amidst these endless roads and shifting seasons, that Jackson Trenton felt most alive, each mile a reminder of the untamed freedom that bound him to this life.
