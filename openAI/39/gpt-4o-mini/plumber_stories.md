**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting:** The story begins in the bustling city of Riverton, where the sound of construction and the chatter of pedestrians envelop the streets. It’s a typical autumn morning, with leaves crunching underfoot and the smell of damp earth permeating the air. Amidst the busy streets is an old brick building, partially obscured by scaffolding, where a family-owned plumbing business, “Riverton Rooters,” has operated for generations.

**Opening:**

As the early morning sun filtered through the gaps in the scaffolding, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the air, **Marcus Theodore Briggs** stood beside his weathered blue van, the emblem of a leaky faucet painted boldly on its side. With his gloved hands resting on his hips, he surveyed the makeshift office littered with plumbing supplies and half-torn blueprints. At thirty-five, Marcus was no stranger to hard work. His hands were calloused from years of fighting against stubborn pipes and impossible clogs, yet his hazel eyes sparkled with a mix of determination and mischief.

Today, the challenge was a formidable one—an urgent call from the local community center, where an ancient boiler had finally succumbed to its years and was now gushing steam and water like a wounded beast. As he opened the back doors of the van, the scent of rubber and oil mingled with the crisp morning air, reminding him of the countless adventures hidden beneath the city’s surface. Little did he know, today’s job would lead him to uncover not just leaks but a network of secrets buried deep within Riverton itself.
