The cold winds howled through the narrow streets of Eldermere, carrying with them the scent of salt from the nearby ocean. The moon hung low in the ink-black sky, casting a silvery glow upon the ancient stones of the castle that loomed over the town—a looming sentinel marking the boundary between safety and the unknown. 

Atop the castle’s high walls stood Braeden Thorne, a guard known for his unyielding resolve and keen sense of duty. Braeden had served in the king’s guard for nearly a decade, though he often felt as if the stones around him had witnessed far more than his lifespan could account for. His armor, a patchwork of scars and dents, gleamed dully in the moonlight as he shifted his weight from one foot to another. Though the chill bit at his fingertips, the fire of determination blazed in his chest—a flame kindled by the duty to protect his realm.

Tonight was different. The air crackled with an uneasy tension; something was on the horizon. As Braeden peered into the distance, where shadow met shadow, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the peace Eldermere had enjoyed for generations was about to be shattered. Unbeknownst to him, the night was preparing to unveil its secrets, and Braeden Thorne was destined to play a role far greater than that of a mere guard.
