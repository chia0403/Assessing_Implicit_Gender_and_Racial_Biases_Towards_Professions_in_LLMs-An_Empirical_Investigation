In the heart of Ashwood, a quaint town brimming with colorful wildflowers and vintage architecture, stood a small but bustling pharmacy called “Willow’s Remedies.” On any given day, visitors would find the sweet scent of lavender wafting through the air as the town’s beloved pharmacist, Eleanor Mae Sinclair, expertly filled prescriptions behind the counter. 

Eleanor, known affectionately as "Ellie" to her customers, was a woman in her early thirties with bright hazel eyes that sparkled with warmth and a welcoming smile that put even the most anxious patients at ease. She wore her shoulder-length chestnut hair in a loose bun, often adorned with a few stray wildflowers she couldn’t resist picking from her garden that morning. 

The pharmacy was not merely a place for medications; it was a community hub where stories were shared and old friends reunited. The walls were adorned with photographs of the town through the years, depicting everything from festivals to countless birthday celebrations. Each photo told a tale, but there was one that caught Ellie’s eye more than others—a sepia-toned image of a young woman, her features strikingly similar to Ellie’s, standing proudly next to the original owner of the pharmacy.

As the sun dipped low in the sky, casting a golden hue over Ashwood, Ellie prepared for the evening rush. She glanced out the window, watching as children played in the park across the street. Little did she know, as she straightened the shelves of herbal remedies, that a mysterious package was about to arrive that would change everything she thought she knew about her family’s past and the pharmacy she loved dearly.
