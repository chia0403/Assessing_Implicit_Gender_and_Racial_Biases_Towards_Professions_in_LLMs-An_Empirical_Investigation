In the heart of downtown Portland, the towering Crescent Hotel shimmered under the soft glow of the setting sun, its elegant facade a stark contrast to the bustling city streets below. The lobby, adorned with rich mahogany, plush velvet furnishings, and an intricate crystal chandelier, welcomed guests with the warmth of an old-world charm fused with modern luxury. The air was perfumed with the faint scent of antiquity—a blend of polished wood, fresh flowers, and the hint of freshly brewed coffee from the café tucked away in the corner.

Among the hustle and bustle of weekend travelers, attended by the gentle hum of conversation and the muted sound of clinking glasses from the adjoining bar, one figure moved with an agile grace. His crisp uniform, complete with a polished brass name tag that read "Felix Thorne," marked him as a bellhop—a position both enviable and demanding.

Felix, a tall young man with a shock of sandy blonde hair and bright blue eyes, had a knack for making people feel at ease with a single smile. Raised in a small coastal town, he’d always dreamed of the life bustling city life promised. On days like this, with the sun painting the lobby in golden hues, he felt that dream solidifying.

But beneath his polished exterior, Felix's routine was stitched with secrets. Each day as he carried suitcases and delivered room service, whispers danced around him, tales of vanished guests and shadowy figures caught in the corners of the hotel's lavish halls. Felix had heard the stories; he had seen the nervous glances exchanged among guests as they huddled in corners. Little did he know, his ordinary existence was about to intertwine with the extraordinary, setting him on a path that would test not only his courage but the very essence of who he truly was.
