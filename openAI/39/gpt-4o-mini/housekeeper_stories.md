In the small coastal town of Seabrook, the mist rolled in from the ocean, mingling with the briny scent of saltwater and the sweet aroma of blooming jasmine. The narrow cobblestone streets whispered the secrets of a bygone era, where every weathered house seemed to hold a story etched into its cracked facade. One such house stood proudly at the edge of a cliff, its whitewashed walls now a bit faded but still radiating charm. Ivy clung to its sides, and a sprawling blue hydrangea bush marked the entrance, inviting visitors with its vibrant color.

In this enchanting setting lived Rosaline Mae Bennett, a devoted housekeeper known for her keen attention to detail and her unwavering sense of duty. With a chestnut braid that fell gracefully down her back and gentle hazel eyes that sparkled with warmth, Rosaline had spent nearly a decade tending to the needs of the distinguished Thorne family, who resided in the grand estate. The creaking floorboards and the dimly lit rooms were her realm, where she navigated through the residue of daily life—dust bunnies, forgotten trinkets, and the occasional mystery hiding beneath the layers of chaos.

As the sun began to rise, casting a warm golden glow over the horizon, Rosaline stood in the kitchen, her favorite place in the house. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled her senses, and she gazed out of the window, lost in thought. Today felt different, though. A strange energy stirred in the air, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to change, both in her own life and in the lives of those she served. Just then, the doorbell echoed through the quiet morning, a sound that would shatter the stillness and alter the course of everything she thought she knew.
