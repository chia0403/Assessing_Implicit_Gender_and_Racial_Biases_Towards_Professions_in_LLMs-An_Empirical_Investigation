Dr. Eliza Harper stepped into the dimly lit waiting room of the Oakwood Behavioral Health Center, her gaze sweeping across the faded floral wallpaper and worn-out chairs that had seen better days. Autumn’s chill seeped through the cracked window panes, adding a brisk edge to the otherwise stagnant air. The scent of old paperbacks mingled with the faint aroma of herbal tea from the staff lounge, creating an oddly comforting atmosphere despite the heavy dread that often lingered in the air.

As she settled into her office, a cozy nook filled with shelves of well-thumbed psychology texts and various succulents that thrived under the soft artificial light, Eliza couldn’t shake the feeling that today would be different. Her patients often revealed their deepest fears and hidden traumas within these walls, but the weight of the stories shared felt monumental, almost as if the past were eager to murmur its secrets to her.

With a deep breath, Eliza adjusted her glasses and turned to her notepad, readying herself for the first session. Little did she know, one of her patients would lead her on an unexpected journey—one that would blur the lines between healing and haunting, and challenge everything she thought she knew about the human mind. As the clock on the wall ticked against the silence, Eliza felt a tingling anticipation in her fingertips, a premonition that today’s revelations would stretch far beyond the confines of her office, dipping into the shadows of her own past.
