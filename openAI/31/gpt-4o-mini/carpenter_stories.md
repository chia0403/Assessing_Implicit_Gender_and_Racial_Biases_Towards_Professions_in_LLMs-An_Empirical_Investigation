In the quaint village of Aldenbrook, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there existed a shop that held the scent of fresh sawdust and the warmth of polished wood. It was here, beneath a wooden shingle intricately carved with the words “Elias Finch - Carpenter,” that the heart of the village pulsed with creativity and craftsmanship.

The sun had only just begun to rise, casting a golden light through the narrow windows of the workshop, illuminating the array of tools hanging from the walls. Each tool had its own story, a testament to years of labor and love that Elias Finch had poured into his trade. Known for his exceptional skill and meticulous attention to detail, the villagers often spoke of his work as if it were magic; a simple piece of wood transformed into a piece of art. 

Elias, a tall man with rough-hewn hands and a beard flecked with sawdust, was lost in the rhythm of his morning routine. He stood at the workbench, the gentle hum of birds outside mingling with the sound of his chisels scraping against the wood. Today, he was crafting a rocking chair, a commission for the town’s upcoming harvest festival. Each curve and joint was carefully considered, as if he were breathing life into the inanimate. 

As he worked, memories flooded back – the laughter of his late father teaching him the trade, the countless hours spent side by side, shaping dreams out of timber. The soft light and the familiar smell of cedar soothed his soul, but a sense of unease lingered in the air. 

Something was changing in Aldenbrook, and Elias sensed it creeping in like the chill of an unexpected winter breeze. Little did he know that this day would mark the beginning of an adventure that would challenge not only his skills as a carpenter but the very essence of the home he had built within these walls.
