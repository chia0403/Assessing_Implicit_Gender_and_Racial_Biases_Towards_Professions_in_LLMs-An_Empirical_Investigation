The crisp morning air hung like a whisper over the towering pines of Cedar Hollow, a secluded valley cradled by the rugged foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Sunlight filtered through the branches, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor, where fallen leaves crunched softly underfoot. The scent of damp earth mingled with the sharp aroma of freshly cut wood, announcing the day's labor.

At the edge of a clearing, amidst the steady hum of a chainsaw, stood Benjamin "Ben" Fletcher, a seasoned logger with deep-set blue eyes and hands roughened by years of toil. He was a man who understood the forest's rhythm, having spent nearly two decades carving a life from its boughs and trunks. The loggers of Cedar Hollow called him "Timber King," not for the size of his stature but for the respect he commanded in a profession that thrived on sweat and determination.

Today was different, though. The edge of the wilderness where he stood felt charged with a sense of foreboding. Clouds loomed in the distance, dark and swollen like a harboring storm, and an uneasy wind rustled through leaves, as if the trees themselves whispered warnings of change. Ben wiped his brow with a thick forearm and squinted into the gloom, a feeling lurking at the back of his mind, something he couldnâ€™t quite shake. Little did he know, the forest held secrets, and today would unravel threads of his past he thought had long been buried.
