Title: **Whispers in the Halls**

Setting: The story takes place in the sprawling, aging structure of Crestwood Academy, a once-prestigious institution nestled on the outskirts of a small, windswept town. The Academy, with its weathered stone façade and ivy-covered walls, still carries remnants of its former glory, echoing the laughter of students and the wisdom of esteemed professors. Its long, dimly lit corridors are lined with dusty lockers and faded portraits of the founders, while the air is tinged with the mixed aromas of old books and polished floors. In the heart of the building lies a forgotten library, where sunlight barely kisses the shelves, giving an air of mystery to the place.

Character: Leonard Gusset

Opening: 

The clock struck midnight at Crestwood Academy, the sound echoing through the empty halls like the distant tolling of a forgotten bell. In the depths of the school, Leonard Gusset, a weary janitor with a heart as weathered as the ancient oak floors he polished, pushed his mop across the gleaming tiles of the main foyer. Leonard had been the night custodian for as long as anyone cared to remember, a solitary figure whose days blurred into nights, filled with the rhythms of routine work. As he scrubbed away the remnants of the day, the vast silence of the Academy wrapped around him like a shroud.

But tonight was different. The shadows danced against the walls, flickering in the pale light of his lone fluorescent bulb. He paused, leaning on his mop, suddenly aware of a faint whispering echoing through the corridors, a sound drifting in and out of his consciousness like a half-remembered dream. He glanced toward the old library, its doors slightly ajar, a silent invitation into the depths of its stories. 

Leonard rubbed the back of his neck, a hint of unease creeping in. He had often heard tales from the few faculty members who remained, stories of secrets buried within the Academy's walls—mysteries that had locked themselves away in the library's shadows. Taking a deep breath, Leonard made his way toward the source of the whispers, curiosity igniting within him like the flicker of a candle in the dark. Little did he know that this was the night everything would change, unraveling the layers of his mundane existence and revealing a world he'd never dared to imagine.
