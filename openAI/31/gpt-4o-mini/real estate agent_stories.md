Title: **Beneath the Surface**

Setting: The small, sun-drenched coastal town of Maple Bay, where whitewashed cottages cling to the cliffs and the scent of salt hangs thick in the air. Towering evergreens line the narrow roads that wind through the picturesque landscape, leading to hidden beaches and rocky shores. The town, known for its vibrant art scene and community-driven festivals, has attracted an influx of newcomers seeking both tranquility and inspiration. Yet, beneath its charming facade lies a web of secrets waiting to be uncovered.

Opening: 

Marissa Lynn Caldwell stood at the edge of the iconic Maple Bay lighthouse, her auburn hair whipping in the brisk ocean breeze. From this vantage point, she could see both the thriving town below and the endless expanse of the sea, which seemed to mirror the tumultuous waters of her life. As a seasoned real estate agent, Marissa had always prided herself on her ability to connect people with their dream homes. But today, she felt a gnawing uncertainty. 

A prominent listing had just landed in her lap—an estate known as the Hawthorne House, a once-grand mansion rumored to be haunted. The townsfolk whispered stories of love and loss entwined within its walls, but Marissa saw potential where others saw ghosts. With the upcoming art festival and the summer rush on the horizon, she was determined to turn the Hawthorne House into her most lucrative sale yet. 

As she gazed out across the bay, her thoughts drifted to the upcoming open house. Would the allure of its haunting history deter buyers or draw them in like moths to a flame? In a town where stories were as important as the houses themselves, Marissa knew the answer could change everything—not just for her career, but for the very heart of Maple Bay. With her mind racing and her heart set, she turned her back to the lighthouse and headed down the winding path, ready to unveil the mystery that was waiting for her at Hawthorne House.
