In the heart of Millstone Hollow, where cobblestone streets wound between ancient oaks and the air always carried the rich scent of earth and woodsmoke, stood Varnell's Meats—a modest butcher shop with streaks of crimson paint fading under the touch of the elements. Inside, the faint sound of a bell jingled every time the door opened, welcoming locals into a world of rustic charm, where the walls were adorned with aging photographs of proud farmers and their livestock.

It was an ordinary Tuesday morning when the day’s first customer entered, greeted by the sight of freshly cut meats hanging neatly on metal hooks, the chill of the air seeming to invigorate the vibrant colors of the sausages and hams that lined the counters. Behind the wooden butcher’s block stood Jasper Thorne, a man known to the townsfolk not just for his craft but for the stories he wove with every deft cut. Jasper Benjamin Thorne—whose family had run the shop for three generations—was a broad-shouldered figure with an easy smile, his hands marked by the labor of his trade and his forearms dusted with flour from the bread he baked every Sunday morning.

But today, Jasper wasn’t merely preparing for the day’s sales; he could feel a tremor in the air, as if the town itself whispered secrets through the rustling leaves. Perhaps it was the arrival of autumn that stirred the unease, or the whispers of tales from the outskirts of Millstone Hollow, where the mist lingered longer than it should. On this day, amidst the familiar rhythm of his trade, Jasper would discover that some stories were more than idle gossip—and some meats carried the weight of a legend long forgotten.
