**Title: The Last Bellhop**

**Setting:** The Grand Marigold Hotel, an opulent establishment nestled in the heart of a bustling metropolis. With its gilded chandeliers, marbled floors, and expansive views of the city skyline, the hotel is a popular haunt for both affluent guests and enigmatic visitors. It is the year 1972, and the summer air is filled with the sweet scent of magnolias from the garden courtyard below, where the sound of laughter and clinking glasses spills out from the elegant terrace.

**Opening:** 

As the morning sun filtered through the tall windows of the Grand Marigold Hotel, casting a warm glow across the lobby, Gregory Emerson adjusted his crisp uniform jacket and took a deep breath. The air was thick with the mingled scents of fresh roses from the reception desk and the faint aroma of brewing coffee wafting from the nearby café. It was another busy day ahead, and Gregory, a diligent bellhop with a penchant for daydreaming, felt a thrill of excitement tinged with nerves.

He stood at his post just inside the grand entrance, eyeing the revolving door with anticipation. Each rotation brought a new world of stories—a celebrity arriving with a flourish, a couple lost in their own universe, or a mysterious guest shrouded in a long trench coat and dark sunglasses. Gregory absorbed it all, his eyes wide with wonder as if each guest was a living novel waiting to be explored.

Yet amidst the bustling activity, something felt different today. The whispers in the corridors hinted at an exclusive event scheduled for that evening—an invitation-only gala for the city’s elite. Gregory could hardly wait. He imagined himself gliding among the rich and powerful, carrying trays of champagne and secretly soaking in their conversations, taking notes on their lives to weave into his own dreams of becoming a writer.

But as he straightened the lapels of his uniform and smoothed the crease in his trousers, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this particular gala was going to be unlike any other he’d ever encountered. The bell rang at the front desk, sending him into a flurry of movement. Time to step into the world of the Grand Marigold—where anticipation hung in the air, and secrets were just a whisper away.
