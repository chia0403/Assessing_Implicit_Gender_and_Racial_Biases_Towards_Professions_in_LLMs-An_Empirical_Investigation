In the heart of the sprawling city of Eldran, where towering stone walls carved an impressive silhouette against the twilight sky, a chill breeze swept through the narrow cobbled streets. The distant echo of a bell marked the hour, its sonorous chimes blending with the muted sounds of evening life. Flickering torchlight cast dancing shadows on the ancient buildings, their weathered facades whispering secrets of bygone eras.

At the southeast gate of the city, a solitary figure stood vigilant, arms crossed and posture as unyielding as the iron gate behind him. **Garrick Thorne**, a seasoned guard of Eldran, wore the heavy chainmail that glinted dully in the waning light. His sharp green eyes scanned the horizon, trained to catch the slightest movement in the encroaching darkness. Like the wall he defended, Garrick was a steadfast sentinel, committed to the safety of his home.

As night settled in, illuminating the sky with stars, Garrick pondered the weight of his duty. Beyond the gate lay the untamed wildernessâ€”a realm where bandits roamed and whispers of dark creatures lingered in hushed tales around flickering hearths. A low growl from the nearby hounds reminded him of the dangers that lurked, and with a shift in the wind, he sensed that something was amiss. Tonight, it seemed, would not be like the others.
