Title: **Miles Between Us**

Setting: The sun began its descent over the vast, arid stretches of Interstate 40, painting the sky a brilliant tapestry of orange and purple. The hum of the highway provided a constant backdrop, a rhythm that resonated with the heart of the open road. Dusty, flat landscapes stretched out on either side, punctuated occasionally by solitary mesas standing like ancient sentinels. A few scattered cacti dotted the horizon, their spindly arms reaching for the fading sun. Out here, the nearest town was a memory, and the stars were about to take their place in the expansive, velvety sky.

Opening: Harold "Dusty" McAllister leaned back in the well-worn seat of his rig, the *Iron Stallion*. As a seasoned truck driver with over two decades on the road, he'd seen the country transform from behind the wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, each delivery a new chapter in a story only he could tell. Dusty had always found a certain comfort in solitude, preferring the vastness of the highways over the confinement of a cubicle. But this night felt different. With the fade of dusk, a troubling sense of restlessness settled in his gut, as if the open road was whispering secrets he wasn’t quite ready to hear.

Tonight, though, his cargo held more weight than usual. A truckload of delicate vintage records sat secure beneath the tarpaulin, bound for a small town with a rich music history. It was a job that paid well, but the journey home felt heavier. Memories surfaced like old songs playing on an endless loop—the laugh of his daughter, Lily, now a teenager, the way she smiled when he returned with tales from the road. Each mile brought him closer to her, but it was also a reminder of the time stolen away, the moments he could never get back. With the engine purring beneath him, Dusty took a deep breath, gripping the wheel tighter as he steered into the twilight, determined to bridge the miles between them, one highway at a time.
