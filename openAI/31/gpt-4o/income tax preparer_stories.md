In the heart of Savannah, where cobblestone streets crisscross beneath towering oaks draped with Spanish moss, Ellery Monroe found solace in the familiar confines of her second-floor office. Her space, nestled in a quaint Victorian building on Broughton Street, was a microcosm of warmth amid the southern chill of late February. The soft hum of a ceiling fan rotated lazily overhead as morning sunlight filtered through delicate lace curtains, casting intricate patterns upon the polished hardwood floor.

Ellery, an astute and meticulous income tax preparer, reveled in the quiet certainty of numbers. She preferred the company of spreadsheets and tax forms to the unpredictable chaos of the outside world. Her desk, an imposing relic of mahogany and brass, was an organized array of client files, a steaming cup of chamomile tea, and a small vase with a single fresh daisyâ€”a gentle reminder of the burgeoning spring.

Each day began with Ellery standing before the wide bay windows, steaming cup in hand, observing the gradually awakening city beneath her. She took comfort in routine, from the reliable certainty of the early morning dog walkers to the distant ring of church bells marking the hour. The rhythm of life in Savannah soothed her, but it was her work that truly anchored her, grounding her with its precise calculations and the satisfaction of resolving the labyrinthine puzzles her clients brought through her door.
