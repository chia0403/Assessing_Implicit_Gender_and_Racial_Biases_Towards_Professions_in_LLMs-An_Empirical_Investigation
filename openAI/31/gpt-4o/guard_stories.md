In the crisp dawn of autumn, where the golden hues of the forest mingled seamlessly with the mist that hovered along the ancient cobbled path, Edwin Lambert stood vigil at the imposing iron gates of Castle Thornwick. Perched high upon the jagged cliffs overlooking the tempestuous sea, the castle was both a fortress and a relic of bygone eras, its shadow casting a long silhouette across the sleepy town of Eldenford nestled below.

Edwin, a guard of unwavering dedication and a keen observer of both the natural world and the human condition, felt the familiar weight of his chainmail pressing gently upon his shoulders as he adjusted his stance. The air was ripe with the scent of brine and earth, and the distant cries of seabirds painted an ethereal symphony against the whispering breeze. This was his domain; this threshold between realms where duty met destiny, and where his presence ensured the safety and secrecy of the castle's ancient stones.

As Edwin watched the vivid tapestry of colors weave across the sky, he found solace in the routine of his post, yet a stirring sense of anticipation thrummed beneath the surface, like the distant roll of thunder before the storm. Today, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the winds carried more than just leaves and salt—they carried change.
