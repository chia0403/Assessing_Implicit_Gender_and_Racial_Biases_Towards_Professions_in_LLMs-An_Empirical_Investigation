In the heart of Willow Creek, a quaint town nestled between rolling emerald hills and thick, whispering forests, stood the Willow Creek Medical Centre. It was an unassuming brick building but held a quiet, determined energy that buzzed through its hallways. Here, amid the rhythmic swells of patient conversations and the soft beep of machines, worked Lila Mae Harper, the town's revered phlebotomist.

Lila Mae, with her gentle smile and steady hands, had a reputation for making even the most needle-averse patient feel at ease. Her dark auburn hair was usually tied back in a loose bun, and a pair of horn-rimmed glasses perched on her nose, framing eyes that seemed to hold stories of their own.

The air was crisp as autumn had just begun to paint the town in shades of amber and gold. The scent of fresh rain on wooden porches and the earthy aroma of damp leaves lingered in the air, giving the town a feeling of nostalgic serenity. The Medical Centre, with its worn wooden floors and sunlit rooms, resonated a warmth that comforted those who entered – a sanctuary of healing amidst the sleepy hum of the rural township.

Lila Mae loved her work; it was her way of contributing to the community that had raised her. She understood the trust her patients placed in her, often finding herself listening to their stories while their blood filled the vials—stories of old family feuds, tales of resilient love, and secrets whispered during hushed, fleeting moments. Today, however, an unfamiliar anticipation hung in the air, prickling like static. A series of peculiar incidents had started weaving themselves into the ordinary tapestry of Willow Creek, and unbeknownst to Lila Mae, today her steady hands would uncover the first thread.
