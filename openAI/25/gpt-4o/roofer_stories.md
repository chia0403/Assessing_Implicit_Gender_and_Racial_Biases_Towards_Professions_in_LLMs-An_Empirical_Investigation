Evan McAlister stood at the edge of the roof, his silhouette sharp against the vibrant backdrop of the morning sky. The early sun cast an amber glow over the sprawling suburb, painting the rows of houses with warm hues. This particular rooftop, like many others Evan had tread upon, offered him a panoramic view of the small coastal town of Harbor Springs. Below, the Atlantic Ocean danced in the distance, its waves catching the light like a sea of shimmering diamonds.

The town itself, nestled between craggy cliffs and emerald forests, was starting to stir with the sounds of daily life. Mothers called children in for breakfast, delivery trucks rumbled by, and the distant tolling of the church bell chimed in time with the seagulls' cries. Evan inhaled deeply, savoring the salty breeze that rolled in from the coast. It was a scent that reminded him of both freedom and responsibilityâ€”freedom in the heights above the bustle below, and responsibility in ensuring the roofs beneath his feet were secure against the elements.

Evan had been roofing since he was old enough to lift a hammer alongside his father. McAlister & Son Roofing was more than just a business; it was a legacy, one started by his grandfather long before Harbor Springs had transformed from a sleepy fishing village into the charming, bustling community it was today. As he surveyed his work, Evan thought of the countless hours spent learning every shingle, every creak, every leak that could possibly mar the structure of the homes he cared for.

Today, he was finishing up repairs on the Donovan house, a stately Victorian perched on Maple Hill, its gables and turrets a testament to a bygone era. Mrs. Donovan had called him just last week, her voice fraught with concern over a sudden leakage that threatened her collection of antique books. Evan understood the weight of her worry; he too cherished things passed down through the generations.
