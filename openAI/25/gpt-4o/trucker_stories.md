In the crisp, early hours of a misty autumn morning, the silhouette of a lone truck sliced through the fog on the deserted highway. The road stretched out like a ribbon through the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, lined by towering oaks that stood as silent sentinels in the stillness of dawn. The air carried the rich scent of damp earth and fallen leaves, mingling in a symphony of aromas that signaled the changing season.

Behind the wheel of the weathered, indigo-colored Kenworth sat Wyatt McCabe, a seasoned trucker whose life was woven into the fabric of these endless roads. His hands, roughened by years of gripping steering wheels and untangling chains, rested calmly at ten and two. Wyatt had seen his fair share of sunrises, watching them burn across vast plains and climb over jagged mountain peaks, but there was something particularly grounding about this momentâ€”the beginning of another day, another journey.

Wyatt's life was a perpetual dance with time, each mile a beat in a rhythm that had been set long before he ever climbed into a cab. A thermos of coffee sat beside him, its fading warmth a small comfort amid the chill. On the dashboard, a small photo of his daughter was wedged into the corner of the windshield, her smiling face a constant reminder of what waited back home.

The gentle hum of the engine and the rhythmic click of the turn signal as he maneuvered along the serpentine path were the only sounds in this solitary world. The journey was one of routine and ritual, and it was within this structure that Wyatt had found a semblance of peace, despite the restlessness that sometimes tugged at the edges of his consciousness.

Wyatt had earned a reputation as a reliable hauler, a man who knew the bends of the road and the bends of fate with equal familiarity. With another load bound for a destination etched in the far reaches of his memory, Wyatt McCabe was once again a part of the living, breathing tapestry that unfolded across the American landscape, where every mile told a story and every turn promised a new beginning.
