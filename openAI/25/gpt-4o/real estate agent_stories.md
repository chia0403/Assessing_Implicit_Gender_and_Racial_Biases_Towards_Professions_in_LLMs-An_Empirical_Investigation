On a balmy summer morning in the heart of Savannah, Georgia, the air was thick with the scent of magnolias and possibility. The sun cast a golden glow over the cobblestone streets lined with grand oak trees draped in Spanish moss. Nestled within the historic district, a modest office with a shingle sign swinging gently in the breeze read "Riverbend Realty."

Inside, Charlotte Abrams wiped the dust off a stack of property flyers with the corner of her blazer. A seasoned real estate agent with a penchant for restoration projects, Charlotte had an eye for the hidden charm in the old brick facades and sprawling verandas that peppered the city. Today, her agenda was filled with back-to-back showings of a decrepit Victorian on Habersham Street, a property she was determined to see restored to its former glory.

As she glanced out the window, a trolley car clattered by, filled with tourists snapping photos of the antebellum architecture. Each day in Savannah brought new faces and stories, and amidst the rich tapestry of history and modernity, Charlotte had found her calling: breathing new life into the old bones of the past.
