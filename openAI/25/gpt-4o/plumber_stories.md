On the outskirts of Willow Creek, where the roar of the city dimmed to a low hum and the air was tinged with the scent of pine, a quaint little suburb nestled between rolling hills and a shimmering lake. The road snaked through the neighborhood, lined with cozy, well-kept houses that seemed to lean toward one another in gentle camaraderie. Children’s laughter echoed from backyards, and the golden leaves, carried by the crisp autumn breeze, danced down the sidewalks in playful swirls.

In the midst of this picturesque scene stood a modest single-story cottage, its red brick facade partially hidden behind a thriving rose bush displaying the last of summer’s blooms. A white work van, emblazoned with the cheerful blue lettering of "Mason Plumbing Services," was parked in the gravel driveway. Inside, the rhythmic clinking of tools intermingled with the bubbling sounds of a percolating coffee pot.

Elias Mason, the man behind the trade, stood at a well-worn workbench cluttered with pipes, wrenches, and various gauges. He was a tall, broad-shouldered figure, with hands that bore the signs of years of dedicated work — calloused, strong, and adept at piecing together the puzzles behind walls and beneath floors. His eyes, a shade of blue reminiscent of the sky before a storm, held a keen, steady focus as he reviewed the day's job assignments. Each was written in his precise handwriting, a planner filled with addresses and notes on the quirks of plumbing in older homes.

As he sipped his coffee, Elias allowed himself a moment to look out the window at the rising sun casting long, warm shadows across the yard. Despite the humdrum nature of his profession, he found a peculiar satisfaction in the predictability of pipes and valves, the quiet reliability of water flowing smoothly where it was meant to. Yet, on this particular morning, he felt a strange sense of anticipation in the air, as though something unexpected and extraordinary lay just around the corner, ready to alter the path of his otherwise routine day.
