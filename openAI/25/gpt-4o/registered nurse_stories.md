Amidst the sprawling hills of the Appalachians, where the morning mist clings to the trees like a soft blanket, the small town of Maple Ridge awoke to another day. The town was a quilt of rustic charm, with quaint houses huddled together on cobblestone streets, and the scent of pine mingled with freshly baked bread from the local bakery. At the heart of Maple Ridge, across from the sun-dappled town square, stood Ridgeview Medical Center—a modest but vital sanctuary amid the mountains.

Inside the warm, bustling corridors of Ridgeview was Jenna-Marie Thompson, RN. With her chestnut hair pulled back in a practical ponytail and a stethoscope draped casually around her neck, Jenna-Marie navigated the hallways with ease. Her presence was a blend of gentle compassion and unwavering resolve, traits honed over years of tending to the diverse ailments and stories of Maple Ridge’s residents. Her patient smile and attentive eyes brought comfort to those in distress, making her a cherished figure within the community.

As the sun broke through the clouds, casting a golden hue over the town, Jenna-Marie’s day began in earnest. While the rhythms of the hospital often mirrored the ebb and flow of the town's daily life, today felt different. A sense of anticipation hung in the air, as though Maple Ridge itself was holding its breath. Unbeknownst to Jenna-Marie, the day would soon unravel in ways that would test not only her skills but the very essence of the tight-knit community she had come to call home.
