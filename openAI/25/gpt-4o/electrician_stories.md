In the small coastal town of Seacrest, where the saltwater breeze whispered tales of the ocean to anyone who cared to listen, the morning sun bathed the landscape in a gentle, golden warmth. Birds sang their chorus as they flitted among the rustling palm trees lining the streets, their song harmonizing with the distant roar of the waves. Colorful cottages and quaint shops stood in neat rows, their weathered facades bearing testament to years of salt and sea.

At the heart of the town, on an unassuming street that wound its way towards the harbor, Robert "Rob" Fitzpatrick—a skilled electrician known for his steadfast commitment and perpetually rumpled hair—sipped his coffee at Dino's Diner. He settled into his favorite corner booth, the seat cracked from years of loving use, to plan the tasks that lay ahead. His tool belt rested on the seat beside him, a constant companion, and his fingers traced its worn leather absently as he reviewed the day’s appointments.

Rob’s reputation preceded him; in a town as small as Seacrest, good work traveled fast. His deft hands had repaired everything from flickering porch lights to the aged wiring of the town’s historic lighthouse. But today, as Rob gazed out the diner's window at the bustling morning traffic, he felt a stirring of something different in the air, a sensation just beyond familiarity. Little did he know, this ordinary day would soon lead him into an adventure that would illuminate more than mere bulbs and wires.
