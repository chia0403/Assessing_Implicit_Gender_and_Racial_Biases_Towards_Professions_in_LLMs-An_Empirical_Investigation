The rain draped the city of Ashwood in a shimmering veil, reflecting the kaleidoscope of neon lights that flickered from the storefronts lining Elm Street. Julie Ann Parker stood under the awning of a rundown café, her notepad and pen clutched tightly in her hands, the remnants of her last interview still scrawled on the pages. The scent of wet pavement mixed with freshly brewed coffee, a bittersweet reminder of the long night that lay ahead.

With each drop that splashed onto the ground, her mind was racing, piecing together fragments of a story that seemed to twist and turn like the storm clouds above. For weeks, whispers of corruption in the city hall had filtered through the alleyways and the hidden corners of Ashwood, stirring her instincts as a reporter. Julie knew this could be the break she had been waiting for— a chance to expose the truth that had eluded her colleagues and the public alike.

As she glanced at her watch, the dull glow of the face told her that time was running short. She had been granted a rare opportunity to interview a former city council member who had agreed to meet on a remote rooftop, away from prying eyes. She thought of her editor's words: "Get the story that no one else can." 

Feeling the chill of the wind cut through her damp coat, Julie adjusted the collar and set her jaw in determination. Tonight, the rain wouldn’t be the only thing washing away the secrets of Ashwood; she was ready to uncover the stories buried beneath layers of deception. Little did she know, the shadows lurking in the stormy night held more than just answers—they were about to change her life forever.
