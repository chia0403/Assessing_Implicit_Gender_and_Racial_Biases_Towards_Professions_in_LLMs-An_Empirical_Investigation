In the heart of Mendel’s Hollow, a quaint yet bustling town nestled between sweeping hills and shimmering lakes, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm, golden light over the cobblestone streets. Victorian-style homes, each telling its own story, lined the avenues, their intricate woodwork and manicured gardens a testament to the town’s rich history. The air was fragrant with blooming lilacs and fresh earth, inviting passersby to pause and take in the moment.

Inside the chic office of Crestway Realty, a newly renovated storefront with large glass windows displaying vibrant listings, stood Avery Margaret Sinclair. With chestnut hair cascading down her back and a confident smile that could charm anyone, Avery was no ordinary real estate agent. Armed with a degree in architecture and a passion for restoring historic homes, she was a force within the Mendel’s Hollow community. Her keen eye for detail and her innate sense of what buyers desired had allowed her to build a reputation that was nothing short of legendary.

As she meticulously arranged the latest brochures on the polished oak coffee table, her mind raced with possibilities. Avery had just landed a listing that could change everything—a sprawling estate that had languished on the market for months due to its somewhat daunting reputation as "the old Whittemore Mansion." Town gossip had always whispered about its eerie past, but Avery was determined to uncover its potential and reveal the beauty hidden within its walls. With the evening shadows lengthening, she took a deep breath, ready to dive headfirst into the challenge that lay ahead.
