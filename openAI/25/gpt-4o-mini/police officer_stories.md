Under the muted glow of a flickering streetlamp, Officer Amelia Jane Thompson adjusted her baseball cap, the emblem of the Ravenwood Police Department casting a familiar shadow over her focused eyes. It was just past midnight, and the windswept streets of Ravenwood echoed with the distant sounds of rustling leaves and the occasional bark of a stray dog. 

Amelia stood at the intersection of Maple Street and Second Avenue, her gaze scanning the quiet neighborhood, the kind of place where everyone knew each other’s names and secrets lingered just out of sight. The late summer air was thick with humidity, causing beads of sweat to form at her temples. A faint siren wailed in the distance, but here, in this moment, the only calls to duty came from the rustling branches overhead and the hum of the old neon diner sign across the street.

This was the heart of Ravenwood—a town framed by dense woods on one side and the ever-stormy coastline on the other. A place of picturesque charm stained by shadows, where new friends could quickly become enemies, and the calm façades often masked deeper currents of unrest. 

Amelia relished the order of her world as a police officer, a commitment that ran deep in her family, serving the people and keeping the peace in a town she called home. However, the unease in the air that night hinted at a different story. Something was brewing just beneath the surface, waiting for someone like her to uncover it. The flash of a red light from the corner of her eye caught her attention, piercing through the veil of the ordinary—and that familiar tingle of instinct began to rise within her. This night would soon change everything.
