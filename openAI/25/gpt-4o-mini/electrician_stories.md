**Opening:**

The hum of fluorescent lights filled the air as Lucas Benjamin Hartman knelt beside the rusty steel panel of the old warehouse. Dust motes danced in the beams of light filtering through cracked windows, remnants of a time when this place buzzed with activity. Now, it was a husk of forgotten machinery and peeling paint, a haunting echo of the city's once-thriving industry. Lucas brushed a hand across his forehead, leaving a streak of grime on his skin. He had been called to this dilapidated structure to assess the erratic wiring that had plagued it for weeks, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this place than met the eye.

**Setting:**

The warehouse was nestled in the heart of a decaying part of town, where the once-bustling streets were now lined with shuttered storefronts and crumbling brick buildings. The air held a musty scent, tinged with the faint aroma of rust and memory. Outside, the distant sounds of traffic and the shouts of street vendors felt like a world away, creating an eerie silence that enveloped the warehouse. Inside, the walls were covered in layers of graffiti—a vivid testimony to the artists who had laid claim to the forgotten space. Shadows curled in the corners, and every creak of the floorboards seemed to whisper secrets of the past. Lucas glanced at his toolbox, feeling the weight of his responsibilities; he wasn’t just there to fix wires—he was about to uncover the history buried in the darkness.
