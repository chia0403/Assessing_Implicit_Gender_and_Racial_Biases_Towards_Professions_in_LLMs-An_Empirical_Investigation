**Story Opening and Setting:**

In the heart of the sprawling city of Aldencrest, where the glinting skyscrapers clashed with the remnants of old brick buildings, a solitary workshop nestled between a coffee shop and a forgotten bookstore. The flickering neon sign above the door simply read "Tech Haven," but for those in the know, it was the backbone of the city's forgotten airwaves. Inside, a faint hum of machinery resonated with an eclectic mix of retro tunes and the occasional crackle of static. It was here that Norah Elspeth Fenton, a seasoned radio technician, carved out her niche in a world increasingly dominated by digital noise.

Norah, with her chestnut hair pulled tightly into a bun and a pair of grease-stained overalls adorned with various badges from radio conventions of yore, was hunched over an intricately designed device that hummed with a life of its own. Her workbench was a chaotic symphony of vintage radio parts and half-finished projects, reflecting her meticulous yet adventurous spirit. Each device, from the pre-war models to the more eccentric creations of her own making, held memories of long-forgotten voices and stories waiting to be retold.

It was early evening, and the rich scent of coffee wafted in from the neighboring shop, mixing with the metallic tang of solder and plastic. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden light through the window, Norah adjusted the knobs on the old transmitter she was restoring, unaware that tonight would bring a frequency unlike any she had encountered beforeâ€”a signal rich with secrets that would ultimately alter the course of her life.
