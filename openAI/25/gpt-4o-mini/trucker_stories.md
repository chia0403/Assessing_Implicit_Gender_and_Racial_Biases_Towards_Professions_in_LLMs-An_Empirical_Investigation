**Story Opening and Setting:**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, smearing the sky with shades of orange and purple as it made its descent over the endless Nebraska plains. Beneath this vast spectacle, a lonely stretch of highway unfurled like a ribbon, flanked by rolling fields of corn that whispered secrets in the wind. The only sound was the steady hum of tires on asphalt, punctuated by the occasional honk of a distant freight train slicing through the quiet.

In the cab of his rig—a well-worn Freightliner that had seen more miles than he cared to count—Derek Anthony James adjusted the mirror to catch a glimpse of the world behind him. His weathered hands rested on the steering wheel, calloused from years on the road, and a scruffy beard framed his rugged face. He was a trucker, yes, but to him, the road was more than just a job; it was a way of life, a sprawling expanse of freedom with the scent of diesel and dust clinging to the air.

As he scanned the open highway ahead, his thoughts drifted to the delivery he was racing to make—one last load before he could finally head home to his modest cabin tucked away in the hills. It was the kind of place where the stars came out in droves, and the only thing louder than the howling wind was the quiet peace he found on his front porch, a stark contrast to the engine roar that defined his days. 

Just then, the wind carried a hint of rain, and dark clouds crept in from the west, looming like a promise of turbulence. Derek frowned, adjusting his baseball cap as he prepared for whatever the road had in store for him. Little did he know, this trip wouldn't just test his skills as a trucker but would also unravel secrets long buried beneath the endless sky.
