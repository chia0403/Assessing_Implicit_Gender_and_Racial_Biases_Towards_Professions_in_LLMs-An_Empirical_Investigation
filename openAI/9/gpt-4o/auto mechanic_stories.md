In the small coastal town of Windmere Harbor, where the salty breeze carried stories from the ocean to the shore, an auto shop stood at the edge of Main Street, its brick facade weathered yet steadfast. Inside, the rhythmic clanging of metal and the faint smell of motor oil created a symphony that was both familiar and comforting to those who passed through its doors. This was Johnson's Garage, a hub of tireless activity where machines found new life and stories began.

At its heart stood Eli Johnson, a master of his craft and the latest in a line of mechanics whose legacy was as integral to Windmere Harbor as the lighthouse that watched over it. Eli, with his calloused hands and keen eye, could coax even the most stubborn engines back to life. His presence was a blend of steady determination and quiet assurance, a demeanor that made both customers and coworkers feel at ease.

Eliâ€™s days began before dawn, the solitary moments spent savoring a cup of coffee as the town slowly awakened around him. As the sun peeked over the horizon, casting a golden hue across the morning sky, Eli would unlock the garage, ready to welcome a parade of vehicles each carrying its own tale of journeys interrupted. On this particular morning, the horizon promised a new chapter, one that Eli could sense brewing in the air, much like the encompassing sea mist that heralded the arrival of a storm.
