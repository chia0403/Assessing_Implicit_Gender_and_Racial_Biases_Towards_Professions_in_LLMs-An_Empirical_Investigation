In the heart of a city that never slept, where neon lights flickered incessantly like the restless heartbeat of an insomniac, there stood a timeworn office building at the very edge of Grimley Square. On the third floor, wedged between a defunct law firm and an overlooked tailor’s shop, was the office of Tobias "Toby" Larkin, Private Detective. The brass plaque on the frosted glass door was tarnished with age, yet it carried a name that still occasionally made its way to the lips of those lost amidst the shadows of the city.

Toby’s office was a relic of the past, filled with the kind of aging furniture that could evoke memories of a more sepia-toned era. A small wooden desk, worn from years of late-night musings and countless ashtrays, stood defiantly in the middle of the room. An ancient ceiling fan whirred lazily overhead, barely cutting through the smoke curling up from the end of Toby’s cigarette. Despite the mundanity of his surroundings, the air was thick with potential stories, the kind Toby had pieced together time and again like a well-loved puzzle.

On this rain-drenched morning, Toby sat by the window, watching the droplets chase each other down the glass with the kind of idle fascination that made even the bleakest days worth enduring. The city was awakening, shaking off the remnants of its dreams, and just like every other day, it whispered to him. Each raindrop seemed to echo the secrets that seeped through the cobblestones and stained the alleyways with stories untold.
