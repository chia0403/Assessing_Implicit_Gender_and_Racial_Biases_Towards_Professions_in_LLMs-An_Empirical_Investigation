In the heart of the bustling city of Ashbourne, nestled between narrow streets lined with cobblestones and ivy-clad brick buildings, sat a quaint little butcher shop with a weathered wooden sign that read "Rutherford's Meats." The shop had stood there for nearly half a century, a testament to the craftsmanship and dedication of its founder, Harold Rutherford. Now, the large wooden counter and neatly displayed cuts of meat were presided over by his grandson, Benjamin Rutherford.

Benjamin, known to everyone in the neighborhood as Ben, had inherited more than just the shop; he carried forward a legacy of meticulous skill and a genuine warmth that endeared him to his patrons. With his sleeves rolled up, revealing muscular forearms lightly dusted with flour from the morning's bacon rolls, Ben moved with practiced precision. The cool air inside the shop was filled with the rich aromas of seasoned sausages, smoked hams, and the comforting scent of freshly baked bread he insisted on making himself every morning. 

It was early autumn, and the first whispers of the season weaved through the open door, carrying with them the crispness of fallen leaves and a gentle promise of change. As the sun slowly climbed higher in the sky, casting slanted golden rays through the shop’s old mullioned windows, Ben prepared for another day of serving the community with the same care and attention that had been his grandfather’s hallmark. Every slice, every exchange, held the stories of the neighborhood—a tapestry of lives woven together by shared meals and familiar faces. 

And so, the day began, with Benjamin Rutherford at the helm, a butcher in spirit and heart, ready to welcome the stories that would walk through his door.
