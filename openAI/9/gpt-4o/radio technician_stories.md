In the small coastal town of Ormsby Bay, where the scent of saltwater lingered in the air and the cries of seagulls echoed against a backdrop of crashing waves, Avery Lennox adjusted the dial on an aging radio transmitter. Set atop a rocky bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic Ocean, the Ormsby Lighthouse was a relic of an older time—its beam still a beacon for passing ships, while its interior had been repurposed into a makeshift radio station. 

Avery, the town's dedicated radio technician, had a knack for bringing life back to forgotten machines. Tools and vintage radio parts cluttered the small room within the towering structure, each with its story, much like the lighthouse itself. The walls were lined with postcards from distant lands and faded maps of the constellations. A soft glow from a table lamp illuminated his workspace, where wires intertwined like threads in a spider’s web.

Outside, the afternoon sun began its descent, casting a golden hue over the town, where small cottages with white picket fences dotted the landscape. The townspeople of Ormsby Bay relied on Avery not just for news from the outside world but for the familiar comfort his broadcasts brought. As he prepared for another evening of transmissions, he gazed out of the window at the vast sea, pondering what tales the waves had to tell.
