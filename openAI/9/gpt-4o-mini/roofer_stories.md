Underneath a sky brushed with hues of lavender and gold, the small town of Maplewood nestled between rolling hills, its quaint houses adorned with blooming gardens. This morning, however, a low-hanging fog cloaked the neighborhood, transforming the familiar streets into a whisper of mystery. As the sun began to emerge, casting its warm light on the dew-kissed rooftops, the air hummed with the promise of a new day.

At the far end of Oakwood Lane stood a proud, vintage Victorian home, its once-vibrant paint now peeling and weary. This was the site of James Franklin Baker’s latest project. A seasoned roofer with calloused hands and a weathered face that spoke of many long hours spent under the sun, James had always found solace in the heights above the bustling town. Today was no different, as he arrived at the site with his tool belt strapped tightly around his waist and the smell of fresh coffee lingering in his wake.

As he set down his tools at the base of the ladder, he glanced up at the ornate shingles waiting to be replaced, their age worn like an old friend. For James, roofing wasn't just a job; it was an art, a way to connect with the history of each building, preserving stories long lost to time. But today, a nagging feeling tugged at him—a sense that this job would be unlike any other. As he hoisted himself onto the ladder, the fog began to lift, revealing not only the beautiful architecture of the home but also something strange glinting among the ruins—a clue that would intertwine his life with the very soul of Maplewood.
