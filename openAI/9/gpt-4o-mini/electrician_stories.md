In the sleepy town of Riverton, where the sun hung low over the rolling hills and the air was thick with the scent of blooming wildflowers, lived an unassuming electrician named Benjamin Carlisle. His workshop, a modest brick building nestled between a bakery and an antique shop on Main Street, was cluttered with tools of the trade—wire strippers, voltage testers, and a disarray of electrical components that often threatened to spill onto the pavement outside.

It was an early morning in late May, and wisps of golden sunlight filtered through the dusty window panes, casting warm squares of light on the faded floorboards. Benjamin, a man in his late thirties with tousled brown hair and a penchant for plaid shirts, was sipping coffee from his favorite chipped mug while scanning the day’s work orders. The hum of the town waking up outside mixed with the quiet buzz of electric potential crackling in his mind—today promised new challenges.

As he prepared to set out for his first job of the day, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something unusual was in the air. Perhaps it was the way the birds seemed to be chirping more insistently than usual or the flickering of the streetlights as he passed them on his way to the old Simmons house—a crumbling Victorian on the edge of the town where tales of odd electrical mishaps danced through the local gossip. Benjamin was no stranger to peculiarities in his line of work, but something told him today would be different, and he felt a mix of excitement and trepidation as he fastened his toolbelt, ready to confront whatever awaited him.
