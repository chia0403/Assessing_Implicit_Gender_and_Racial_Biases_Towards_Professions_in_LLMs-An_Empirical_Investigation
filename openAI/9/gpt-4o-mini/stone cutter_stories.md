In the heart of the rugged, timeless peaks of the Stonecrest Mountains, nestled between craggy cliffs and ancient pines, lay the small village of Eldergrove. Here, the air was crisp with the scent of pine resin, and the constant murmur of the river below served as a soothing backdrop to the rhythm of daily life. The villagers were proud of their traditions, and among them was a man whose name echoed through the quarry and beyond—Cormac Thorne.

Cormac was a master stone cutter, his hands calloused from years of labor yet deft as a musician’s fingers on a stringed instrument. He was known for his ability to breathe life into the cold, unyielding rock, transforming rough boulders into sculptures that spoke of strength and beauty. Each morning, as the dawn broke, he would rise before the sun, his silhouette framed against the rising light, and make his way to the quarry with his weathered tools slung over his shoulder.

The quarry, a vast chasm cut from the mountainside, was where Cormac felt most at home. Solid walls towered above him, their surfaces glistening in shades of gray and ochre, while the sound of his hammer striking chisel resonated like a heartbeat in the quiet dawn. It was here that both stone and soul were forged, surrounded by the stoic majesty of the mountain that had stood for millennia. But lately, a shiver of doubt had settled within Cormac’s chest—strange dreams haunted his nights, visions of restless stones whispering secrets of a great creation still waiting to be unearthed. 

As the first light kissed the peaks with a golden hue, Cormac prepared to embark on a journey that would lead him deeper into his art—and perhaps into the very heart of the stone itself.
