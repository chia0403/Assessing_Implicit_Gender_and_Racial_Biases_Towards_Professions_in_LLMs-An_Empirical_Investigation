In the heart of Maplewood, a small town where the scent of pine mingled with the lingering aroma of gasoline, stood a modest garage called "Eagle's Rest Auto Repair." The sun cast a warm, golden glow over the cracked asphalt as the familiar sound of tools clattering and engines revving filled the air. Inside, grease-stained walls were adorned with vintage car posters and a clock that ticked steadily, keeping time with the rhythm of the everyday bustle.

At the center of this mechanical sanctuary was Marcus Henry Malone, a thirty-five-year-old auto mechanic with a talent for coaxing life back into the most stubborn of engines. With tousled brown hair and a rugged beard that hinted at the long hours spent under hoods, Marcus was the sort of person who could fix anything with a pulse. His hands, calloused and strong, moved effortlessly over metal and machinery, often accompanied by a ready smile and a soft murmur of classic rock playing on the radio.

Today, however, the atmosphere felt different. The garage door rumbled open, letting in an unusual chill as dark clouds rolled in over the town, threatening rain. Marcus wiped his hands on a rag, glancing out to see a figure standing by the roadside, silhouetted against the encroaching storm. Something about the way they held themselves piqued his curiosity, and as he stepped closer to the entrance, he felt an unshakable premonition that the day held more than just oil changes and tire rotations ahead.
