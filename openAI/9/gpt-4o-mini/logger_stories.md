The moon hung low over the dense, whispering pines of Timber Creek, casting long shadows that danced over the forest floor like phantoms in the night. The air was crisp and filled with the earthy scent of damp soil and moss, the remnants of the day’s rain clinging to the underbrush. In the heart of this rugged wilderness stood a solitary cabin, worn but resilient, surrounded by towering trees that had witnessed the passage of time in silent stoicism.

Within the cabin, the glow of a lantern flickered against the wooden walls, illuminating the work-worn hands of Jacob Thorne, a fifth-generation logger. At thirty-five, Jacob carried the weight of his family’s legacy on his broad shoulders, a lineage stitched into the very fabric of this sprawling forest. His fingers were calloused and rough from years of wielding an axe, and his auburn hair, tousled and streaked with strands of silver, spoke of countless days spent under the sun and the elements.

As he meticulously sharpened his tools, the sounds of the night enveloped him—a chorus of distant owls hooting, the rustle of leaves, and the occasional crackle of twigs underfoot. This was his sanctuary, the scent of cedar and fir a balm to his spirit. Yet, a sense of unease threaded through the serenity, for the winds whispered of change, and in the depths of the forest, something ancient and restless stirred. Jacob swallowed hard, glancing at the stark outline of the mountains against the star-studded sky, feeling an inexplicable pull towards the shadows that loomed just beyond the reach of his lantern’s light.
