The flickering fluorescent lights cast an unsteady glow over the deserted corridors of Hawthorne High School, creating a dance of shadows that flicked across the freshly scrubbed tiles. It was late evening, and the hum of the janitorial crew’s machinery was the only sound puncturing the thick silence. 

In the midst of this almost palpable stillness, Samuel Everett Dawson pushed his mop resolutely across the floor, his weathered hands gripping the long wooden handle with a familiar ease. The janitor’s navy blue jumpsuit was slightly frayed at the edges, a testament to the years of late nights and early mornings spent in the service of the school's upkeep. Sam had been here long enough to know every crack in the walls and every creak of the ancient floorboards, but tonight felt different. An unsettling energy seemed to linger in the air, almost as if the building itself were holding its breath, waiting for something—or someone.

As he made his way down the gallery adorned with faded photographs of graduating classes, Sam mused nostalgically about the students who had walked these halls. Each frame captured more than just smiles; they held the stories of dreams and heartbreak, hope and despair. But his reverie was abruptly interrupted by a distant thud echoing from the art room—a place he knew all too well for its chaotic blend of creativity and mess.

With a cautious sigh, Sam decided to check it out, his heart racing with a mixture of curiosity and unease. After all, tonight was supposed to be just another shift, a series of mundane tasks that transformed the school into a cleaner, brighter space by morning. Little did he know that the discovery awaiting him beyond the door would unravel something deep within the walls of Hawthorne High, something that had been hidden long before he took up his mop.
