In the crisp light of early morning, the dew clung like jewels to the wide expanse of green that stretched as far as the eye could see. Rows of stately oaks lined the path leading to the heart of Holloway Estate, where the stately mansion stood, draped in ivy and history. The air was filled with the gentle hum of insects waking to another day, mingling with the distant calls of birds that nested in the high branches above. It was a world unto itself, sealed off from the rush of time beyond its sprawling borders.

Amidst this picturesque setting, Jonas Fletcher, the estate’s dedicated groundskeeper, moved with purpose and precision. At fifty-three, with sun-etched lines on his face and hands that were as familiar with the feel of earth as a sailor’s were with rope, Jonas had dedicated the better part of his life to coaxing beauty from the land. His presence was almost mythical among those who knew the estate; a trusty steward who knew every tree, every bush, and every blade of grass under his care.

To Jonas, Holloway wasn't just a job—it was a living, breathing masterpiece. Every day unfolded with tasks imbued with a rhythm he understood inherently: pruning trees with the patience of a medic attending a wound, or encouraging flowers to bloom just so, like a maestro guiding his orchestra. And today was no different, as he set out with his well-worn tools and the soothing familiarity of routine, ready to coax yet another day from the rich soil he loved.
