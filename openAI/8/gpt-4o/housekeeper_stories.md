In the quiet mid-morning hush of Sable Manor, the only sound was the soft whisper of a broom gliding across the polished oak floors. The air carried a faint scent of lemon and lavender, the familiar signature of Liliana Harper's diligent care. Situated on the outskirts of Dunsberry, a quaint English village wrapped in swathes of heather and ivy, the manor was both a daunting and comforting presence, its ancient stone walls having borne witness to centuries of whispered secrets and echoing laughter.

Liliana Harper, the manor’s housekeeper for nearly a decade, approached her duties with unwavering dedication. Her keen hazel eyes, framed by a curtain of dark, curling hair that defied all attempts at taming, missed nothing. Though the windows were thrown open to welcome the day, the grand old house—still sound asleep in its hollows—held a subtle chill that crept into her bones, a testament to its ancient lineage and the perennially overcast skies of the village.

At thirty-four, Liliana found solace in the rhythms of her work—the dusting of forgotten corners, the polishing of timeworn banisters, the ritualistic opening of heavy drapes to let in the gentle wash of grey daylight. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every sigh of the doors, and every flicker of the aging chandeliers overhead. Sable Manor was more than her place of employment; it was her sanctuary.

Outside, the world was beginning to stir. The village square, with its cobblestone paths and timber-framed shops, would soon hum with the day’s business. But within the manor’s thick walls, Liliana reveled in the peaceful interlude that stretched between dawn and the inevitable call of household duties. For now, she was content to glide invisibly through the corridors, a keeper of stories, watching as the sunlight gradually unfurled itself across the tapestry of the day.
