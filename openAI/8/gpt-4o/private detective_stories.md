In the heart of Port Lorian, a city where the rain seemed to fall more often than the sun ever shone, the neon lights of Mick's Diner flickered with a stubborn persistence. The air smelled like a mix of brewed coffee and distant ambition, with a hint of desperation for good measure. It was the kind of place that attracted souls drifting through the busy streets, looking for warmth or answers, or perhaps a little bit of both.

Detective Evelyn Harper sat at her regular booth, under the glowing orange sign promising 'World's Best Pie', although she had her doubts about that claim. Her untouched cup of coffee, now lukewarm, reflected the weary gaze she wore like an accessory. As a private investigator in a city teeming with secrets, Evelyn knew the value of waiting—waiting was often more revealing than asking.

Evelyn Harper had seen more than her fair share of mysteries in her line of work. Her name was whispered in circles that piqued even the murkiest curiosities, known for her sharp intuition and an uncanny ability to coax truth out of the shadows. The city’s pulse lent itself to intrigue, and tonight was no different. She had received an anonymous tip, a crumpled envelope delivered through her mail slot with nothing but a time and place scrawled on the inside flap. As the clock inched closer to midnight, she watched the door with a calculating calm, waiting for her next case to walk through.
