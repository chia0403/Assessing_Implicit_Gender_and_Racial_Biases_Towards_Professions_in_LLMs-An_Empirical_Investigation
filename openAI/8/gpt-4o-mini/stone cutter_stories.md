In the quaint village of Eldermere, nestled between rolling hills and a meandering river, the air was thick with the scent of earth and stone. Gray clouds hung low in the sky, casting a muted light over the cobblestone streets and the sturdy stone cottages that had stood for generations. The villagers bustled about, preparing for the coming storm, their voices mingling with the distant sound of chisel striking rock from the nearby quarry.

At the edge of the village, where the path to the hills began to rise and twist into the thickets, stood a small workshop, partially concealed by ivy and moss. Here, amidst the shards of granite and the fine dust that coated every surface, worked one of Eldermere’s most skilled stone cutters, Gideon Thorne. 

Gideon, a man of moderate stature with calloused hands and eyes that shimmered like polished marble, poured his heart into every piece he crafted. He had watched the sun rise and fall over the quarry for nearly two decades, his dedication evident in the intricate carvings adorning tables, statues, and gravestones throughout the village. Each strike of his chisel told a story, shaping the stone into something greater than itself—a reflection of life, loss, and legacy.

As he paused to wipe the sweat from his brow, a gust of wind swept through the open doorway, carrying with it the scent of rain and the whisper of an approaching storm. Gideon turned his gaze toward the looming clouds, feeling an unsettling mix of anticipation and foreboding. Little did he know, that day would mark the beginning of a journey he never expected, one that would take him beyond the confines of stone and lead him into the heart of the stories hidden within the very mountains he had spent his life carving.
