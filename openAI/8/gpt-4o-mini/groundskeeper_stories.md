The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden hue over the sprawling grounds of Hawthorne Manor, an estate that had seen better days. Once a beacon of elegance, the manor now wore the scars of time like a weathered cloak, its ivy-covered walls whispering secrets of a past long forgotten. The gardens, once meticulously maintained, had surrendered to the wild embrace of nature, with vibrant wildflowers sprouting alongside the overgrown hedges.

Amidst this tapestry of decay and beauty worked Simon Benjamin Harlow, the estate’s steadfast groundskeeper. In his flannel shirt and worn leather boots, Simon was a solitary figure, a silent guardian of the land that held so many memories. He had spent his life tending to the grounds, his calloused hands nurturing the soil while his heart quietly yearned for something more than the familiar rhythm of raking leaves and trimming hedges. 

Each day, as he pulled weeds from the labyrinthine garden paths or pruned the ancient rose bushes that had once been the pride of the manor, Simon listened to the echoes of laughter and music that lingered in the air, remnants of the extravagant soirées that had taken place long ago. But it was not just the memories that haunted him; it was the secret he carried—the letter hidden in the pocket of his work apron, a fragile parchment that could change everything he knew about his connection to Hawthorne Manor and its enigmatic inhabitants.
