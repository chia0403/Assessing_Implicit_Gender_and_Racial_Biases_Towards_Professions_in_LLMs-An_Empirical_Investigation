**Title: Numbers in the Dark**

**Setting: Evergreen, a quaint town nestled between rolling hills, where the air is brisk with the scent of pine and the streets are lined with charming brick buildings from the early 1900s. The time is late April, with the scent of spring blooming around the town as residents prepare for the warmer months ahead. However, there’s a palpable tension this tax season, a buzz of uncertainty that seems to hang thick in the air.**

**Story Opening:**

As the clock struck nine, the front door of Holloway & Co. Tax Advisors swung open with a gentle chime, welcoming its clients into an atmosphere that mixed the crispness of freshly printed tax documents with the comforting aroma of brewed coffee. Inside, the fluorescent lights flickered to white-hot intensity, illuminating the rows of cubicles that buzzed with the sounds of calculators tapping and printers whirring. 

At the far end of the office, nestled between a towering stack of file boxes and the family portrait of her three golden retrievers, sat Eliza Mae Holloway, a seasoned income tax preparer. Eliza Mae was known not only for her meticulous attention to detail but also for her uncanny ability to navigate the labyrinthine tax code as if it were an old friend's map. With her rich auburn hair pulled into a practical bun and her round glasses perched on the tip of her nose, she scanned three years’ worth of spreadsheets on her dual monitors, her green eyes sparkling with determination.

As the last few days of tax season approached, Eliza Mae sensed something unusual lurking beyond the numbers. Despite her focus on discrete deductions and credits, whispers of financial discrepancies danced around the office, growing louder with each passing hour. Were there secrets hidden behind the seemingly innocuous forms filed by her longtime clients? 

Dismissing the uneasy feeling clinging to her like a shadow, Eliza Mae pushed her glasses up her nose, her fingers flying across the keyboard. She was engrossed in the world of finances, balancing countless budgets, until a mysterious envelope arrived, its edges frayed, and its sealed flap hinting at trouble. Little did she know, this would lead her down a path riddled with intrigue that went far beyond deductions and returns, testing not only her skills as a tax preparer but also her resolve as a citizen of Evergreen.
