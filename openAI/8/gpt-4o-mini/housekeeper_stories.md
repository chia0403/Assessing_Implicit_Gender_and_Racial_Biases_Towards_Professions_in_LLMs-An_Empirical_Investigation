In the quaint coastal town of Merrow’s Cove, the sun dipped low over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of gold and lavender. The salty tang of the sea air mingled with the scent of blooming jasmine that climbed the weathered stone wall of the Grand Ashford Manor, a once-lavish estate that now bore the weight of time and secrets. It was here, beneath the sprawling oaks that had witnessed generations of laughter and whispered intrigues, that Clara Bellefontaine prepared for another evening of solitude.

Clara, a diligent housekeeper in her mid-thirties, had been in service to the Ashford family for almost a decade. With her chestnut hair pinned back in meticulous curls and a simple yet elegant uniform that showcased her neatness, she was the embodiment of grace and reliability. As she dusted the grand foyer, she could hear the distant crash of the waves against the cliffs, their rhythm a soothing backdrop to her thoughts. 

Tonight, however, the air felt charged, as if the creeping shadows held whispers of untold stories. Clara had long since learned to tread lightly in the Old Ashford Manor—after all, it was not just the dusty corners and faded portraits that held memories; it was the very walls themselves. As she polished the ornate brass handrails, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was shifting in the house, a disturbance in the cycle of years spent in service to its fading grandeur. Little did she know, a storm was brewing, not just outside, but within the very heart of the home she had come to love and protect.
