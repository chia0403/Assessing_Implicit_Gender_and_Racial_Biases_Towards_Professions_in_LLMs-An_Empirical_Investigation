**Title: Shadows at the Bar**

The flickering neon sign outside McCarthy’s Pub buzzed softly as evening settled over the sleepy town of Ridgewood. Inside, the atmosphere was thick with the scent of hops and the low murmur of laughter and clinking glasses. The pub was a refuge for locals, a place where stories spun like the ceiling fan overhead.

Behind the polished oak bar stood Margaret Elise Harrington, known to everyone simply as “Maggie.” Her dark curls tumbled loosely around her shoulders, and the light from the amber bulbs above cast a warm glow on her sun-kissed skin. A deft hand poured a perfectly chilled lager, while her sharp green eyes scanned the room, always tuned to the unspoken currents that ran through conversations.

Tonight felt different. The air was charged, as if secrets simmered just beneath the surface of the jovial exchanges and cheerful toasts. Maggie wiped down the bar with a well-worn cloth, glancing at the door every few moments, as if awaiting someone—or something—that would tip the balance of a night already thick with possibilities.
