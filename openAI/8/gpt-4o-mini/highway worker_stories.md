**Title: The Midnight Road**

**Setting:** It was a crisp autumn evening in Maplewood County, where the roads wound like ribbons through a canvas of fiery red and golden leaves. The sun had long since dipped below the horizon, leaving a blanket of indigo sky scattered with stars. A solitary stretch of highway, known as Route 69, cut through the countryside, its cracked asphalt glimmering under the glow of flickering streetlights. The distant sound of crickets filled the air, mingling with the occasional rumble of a truck barreling down the road. Alongside the highway, a weathered pickup truck sat parked, its tailgate lowered, revealing a clutter of tools and road signs that marked the territory of its owner.

**Opening:** As the clock struck midnight, the hum of the world beyond the road quieted to a whisper, but for twenty-eight-year-old Miles Everett Thompson, the night was just beginning. He adjusted his hard hat and tugged at the reflective vest that seemed to glow against the moonlight. It had been a long week of repairing potholes and patching up the crumbling edges of the highway, yet something stirred in him that felt strangely alive beneath the routine. Miles stepped out of his truck and inhaled the sharp, crisp air, the scent of wet leaves mixing with gasoline and asphalt. 

He couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant to be here, in this remote stretch of darkness where the stars twinkled like secrets waiting to be uncovered. As he knelt to inspect a section of the road, the beam of his flashlight danced over the cracked surface, illuminating the small stones and bits of debris. But then something caught his eyeâ€”beneath the layers of grime, a shimmer of metal peeked through the dirt. Miles brushed the soil away, revealing the handle of a small, rusted object half-buried in the ground. Curiosity tinged with caution bubbled inside him; what could possibly be hidden here, in the solitude of the highway?
