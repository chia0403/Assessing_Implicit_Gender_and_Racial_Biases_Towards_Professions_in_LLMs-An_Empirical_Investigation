In the small, sun-drenched town of Maplewood, Texas, nestled between sprawling fields and the wide blue sky, there sat an unassuming auto garage at the edge of Main Street. Dust danced lazily in the warm afternoon breeze as it made its way through the open door of Miller's Auto Repair. Inside, the soft clinking of metal and the rhythmic hum of an engine coming back to life were music to the ears of anyone who appreciated the craft of machinery.

Standing beneath the hood of a classic '67 Mustang, with grease-stained hands and a focused brow, was Henry "Hank" Thompson. Known to most in Maplewood simply as "Hank," he was a man whose reputation for mechanical wizardry extended far beyond the town limits. At 42, Hank carried an air of rugged wisdom about him, his blue eyes reflecting an unwavering dedication to his work. His love affair with engines began in his grandfather's barn when he was just a boy, watching and learning how to transform lifeless heaps of metal into roaring beasts of the road.

The garage was Hank's sanctuary; its walls echoing tales of countless repairs and restorations. Posters of vintage cars and a calendar stuck in 1985, the year he opened shop, adorned the walls. Each creased page of the calendar seemed a relic of the past, reminding Hank of promises and dreams, both fulfilled and pending.

As the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the floor, Hank worked with a determined rhythm, his trusty sidekick, Charlie the tabby cat, lazily observing from atop a tool chest. With a gentle pat on the carburetor and a final twist of the wrench, Hank stepped back, admiring the restored vehicle, which now seemed as eager to hit the open road as its owner.

Just as Hank was wiping his hands on a rag, the familiar jingle of the bell above the garage door signaled the arrival of his next customerâ€”an arrival that would soon intertwine with the peculiar events about to unfold in Maplewood.
