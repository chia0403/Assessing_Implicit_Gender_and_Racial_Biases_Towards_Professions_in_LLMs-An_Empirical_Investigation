Beneath the vast canopy of an unbroken, cobalt sky, Captain Evelyn Morgan guided her sleek twin-engine jet, the Aurora, through the endless expanse above the Pacific Ocean. The rhythmic hum of the engines was a symphony of mechanical purrs and whispers, harmonizing with the steady thrum of her heart. She had always cherished this view from the cockpit, with nothing but open sky and boundless horizon as far as her eyes could trace.

Evelyn was on course for Honolulu, having departed from San Francisco in the early hours of the morning. The world below appeared as a patchwork quilt of churning waves and sun-speckled clouds, a testament to the earth’s perpetual dance beneath the heavens. Although the sea was rife with untold secrets and stories of its own, here in the air, Evelyn felt an unmatched sense of freedom and control.

As sunlight streamed through the cabin windows, casting warm golden reflections on her instruments, Evelyn adjusted her sunglasses and reached for her thermos, savoring the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. A glance at her wristwatch confirmed that she was right on schedule, a comforting reassurance that played as smooth and familiar as an old jazz tune.

The Aurora was both her companion and refuge, a vessel that gave her the wings she had always dreamed of from a young age. Evelyn often thought back to those early days in the small town of Asheville, North Carolina, where her fascination with flight had been sparked by a poster of Amelia Earhart pinned above her bed. Now, countless flight hours later, she lived that dream each time she soared high above the earth.

Yet, despite the routine calm of the morning’s flight, an unfamiliar signal on her radar screen began to pulse ominously. Evelyn's trained eyes narrowed, her focus homing in on the unexpected blip. Beneath her calm exterior, a ripple of anticipation stirred. She knew the skies held their fair share of mysteries—and she was about to encounter one.
