In the heart of downtown Seattle, where the glass spires of skyscrapers pierced the overcast sky, the unassuming office of Evergreen Insurance sat on the third floor of the historic Hamilton Building. The structure, with its red-bricked façade and intricate ironwork, offered a nostalgic counterpoint to the looming modernity around it. It was here, amidst the echoes of typewriters that no longer existed and the residual scent of aged wood, that Leonard "Lenny" Morrison built a career from the innate gift of reassuring those gripped by life's uncertainties.

Lenny Morrison might not have stood out in a crowd—his dusty, heather gray suit blending with the city's perpetual drizzle—but he possessed a rare ability to listen deeply to clients' anxious stories. He moved through his day with a calm pragmatism, a kind-hearted man in his mid-thirties who understood that behind every policy number, there lay a family, a dream, a future.

As the autumn afternoon began to dim, casting long shadows through the room's tall windows, Lenny sat at his cluttered desk. Paperwork towered like mini skyscrapers beside him, yet his focus was unwavering. He liked to think that around every corner lay an unexpected adventure, though today that feeling pressed a little closer to his chest, bolder than usual. Little did he know, a message waiting in his inbox would challenge everything he thought he knew about risk, safety, and his own role in the world.
