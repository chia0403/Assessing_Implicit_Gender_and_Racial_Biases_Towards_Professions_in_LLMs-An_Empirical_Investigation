The gentle hum of the awakening suburb served as her morning symphony, with birds composing a melody only nature could orchestrate. The streets, lined with ancient oak trees, exhaled the tranquility of the night before yielding to the busier rhythm of the day. Known for its red-brick facades and carefully manicured lawns, Millwood was the kind of place where the past and present danced seamlessly.
