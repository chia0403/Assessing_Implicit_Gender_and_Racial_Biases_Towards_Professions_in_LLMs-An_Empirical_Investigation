In the heart of Lower Manhattan, amidst the towering silhouettes of glass and steel, the sun fought its way through the canopy of skyscrapers, casting angular patterns on the bustling streets below. It was here, in this maze of commerce and ambition, that financiers, traders, and dreamers alike converged daily, drawn to the exhilarating pulse of Wall Street.

Amidst this crowd, Duncan Everett stood out not for flamboyance or ostentation, but rather for the quiet intensity he carried. At just over six feet, with a lean build honed from years of pre-dawn runs along the Hudson, he projected a calm confidence. His tailored navy suit, a staple in his wardrobe, was complemented by a deep burgundy tie that hinted at a flair he often chose to keep subdued. 

Duncan had carved out his niche in the world of finance through sharp intuition and unwavering dedication. As he strode through the glass doors of Hamilton & Curtis Brokerage Firm, the familiar hum of ringing telephones and the rapid-fire exchanges of brokers enveloped him like an old song. Here, time was marked not by the steady alternation of day and night, but by the relentless tick of market hours, each minute a potential triumph or disaster.

The trading floor was awash with vibrant energy, punctuated by the clattering keyboards and voices that ranged from hushed urgency to exuberant shouts of success. Screens filled with flashing algorithms and stock tickers hinted at the countless stories of joy and ruin playing out across the globe.

Duncan's corner was less frenetic, yet no less engaged. As he settled into his desk, the digital dashboards before him lit up, reflecting a rainbow of market trends and financial statistics. Each flicker on his screen was a puzzle piece, each chart a narrative waiting to be unraveled. Here, surrounded by the artifacts of modern commerce, Duncan Everett prepared to navigate another day in the only world he had ever known, where fortunes were won and lost with the rise and fall of the stock ticker.
