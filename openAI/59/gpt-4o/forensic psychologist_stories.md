On the outskirts of the bustling city of Seattle, nestled against the encroaching wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, stands Ravenwood Institute—a sprawling, ivy-clad building that once served as an exclusive boarding school. Now, it's home to the region's most illustrious forensic psychology center, a place where the shadows of the past meet the intricacies of the human mind. 

Dr. Eleanor Finch, renowned forensic psychologist, stepped out of her aging sedan, her heels clicking on the cobblestone pathway that led to the institute's grand entrance. The morning mist clung to her tailored coat, blending with the soft drizzle that seemed perpetual in this part of the world. Her presence was both methodical and reassuring, a steady force in the midst of Ravenwood's imposing architecture.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aged pages and polished wood, a testimony to the institute's storied history. Eleanor, with her sharp, perceptive eyes and a mind as intricate as the puzzles she unraveled, had arrived to lend her expertise to a case that promised to unlock secrets buried deeper than the forest's roots. As she entered the dimly lit corridors, a new chapter awaited—not just in the annals of criminal justice, but in her own meticulously structured life.
