In the heart of Colby County, where the air carried the scent of pine and distant rain, the sun yawned over a horizon flecked with gold and crimson. The sleepy town of Everwood stirred to life, with breakfast aromas wafting through open windows and the chatter of birds echoing down quiet, winding streets. Nestled between the gentle roll of Misty Hills and the vast embrace of Hollow Lake, Everwood seemed to exist in a world untouched by time. Here, rustic charm met tranquil wilderness, and the spirit of a tightly-knit community thrived amid its quaint cafes and bustling farmers’ market.

Amidst this early morning symphony, Clare Donovan slipped out of the small clapboard house she called home. A warm breeze ruffled her chestnut hair as she adjusted her messenger bag, making sure her nurse's badge gleamed prominently—“Clare Donovan, RN” proudly displayed in embossed letters. Clare was more than just a nurse; in Everwood, she was a beacon of comfort and strength, tending to the community’s needs with an unwavering dedication that had become woven into the very fabric of the town. Her presence was like that of the dawn itself, bringing light and hope to those she encountered.

As she strolled down Maple Lane, past wide-eyed shopkeepers setting out their wares and children darting off to school, Clare felt the familiar sensation of anticipation warming her heart. The world was waking up, and with it, a new day of stories and encounters awaited her in the worn hallways of Everwood General Hospital, where every patient was a neighbor, and every challenge was met with compassion and care.
