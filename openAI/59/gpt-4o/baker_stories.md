On the edge of the quaint village of Harrowfield, where cobblestone streets meander through rows of timber-framed cottages, Eliza Windham unlocked the doors to "Windham's Bakehouse" just as the first light of dawn kissed the rooftops with a golden hue. The scent of fresh rain clung to the air, mingling with the earthy fragrance of flour and yeast, as she flicked on the warm, inviting glow of the bakery’s interior lights.

Eliza, a woman with flour-dusted auburn hair perpetually tied into a hurried bun, had inherited the little bakehouse from her grandmother. She cherished its old-fashioned charm — the kind that drew townsfolk like bees to honey — with its leaded glass windows and the blue wooden sign that swung gently above the door. Inside, the shop exuded a rustic warmth, with rustic wooden shelves lined with ceramic jars and an oak counter that bore the patina of years of service.

As she set about her morning routine, kneading dough with practiced rhythm, the village slowly stirred to life. The morning mist that clung to the hills began to dissipate, revealing a tapestry of verdant pastures dotted with sleepy sheep. Eliza paused, her hands coated in flour, and glanced through the window. This was the moment she loved most — the quiet promise of a new day, the anticipation of the oven's comforting heat, and the knowledge that soon the bakery would be filled with the soft chatter of neighbors gathering for their morning loaves and pastries.
