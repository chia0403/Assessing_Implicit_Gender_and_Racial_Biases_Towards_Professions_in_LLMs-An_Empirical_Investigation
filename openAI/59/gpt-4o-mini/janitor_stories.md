Title: **The Whispering Halls**

Setting: The story takes place in Millwood High School, a sprawling brick building with ivy trellises climbing its walls. The bright classrooms are filled with an array of colorful posters and projects proudly displayed by students. However, as the sun sets and classes come to an end, the hallways transform into a maze of shadows and echoes, where the memories of laughter linger and the air feels thick with unspoken secrets. The flickering fluorescent lights hum softly, casting an eerie glow over the rows of empty desks and lockers.

Opening: As the last bell rang, signaling the end of another day, **Walter Benjamin Grayson** rolled his cart of cleaning supplies down the polished linoleum floor of Millwood High. Clad in a faded blue jumpsuit, he paused momentarily, glancing at the once-vibrant art display that now faded into the backdrop of daily school life. He had worked at Millwood for nearly a decade, finding solace among the remnants of students’ creativity. Every day, as he scrubbed away the traces of chalk dust and spilled juice, he felt the pulse of life in this place—though until this moment, he'd never sensed the weight of its secrets.

Walter wiped the sweat from his brow with a stained rag, his gray hair catching the last light of day filtering through the tall windows. A familiar sound echoed from the far end of the hallway—a soft thud followed by a low mumble. Unfazed, he continued toward the science lab, but something in the atmosphere felt different tonight, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath, just waiting for him to uncover what lay hidden in the space between empty chairs and quiet corridors.
