Title: **Under the Orange Cones**

**Setting:** 

The summer sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the vast expanse of Highway 47, a stretch of asphalt that wound its way through the sleepy town of Cedar Hollow. Dust from the gravel shoulders danced in the warm air as the hum of distant traffic faded into the background. Orange cones lined the edges of the road, an inescapable reminder of the ongoing construction project that had turned this once-bustling route into a maze of detours and caution signs. The scent of hot asphalt mixed with pine from the nearby woods, a smell that had become as familiar to the locals as the sound of chirping crickets that filled the evening air.

**Opening:**

As the last rays of sunlight painted the sky in shades of lavender and crimson, **Marcus Jameson**, a seasoned highway worker in his late thirties, wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand. He leaned against the side of his truck, its faded blue paint chipped and peeling, a testament to the countless hours spent under the glaring sun. With a scruffy beard, sun-kissed skin, and a yellow hard hat slightly askew atop his head, Marcus looked every bit the part of a man who had dedicated his life to the labor of the open road.

Despite the monotonous nature of his job, Marcus found solace in the rhythm of the work—the roar of machinery, the chatter of his coworkers, the way the sunset illuminated the asphalt like some kind of magic. But tonight, something felt different. The air was thick with an unspoken tension, a sense that the evening held more than just the promise of another day’s end. He glanced down the long stretch of highway, where his eyes caught a flicker of movement—an unfamiliar figure standing just beyond the barricades, shrouded in shadow. Marcus felt an inexplicable urge to investigate. 

With a quick nod to his foreman, he grabbed a flashlight and started towards the silhouette, the crunch of gravel beneath his steel-toed boots echoing the questions swirling in his mind. Who were they, and what secrets did the highway hold tonight?
