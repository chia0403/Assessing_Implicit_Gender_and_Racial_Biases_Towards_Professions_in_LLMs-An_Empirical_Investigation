The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Eldridge, a prosperous but uneasy city nestled between the rolling hills and dense forests. The air was thick with the scent of autumn leaves and the distant sound of laughter wafted from the town square, where merchants peddled their wares beneath brightly colored awnings. But beneath the festive facade lay a tension that had started to seep into the very fabric of the city.

Standing at the main gate of the castle, forged from dark iron and adorned with intricate carvings, was Garrick Thorne, the steadfast guard of Eldridge. His figure was imposing, clad in a suit of armor that gleamed dully even in the fading light, a weathered face marked by years of service and shadowed by a helm that obscured much of his features. Garrick had always favored the quiet duty of watching the gate—an unassuming role that allowed him to observe the comings and goings of the realm, each traveler with their own story, yet all were of equal importance in his eyes.

As he glanced down the road leading into the city, an unexpected chill ran down his spine, stirring the unease that had settled over the town. A figure clad in a tattered cloak approached, their face obscured by the shadows. The cloak flared dramatically in the wind, and Garrick’s hand instinctively moved to the hilt of his sword. He had grown accustomed to the signs of danger, having faced more threats than he'd like to remember in his long service. Tonight, though, felt different, as if the very air quivered with a foreboding promise of change.
