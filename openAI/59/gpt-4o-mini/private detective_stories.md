Title: Shadows of the Forgotten

Opening:

The rain fell in a steady rhythm, turning the cobblestones of East Larkwood into a glistening tapestry of reflections. Streetlights flickered like forgotten memories, casting a dim glow on the empty alleyways that wove through the old brick buildings. It was the kind of night that held secretsâ€”cloaked in mist and murmurings that skittered between the cracks of reality. 

Amidst the symphony of raindrops and the distant chatter of a city that never truly slept, a solitary figure shrouded in a long, dark trench coat stood outside a nondescript office building. The name etched in peeling gold letters above the door read "Harper & Co. Investigations." Clutching a battered fedora in one hand and a half-lit cigarette in the other, *Cordelia Anne Harper* gazed out into the gloom with a mixture of resolve and weariness. 

The city whispered tales of betrayal and heartache, and Cordelia knew all too well that behind every closed door lay riddles waiting to be unraveled. With a heavy sigh, she flicked the cigarette into the rain and stepped inside her office, the scent of damp paper and old coffee wrapping around her like an old friend. A single desk lamp flickered to life as she settled into her chair, casting shadows that danced across the walls, heralding the start of another night filled with questions demanding answers.
