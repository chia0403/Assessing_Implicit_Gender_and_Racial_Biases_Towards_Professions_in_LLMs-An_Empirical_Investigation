The sun hung low in the sky, casting golden rays across the small town of Maplewood, where the air was filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and the distant sound of laughter from the children playing in the park. Above the bustling streets, the rooftops of charming bungalows and clapboard houses created a patchwork quilt against the backdrop of an azure sky. 

On the edge of town, a humble house with weathered shingles stood like a sentinel, its once-vibrant color now faded by years of storms and sun. Perched atop this house was Connor James Albright, a seasoned roofer with calloused hands and a sun-kissed face marked by hard work. He slid his tool belt into place, the familiar weight a comforting reminder of his craft. 

At thirty-five, Connor was a local legend in Maplewood, known not just for his skill but for the stories he spun as he worked—tales of old roofs and forgotten memories, tales that filled the air with laughter. Below him, the town hummed with life, but up here, on this sloped surface of asphalt and shingle, he found a kind of peace. The world was a canvas above the chaos, and there he felt most free. 

But today was different. A storm was brewing in the distance, and as thunder rumbled like a warning from the heavens, Connor couldn’t shake the feeling that this day would hold more than just the usual repairs. The winds whispered secrets, and he had a sense—a premonition—that he might soon be called to face a challenge far greater than any roof he had ever repaired.
