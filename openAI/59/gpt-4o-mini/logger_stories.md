In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where the air was thick with the scent of pine and the chorus of chirping crickets filled the twilight, a rugged logging camp nestled amongst towering conifers. Cedar and fir trees stretched into the sky like ancient sentinels, their branches whispering tales of the wilderness to those who dared to listen. 

It was here, in this untamed expanse, that Caleb Nathaniel McCaffrey honed his craft. With broad shoulders and hands hardened by years of labor, he moved with the practiced ease of a man who respected the forest, yet understood the weight of his responsibilities. The low hum of chainsaws and the rhythmic thud of falling trees surrounded him, a melody of industry that echoed through the canyons and valleys.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a crimson hue across the sky, Caleb stood atop a knoll, surveying the land. Despite the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the trees—wild animals, shifting weather, and the looming threat of injury—he felt a deep connection to this place. He had spent a lifetime learning its secrets, navigating its challenges, and always respecting its power.

But that evening, as a cool breeze rustled the branches overhead, something felt different. A sense of unease crept over him, like an approaching storm. Up ahead, the fluorescent lights of the camp flickered against the encroaching darkness, punctuating the stillness with an unsettling glow. Little did Caleb know, the following day would change the course of his life forever, revealing hidden dangers far beyond the forest floor.
