Title: "The Long Haul"

In the heart of a sleepy little town called Ridgewood, nestled between the towering cliffs and the winding rivers of the Pacific Northwest, the air was thick with the scent of pine and the promise of rain. It was early dawn, and as the sun began to lace the horizon with shades of orange and pink, the stillness of the morning was interrupted by the rumble of an engine starting. 

At the outskirts of town, a weathered blue Peterbilt truck sat idling in front of a modest diner, its chrome glinting in the light, an iron giant ready for the road. Behind the wheel, Matthew "Matt" Dawson, a burly man in his late thirties with a thick beard and kind blue eyes, took a moment to collect his thoughts. He had spent countless nights behind the wheel, lost in the rhythm of the asphalt, the radio crackling old country tunes that echoed through the cab like distant memories. But today felt different. 

As Matt adjusted his worn cap and pulled on a faded leather jacket, he glanced at the small photograph pinned to the dashboard—a snapshot of his daughter, Lily, grinning with her missing front tooth. She was waiting for him back home, counting down the days until his return. With a determined nod, he shifted the truck into gear, ready to tackle the miles ahead. 

Today’s run would lead him through winding mountain passes, deep forests cloaked in mist, and sprawling valleys where the world opened up like an endless canvas. As he pulled out onto Route 24, chuckling to himself as the familiar rhythms of the road began to play, he had no idea that this trip would take a sharp turn, veering into the heart of a mystery that awaited just beyond the horizon. For Matt Dawson, the road was always more than just a job; it was a journey, a life full of stories waiting to unfold.
