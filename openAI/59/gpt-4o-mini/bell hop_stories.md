The sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the bustling streets of downtown New Orleans. The air was thick with the rich scent of gumbo and the soft strains of jazz floated through the atmosphere, offering a tantalizing preview of the evening’s festivities. It was a place where history breathed through the crumbling brick facades and where every corner told a story.

Inside the opulent Maison du Cerf hotel, chandeliers sparkled like stars, illuminating the polished marble floors and the vast lobby, which bustled with guests arriving and departing, laughter mixing with the distant sound of a piano. Among the elegantly dressed patrons, a young man moved with practiced grace. 

His name was Oliver James Hawthorne, and he had recently traded a mundane life in a small town for the vibrant chaos of this iconic hotel. Clad in a crisp navy uniform adorned with brass buttons, Oliver was a bellhop, but he held aspirations far bigger than simply carrying luggage. With a keen eye for detail and a knack for knowing the guests' needs before they voiced them, he quickly became known for his charming demeanor and unwavering commitment to service.

Tonight, however, held a shimmer of mystery. A particularly intriguing guest had checked in earlier that day—a renowned author rumored to be working on a novel steeped in the city’s legendary tales. As Oliver adjusted his cap and prepared to make another round delivering suitcases and answering calls, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this evening would weave a new chapter into his own story. Little did he know, the night ahead would be unlike any he had encountered, filled with secrets and whispers that echoed the haunting ballads of the city itself.
