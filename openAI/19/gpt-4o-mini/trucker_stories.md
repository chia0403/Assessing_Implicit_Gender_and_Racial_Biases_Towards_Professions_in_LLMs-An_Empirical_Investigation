**Title: Miles to Freedom**

**Setting:**
The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden hue over the sprawling highways of the Midwest. The air was crisp, with the faint scent of pine wafting in from the dense forests that lined the roads. A chill was beginning to creep in as night approached, and the vast expanse of the sky was turning a deep navy. A lone trucker, with miles of asphalt stretching before him, prepared for the long haul ahead. The rhythmic rumble of his eighteen-wheeler echoed through the stillness of the evening, accompanied only by the distant howl of the wind.

**Opening:**
As the headlights pierced the twilight, **Cody Jeremiah Hale** adjusted his grip on the steering wheel, an old leather glove clinging to his calloused hands. The cabin of his truck, a well-worn Freightliner, was a refuge filled with the aromas of coffee and the faint trail of stale cigarette smoke. A tattered map sprawled across the passenger seat, crisscrossed with inked routes and scribbled notes from past journeys.

Cody's mind wandered as he navigated the open road, the miles blurring in a familiar trance. He had been driving for over fifteen years, each turn of the wheel a brushstroke in the canvas of his life—a life spent chasing the horizon, escaping the ghosts of his past. Tonight, he was bound for Denver, delivering a load of automotive parts, but his thoughts were tangled in the intricate tapestries of memories that the road had woven around him. 

He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. Midnight lay just a few hours ahead, a silent promise that first seemed like an endless stretch of blacktop, but now felt like an invitation to freedom. The hum of the truck's engine was a constant companion, and as he shifted into the next gear, he couldn't help but feel that each mile was a step toward something greater than just a paycheck—perhaps a second chance, or maybe just a peace he had yet to find.
