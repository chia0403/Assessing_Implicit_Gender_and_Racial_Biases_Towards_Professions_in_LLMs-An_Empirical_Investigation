In the heart of Eldridge, a weathered town wrapped in the embrace of thick, sprawling forests, stood Anton Mercer’s butcher shop, “Mercer’s Meats.” The shop continued to stand steadfastly in a cobblestone square that had witnessed the ebb and flow of time. Its weather-beaten wooden sign swung lazily in the soft breeze, creaking gently as if it held secrets of the past within its grooves. The air was rich with the scent of fresh cuts, spices, and the occasional whiff of smoke from the old brick smoker behind the shop, where Anton showcased his talent for curing meats.

Inside, the establishment was a curious blend of rustic charm and bustling efficiency. Old photographs of Anton’s father and grandfather adorned the walls, each freeze-frame a glimpse into the legacy of their craft. A sturdy wooden counter, polished by years of service, stretched across the back, behind which Anton, a broad-shouldered man in his late thirties with salt-and-pepper hair and a thick, checkered apron, maneuvered skillfully between his knives and saws, every movement exuding confidence and precision.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the square, Anton took a moment to wipe his brow. He looked out through the shop’s glass display case, feeling the buzz of life in Eldridge. Customers came and went, exchanging pleasantries and stories as they filled their bags with cuts for the evening meal. Yet behind his warm smile lay an unease—a growing suspicion that something eerie lurked in the hollows of the woods, whispering secrets that only Anton seemed to notice as twilight approached.
