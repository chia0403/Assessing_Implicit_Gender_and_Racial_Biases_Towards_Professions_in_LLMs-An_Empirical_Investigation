In the quiet town of Cedarhaven, nestled between towering evergreens and the rugged foothills of the Cascade Mountains, the air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. It was early morning, and a veil of mist hung low over the dense forest, wrapping the trees in a shroud of mystery. The silence was only occasionally interrupted by the distant sound of a chainsaw, a familiar symphony to those who made their living in the woods.

Ethan Callahan, a seasoned logger with hands calloused from years of labor, stood at the edge of the clearing, his rugged silhouette framed by the towering trees. At thirty-five, he embodied the spirit of the forest—grounded, resilient, and ruggedly handsome, with a smattering of chestnut beard and deep-set green eyes that mirrored the wilderness he loved so dearly. His flannel shirt, faded from countless days spent under the sun, clung to his muscular frame as he surveyed the land ahead of him. Today would mark the start of a new project, one that required precision and respect for the delicate ecosystem surrounding him.

The morning sun began to break through the fog, casting warm rays upon the muted greens and browns of the forest. Ethan inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the invigorating scent of damp moss and fresh wood. This was more than just a job to him; it was a way of life, a connection to the land that had shaped his youth and would continue to shape his future. He felt a kinship with the trees, both standing tall and steadfast, yet constantly changing and adapting to the world around them.

But today, there was an unshakable tension in the air, one that stirred Ethan’s instincts. As he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, revealing the intricate tattoo of a pine tree that spiraled down his forearm, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this logging expedition would be unlike any he had experienced before. Little did he know, the forest held secrets that were waiting to unfold in the days ahead, challenging everything he thought he knew about the land he called home.
