In the heart of Eldoria, where the sprawling green valleys kissed the horizon and ancient oaks whispered secrets to those who dared to listen, stood the formidable Stonewatch Keep. Its granite walls loomed above the surrounding landscape like a sentinel, eternal and steadfast. The sun dipped low in the sky, casting a golden hue across the battlements and the surrounding forest, while shadows crept along the cobblestone path leading to the heavy oak gates.

Atop the ramparts, a lone figure stood, his silhouette etched against the vibrant sunset. This was Morgan Alaric, a guard sworn to protect the kingdom from unseen threats. Clad in weathered leather armor that bore the marks of countless battles, he was a man of considerable stature, with wind-tousled dark hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to reflect the very essence of the kingdom he defended.

Morgan had spent years patrolling the grim corridors and echoing halls of Stonewatch Keep, and the responsibilities of his duty weighed heavily on his broad shoulders. He was no stranger to the tales of monsters lurking in the shadows or whispers of betrayal from within. Tonight, however, as he surveyed the mist-laden forest, a prickle of unease settled within him, hinting that this night might be unlike any other he had encountered.
