In the small coastal town of Crescent Bay, where the salty breeze mingled with the scent of wildflowers, the sun dipped low over the horizon, casting a warm golden hue across the quaint houses lining the shore. Seagulls cried out overhead, their silhouettes dancing against the vibrant sky as evening settled in, promising a peaceful end to another day.

Inside the Crescent Bay Medical Center, the atmosphere was a mix of exhaustion and camaraderie. The sounds of distant chatter and the beeping of machines filled the air, but one voice stood out above the rest—steady and reassuring, like a lighthouse guiding lost vessels home. It belonged to Angela Marie Thompson, a dedicated registered nurse whose warm smile made patients feel not just cared for, but truly seen. 

With dark hair pulled back into a neat bun, and the faint hint of lavender from her nurse’s scrubs, Angela moved through the bustling halls with purpose. Her silver name badge, etched with her name and title, glinted under the fluorescent lights. In a town where gossip traveled faster than the tide, Angela was a beloved figure, known for her unwavering compassion and fierce determination. 

Tonight, as the clock inched closer to midnight, Angela prepared for her evening shift, completely unaware that this night would unravel a sequence of events that would change her life's course forever. As she filled a syringe in the dimly lit medication room, the air crackled with tension, a storm brewing just beneath the surface of the calm facade. Little did she know, the echoes of her past and the shadows of the night would soon converge, forcing her to confront not only the challenges of her profession but also the embers of a buried secret.
