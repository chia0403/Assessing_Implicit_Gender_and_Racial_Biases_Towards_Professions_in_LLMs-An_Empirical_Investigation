In the heart of Riverton, a small town nestled between rolling hills and thickwooded forests, the air was crisp with the promise of autumn. The streets were lined with quaint homes painted in shades of cream and sage, their picket fences adorned with leaves turning vibrant shades of amber and crimson. Every evening, the townsfolk gathered at Marlene’s Diner, sharing stories over steaming mugs of coffee and homemade pie.

In a cluttered garage at the end of Maple Lane, surrounded by the scent of polished metal and fresh paint, thirty-five-year-old Alexander “Alec” Patterson was busy organizing his tools. With a shock of unruly chestnut hair and a pair of spectacles perched on his nose, Alec was the type of man who had a knack for fixing things—both in the world and in his own life. A common sight in Riverton, he wore the blue overalls of his trade proudly, the fabric stained with blueprints of grease and triumph.

As he tightened the last bolt on a vintage faucet he had been restoring, the faint sound of water murmured from the kitchen sink. Alec wiped his brow and made his way inside, cradling a heavy toolbox. He paused for a moment, gazing out the window at the golden sunset that bathed the town in a warm glow, a sense of peace washing over him. Little did he know that as the sun dipped below the horizon, a call would come in that would challenge not only his plumbing skills but the very fabric of the community he loved.
