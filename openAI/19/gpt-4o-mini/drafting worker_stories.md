In the heart of Steelhaven, a city where the clang of metal echoed through the air and the river flowed with the remnants of industry, stood a weather-beaten drafting studio nestled among towering warehouses and bustling streets. It was a modest space, graced only by the flickering light of a single overhead bulb and the clutter of blueprints strewn across wooden tables. The smell of graphite and fresh ink combined with the earthy scent of the rain-soaked concrete outside, creating a familiar ambiance that felt like home to those immersed in their craft.

At the center of this chaotic sanctuary was a young man named Samuel Richard Hayes. With tousled dark hair and ink-stained fingertips, Samuel spent his days sketching intricate designs for the bridges and buildings that would soon reshape the skyline of Steelhaven. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow on the horizon, Samuel hunched over his drafting board, lost in the rhythm of his pencil gliding across laminated sheets of graph paper.

Yet, beneath the surface of his concentrated work, a storm brewed. Steelhaven was on the brink of a transformation that would forever change its landscape—and Samuel, with his dreams of becoming a renowned architect, could feel the exciting pulse of innovation mixed with an undercurrent of turmoil among the workers and townsfolk alike. Little did he know, his latest project would not only test his skills but also awaken a landscape of secrets lying just beneath the city’s industrial heart.
