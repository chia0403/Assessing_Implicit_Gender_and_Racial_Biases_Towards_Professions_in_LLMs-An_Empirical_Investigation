In the sleepy town of Maplewood, the early morning mist curled lazily around the old oak trees that lined the cobblestone streets. The faint sound of a distant church bell chimed, announcing the start of another day at Maplewood High School. Inside, the halls were filled with the echoes of lockers slamming, muted laughter, and the shuffle of sneakers on polished linoleum floors. 

At the end of the corridor, situated between the bustling cafeteria and the serene library, was a modest office adorned with colorful posters promoting positivity and mental health awareness. A soft glow illuminated the room from an antique desk lamp, casting a warm light over the collection of books and papers scattered across the desk. 

The door swung open, and a woman in her mid-thirties stepped inside, shaking off the remnants of the chilly morning. This was Eleanor Grace Peterson, the school's guidance counselor. With chestnut-brown hair pulled into a loose bun and wearing her trademark cardigan paired with bright sneakers, Eleanor exuded a blend of warmth and approachability. Her blue eyes sparkled with empathy, hinting at the countless stories and struggles she had listened to over the years. 

As she settled into her well-worn chair, a gentle smile crossed her face. Today was the first day of the school semester, and though she was acutely aware of the challenges that lay ahead, she felt excitedâ€”a fresh start meant fresh opportunities for her students. Little did she know, a heart-wrenching dilemma was about to knock on her door, one that would test her resolve as a counselor in ways she had never anticipated.
