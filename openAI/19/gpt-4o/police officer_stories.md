The rain fell in relentless sheets, a steady drumming against the rooftops and abandoned cars that lined the streets of Ashford Heights. The small town, usually teeming with life, was now cloaked in a somber gray, a consequence of the approaching storm that seemed intent on washing away everything in its path. Streetlights flickered uncertainly, casting a dim, wavering glow on the glistening pavement below.

Officer Jameson Clark stepped out of his squad car, pulling the collar of his heavy coat up against the chilled wind that blew in from the east. Despite the dreariness of the evening, there was a certain tranquility in the ongoing deluge—a temporary lull in the usual chaos that marked his days on the force.

Jameson had walked these streets for over a decade, from his early days as a fresh-eyed rookie to now, where each step seemed etched with the weight of countless cases. Ashford Heights was as much a part of him as the worn badge he wore proudly on his chest.

The call that had drawn him here was unexpected—an anonymous tip about something suspicious behind the old, defunct railway station that had stood untouched for years. Most had forgotten about it, overshadowed by the town's modest attempts at modernization. Yet, for reasons he couldn't quite articulate, Jameson felt a pull, a quiet urgency urging him to investigate.

As he made his way down the narrow alley leading to the station, his flashlight cutting through the dark like a beacon, Jameson was keenly aware of the heavy silence that lingered beneath the rain's whisper. It was a silence that hinted at secrets—the kind that towns like Ashford Heights were adept at hiding.

With each step, a question loomed larger within him: what, or who, would he find waiting at the end of the line?
