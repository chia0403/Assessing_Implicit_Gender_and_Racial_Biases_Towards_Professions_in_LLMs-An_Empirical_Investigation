Title: **Rolling Horizons**

In the quiet predawn of a Tennessee morning, the world felt as though it were holding its breath. Dew clung to the tall grasses lining the highway, glistening like a sea of tiny diamonds under the sparse lights of the rest stop. The sky was a deep, endless blue, just beginning to be streaked by the first hints of dawn.

Jackson "Jax" Wheeler kicked at the gravel with worn boots, the only sound penetrating the stillness apart from the rumble of distant engines. He was a man married to the open road, where each mile-marker was like an old friend and each rumbling engine a reminder of life’s ceaseless journey. At 35, Jax had grown accustomed to the solitude the job entailed, finding comfort in the steady rhythm of the wheels beneath him and the endless tapestry of landscapes unfurling from the east to the west.

The air was crisp, laden with the scent of pine and the faint promise of adventure. His truck—a hulking behemoth he affectionately called "Big Red"—stood nearby, its chrome glinting under the service station's fluorescent lights. To Jax, Big Red was more than just a vehicle. It was his livelihood, his companion, and, sometimes, his sanctuary.

This morning, as he sipped his lukewarm coffee and watched the sky lighten, there was a stirring in his chest. Today was not just another day on the road. Today marked the beginning of a route that whispered of new adventures and unseen horizons—promising stories yet to live and roads yet to travel. Jax felt the call of the open road more keenly than ever, each mile a note in a song of freedom that only those who lived by the wheel would ever truly understand.

Sliding into the driver’s seat, he tweaked the rear-view mirror and tugged the brim of his well-worn cap down low. There was a quiet resolve in his eyes, a determination carved out of countless nights spent chasing the horizon. He took a deep breath, turned the ignition, and with that familiar roar, Big Red leapt to life.

As he pulled onto the highway, leaving the safety of the rest stop behind, the world opened up before him. Jax Wheeler settled into the comfort of the long drive ahead, ready for whatever stories the road had to offer.
