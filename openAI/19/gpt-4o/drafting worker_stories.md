On the outskirts of the bustling city of New Haven, where the cacophony of hurried footsteps and honking cars gives way to the gentle hum of crickets and the distant rustle of leaves, lies a quaint little neighborhood known as Maple Grove. It is here, amidst rows of neatly kept lawns and towering oak trees, where Andrew Carter lives and works. His modest, single-story house sits comfortably at the end of Willow Lane, with a small wooden sign by the entrance that reads, "Carter Drafting Services."

The morning sun pours through the windows of Andrew's home office, casting long shadows across the meticulously organized drafting table. There, each pencil is arranged by hue and hue by preference, alongside rulers and tools so perfectly aligned it seems a whisper could disrupt their order. The walls are adorned with blueprints and sketches, a testament to years of dedication and an eye for precision.

Andrew Carter, with his sleeves rolled up and a steaming mug of coffee within reach, surveys a new project splayed out before him. His wiry frame leans forward, eyes narrowing in concentration as he studies the details of an architectural plan. The quiet of the room is broken only by the rhythmic scratching of pencil on paper, a sound he finds both soothing and invigorating.

Outside, the day begins with familiar scenes: neighbors exchanging greetings over fences, children slinging backpacks over their shoulders as they hurry to catch the school bus, and the postman making his rounds. But within the walls of Andrew's workspace, a world takes shape in graphite and ink, one where lines turn into structures, and visions become reality.
