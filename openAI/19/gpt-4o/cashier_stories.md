In the dim glow of early morning, the small coastal town of Larkspur was shaking off the last tendrils of night, its wooden docks ringing softly with the sound of clinking ropes and the first calls of seagulls. This town, wrapped snugly against the edge of the Atlantic, was painted with the salty breath of the sea and the promise of a new day. Along its winding, cobblestone main street, tucked between a bakery with fresh bread scents unfurling like ribbons, and a boutique showcasing handmade quilts in the window, stood Myrtle’s General Store.

The store had become a staple in Larkspur, a heartbeat of the town, where the wood floors creaked with stories of the past, and shelves brimmed with everything from canned soups to hand-carved trinkets. It was here that Clara Bethany Saunders found herself each morning, turning the key and stepping into a world wrapped in warmth and familiarity. A tall woman with a quiet grace, Clara had been the cashier at Myrtle’s for over a decade, her life as neatly organized as the rows of candy that lined her counter.

As Clara switched on the lights, their sudden brightness revealing the colorful packages lining the shelves, she took a deep breath, savoring the moment of solitude before the day's rush began. The store felt like a second skin to her; she knew each aisle like the back of her hand, and the bell above the door its welcome symphony. In Larkspur, where the pace of life matched the tidal ebb and flow, Clara was a constant, her presence as integral to the town as the lighthouse that watched over its shores.
