Evelyn Hartley stood at the edge of the ancient, sprawling ruins of Caelum Valley, the golden light of dawn casting long shadows across the crumbling stones. This early in the morning, the valley was shrouded in a peaceful quiet, broken only by the distant call of a lone bird and the soft rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze. It was her favorite time of day, a moment when the world was still waking, and she could almost feel the whisper of history in the air.

As the lead tour guide for the esteemed Heritage Explorers Agency, Evelyn’s days were usually bustling with the chatter of eager tourists and the hum of engines from the transport shuttles that brought them from the small, neighboring town. But today was different. Today, she had a private tour scheduled, one that promised to be anything but ordinary.

Evelyn brushed a strand of auburn hair from her face and took a deep, calming breath. Her keen green eyes swept across the landscape, noting the intricate carvings on the ancient stone and the rich tapestry of stories they hinted at. She loved this place with all its mysteries and secrets, and she relished the opportunity to make it come alive for her guests. Regardless of the day's challenges, she approached each tour with the kind of enthusiasm that had earned her a reputation for bringing the past to life.

As she glanced at her watch, Evelyn knew it wouldn’t be long before her guests arrived. She adjusted the brim of her sunhat and checked her notes one last time, eager to share the magic of Caelum Valley with yet another group of adventurers. While she waited, she allowed herself a moment to revel in the serenity and beauty of the landscape that had become not just her workplace, but her home.
