In the early hours of dawn, when the city teetered on the delicate edge between night and day, Olivia Bennett stood alone on the rooftop of St. Augustine's Hospital. The sprawling medical complex below had been her professional home for nearly a decade, an urban labyrinth where she spent countless nights tending to the sick and the weary.

Above her, the horizon began its transformation, a whisper of lavender and gold stretching across the sky, chasing away the last vestiges of night. The gentle breeze carried with it the scent of freshly brewed coffee from the cafeteria on the floor below, mingling with the sterile, familiar aroma of disinfectant that clung to her scrubs.

Olivia, a registered nurse with a heart as vast as the sky she gazed upon, cherished these quiet moments before her shifts. They were fleeting interludes of peace, stolen from a world that constantly clamored for her attention and care. Her long auburn hair, usually confined in a strict bun during work, danced freely around her shoulders, playing in the wind like echoes of her untold stories.

As the city awoke, its symphony of distant car horns and the thrum of city buses coming to life, Olivia glanced at her watch. The minute hand nudged closer to the hour, and she knew it was time to descend into the bustling hive of activity that awaited her. Yet for a moment longer, she allowed herself to linger in the twilight, inhaling the crisp morning air, feeling its promise of a new day seep into her bones.
