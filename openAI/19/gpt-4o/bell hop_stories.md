In the heart of the bustling metropolis of New Avalon, where towering skyscrapers kissed the heavens and the streets pulsed with the rhythms of a sleepless city, the century-old Grand Meridian Hotel stood as an illustrious testament to a bygone era. Its façade, a blend of Gothic spires and Art Deco lines, shimmered under the glow of vintage streetlamps, offering a warm embrace to weary travelers from around the world.

Within its opulent halls, the aroma of polished mahogany mingled with the faint scent of blooming gardenias from the lobby’s centerpiece arrangement. Crystal chandeliers threw kaleidoscope patterns across the marble floors, and the distant tinkle of a grand piano at the corner spoke of elegance and timeless charm.

Navigating this enchanting labyrinth of luxury, Ezra Thorne, the hotel’s most seasoned bellhop, moved with quiet efficiency. At just thirty-two, Ezra bore the weight of twenty years of secrets whispered in hallways, notes exchanged under furtive glances, and heartfelt stories shared with a trusted listener. A study in contrasts, his uniform was pressed to perfection, its gold buttons glinting, while his eyes held the soft understanding of one who had glimpsed both the ecstasy and hardship of human tales unfolding in transient rooms.

With the ease of long practice, Ezra balanced an impressive tower of luggage on a handcart, guiding it as though it were an extension of himself. His presence was unassuming yet integral—one of the invisible gears that made the Grand Meridian the living, breathing entity it was. And as he approached the brass-trimmed elevator, the soft chime of its arrival heralded another story waiting to unfold under the watchful eyes of Ezra Thorne, the silent keeper of the Grand Meridian’s many secrets.
