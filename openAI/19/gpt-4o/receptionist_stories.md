Title: **Whispers of Elmwood Lodge**

The rain pattered softly against the windowpanes of Elmwood Lodge, creating a soothing symphony that filled the lobby. The grand, yet comfortably worn, reception area was dimly lit by antique sconces that adorned the faded floral wallpaper. A heavy, oak reception desk stood at the center, its varnish glinting under the flickering light. Behind it sat Abigail Worthington, the lodge's diligent receptionist, whose warm smile was as much a fixture as the venerable armchairs clustered about the room.

Abigail, with her auburn curls pinned back neatly, glanced up from her ledger as the grandfather clock in the corner solemnly chimed six. Outside, the distant rumble of thunder added a hint of drama to the evening's tranquility. She adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses and turned her gaze towards the entrance, watching the shadows deepen as dusk descended over the sprawling gardens beyond.

Despite the weather's melancholy, Elmwood Lodge retained a welcoming charm, with its perennial scent of polished wood and the faint hint of lavender from the sachets placed discreetly around the space. Abigail took a deep breath, savoring this moment of stillness before the night unfolded. She enjoyed these hours, where history seemed to linger in every corner, whispering tales of the lodge's past.

Tonight promised an influx of guests, as the annual writers' retreat commenced. Abigail felt a spark of excitement; each visitor brought stories of their own, and she loved playing her small part in the tapestry of Elmwood's lore. Her desk was ready with a stack of freshly printed itineraries, room keys polished to a shine, and her trusty fountain pen poised for an evening of introductions and warm welcomes.
