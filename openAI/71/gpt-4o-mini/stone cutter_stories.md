In the heart of the rugged Clary Mountains, where jagged peaks pierced the sky and evergreen trees clung tenaciously to the steep cliffs, lay the small, ancient village of Eldergrove. There, the air was rich with the scent of pine and earth, mingling with the distinctive aroma of crushed stone. At the edge of the village, a small workshop stood against the backdrop of towering granite walls—its weathered roof sagging slightly, as if bowing to the very rocks it was built from.

At dawn each day, as the first light painted the mountaintops in hues of gold and amber, Nathaniel Graystone would emerge from his modest home. With his hands roughened by years of labor, he was known as the finest stone cutter in the region. Nathaniel Graystone was not just a tradesman; he was an artist, transforming simple blocks of granite into intricate sculptures and sturdy structures that would endure for generations. The village relied on him to craft everything from ornate gravestones that whispered stories of the past to robust foundations for the homes built in his care.

As he entered his workshop, the rhythmic sound of his hammer striking chisel filled the air, resonating like a heartbeat against the quiet morning. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light that filtered through the small windows, illuminating the tools of his trade sprawled across the sturdy oak workbench. Despite the tranquility of the moment, Nathaniel felt a restless energy stirring within him. He had spent years shaping stone, yet now, a yearning pulled at him for something greater—a challenge that would broaden the horizons of his craft and perhaps reveal a piece of himself that remained hidden amidst the grains of granite. 

With a slight frown shadowing his forehead, he picked up a small, unassuming block of limestone that had been set aside for weeks, its surface still rough and unyielding. Today, he would begin anew, not just carving stone, but sculpting his destiny.
