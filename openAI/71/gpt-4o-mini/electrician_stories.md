In the small, windswept town of Woodhaven, where time seemed to linger like the mist that clung to the evergreen trees, a solitary figure moved with purpose through the narrow streets. The first hints of dawn painted the sky in soft shades of pink and orange, but most of the town remained shrouded in the shadows of early morning. Clutching a well-worn toolbox, Samuel Everett Turner adjusted his baseball cap, its fabric faded and frayed from years of service.

Sam had been an electrician for nearly two decades, known around town not just for his expertise with wires and circuits but for his quiet demeanor and willingness to lend a hand to anyone in need. His reputation was etched into the very fabric of Woodhaven—a reliable source of light in both the literal and metaphorical sense. Today, though, he felt an unusual twinge of unease as he approached the crumbling Victorian house at the end of Maple Street, rumored to be haunted by the stories of those who once called it home.

The house loomed in front of him, its peeling blue paint and sagging porch creating an atmosphere thick with neglect and mystery. Sam had been called to fix a flickering light in the attic—an odd request that sent shivers down his spine. As he climbed the creaking steps to the entrance, a gust of wind rustled the leaves overhead, and for a brief moment, he thought he heard whispers carried on the breeze. Shaking off the sensation, he steeled himself. After all, he was just here to do a job. But as the door swung open with a hesitant creak, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this would be more than just a routine repair.
