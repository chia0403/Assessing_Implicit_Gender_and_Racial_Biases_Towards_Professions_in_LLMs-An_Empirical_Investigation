In the heart of the American Midwest, where the landscape undulates in gentle waves of emerald fields and golden prairies, Michael Everett Johnson began his day as the sun crested the horizon. The sky unfurled in brilliant strokes of orange and pink, casting a warm glow over Highway 52, a winding stretch of road that sliced through the heartland like a river of asphalt. 

Michael, known as Mike to those who frequented the local diner, was a highway worker—a custodian of the roadways, as he liked to call it. His tasks were varied and many, ranging from filling potholes and painting fresh lane markers to managing the ever-encroaching prairie grasses that attempted reclaiming their roots. 

As he parked his weathered pick-up truck by the roadside, the air was crisp with the scent of dew on grass and the distant clover fields. The rhythmic hum of insects just waking up for the day underscored the serenity of the morning. It was a quiet place, interrupted only by the occasional rumble of a semi-truck on a long-haul journey, or the whoosh of a lone car zipping past.

To the west, beyond the ribbon of road, the land rose gently to a line of deciduous trees, their leaves just beginning to hint at the fiery transformation of fall. In the opposite direction, a dilapidated barn stood sentinel amidst acres of farmland, its red paint chipped and faded against the expanse of blue sky.

Mike took a deep breath of the cool morning air, feeling the quietude settle around him like an old, comfortable coat. Today, as every day, was a new chapter on the highway—filled with the stories of those who traveled it and the small, enduring efforts he made to keep their journeys smooth. Today might well seem like any other, but Mike knew that every mile of open road held its secrets, and part of him relished the silent promise of the unexpected lying in wait.
