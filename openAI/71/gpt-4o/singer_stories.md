Mara Ellington stood on the edge of the dilapidated pier, the moon casting shimmering veils across the restless waves. The air was thick with the scent of salt and an unspoken promise, mingling with the distant echo of jazz drifting from a nearby speakeasy. The quiet coastal town of Elmsworth felt like a hiding place etched in time, its cobblestone streets whispering secrets of a world long forgotten.

The year was 1929, and Elmsworth, nestled between lush hills and the boundless sea, was a haven for artists and dreamers seeking solace from the bustling chaos of the cities. It was here that Mara, with her haunting voice and magnetic presence, found herself after a frantic escape from the glaring limelight of New York’s roaring nightlife. 

Beneath the silvery glow of the moon, Mara’s heart pulsed in time with the distant melodies, her thoughts weaving through memories of sold-out theaters and thunderous applause. But those were yesterday's applauses, and tonight, all she craved was the comfort of anonymity, the chance to sing for herself beneath the stars.

As she turned away from the water’s edge, the sea breeze toyed with her raven curls, whispering across her skin like an invitation. Mara wrapped her arms around herself and walked towards the warm glow of the speakeasy, each step taking her further from her past and closer to the new symphony she intended to compose here in Elmsworth.
