In the heart of the bustling city of Riverton, where concrete skyscrapers brushed against the ashen sky and glowing signs illuminated the night, Vincent "Vince" Gallagher worked diligently as an electrician. His domain was the labyrinthine underbelly of the metropolis, a twisting network of wires and circuits that powered the city's relentless pulse. By day, Vince navigated the subterranean corridors of high-rise buildings, his tool belt jangling with every confident step. By night, the neon glow of the city painted his solitary walk home with shades of blue and pink.

Vince had grown accustomed to the symphony of Rivertonâ€”the hum of subway trains, the chatter of bustling streets, and the melodic chaos of construction sites. He lived in a modest apartment on the seventh floor of a weathered brick building in the Carpenter's Ward, a neighborhood known for its eclectic mix of artisans and industrial workers.

On this particular evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the city awoke with its nocturnal energy, Vince was finishing a long day's work at the Riverton Harborfront. Here, old warehouses were being transformed into modern lofts, attracting those who fancied riverview living. Vince meticulously checked the circuit panel one last time, ensuring that each connection was secure, each wire precisely aligned, before packing up his tools.

As Vince stood amidst the dimly lit construction site, he thought about the harmony he sought not only in the web of cables but also in the life he lived and the city he loved. Little did he know, tonight's walk home through the glistening, rain-soaked streets would set into motion events that would entangle him in a mystery as intricate as any electrical schematic he had ever encountered.
