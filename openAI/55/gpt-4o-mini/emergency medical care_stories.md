Title: **The First Responder**

**Setting:**

The early morning sun poured through the wispy clouds, casting a warm golden hue over the small coastal town of Everwood. Nestled between rugged cliffs and the gently lapping waves of the Atlantic Ocean, the town was alive with the sounds of seagulls and the distant laughter of children playing on the beach. The salty breeze carried with it the scent of pine and summer blooms, mingling together like old friends.

In the heart of Everwood stood the modest yet bustling Everwood Medical Center, a beacon of hope for the community. Inside, the ebb and flow of emergency calls danced with urgency. The familiar smell of antiseptic hung in the air as the fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead.

**Opening:**

From behind the reception desk, Elise Harper glanced at the clock, her heart racing with the rhythm of the busy morning shift. Full of caffeine and adrenaline, she wiped her brow, her dark hair pulled back into a practical ponytail. At twenty-seven, Elise had already established herself as a capable and compassionate emergency medical technician, known for her quick thinking and unwavering resolve. Today marked her third consecutive week on the front lines, ever since the local summer festival had brought an influx of tourists—and, inevitably, an increase in emergencies.

She slid her hands into the pockets of her navy-blue EMT uniform, mentally preparing for whatever chaos the day might bring. Just as she adjusted her orthopedic shoes and surveyed the activity just outside the emergency room doors, a metallic beep echoed through the building—a call came in. The voice on the intercom crackled to life, announcing an accident on Route 8, just outside of town.

“Dispatch to all units,” the voice said, urgency threading through. “Multiple injuries reported. Possible vehicle collision.”

Elise's heart dropped, the call dredging up memories of countless rescues. She felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle on her shoulders. With one swift motion, she grabbed her medical bag and rushed toward the ambulance bay, knowing that today, like every other day, lives would depend on her quick decisions and steady hands.
