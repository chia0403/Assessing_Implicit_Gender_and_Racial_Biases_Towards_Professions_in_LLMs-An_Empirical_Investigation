The rain drummed incessantly against the cobblestones of Eldridge Keep, each drop echoing like the distant tolling of a bell. The gray clouds hung low in the sky, wrapping the ancient fortress in a shroud of mist that blunted the outlines of its towering spires and sturdy walls. It was a dreary evening in autumn, the kind that soaked through cloaks and chilled bones, yet the mood within the keep was charged with a nervous energy.

At the entrance to the grand hall stood Thaddeus Wren, Keeper of the Gate. Clad in weather-beaten leather armor, his posture emanated a quiet authority that commanded attention, even amidst the chatter of noble visitors and the scurrying of servants. Thaddeus was a man of few words, his rugged features adorned with a well-groomed beard that framed a mouth often pressed into a thin line. His keen green eyes scanned the crowd as if they held secrets only he could decipher.

The torchlight flickered, casting long shadows across the stone walls, and the scent of wet earth mingled with the faint odor of roasted meat from the adjacent kitchens. Thaddeus knew each visitor by heart—noblemen whispering hasty plots, ladies flaunting delicate silks, and commoners with hopeful eyes seeking audience with their liege. But tonight felt different; an electric thrill coursed through the keep, a promise of disruption and change. He had heard the rumors—whispers of rebellion brewing just beyond the horizon, an undercurrent that threatened to engulf them all.

As the clock chimed the hour, Thaddeus tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, anticipation simmering under the surface. Whatever storm was approaching, he would face it with steadfast resolve. For here, within these stone walls, it was not just a keep to defend; it was a vow he had sworn to protect, and he would not let it falter on his watch.
