The neon glow of the city faded into the rearview mirror as Richard “Rick” Thompson rolled his rig onto the long stretch of Highway 41. The hum of the engine was a comforting lullaby against the monotonous landscape rolling by—fields of golden corn swaying gently in the evening breeze and the occasional rustle of small creatures stirring in the dusky twilight. It was late October, and the air carried a crisp hint of autumn, the promise of cooler nights ahead.

Rick’s worn truck, a 2008 Peterbilt painted in bright red with chrome accents, had seen countless miles and countless nights like this one. Inside the cab, the walls were adorned with mementos from the road—pictures of his daughter, Lily, taped to the dash, and a trusty old coffee thermos that had been his faithful companion through sleepless nights spent on the highway. With a sigh, he adjusted his baseball cap and switched on the radio, the soothing voice of a late-night DJ weaving through the static, blending with the sound of the tires rolling over asphalt.

As he settled into the comfortable rhythm of the road, his thoughts wandered back to home—an old farmhouse on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio, where he was expected for dinner just as soon as he dropped off this load of freight in Nashville. The smell of his ex-wife’s famous chili pot simmering on the stove danced in his imagination, mingling with the bittersweet memories of family dinners long gone. But he was a trucker, bound by the road and the promise of deliveries that didn’t wait for anyone.

Ahead, the horizon swallowed the sun's last rays, leaving a canvas of deep purple and soft orange, the stars beginning to flicker to life above him. Little did Rick know that tonight, the highway would offer more than just another long haul; it would be a night of unexpected turns and revelations that would steer his life in a new direction altogether.
