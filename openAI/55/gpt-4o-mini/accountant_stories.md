The clock on the wall ticked steadily in the small, warmly lit office, where the faint aroma of fresh coffee mingled with the faint scent of aging paper. Lisa Marie Thompson adjusted her round glasses, peering at the spreadsheets cascading across her dual monitors. It was a Monday morning, and the sun filtered through the office windows, casting delicate shadows that danced across the piles of invoices and balance sheets neatly stacked on her desk.

Lisa sat at her polished oak desk, a haven of organization amidst the chaotic world outside her window. The soft whirr of the overhead fan provided a calming backdrop to her meticulous calculations. Behind her, a bulletin board was peppered with colorful reminders: “Client A’s tax deadline,” “Team meeting on Friday,” and a cherished postcard from her sister, depicting the sparkling shores of Hawaii. Though her world revolved around numbers, she secretly harbored a passion for travel—something her diligent career as an accountant rarely afforded her.

As Lisa transferred figures from one document to another, her mind wandered. She had always found solace in the predictability of tax codes and profit margins. But today felt different. An unsettling feeling skated across her skin, as though the humdrum of the workday was about to be punctuated by something unexpected.

Just then, the phone rang, its suddenness jolting her from her thoughts. She took a deep breath, smoothed her navy blouse, and answered, her voice steady yet curious. The line crackled briefly before a familiar voice on the other end breathed a hint of urgency. "Lisa, you need to come to the office right away. There’s something you need to see."
