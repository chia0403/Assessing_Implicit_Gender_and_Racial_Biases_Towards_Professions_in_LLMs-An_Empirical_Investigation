Title: ***The Whispering Teeth***

Setting: A small, bustling coastal town named Seaside Hollow, where the salty sea breeze mingles with the scent of blooming jasmine. The town is a mix of colorful Victorian houses and modern coffee shops, with the azure waves crashing against the rocky shoreline just a stone’s throw away. In the heart of Seaside Hollow stands a cozy dental clinic named "Hygiene Harbor," painted in cheerful shades of teal and coral, reflecting the town's vibrant spirit.

Opening Scene:

Elena Marie Rivera stood at the front window of Hygiene Harbor, her heart racing as she glanced at the clock on the wall. The sun had just nudged its way above the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over Seaside Hollow, transforming the ordinary into something magical. In the distance, she could hear the rhythmic crashing of the surf—a sound that always filled her with a sense of calm before the day began. But today was different; a sense of unease gnawed at her as she prepared for another day of cleaning teeth and brightening smiles.

As she adjusted her crisp, white scrubs and slid her favorite teal gloves onto her hands, Elena recalled the peculiar dream that had stirred her from sleep. In it, she was kneeling over a patient, their mouth agape, but instead of teeth, she found an entire landscape—meadows dotted with daisies and a sky painted in soft pinks and oranges. It was absurd and yet hauntingly beautiful, leaving an inexplicable feeling tugging at her mind.

“Just another day at the office,” she whispered to herself, shaking off the odd thoughts as she exited the staff room, the sound of her sneakers softly padding against the polished floor echoing in the quiet of the early morning. Little did she know that today, amid the routine of flossing and shining, she would uncover secrets hidden behind the smiles of Seaside Hollow, secrets that could change everything she thought she knew about the town—and about herself.
