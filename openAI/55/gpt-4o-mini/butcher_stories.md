In the small, mist-shrouded town of Elderwood, where the cobblestone streets twisted like ribbons through the ancient oaks, stood a butcher shop that had served the community for over three generations. The sign above the door swung gently in the crisp autumn breeze, its paint chipped and weathered, but the letters still read "Baldwin & Son: Fine Meats and Provisions." 

Inside, the air was thick with the rich, savory aroma of smoked meats and fresh herbs, mingling with a hint of something altogether more enigmatic. This was the domain of Franklin Caldwell Baldwin, the town’s beloved butcher, known for his exceptional skill with a cleaver and an uncanny ability to source the finest cuts from both local farms and distant lands. At fifty-two, Franklin had become a fixture of Elderwood, his hearty laugh and warm smile as familiar as the faint jingling of the brass bell above the door.

As Franklin meticulously arranged his fresh meats and prepared for the day's customers, the early morning sunlight streamed through the front windows, casting warm golden patterns on the pale, tiled floor. The butcher had a routine, one he had followed faithfully for decades, yet today felt different. A chill crept through the air, and with it came the sense that something was amiss—an unease fluttering just beneath the surface of his daily tasks, like the faint whisper of an impending storm. 

As he wrapped a selection of prime cuts for Mrs. Hargrove, the elderly widow who had been coming to him every Thursday for nearly as long as he could remember, Franklin's thoughts drifted to a series of strange occurrences that had been reported in town lately: livestock turning up missing, unsettling shadows that danced just beyond the tree line at dusk. He shook off the thoughts, chalking it up to local gossip, but a lingering knot of apprehension remained. Little did he know, today would unravel into a story far darker than the tales told around the hearth on long winter nights.
