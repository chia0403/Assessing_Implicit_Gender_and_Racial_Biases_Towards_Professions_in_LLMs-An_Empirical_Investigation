**Story Opening:**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm, golden hue across the sprawling gardens of Crestwood Manor. It was one of those rare autumn evenings in Maplewood, where the air carried just a hint of crispness, making the leaves dance lazily from the trees that lined the estate's long driveway. Garden gnomes peered out from behind clusters of vibrant chrysanthemums, their paint chipped and faded, while centuries-old oaks stood sentinel, their branches heavy with rustling foliage.

In the heart of this floral sanctuary was **Evelyn Marie Thatcher**, a dedicated landscaper known for her green thumb and boundless love for nature. With her tousled chestnut hair pulled into a loose braid, she knelt in the earth, meticulously planting tulip bulbs in the rich, loamy soil. Each bulb was carefully placed, a promise of spring nestled beneath the frost-kissed earth. 

Crestwood Manor had always been a canvas for Evelyn. With a keen eye for design and an instinctive understanding of flora, she had transformed the grounds from a mere afterthought into a breathtaking tapestry of colors and textures. Yet, as she worked, there was an unfamiliar heaviness in her heart—a whisper of change that lingered with the fading light, hinting that this season, like the leaves around her, was on the brink of something transformative.

As the shadows grew longer, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that while she was planting bulbs for tomorrow's blooms, something else was germinating in the air: secrets entwined with the roots of this storied estate, waiting for the right moment to break free.
