The rain fell in a steady rhythm, tapping against the old stone windows of Maplewood University. It was an unremarkable Tuesday afternoon in late October, but the atmosphere inside the ivy-clad halls was anything but ordinary. The warm, golden glow of the library's reading lamps illuminated the rows of ancient books, their spines cracked and faded, whispering the secrets of centuries past. 

Professor Eliza Genevieve Hawthorne stood at her lectern, her gaze sweeping across the room filled with eager students. She was a woman of sharp intellect and quiet intensity, her auburn hair pulled back in a tidy bun, revealing a thoughtful face framed by round spectacles. Today, she was about to unveil the enigmatic world of literary symbolism, a topic she was both passionate about and secretly apprehensive to tackle. 

Outside, the leaves of the gnarled oak trees danced wildly in the wind, casting playful shadows that flickered across the library floor. As Eliza prepared to delve into the complexities of meaning, a flicker of anticipation stirred within her; her lecture might just unlock a new way of seeing for one of her students. Little did she know, however, that this very afternoon would unravel into something far more intricate than any literary device she had ever studied.
