Dr. Evelyn Grant stood at her living room window, watching the early morning fog weave its delicate tendrils through the towering oaks that bordered her property. The world beyond was a muted, watercolor wash of grays and greens, the promise of another autumn day in Dunridge—a small coastal town where the ocean mist often played its games with the land. As the sun struggled to pierce the veil, its first golden rays cast faint, shimmering echoes on the glass, mirroring the shimmering career Evelyn had painstakingly built.

Her quaint Victorian home, with its ivy-clad walls and chimneys whispering stories of a bygone era, seemed at odds with the precision and certainty that dominated her professional life. Inside, it was a refuge of order and calm, filled with books and the soft, inviting hues of New England charm. Here, in this place of warmth and tranquility, Evelyn could almost forget the relentless demands of St. Margaret's Hospital and the lives that were shaped—or reshaped—by her hands.

Yet, the ticking of the antique clock above the mantel was a reminder that the delicate balance between life and death never rested, much like her own calling. As a renowned surgeon known for her deft touch and unwavering composure in the operating room, Evelyn was both revered and envied by her peers. But within her, a quiet restlessness stirred, a whisper of a longing she couldn't quite name, echoing like the distant roar of the ocean that lay just beyond the fog.
