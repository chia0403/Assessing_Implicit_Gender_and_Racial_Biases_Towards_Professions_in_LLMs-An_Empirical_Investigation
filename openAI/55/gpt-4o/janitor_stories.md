In the heart of Crescent City, shrouded in coastal fog and the gentle hum of distant waves, stood the venerable old edifice of Larkspur High. Its red brick facade, now softened by age and creeping ivy, whispered tales of generations past. Inside, the echo of students' footsteps had faded with the day's end, leaving behind a serene stillness that crept through the grand corridors.

It was in this peaceful interlude, just before the ballet of nighttime custodians began, that Nelson Avery stepped into the fray with his trusty mop and a warm, enduring smile. Nelson, the school’s head janitor, had been a fixture at Larkspur High for over twenty years. To the students, he was a friendly, reassuring presence; to the teachers, a colleague who quietly ensured that their world ran smoothly.

Hours past the final bell, the school transformed into Nelson's private kingdom. The clatter of his cart echoed in harmonious rhythm with the once noisy halls. As he worked, the setting sun cast golden hues through the towering windows, painting the walls with vibrant streaks of color that danced around amidst the shadows.

Nelson paused momentarily in the grand foyer, a favorite spot of his, where a majestic chandelier hung above like a crown jewel. There, beneath its twinkling light, Nelson often felt the weight of time lift, as if each sparkling facet held a memory suspended in history.

With a gentle push, he moved forward, his thoughts drifting between fragments of conversations he'd overheard, dreams sprinkled with the faces of students he'd grown to care for, and the quiet poetry he found in his nightly ritual. Rustling keys at his side, Nelson Avery embarked on his unseen voyage through the school’s sleeping corridors, a humble guardian of the stories within.
