In the heart of downtown Charleston, nestled between the cobblestone streets and the whispers of the past, stood a bar known as "The Lantern's Glow." It was a place where stories unfolded alongside the moonlit river, and secrets lingered in the air like the sweet scent of magnolia blossoms after a heavy rain. The Lantern’s Glow was not just a bar; it was a refuge, an establishment where time seemed to stall, allowing patrons to lose themselves in its warmth and charm.

Behind the burnished oak counter, with its surface seasoned by countless elbows and spilled tales, was Oliver Mercer. At thirty-four, Oliver was a man whose presence commanded attention, not through boisterousness, but through quiet confidence and a smile that seemed to know exactly what you needed before you even asked. His dark hair, an unruly underbrush, framed a pair of kind eyes that bore witness to the countless encounters passing through The Lantern’s Glow.

Oliver's life, much like the bar he tended, thrived on the stories of others. Each evening he watched as strangers became friends and laughter unspooled into the night. Tonight, however, the air felt different—thicker, somehow. The stories that resonated against the wooden beams seemed to sway with an undercurrent of the unexpected, carrying with them a new chapter Oliver hadn’t quite anticipated.
