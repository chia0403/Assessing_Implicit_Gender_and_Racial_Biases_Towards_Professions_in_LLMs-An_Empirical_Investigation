On the corner of Willow and Main, nestled between an antique bookstore and a quaint café, stood Opal’s Bloomery, a floral shop like no other. Its façade was a kaleidoscope of colors, with vibrant displays of cascading pansies and delicate baby's breath framed by ivy that wrapped lovingly around the doorframe. The intoxicating scent of fresh flowers spilled onto the streets, drawing passersby into its whimsical embrace. 

Inside, under the warm glow of Edison bulbs strung along the ceiling, a symphony of floral arrangements sat atop reclaimed wooden tables. They ranged from simple bouquets of wildflowers to intricate designs fit for grand affairs. The air was alive with the rustling of petals and the faint hum of an old vinyl record spinning in the background.

Tending to this haven of horticulture was Margot Elowen Jarvis, a true artist of the botanical realm. With a gentle touch and an eye as keen as a hawk’s, she crafted each bouquet with devotion, as if each flower held a story waiting to be told. Her fingers were stained with chlorophyll and the faint markings of thorns, badges of honor for a florist whose heart was in every stem she handled.

Margot, with her deep chestnut hair pulled into a loose braid and eyes the color of a summer storm, found solace amongst the blooms. Here, amidst the lush greens and vibrant hues, she navigated the world not through words, but through the unspoken language of flora, each petal a piece of an uncharted narrative. Today, as the morning sun painted the room with golden light, she prepared for an ordinary day that, unknown to her, held the promise of extraordinary ventures.
