In the heart of the bustling, rain-soaked city of Portland, Oregon, where the streets glistened with the sheen of a perpetual drizzle, Calvin Montgomery lived most of his days beneath the surface, navigating an intricate world hidden from the hurried pace above. Known to friends and neighbors simply as “Cal,” he was a seasoned plumber with an intuition for the labyrinth of pipes and drains that ran beneath the city like veins and arteries.

Calvin's domain was the dimly lit basement of a century-old brick walk-up nestled between a vintage vinyl shop and a bohemian café adorned with strings of fairy lights. It was a small, cluttered workshop that smelled of solder and coffee, with tools neatly organized across pegboards and stacks of well-worn manuals crowding the shelves. Here, amidst the hum of boiler systems and the gentle trickle of leaking faucets, he crafted solutions akin to an artist shaping clay.

The day was a typical overcast morning, the kind where the clouds hung low enough to almost brush the tops of the trees, and the damp air carried the earthy scent of moss and wet pavement. Calvin was sipping his third cup of black coffee, enveloped in the steady percussion of raindrops against the windowpane, when the phone rang—a sound as familiar and comforting as the whistle of a kettle. It was the call for another job, another chance to fix what others saw as broken; for Calvin Montgomery, this was the music of another day unfolding.
