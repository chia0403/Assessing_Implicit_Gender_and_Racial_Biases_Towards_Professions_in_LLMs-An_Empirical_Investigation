On the outskirts of the small, sun-baked town of Crescent Ridge, where the shimmering heat waves waver against the horizon, stood a weathered garage named "Ridgeway Repairs." It was a simple structure, with its faded red paint and rusty corrugated metal roof, but for more than a decade, it had been a lifeline for the locals. The scent of motor oil and the sound of clinking metal filled the air, a symphony of industry and persistence.

Inside the garage, amidst the organized chaos of tools and spare parts, worked Ethan "Wheels" Carlisle, a man whose hands were as skilled as any artist's. Ethan was known for his easy smile and even steadier resolveâ€”a trait appreciated by those who found themselves in desperation with broken cars in the middle of nowhere. Tall and broad-shouldered, his presence was as reassuring as the hum of an engine brought back to life under his care.

Ethan's days were spent beneath cars, coaxing life from stubborn engines or patiently explaining the intricacies of carburetors to curious customers. Despite the often-grueling work, Ethan found peace within the mechanical heartbeats of the vehicles he mended. To him, each car was a puzzle, a mystery waiting to be solved, and each day brought with it a new opportunity for discovery.
