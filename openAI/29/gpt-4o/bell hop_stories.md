Title: *Echoes of the Hotel Grandis*

The sun had barely begun to peer over the horizon, casting a soft golden hue across the city streets, as Ethan Montgomery stepped out onto the rain-slicked pavement in front of the Hotel Grandis. As the night surrendered to dawn, the city was suspended in a peculiar hush, a momentary pause before the commotion of the day ahead. The hotel, a stately relic of the late 19th century, stood like a bastion of old-world charm amidst the encroaching modern skyscrapers, its stone façade adorned with garlands of ivy and intricate carvings that seemed to whisper tales from a bygone era.

Ethan adjusted the collar of his neatly pressed bellhop uniform, a deep burgundy jacket with gleaming brass buttons, and took a deep breath of the crisp morning air. He thrived in these early hours when the world was still waking, savoring the promise of untold stories as guests from around the globe passed through the revolving doors. Born and raised in the city, Ethan had found solace in the rhythmic routine of his job, carrying it out with an attention to detail that was both meticulous and unspoken.

The lobby of the Hotel Grandis was a symphony of opulence, echoing with the soft tinkling of a grand chandelier and the gentle rustle of morning newspapers. Marble floors gleamed under the artfully dimmed lighting, and the rich scent of polished wood mingled with a hint of lavender from the fresh floral arrangements adorning the tables. Ethan's footsteps were quiet, purposeful, as he moved across the lobby, exchanging nods with the sleepy-eyed night concierge as she prepared for the end of her shift.

Today promised the arrival of a varied ensemble of guests: the ever-elusive critique writer, rumored to dine solely where culinary excellence whispered to the soul; the reclusive artist seeking silence and yet another canvas to tell untold stories; and the spirited young couple, eager to treat the city as their playground. Ethan relished these encounters—fragments of lives that intersected his own in brief, kaleidoscopic snippets. He glanced at his watch, straightened his tie nervously, and steeled himself for the ballet of hospitality that awaited just beyond the cusp of daybreak. Each guest was a mystery wrapped in the veneer of suitcases and weary smiles, and Ethan Montgomery found that there was nothing more thrilling than unearthing those secrets, one luggage-laden journey at a time.
