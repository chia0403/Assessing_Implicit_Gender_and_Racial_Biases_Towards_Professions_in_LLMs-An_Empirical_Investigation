In the heart of bustling downtown Seattle, beneath the steel and glass giants reaching for the sky, there stood an old brick building, tucked away like a forgotten relic of times gone by. Inside, the rhythmic hum of typewriters and the muffled chatter of telephones created an orchestra of modern commerce. On the third floor, overlooking the vibrant streets below, was the office of Harding & Ferris Imports.

Miriam Caldwell was at her desk, a sanctuary of neatly stacked paperwork and freshly sharpened pencils. Her fingers moved with practiced grace, a maestro of efficiency orchestrating the daily symphony of correspondence that flowed through the company. The morning light slanted through the wide, dusty windows, casting a warm glow on her immaculate workspace. Outside, the world was a blur of activity, but here, in this dimly lit oasis, time seemed to slow down, her domain one of order amidst the chaos.

Miriam, with her calm demeanor and sharp wit, was known as the cornerstone of the office. In her capable hands, disparate streams of information merged into coherent plans, ensuring the wheels of business turned smoothly. Her auburn hair was neatly pinned up, and her attire—a dark green blouse and charcoal skirt—was as meticulous as her work. To the outside world, she was simply a secretary, but to those who knew her, she was the indispensable heart of Harding & Ferris. Today, however, unbeknownst to her, the ordinary rhythm of her life was about to be disrupted in the most extraordinary of ways.
