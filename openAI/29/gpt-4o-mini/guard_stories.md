In the heart of the ancient city of Eldoria, where cobblestone streets wound through towering spires and the scent of baked bread mingled with the cool evening air, a heavy wooden gate marked the entrance to the Royal Keep. The fading sunlight cast long shadows across the courtyard, illuminating the glistening armor of the guards on duty. Among them stood a figure of unwavering resolve, Guard Captain Seraphina Thorne, her emerald eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of trouble.

Seraphina had spent ten years defending the kingdom from both visible threats and those lurking in the shadows. Her presence commanded respect; tales of her bravery echoed in every tavern and market square. As the last rays of sunlight dipped behind the mountains, a chill swept through the air, carrying whispers of an impending storm. Tonight, the feast of the Harvest Moon would draw noble families and common folk alike to the Great Hall within the Keep, but Seraphina sensed an undercurrent of tension that unsettled her, as if the very stones of the castle held secrets waiting to be unveiled. 

The courtyard bustled with servants setting up lanterns and arranging tables, laughter spilling from the kitchens where fragrant meals were being prepared. But amidst the jovial atmosphere, Seraphina couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was watching. Clad in her polished breastplate adorned with the emblem of a silver eagle, she tightened her grip on the hilt of her sword, ready for whatever lay ahead. Whatever shadows danced in the depths of the twilight, Seraphina Thorne would confront them head-on.
