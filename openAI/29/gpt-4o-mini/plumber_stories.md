In the quaint, sun-dappled town of Brookhaven, where ivy-clad cottages leaned together as if sharing secrets, the air was often filled with the harmonious sounds of chirping birds and the gentle rustle of leaves. However, today was different; a chill wind swept through the narrow streets, whispering of changes ahead. 

At the end of Maple Lane, tucked between a cozy bakery and a shop brimming with antiques, stood a modest plumbing business owned by none other than Benjamin Arthur Kowalski. The paint on the wooden sign above the door had begun to chip, yet it proudly proclaimed: “Kowalski Plumbing: Fixing Leaks and Lowering Creaks Since 1995.” 

Benjamin, or Ben to the locals, was known for his warm smile and grease-stained overalls, a badge of honor reflecting years spent kneeling behind sinks and climbing into dusty basements. At thirty-five, with tousled chestnut hair and a collection of well-worn tools strapped to his waist, Ben embodied reliability in a town that cherished tradition. Today, however, his thoughts lingered on a peculiar call he had just received—a desperate request from the old Harrington estate, a sprawling, decaying mansion rumored to be haunted. He took a deep breath, allowing the scent of fresh bread from the bakery to settle his nerves. Little did he know, this job would lead him far beyond pipes and wrenches, into the heart of Brookhaven’s deepest mysteries.
