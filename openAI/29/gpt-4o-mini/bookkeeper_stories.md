The clock struck six as Amelia Marigold sat at her desk, the soft glow of her desk lamp casting a warm pool of light over the piles of invoices and ledgers that surrounded her. The small, windowless office on the second floor of an aging brick building smelled faintly of paper and sandalwood, the scent mingling with the hustle and bustle of the city below. Outside, honking taxis and the distant chatter of pedestrians flickered like ghosts in the periphery of her mind, but Amelia remained undistracted. 

She had always found solace in numbers. There was a certain comfort in their predictability, a sense of order that contrasted the chaotic world beyond her door. The rhythmic scratching of her pen against paper was her best friend, and the meticulous organization of her ledgers was a sanctuary where she could escape from the uncertainties of life. 

On this particular evening, however, as Amelia balanced the last set of accounts for the month, a thought nagged at the back of her mind. Underneath the routine calculations and meticulous entries lurked a sense of apprehension. A storm was brewing—not in the skies, but in the very place she sought refuge. Across the hall, the usually quiet office of Grayson & Co. had turned raucous, its occupants hastily packing boxes and sharing secrets as if the world as they knew it was about to end. 

Curiosity piqued, and feeling the weight of her solitude, Amelia peeked through the gap in her door. What she saw sent a shiver down her spine. In the middle of their frenzied exodus was Martin Grayson, the firm’s gregarious owner, standing at the center of an electric conversation that spun around him like a whirlwind. Little did Amelia know, this moment would mark the beginning of a series of events that would unravel the very fabric of her orderly existence.
