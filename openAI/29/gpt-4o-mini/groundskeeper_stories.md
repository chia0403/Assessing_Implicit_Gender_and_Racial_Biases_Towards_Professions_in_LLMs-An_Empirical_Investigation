The early morning mist hung low over the sprawling grounds of the Harrington Estate, the dew-kissed grass glimmering like a myriad of tiny diamonds in the pale light of dawn. Towering oak trees stood sentinel at the edges of an expansive garden, their gnarled branches adorned with vivid hues of red and gold, a testament to the changing season. In the distance, the imposing silhouette of the manor loomed, its ancient stone walls whispering secrets of generations past.

At the heart of this serene landscape, Maxwell Thorne knelt in the soft earth, a trowel in one hand and a small potted sapling in the other. His weathered hands, marked by years of toil and care, trembled with anticipation as he prepared to plant the young tree—a gift from the owners to commemorate a milestone in their family's history. The scent of moist soil filled the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of blooming chrysanthemums that surrounded him.

Maxwell had dedicated nearly two decades to the Harrington grounds, nurturing every flower, every blade of grass as if they were his own children. At fifty-eight years old, he understood the rhythms of the land better than most; he could predict the blossoming of spring tulips and the fall of leaves with an instinctual precision. His hair, a silver crown against the setting sun, betrayed his age, yet his eyes sparkled with a youthful passion for nature's beauty.

As the sun began to rise above the treetops, casting a warm glow across the landscape, a gentle breeze rustled the leaves, and Maxwell paused for a moment, closing his eyes to absorb the stillness that enveloped the estate. In this tranquil space, he pondered not only the life he had cultivated in the garden but also the one he had yet to fully embrace—one filled with dreams long buried beneath the weight of duty.
