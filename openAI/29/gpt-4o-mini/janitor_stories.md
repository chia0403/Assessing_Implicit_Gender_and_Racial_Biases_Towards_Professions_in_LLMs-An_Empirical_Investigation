The old clock tower in the heart of Langston Valley struck midnight, its chimes echoing through the quiet streets. The moon hung low, cloaked in a veil of mist that rolled in from the nearby river, casting a silvery glow on the cobblestones and lending an otherworldly air to the town. As the last vibrations faded, a figure emerged from the shadows of the alleyway beside the weathered library—a tall man with a crooked back and calloused hands, pushing a rusting cleaning cart filled with worn mops, tattered rags, and a bucket that had seen better days.

This was Theodore "Theo" Langley, a janitor who had dedicated nearly two decades of his life to keeping the old library pristine, although no one ever seemed to notice. He was both a ghost and guardian, resurfacing in the dim corners of the building at odd hours, murmuring to the pages of books that had become his only companions. Theo’s uniform—a faded blue jumpsuit with a name tag that had long lost its crispness—hung loosely on his frame, while his unkempt hair and tired eyes told stories of sleepless nights spent in the embrace of forgotten tales and half-whispered legends.

As the wind howled outside, rustling the leaves in the gnarled trees that surrounded the library, Theo pushed his cart through the grand wooden doors, the wood groaning under the weight of time. The smell of aged paper and dust wafted toward him, wrapping him in a familiar embrace. On a night like this, when the world outside faded to darkness, the library breathed life, and Theo could almost hear the secrets hidden within its walls beckoning to be uncovered.
