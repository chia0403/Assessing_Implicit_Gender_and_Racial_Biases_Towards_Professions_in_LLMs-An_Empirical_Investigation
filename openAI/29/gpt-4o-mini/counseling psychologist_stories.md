**Story Opening and Setting**

The late afternoon sun filtered through the tall oak trees that lined Maplewood Counseling Center, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. Nestled in a quaint neighborhood, the center's brick façade was adorned with climbing ivy, giving it an air of both warmth and professionalism. Inside, the walls were painted a calming shade of lavender, with soft-spoken artwork depicting serene landscapes adorned throughout the halls. The faint scent of lavender essential oil lingered in the air, a thoughtful touch by the staff to soothe the anxious minds that sought solace within.

In the center’s tastefully decorated office, Dr. Isabelle Marie Thompson sat at her mahogany desk, the plush chair across from her empty for now. At thirty-eight, she had carved out a respectable career as a counseling psychologist, specializing in anxiety and trauma therapy. Her warm hazel eyes held a depth of understanding that made clients feel they were in safe hands. With soft, chestnut hair gathered into a loose bun, Dr. Thompson exuded a blend of professionalism and gentleness, her attire—a collared blouse and tailored slacks—striking a balance between approachable and authoritative.

She glanced at the clock on the wall; her last client of the day would arrive soon. Outside, the gentle rustle of leaves reminded her that fall was creeping in, a season of transformation and change. A familiar sense of anticipation settled in her chest as she picked up her notepad, ready to help someone unravel their tangled emotions. Little did she know, the next appointment was not just any session—it was the beginning of a journey that would change her life forever.
