In the quiet town of Eldridge Hollow, nestled between rolling hills and ancient oak trees, the first light of dawn crept through the mist that lingered over the sprawling estate of Hawthorne Manor. The air was crisp with the scent of freshly turned earth and dew-kissed grass. A lone figure emerged from the shadows, a silhouette against the soft pastel sky—a man whose hands were calloused and weary, yet gentle enough to coax life from the soil. This was Harold Benjamin Crowley, the dedicated groundskeeper of Hawthorne Manor.

Harold's world was one of routine and reverence, tending to the vast gardens that sprawled around the historic mansion. Each sunrise found him planting, pruning, and nurturing the vibrant blooms that decorated the walkways and enclose the stately trees lining the property. The manor itself loomed behind him, its ivy-clad stones whispering tales of a bygone era while being embraced by the rich greens of the grounds he so lovingly maintained.

Today, however, was different. As he knelt beside a patch of tulips, Harold’s eyes caught a glint of something in the underbrush, a flash that seemed out of place against the earthy tones. Curiosity piqued, he brushed aside the leaves, his heart quickening as he unearthed a small, ornate key glittering in the morning sun—a relic that might unlock more than just doors within the old estate. Little did Harold know, this discovery would weave him into the threads of an ancient mystery buried deep in the heart of Hawthorne Manor.
