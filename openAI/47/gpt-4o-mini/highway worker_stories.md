The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden hue over the endless stretch of asphalt that threaded through the heart of Wyeth County. It was a quiet afternoon, the kind where the only sound was the gentle rustle of tall grass swaying in the distance and the occasional lull of a distant truck rumbling past. Along the side of Highway 53, where the state line danced like a mirage on the horizon, stood a lone figure in a bright orange safety vest, his shovel resting against the gravel beside him.

Caleb Henry Donovan wiped the sweat from his brow, blinking against the brightness that enveloped him. He was a highway worker, having dedicated the last fifteen years of his life to maintaining the roads that connected small towns to the cities, each project a promise of progress and safety for the travelers that passed through. Today, though, he found himself haunted by the stillness; it was an unsettling tranquility, one that carried an undercurrent of change.

It was here, between the flickering glow of the construction sign and the steady rhythm of his heart, that Caleb felt the familiar tug of uncertainty—a feeling he’d grown accustomed to in recent months. As he leaned down to dig once more, the earth beneath his feet seemed to rumble lightly, as if it too sensed the shifting winds of fate. It wasn't just the highway that was changing; it was everything—his life, his choices, the very essence of what it meant to be Caleb Henry Donovan, a man so deeply tied to the ground beneath him and yet yearning for the horizon.
