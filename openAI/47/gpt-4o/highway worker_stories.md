Beneath the expansive Texas sky, where the horizon seemed to stretch infinitely, there was a stretch of road that rarely witnessed a lull in its restless life. This was where Matthew "Matt" Corbin spent most of his days, wearing the bright reflective vest that marked him as a guardian of these black-topped rivers of commerce and connection. The heat shimmered in waves over the faded asphalt, dancing mirages teasing travelers with promises of cool water and relief.

Matt had come to know this particular expanse of Highway 87 as intimately as one might know a best friend. He had seen it endure the extremes—floods that swept across it in liquid sheets, summer sun that baked it until fissures appeared like parched lips pleading for moisture, and winter frost that crusted its edges in delicate white crystal. The highway was a living thing, and Matt tended to it with dutiful care, clipboards and tools replacing the stethoscope and thermometer of a physician.

A cluster of wild sunflowers breached the fence line, adding vibrant yellow punctuation to the unending green fields that rolled away from the road's edge. It was here, amid the hum of cicadas and the occasional boom of a semi-truck hurtling past, that he felt a deep sense of purpose. Though the traffic never ceased, there was often a kind of solitude in his work—something Matt relished as much as he did his first cup of morning coffee. 

The rhythmic sound of distant rubber on pavement was a comforting symphony that accompanied the peeling away of old road markings and the laying down of fresh ones, a task that brought new life to the road and to him. Yet, for all its predictability, today offered the air of something different, something impending. A pair of hawks circled overhead, tracing lazy arcs in the sky, perhaps heralding change or merely the satisfaction of catching a thermal. Matt couldn't be certain, but he felt a subtle shift as surely as one senses an approaching storm.
