Inside, the waiting room was bathed in soft, golden light filtering through tall windows framed by lush, leafy plants. Shelves lined with books about human behavior and the mind offered glimpses into the world that Eleanor had dedicated her life to understanding. Her office, a tranquil sanctuary painted in calming shades of blue and gray, was ready for the day. A worn leather armchair beside a tasteful array of diplomas and certificates hinted at Eleanor's years of dedicated study and her passion for healing the troubled minds that sought her guidance.
