In the heart of a city that never sleeps, where the skyline was a jagged crown against the endless sky, stood the grand old Royce Hotel. Its opulent façade gazed impassively upon the bustling avenue below, its gilded doors a portal to another time, where whispers of the past wove seamlessly with the hum of the present. Inside, the lobby gleamed under crystal chandeliers, reflecting a thousand points of light onto the polished marble floor. 

Among the flurry of well-heeled guests and hurried staff, Daniel Everett, in his perfectly pressed burgundy uniform, embodied the hotel’s timeless elegance with a hint of youthful mischief twinkling in his eyes. As the head bellhop, Daniel was as much a fixture of the Royce as the aged grandfather clock that solemnly counted the beats of the bustling day. With every luggage cart he maneuvered through the lively hallways, he carried not just the belongings of the weary traveler but the hopes and secrets of those passing through this storied establishment. Today, however, a mysterious energy clung to the air, whispering of changes waiting just around the corner.
