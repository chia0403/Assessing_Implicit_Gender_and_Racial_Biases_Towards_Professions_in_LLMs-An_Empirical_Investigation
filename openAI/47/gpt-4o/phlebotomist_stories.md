In the early morning light, a gentle mist hugged the narrow streets of Crestwood, a quaint town nestled in a valley surrounded by lush, rolling hills. The town, with its cobblestone pathways and Victorian-era shops, seemed to belong to a time mostly forgotten. At the heart of Crestwood stood St. Elmira’s Hospital, a weathered but sturdy structure with ivy climbing its brick facade.

Inside the hospital’s softly-lit corridors, Evelyn Carter prepared for another day of work. As a seasoned phlebotomist, Evelyn had become a familiar face to both the staff and patients. Her calm demeanor and gentle touch were legendary, earning her a reputation for easing even the most anxious of patients.

Evelyn paused by a window near her station in the lab, watching as the sun began to break through the mist, casting long shadows across the town. The morning was a deceptively tranquil prelude to the bustling activity that would soon fill the hospital. With a deep breath and a slight smile, she turned away from the window, ready to embrace the day's challenges with the steadfast grace that had come to define her presence in the healing community of St. Elmira’s.
