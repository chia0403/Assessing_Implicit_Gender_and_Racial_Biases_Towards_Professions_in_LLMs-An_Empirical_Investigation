**Setting:** The bright fluorescent lights of “Treetop Grocers” flickered gently overhead, illuminating aisles stocked high with colorful packages and fresh produce. A soft hum of chatter from customers mingled with the occasional chime of the register as shoppers flowed in and out of the store like a well-oiled machine. Outside, autumn leaves danced in the crisp wind, their vibrant reds and oranges painting the sidewalk as the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the parking lot.

**Story Opening:** 

Samantha Mayfield leaned against the cool metal frame of her register, absentmindedly scanning a bag of organic apples as the familiar rhythm of her work lulled her into a comfortable routine. With a practiced smile, she greeted each customer, her thoughts drifting beyond the automatic responses she had honed over countless shifts. Today, however, her mind was a swirl of anticipation and anxiety; it was Halloween weekend, and excitement hummed in the air, thick as the scent of caramel apples from the bakery section.

As she started to ring up an elderly man’s groceries—milk, a loaf of bread, and a few candy bars—Samantha caught sight of a small boy wearing a homemade dragon costume with vibrant green scales. He stood mesmerized before an overflowing display of pumpkins, his eyes wide with wonder. Her heart warmed at the sight, a reminder of the magic that still existed in the world, even on the monotonous days spent behind the register. But as she handed the man his change, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something unusual was brewing beneath the surface of this ordinary afternoon. 

Just then, the store's door swung open with a jingle, and a chilling gust of wind swept through, rustling papers and sending a shiver down her spine. Samantha found herself glancing up, her curiosity piqued, her heart beginning to race—and that was when she saw him.
