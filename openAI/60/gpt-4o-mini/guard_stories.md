In the heart of the ancient city of Elmsford, where cobblestone streets twined like serpents through a maze of medieval architecture, the sun dipped low in the sky, casting a warm golden glow that clung to the stones like a memory. The scent of roasted chestnuts and freshly baked bread wafted through the air from the bustling market square, where townsfolk gathered in the late afternoon light, their laughter mingling with the distant notes of a street musician’s lute.

At the entrance of the grand castle that loomed over the city, standing tall and formidable, was a man clad in dark leather armor, his posture straight and vigilant. This was Reginald Thorne, an honor-bound guard of the Royal Guard of Elmsford. His broad shoulders bore the weight of duty, and his sharp green eyes scanned the horizon with a mixture of pride and wariness. A deep scar running along his jawline told tales of battles fought and challenges faced, though his heart remained steadfast to the kingdom he had served for nearly a decade.

As the last rays of sunlight faded, Reginald’s mind shifted into the solemn rhythms of the night. He could hear the distant echoes of the market slowly quieting as night creatures began their nightly serenade. He had heard whispers of unrest brewing among the neighboring countrysides, and tonight, he felt a chill in the air, as though the very wind carried secrets meant to be kept. With the weight of the castle's gates behind him, his thoughts turned inward. Was the tranquility of Elmsford merely a fragile façade, or was something darker lurking just beyond the horizon?
