In the shadow of the great Selwyn Mountains, where jagged peaks kissed the sky and wisps of cloud clung to their summits like wisps of forgotten dreams, lay the quiet village of Eldergrove. It was a place where time seemed to pause, wrapped in the embrace of nature’s grandeur. Mist curled around the moss-covered stones of old cottages, and the air was thick with the scent of pine and freshly tilled earth.

In the heart of this village, amidst the sound of chipping stone and rhythmic hammering, lived a man named Thaddeus Berenwald. Thaddeus was not just any stone cutter; he was a craftsman with an artistry that molded raw rock into forms of beauty, each stroke of his hammer whispering secrets of the earth itself. With a tall, lean frame and rough hands etched by years of toil, he commanded respect in Eldergrove, though he often preferred the company of the stones he worked rather than the prying eyes of neighbors.

His workshop, a weathered stone building dotted with shards of marble and granite, stood at the edge of a crystal-clear stream that wound its way through the village. Glimmering sunlight danced upon the water's surface, casting flickering reflections that seemed to pulse with life. Inside, the air was filled with the rhythmic sound of chisel against stone, harmonizing with the tranquil melody of the flowing stream.

Thaddeus had always felt a pull toward stone, as if they were not just inanimate objects, but vessels of history and memory. Every morning, he would tread the familiar path to his workshop, surrounded by the towering cliffs that had cradle him since childhood. Today was different, however; a feeling of restlessness tugged at him. As he picked up his tools, Thaddeus could not shake the sensation that something profound was about to unveil itself, buried deep within the rocks he so lovingly shaped. Little did he know, today’s tasks would intertwine his fate with an ancient power that lay forgotten in the very stones he carved.
