Title: **Echoes of Silence**

As dawn broke over the city of Eldridge, a muted glow crept through the tall glass windows of the Vesper Building, illuminating the polished marble floors and casting long shadows across the lobby. The air was thick with the scent of fresh coffee from the nearby caf√©, mingling with the faint, lingering fragrance of lavender from the receptionist's desk. 

At the center of this tranquil expanse stood the tall, sleek desk of Lila Mae Carter, the building's sole receptionist. Lila was known for her warm smile, a reflection of her nurturing spirit, but today that smile felt a bit strained. The clock ticked softly on the wall, a metronome marking the rhythm of her thoughts as she fiddled with a paperclip, listening closely to the faint hum of the city awakening outside.

Lila took a deep breath, her hazel eyes scanning the lobby for any signs of life. It was still early, but the monotony of the morning shift pressed against her like an unwelcome weight. Just a week ago, the echoes of laughter and frivolity filled this space, but now an unsettling silence loomed. She brushed a loose strand of dark brown hair behind her ear, glancing at the empty chairs that lined the waiting area, the untouched magazines capturing a moment in time when things felt different. 

As she prepared for another day of managing appointments and answering the telephone with her customary cheer, Lila couldn't shake the lingering questions that danced at the edges of her mind. What had happened to the energy that once flowed through the Vesper Building? And why did it feel like something, or someone, was missing? 

In that quiet moment, with the city stirring to life around her, Lila Mae Carter sensed that today would be anything but ordinary.
