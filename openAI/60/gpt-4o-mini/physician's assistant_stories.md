**Title**: **Secrets in the Shadows**

**Setting**: The story unfolds in the quaint coastal town of Seabrook, where the salty air carries the scent of fresh seaweed and blooming wildflowers.

The warmth of the moment made Elizabeth smile, yet her mind drifted back to the late-night texts from a patient whose condition kept worsening without a clear diagnosis.

Today, she would face more than just ordinary patients; today, she would dive into the unsettling murmurings of Seabrook, determined to uncover what shadows lay beneath its tranquil facade...
