The sun dipped low on the horizon, splattering the sky with hues of orange and purple as the vast plains of Kansas stretched endlessly beyond the windshield. Dust swirled in the warm evening air, and the hum of the engine filled the solitude of the night, a familiar comfort to Jacob Nathaniel Cole. Seated in the cab of his rig, a behemoth Freightliner named "The Iron Stallion," Jacob adjusted his baseball cap, the worn fabric a testament to his countless miles traveled across the open road.

The backroads were a second home to him, where the isolation cradled his thoughts and the rhythm of the tires against asphalt became a kind of lullaby. Each mile beneath the wheels carried memories of nights under the starlit sky and dawns that spilled golden light over sleepy towns. The freedom of the trucker’s life—chirping radios, the occasional camaraderie of diner patrons, and the gentle sway of the trailer behind him—was a stark contrast to the cacophony of the world he was often trying to escape.

With a last glance at the setting sun, Jacob turned up the radio. The voice of a country singer filled the space, a ballad that echoed the tales of love and loss he knew all too well. The road ahead was long, but for Jacob Nathaniel Cole, it was a journey not just of distance, but of self-discovery, each stop a chance to uncover the pieces of himself he often left behind in forgotten truck stops and the lines of endless highways.
