In the small coastal town of Seabridge, where the waves whispered secrets and the salty air carried tales of the ocean, a rickety radio tower stood sentinel atop a misty hillside. This tower, rusted and forgotten by time, was the lifeblood of the town's only radio station — WSBJ. 

On a rainy Monday morning, with dark clouds swirling above, a low hum of static filled the cramped confines of the station’s control room. Amongst the tangled wires and flickering screens sat Ethan Jacob Hartley, a twenty-eight-year-old radio technician with an unruly mop of dark hair and a penchant for vintage rock. His keen blue eyes, often hidden behind thick-rimmed glasses, flitted between gauges and knobs as he meticulously tuned the equipment, hoping to find clarity amidst the static.

Ethan had inherited his passion for radio from his late father, a station manager known for his legendary on-air voice and his commitment to the community. From a young age, Ethan had been captivated by the idea that waves could carry messages across vast distances. Now, as he adjusted the frequency of WSBJ, he felt a connection to a past that lingered in the shadows of the studio, infused with memories of his father’s laughter mixing with the sound of crackling vinyl.

As thunder rumbled in the distance, and the rain intensified, Ethan’s focus sharpened. He was determined to keep the station alive, even if it meant waging battle against the storm outside. That morning, however, the air was charged with more than just electricity; it crackled with a sense of the unknown, as if the universe itself was gearing up to reveal a long-buried secret. Little did Ethan know that his day would unravel in ways he could never have anticipated, leading him down a path that blended the past with the present, drawing upon the very fabric of radio waves to bridge the two.
