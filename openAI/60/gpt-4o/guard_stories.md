In the heart of the sprawling, mist-laden forest known as Elderglen, where sunbeams filtered through a verdant canopy to dance upon the forest floor, stood the formidable Bastion Keep. This ancient stronghold, built of timeworn stone and crowned with imposing battlements, served as a sentinel outpost between the mystical woods and the kingdoms beyond. Here, in the shadow of age-old towers that whispered the tales of yore, stood Marcus Thane, a stalwart guardian whose sworn duty was the protection of the realm.

Marcus, clad in the weathered armor of his station, bore the insignia of the Silver Wolf, a mark that denoted both courage and wisdom—qualities that Marcus embodied as he patrolled the ramparts each day. His watchful eyes, keen and perceptive, scanned the treeline for any signs of disturbance, though in truth, he found equal solace in the serene rustle of leaves and the distant call of mysterious woodland creatures.

It was just another ordinary dawn when Marcus began his rounds, the autumn air crisp and invigorating, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and aromatic pine. Yet, beneath the dome of the awakening sky, something unusual lingered in the air—a subtle change, like the anticipation of a story waiting to unfold. And it was on this day, as the sun continued its climb, that Marcus Thane would find his life irrevocably altered in ways he never imagined, setting in motion events that would test his mettle and redefine his destiny.
