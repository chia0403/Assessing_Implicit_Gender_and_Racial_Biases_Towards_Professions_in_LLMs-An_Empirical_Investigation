In the small, windswept town of Maple Hollow, where the whispers of the forest mingled with the salt-kissed breeze from the nearby coast, Aaron Grant tightened his grip on the ladder. The morning sun cast a dappled light through the thick canopy of trees, painting patches of gold onto the rooftops he knew so well. As he climbed to the peak of the Thompson’s aging Victorian house, the familiar scent of pine mingled with the earthy aroma of damp wood, reminding him of the countless roofs he had mended in this sleepy corner of Maine.

The autumn air was cool and crisp, a sure sign that winter was advancing steadily, and with it, the demand for Aaron's expertise. Born and raised in Maple Hollow, Aaron had found a certain poetry in roofing—a blend of physical labor and craftsmanship that aligned perfectly with his meticulous nature and love for both the ground below and the sky above. From this height, he had a panoramic view of the town, its quaint houses nestled together like old friends, surrounded by the vibrant hues of fall. This was Aaron’s domain, a place where he found solace above the chaos of the world, with only the caw of distant gulls and the soft rustle of leaves for company.

Today, as he prepared to replace the missing shingles and reinforce the weathered beams, Aaron felt a sense of contentment. This town, with its intertwining stories and hidden mysteries, had been his lifelong muse. Little did he know that the day ahead would bring a discovery that might just change everything he thought he knew about Maple Hollow.
