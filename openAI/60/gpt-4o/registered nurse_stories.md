On a crisp autumn morning in the bustling city of Portland, Oregon, the sunlight filtered softly through the golden leaves that clung to the ancient oaks lining the streets. The air carried a hint of the sea, mingling with the earthy aroma of a nearby café brewing its first pot of the day. As the city awakened, life inside St. Agnes Hospital had already been in motion for hours.

Natalie Richardson, a dedicated registered nurse, paused for a brief moment on the steps of the hospital, her eyes momentarily alighting on the distant silhouette of Mount Hood etched against the dawn sky. Her coffee cup steamed gently in her hand, an ephemeral warmth combating the chill in the air. St. Agnes, a towering testament to decades of relentless care and tireless compassion, seemed to hum with life around her, its glass doors sliding open and closed with the rhythm of a beating heart.

Inside, the hospital buzzed quietly, a symphony of beeping machines and whispered conversations. It was a world of its own, filled with stories of hope and heartache. As Natalie entered the bustling halls, she felt the familiar comfort of her white scrubs blending into the sea of activity. Her heart swelled with a sense of purpose—a reassuring constant amid the uncertainty of the days to come. Today, like every day, she was ready to navigate the intricate mosaic of humanity, tending to the healing journeys unfolding around her.
