In the heart of the bustling city of New Ardent, where glass skyscrapers clamored for space amidst the gloomy clouds, there stood an unassuming, ivy-clad building that housed the offices of Brecken and Co., a modest accounting firm. It was here, on the third floor, tucked away in a corner office, that Martin James Hollister spent his days. The space was dimly lit, the windows filtered by sheer curtains that danced with each gust of wind, the air carrying the faint aroma of fresh ink and newly opened stationery.

Martin was a man of meticulous habits, his routine as precise as the numbers he meticulously balanced day in and day out. Each morning, he arrived at the office promptly at 7:45 a.m., his travel mug filled with barely sweetened black coffee in hand, and his leather satchel slung over one shoulder, filled with neatly organized ledgers and files. He thrived in the structured symphony of debits and credits, finding solace in the predictability of his spreadsheets.

Yet, as the seasons shifted from the muggy grip of summer to the crisp embrace of autumn, there was something stirring within Martin Hollister—an almost imperceptible itch, a whispering curiosity that even the most orderly of columns couldn’t suppress. It was a yearning for something beyond the rows and columns, something waiting to be discovered amidst the chaos of life outside the confines of his neatly arranged world.
