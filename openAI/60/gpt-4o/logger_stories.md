In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where towering firs and ancient cedars brushed the sky with their verdant fingers, the morning fog intertwined with the forest in an intimate dance. Sunlight pierced through the mist in slender beams, casting a dainty glow upon the moss-laden undergrowth. The air was imbued with the fresh scent of pine and earth, a fragrance both ancient and invigorating.

Eliot Thorne, a rugged logger with the sun-weathered face of a man seasoned by countless days in the wild, stood amidst this arboreal cathedral, listening to the forest’s symphony. The faraway murmur of a stream mingled with the rhythmic sighs of the trees, harmonizing with the sharp chirps of songbirds heralding the dawn. Eliot adjusted his weathered cap, his eyes taking in the familiar sights with reverence tempered by a lifetime of labor.

Years of work had etched strength into Eliot's sinewy frame, but it was the ceaseless hum of chainsaws and the thunderous fall of timber that marked his days, even in dreams. Today was different, though. Today, as he paused before the proudest of Douglas firs, he contemplated stories left untold. Stories written in the rings of a tree's heart, mirroring the many seasons they had both endured.

Here in the wilds, at the edge of civilization, the forest was both his escape and his battleground. As Eliot prepared for another day—a series of measured cuts, the peeling of bark, the ritual heft of saw and blade—he couldn't shake the feeling that something in the forest had changed. The trees spoke of an unrest, a whispering unease that settled like a shadow against the untouched beauty.
