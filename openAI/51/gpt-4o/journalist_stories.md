In the dim light of the early morning, the rain-slicked streets of Everton gleamed like rivers of obsidian, reflecting the ghostly glow of lamp posts. Eleanor Moretti stood on the curb outside her apartment building, the damp air curling her dark curls into coils that framed her face. She drew the collar of her trench coat tighter against the biting chill and balanced a steaming cup of coffee precariously atop a stack of dog-eared notebooks. The urban symphony of distant honking horns and the rhythmic clatter of a passing train contributed to a familiar cacophony that she found oddly comforting.

Eleanor was no stranger to mornings like this. As an investigative journalist for The Daily Chronicle, she thrived on the promise of a new story hidden beneath the mundane veneer of city life. Today, however, there was an extra layer of anticipation that stirred her senses. A confidential tip had arrived the night before, slipped under her door with an urgency she could almost feel, hinting at a brewing scandal within the upper echelons of the city’s political sphere.

Her destination was the heart of Everton’s bustling downtown, where sleek skyscrapers pierced the sky and the pulse of the city beat strongest. As Eleanor maneuvered through the streets, splashing through puddles and dodging speeding taxis, she could almost taste the story on the tip of her tongue—a familiar sensation that spurred her onward with purpose and determination.
