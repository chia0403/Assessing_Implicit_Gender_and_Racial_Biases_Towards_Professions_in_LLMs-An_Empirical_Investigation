Title: **"Highway Crossroads"**

The morning sun crested over the jagged peaks of the Rockies, casting golden rays across the endless stretch of asphalt known as Interstate 70. The engine of a well-worn Peterbilt roared to life, blending seamlessly into the symphony of humming tires and chirping birds. Sitting comfortably in the driver's seat was Jackson "Jax" McCallister, a seasoned trucker with salt-and-pepper hair and sharp blue eyes that seemed to glean stories from every mile of open road.

Jax's rig, affectionately named "Big Red," was more than just a truck; it was a second home. Its cherry-red exterior glistened in the dawn light, a bright contrast to the rugged mountainous backdrop. Inside, the cabin was a medley of personal touches — a faded Polaroid of his family clipped to the visor, a lucky coin taped to the dash, and an aging radio that had been his companion through countless journeys.

Today, the air was crisp and carried a hint of pine, promising the first signs of autumn. Jax was en route to Denver with a trailer full of fresh produce from the orchards of Washington. The road ahead was flanked by towering evergreens and somehow felt like it was perched on the edge of the world, as if leading towards something yet undiscovered.

As Big Red rumbled along the highway, Jax found solace in the monotony, the rhythmic rise and fall of the mountain road offering comfort in its predictability. But he knew well enough that the road was much like life — always changing, offering both challenge and chance with each turn and crossroads. And today, the journey seemed different, like an omen lingering on the horizon, whispering of encounters that might shift the very ground beneath him.
