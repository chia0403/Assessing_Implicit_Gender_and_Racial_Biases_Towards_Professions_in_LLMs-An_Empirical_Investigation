The sun dipped low over the quiet coastal town of Seabreeze, casting long shadows across the white sand beach. The rhythmic sound of waves lapping against the shore provided a calming backdrop to the busy streets, where the scent of salt and freshly grilled seafood filled the air. Nestled between a cozy café and a vibrant beachwear shop stood Willow Physical Therapy, a quaint yet modern facility that mirrored the warm spirit of its surroundings. 

Inside, bright walls adorned with motivational quotes and vibrant photographs of local athletes welcomed patients as they stepped through the door. The air buzzed with a gentle energy, an inviting space for healing and recovery. Behind the reception desk, thirty-two-year-old Tara Lynn Emerson was meticulously organizing her day’s appointments. With chestnut hair tied back in a practical bun and a pair of bright blue scrubs, Tara embodied both professionalism and compassion. 

Lively and determined, Tara was known in Seabreeze not only for her keen expertise in rehabilitation but also for her ability to connect with her patients on a personal level. Each treatment session was a testament to her belief that healing went beyond the physical; it was about nurturing the spirit and restoring confidence. Today, however, as Tara prepared for a busy afternoon, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was about to change the course of her life forever.
