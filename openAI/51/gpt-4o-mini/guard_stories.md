The sun dipped low in the sky, painting the horizon with hues of crimson and gold as it set behind the imposing granite walls of Eldermoor Castle. The air was crisp and laced with the faint scent of pine, mingling with the lingering aroma of the day’s feasting. Lively music and laughter echoed from the castle’s great hall, where nobles and dignitaries gathered to celebrate the annals of the kingdom, but outside, a different world thrived under the twilight.

Standing sentinel at the castle's grand gates was Guard Thaddeus Aelric, a figure carved from the shadows of duty. His uniform, a deep forest green tunic adorned with the order’s silver crest, bristled with an array of weaponry, each piece telling tales of encounters and moments that forged his resolve. Thaddeus’s sharp green eyes scanned the surrounding woodland, every rustle drawing his attention, reminding him that the safety of Eldermoor rested on his vigilant shoulders.

As darkness settled in, the torches lining the stone pathway flickered to life, casting long shadows that danced upon the cobblestones. The distant howl of a wolf punctuated the silence, an ominous reminder of the threats that lurked beyond the castle’s protective walls. It was on this fateful evening, while bathed in the glow of fading light and the promise of adventure, that Thaddeus Aelric would find himself pulled from the routine of watchfulness and thrust into a mystery that would test his courage and allegiance to the kingdom he loved.
