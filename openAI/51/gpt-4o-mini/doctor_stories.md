In the heart of Manhattan, where the skyscrapers pierced the clouds and the streets pulsed with an incessant rhythm, there nestled an old, ivy-clad hospital named St. Elizabeth’s. It was here, amidst the sterile white walls and the echoing footsteps of nurses, that Dr. Evelyn Margaret Sinclair found her purpose. 

The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above her as she stood in the bustling emergency room, her scrubs a deep shade of navy blue. The chaotic scenery blended together: the distant wail of sirens, the murmurs of anxious families, and the cadence of footsteps rushing to and fro. Yet, in the midst of it all, Evelyn's emerald-green eyes sparkled with determination. A seasoned physician specializing in trauma surgery, she had weathered hurricanes of medical crises over her decade-long career, but nothing could prepare her for what lay ahead that fateful autumn evening.

It was turning into a typical October night, the air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and impending rain. Outside, the skies were darkening, but inside St. Elizabeth’s, the emergency room was ablaze with activity, each moment a life hanging in the balance. Evelyn adjusted her glasses, her mind racing through the patients she had just seen, her heart beating with the weight of responsibility. Little did she know, tonight would be a test—of her skills, her resolve, and the very fabric of her humanity. 

As the clock ticked closer to midnight, a loud crash echoed from the streets below, followed by the shrieks of sirens piercing the night, signaling the arrival of a mass casualty incident that would bring the chaos to a whole new level.
