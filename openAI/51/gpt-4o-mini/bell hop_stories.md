In the heart of the bustling city of Delmare, nestled between towering skyscrapers and glittering storefronts, the Marigold Hotel stood as a testament to a bygone era of elegance. Its ornate façade, adorned with golden filigree and blossoming window boxes, beckoned to weary travelers seeking refuge in its opulent embrace. The scent of rich coffee and fresh pastries wafted through the air, mingling with the distant sound of laughter and clinking glasses from the hotel’s grand lobby bar.

Within this timeless sanctuary, a young bellhop named Oliver Finch maneuvered through the bustling lobby with practiced ease. Clad in a crisp navy uniform with brass buttons that gleamed under the warm chandeliers, Oliver's demeanor radiated a blend of enthusiasm and earnestness. He was known for his bright smile and the way he seemed to effortlessly juggle the needs of guests, from heavy luggage to late-night requests for extra pillows.

On this particular Wednesday afternoon, the late autumn sun cast a golden hue across the lobby, illuminating the intricate marble floor. Oliver stood by the front desk, his hands carefully folding a luggage cart while listening intently to the soft hum of conversations around him. With dreams of one day exploring distant places and unraveling the mysteries of the world, he often daydreamed about the lives of the guests who passed through the hotel. Little did he know that today would be different, a day that would change the course of his own story forever.
