In the quaint village of Elderglen, where cobblestone streets wound like forgotten thoughts and ivy-clad cottages whispered tales of yore, a gentle aroma of freshly baked bread filled the morning air. At the heart of the village stood "Thyme & Flour," a cozy bakery nestled between a bustling apothecary and a sleepy bookshop. Inside, the warmth from the oven melded with the scent of cinnamon and vanilla, wrapping around patrons like an inviting hug.

Behind the worn oak counter, flitting between the humming ovens and fragrant display shelves, was Eleanor Dunbridge—known to all as the finest baker in Elderglen. Her auburn hair, usually tied back with a fading green ribbon, caught the early sunlight streaming through the large bay windows, giving her an ethereal glow. Eleanor, whose hands seemed to dance as they kneaded, shaped, and glazed, was known for her sweet pastries and savory treats that brought the village to life each day.

Eleanor had inherited this little slice of heaven from her grandmother, and she infused it with both tradition and a hint of her whimsical imagination. Every morning, as the sky transitioned from the inky night to soft rose, Eleanor would unlock the bakery’s door, ushering a bit of magic into the world with each open day. Today promised to be no different, or so it seemed—though the peculiar stranger arriving with the next rustle of the bell would soon suggest otherwise.
