Title: *Above the Rolling Clouds*

In the stillness of the pre-dawn hour, as the world lay wrapped in the gentle embrace of slumber, the first light of day began to unfurl tendrils of soft violet across the indigo sky. Standing beside the tarmac at Shasta Regional Airport, Captain Amelia "Millie" Hawthorne absorbed the tranquil scene. Wisps of fog clung stubbornly to the earth like slumbering phantoms reluctant to fade with the coming dawn. The chill in the air nipped at her cheeks, hinting at the crisp promise of autumn. Behind her, a whispering breeze carried the scent of dew-drenched grass and distant pines.

Amelia, known affectionately by her colleagues and friends as Millie, was in her element; the quiet anticipation of a new journey was a symphony she had come to cherish. Her plane, a sleek Cessna 208 Caravan, stood ready, a familiar companion silhouetted against the burgeoning dawn. Metallic surfaces glistening with condensation caught the faintest glimmers of sunlight, promising adventure above the rolling clouds.

The rhythmic hum of engines powering up punctuated the atmosphere, a welcome sound in the otherwise serene solitude. Millie ran a hand through her short auburn hair, securing it beneath her well-worn cap, and reached for her logbook. Her eyes gleamed with a mix of determination and contentment, reflecting an azure shade not unlike the morning sky.

Captain Millie Hawthorne was more than a pilot—she was an artist of the air, painting new horizons with each flight path. The skies above Shasta were hers to explore, a vast, boundless gallery awaiting her touch. Today’s journey was a familiar route up the Pacific Coast, but the beauty of such trips lay in their unpredictability and the subtle shift of perspective they offered every single time. 

Stepping across the tarmac, she thought of the lives she would touch today, passengers eager for new beginnings or the comforting embrace of coming home. Each flight was a thread in an intricate tapestry of stories, and Millie cherished her role as both guide and guardian in this airborne narrative.
