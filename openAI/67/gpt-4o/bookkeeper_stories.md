In the heart of the bustling city of Eldridge, where towering skyscrapers brushed the clouds and the constant hum of life never waned, lay a small enclave that time had seemingly overlooked. Tucked away on a narrow cobblestone street, lined with gas lamps that flickered to life at dusk, was the quaint office of Whittaker & Sons, Accountants Extraordinaire. It was here, nestled amidst ledgers, ink pots, and the comforting scent of aged parchment, that Beatrice Lilac Hartley, a bookkeeper of prodigious skill, plied her trade.

Beatrice, or Bea as she was known to her colleagues, had a talent for numbers that was rivaled only by her passion for the written word. Her desk, neatly arranged with columns of papers and abacuses gleaming with precision, sat by a window that offered a view of the ever-changing tapestry of city life outside. The office itself was a relic from the early 20th century—a world of plush burgundy drapes, oak-panelled walls, and leather armchairs that creaked with the accumulation of stories told and secrets kept. In this sanctuary amid the modern chaos, Bea unraveled the mysteries of finance with meticulous care, finding solace in the predictable dance of debits and credits.

Yet, beneath her calm exterior, Beatrice harbored dreams that stretched beyond the confines of balance sheets and quarterly reports. Her heart soared on wings of adventure penned by Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson, whose volumes lined the shelves just within reach. Here, the safekeeping of numbers was both her livelihood and her refuge—a vocation that allowed her to drift into realms uncharted as she reconciled accounts, her imagination soaring even as her fingers worked with methodical precision across the calculator's keys.
