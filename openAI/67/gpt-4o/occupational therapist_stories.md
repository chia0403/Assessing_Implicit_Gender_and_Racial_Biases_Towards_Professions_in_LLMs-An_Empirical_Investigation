In the quiet coastal town of Seabrook, where the salt-kissed breeze danced through the streets and the rhythmic hum of the ocean served as a constant backdrop, Emma Carlisle began her day in the usual manner. With a gentle hum, she maneuvered her way through the narrow aisles of the Cozy Corner Café, balancing a steaming cup of chamomile tea in one hand and her well-worn leather bag in the other. The faint scent of fresh cinnamon rolls mingled with the bracing scent of the sea air, creating an oddly comforting aroma that Emma had come to associate with home.

Emma was an occupational therapist at Horizon Harbour Rehabilitation Center, a modest but reputable facility nestled on the outskirts of town. As she sipped her tea, she went over her notes for the day, her focus unwavering despite the bustling morning rush around her. Her first appointment was with Mr. Donovan, a retired fisherman who had suffered a stroke several months prior. Emma had been working tirelessly to help him regain his independence, and today they were to try a new exercise devised to strengthen his grip.

Emma's approach to therapy was as warm and inviting as her surroundings, much like the town that embraced her. She found solace in the knowledge that her work in Seabrook, small as it seemed, could bring about monumental changes in her patients' lives. As the morning sunlight began to filter through the café's large windows, painting the wooden floors with golden hues, Emma gathered her things and headed out, ready to face another day of challenges and triumphs along the sunlit, salty shores of Seabrook.
