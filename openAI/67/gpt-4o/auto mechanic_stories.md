In the small, rusty town of Riverton, where the morning fog clung to the ground like a stubborn blanket, Samuel "Sam" McNeely wiped the oil from his hands with a rag that had seen better days. The soft hum of engines and the rhythmic clinking of tools were a comforting symphony in McNeely's Auto Repair, a garage tucked neatly between the aging brick facades of a forgotten Main Street. The sign outside, painted by Sam's own father decades ago, swung gently in the crisp autumn air.

Sam, a tall man with a worn baseball cap permanently perched on his head, scanned the garage with eyes that seemed to carry the weight of far more years than he had lived. He was a man who could tell a car's ailment just by hearing it pull into the gravel driveway, which many said was a talent akin to magic. His reputation as a skilled mechanic was known throughout Riverton, yet it was his kindness and honesty that had truly earned him the respect of the townsfolk.

The walls of the garage were lined with tools meticulously organized, each with a story etched in the nicks and scratches they bore. Old license plates and faded photographs of cars from the days when tailfins were the height of automotive fashion decorated the space, whispering tales of bygone eras to anyone who cared to listen. In one corner, a radio softly crooned classic rock, the tunes mingling with the scent of oil and gasoline – a perfume that Sam found oddly reassuring.

As the sun struggled to break through the overcast sky, casting a pale glow over the town, Sam paused to sip his morning coffee. It was the simple pleasures like this that made the early hours of the day his favorite — a moment of calm before the bustle of engines and stories of those passing through with tales of distant places and long journeys past. Today, however, would bring with it a new story, one that Sam could not yet foresee, one that would push him beyond the safe confines of his garage into something far more uncertain.
