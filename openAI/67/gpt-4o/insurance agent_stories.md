On a damp November morning when the fog clung to the streets like a shroud, Elliott Morrison guided his compact sedan through the winding roads of Ashgrove, a small town nestled between the rolling hills and dense forests of the New England countryside. Ashgrove had always seemed to live in a perpetual state of autumn, where the trees burst into flames of orange and red, and the air carried a crispness that hinted at the first frost.

Elliott, an insurance agent with Midway Assurance, had spent the greater part of his decade-long career navigating the ins and outs of policies and premiums, a world bound by numbers and fine print. Despite the familiar tedium of his job, he found an unexpected sense of comfort in the predictability of it all; the routine of shuffling from one client's quaint home to the next, their stone fireplaces crackling with warmth, was an unchanging constant in his life.

That morning, as he pulled up to an old Victorian with gables that seemed to frown under the weight of the ages, Elliott felt a peculiar twinge of anticipation. The address belonged to one Mrs. Agnes Chandler, a new client whose reputation around town preceded her like a shadow. It was said that her family had lived in Ashgrove for generations, their lineage intertwined with tales of old secrets and whispered rumors. Elliott had never believed much in ghost stories, but something about the looming house and the swirling mist spoke of mystery, promising that this day might be different from the rest.
