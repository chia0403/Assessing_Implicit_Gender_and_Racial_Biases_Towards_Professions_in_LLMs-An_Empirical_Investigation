In the heart of Seattle, where the drizzle kissed the cobblestone streets before the sun’s rays could fully awaken the city, stood a small, charming office tucked between a bustling café and an artisanal bookstore. Within its walls, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of travel brochures, creating an inviting haven for dreamers and explorers alike. This was the home of Wanderlust Bound, a quaint travel agency where maps covered the walls like a patchwork quilt of the world.

Amelia Novak, with her copper hair twisted into a loose braid and a penchant for vibrant scarves, was the orchestrator of adventures, the dream weaver of travel plans. Her desk, a curated chaos of glossy brochures and half-full coffee cups, was always adorned with a new postcard from clients who had sent their thanks from distant shores. The morning light filtering through the large window behind her bathed the room in a warm glow, reflecting off trinkets from every corner of the globe—souvenirs from places she had touched in spirit, if not always in person.

For Amelia, every trip she planned was a mosaic puzzle, each one unique and rich with potential, where the only limits were the edges of the map. To her, the world was vast and varied, yet intimately accessible with the right itinerary and a little imagination. As the clock in the hallway chimed nine o'clock, the shop bell trilled softly, signaling the arrival of a new day and new stories waiting to be crafted.
