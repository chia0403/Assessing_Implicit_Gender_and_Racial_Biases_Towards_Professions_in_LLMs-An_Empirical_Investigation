On a quiet, mist-laden morning in the heart of Midtown, the sun fought a losing battle against a sea of gray clouds. The city was still in its slumber, save for the distant rumble of delivery trucks and the occasional clatter of a subway train beneath the streets. This was the time when Arthur J. Pennington, the steadfast janitor of the old Eastwood Building, began his day.

The Eastwood Building, once a shining beacon of mid-century architecture, now stood as a relic from a bygone era. Its façade, adorned with ornate stone carvings and cracked cornices, was a testament to the past glamour of the city's golden age. Inside, its grand lobby, with marble floors and tarnished chandeliers, echoed with whispers of long-forgotten conversations. It was a place that still held on to its dignity, and Arthur took pride in preserving its legacy.

Every morning, his key ring jangling with the authority of access, Arthur would unlock the heavy wooden doors and step into the building's embrace. The scent of floor polish mingled with the mustiness of old records, a fragrance as familiar to him as the worn cloth of his uniform. Armed with his mop and broom, Arthur began his solemn ritual, tending to the vacant hallways and silent office suites with the diligence of a caretaker watching over a cherished heirloom.

Arthur's presence in the Eastwood Building was as constant as time itself, a quiet figure navigating its labyrinthine corridors. Despite his unassuming role, he held an intimate knowledge of the building's quirks and secrets—details lost to those who hurried past him in suits and high heels, oblivious to the stories contained within its walls.
