The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the endless ribbon of asphalt that stretched across the desert landscape. The air was thick with the scent of sagebrush and the distant cry of a lone coyote, creating a symphony of solitude that was both comforting and eerie. In the driver's seat of his faithful eighteen-wheeler, the "Silver Comet," sat Walter J. Harding, a trucker whose life was etched along the highways and byways of the American West.

Walter, with a weathered face that carried the stories of countless miles, adjusted his cap and glanced at the dashboard clock. It was nearly six in the evening, the time when shadows stretched their longest, and the road seemed to whisper secrets only he could hear. The journey ahead was long, leading him through a forgotten route of Route 66, past ghost towns where time stood still and memories lingered like dust in the air.

His destination was Alamogordo, New Mexico, a town known for its skies and secrets. But for now, his immediate focus was the two-lane highway winding through a landscape at once desolate and beautiful, where the mountains rose like ancient sentinels keeping watch over the barren earth. Walter eased the truck into a gentle curve, the hum of its engine a steady companion under the vast, open sky.
