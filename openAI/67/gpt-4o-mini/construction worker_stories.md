In the heart of Riverton, a city that pulsated with development and ambition, the sun rose briskly over the horizon, casting a warm glow on the skeletons of buildings that reached for the sky. The air was thick with the scent of wet concrete and the distant hum of heavy machinery. Nestled between the growl of generators and the rhythmic clanging of steel, the sound of laughter erupted from a group of construction workers taking a break, their camaraderie brightening the gritty landscape.

Among them, Caleb Michaelson stood out not just for his towering height and broad shoulders, but for the easy way he blended strength and kindness. At thirty-two, he had spent over a decade working on construction sites, his hands calloused and sun-kissed—a testament to years of hard labor. Today, he leaned on a half-finished wall, wiping sweat from his brow with a dirt-streaked forearm, eyes sparkling with determination as he surveyed the ambitious project that would soon rise before him: Riverton Tower, a shining beacon of the city’s future.

Yet, as Caleb glanced over the bustling site, something nagged at the back of his mind. The familiar rhythm of progress felt like a comforting heartbeat, but beneath it lay an undercurrent of tension. A rumor had circulated among the workers—there were corners being cut, safety measures overlooked. Caleb knew the stakes all too well; it wasn’t just about erecting buildings but about the lives that relied on them. A flicker of doubt crossed his face, but he pushed it aside, focusing on the moment. After all, there was work to be done, and he had a job to do.
