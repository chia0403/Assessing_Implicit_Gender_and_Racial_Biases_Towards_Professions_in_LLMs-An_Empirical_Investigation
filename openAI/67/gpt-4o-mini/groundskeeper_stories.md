Beneath the sprawling boughs of ancient oaks that whispered secrets to the wind, the estate of Ashgrove Manor stood like a guardian of the past. Its weathered stone walls, cloaked in ivy, told tales of grandeur and decay, a majestic relic nestled deep within the heart of the English countryside. The sun, dipping low in the sky, cast long shadows across the vibrant gardens, where rosebushes blazed with the last bursts of summer blooms, and ivy-clad trellises wound upward toward treetops that seemed to scrape the sky.

At the heart of this verdant expanse was Samuel Thorne, the groundskeeper. His hands, calloused and strong from years of tending to the land, dug deep into the earth, coaxing life from the soil with each careful stroke of his spade. Samuel was a man of few words, his quiet demeanor only occasionally broken by the lyrical hum of the birds that danced in the trees above. At seventy-three, he was a fixture of the estate, having spent nearly a lifetime mastering the rhythms of nature that unfolded within its confines.

But this evening was different. As the last light dimmed and a chill kissed the air, Samuel paused, wiping the sweat from his brow. A faint rustling caught his attention from the thick hedgerow bordering the garden—a sound that resonated not just with the rustling leaves but also with something deep and troubling within him. He sensed a shift in the air, a disturbance that felt out of place among the familiar scents of damp earth and blooming flowers—a harbinger of change that stirred the edges of his quiet life. With curiosity piqued and a heart full of questions, Samuel set his spade aside, descending the path to investigate the source of the commotion, unaware that this evening would unravel the very fabric of Ashgrove Manor’s history.
