**Title: The Secrets of the Grand Marigold Hotel**

**Setting:**

The Grand Marigold Hotel stood majestically at the corner of Elm and Vine, a gilded relic of the roaring twenties, its ornate façade adorned with delicate filigree and large bay windows that reflected the ever-busy streets of downtown. Inside, crystal chandeliers dangled like stars from the high ceilings, casting warm golden light on the polished marble floors below. Each corner of the lobby held echoes of laughter and whispers from guests who floated through in designer suits and elegant gowns, carrying with them an air of mystery and decorum. The gentle clinking of fine china from the café and the soft strains of a jazz band filled the air, creating a symphony of sounds that swirled around the glittering space.

**Opening:**

With a small brass bell in hand, Douglas Sebastian Prior adjusted his crisp, navy-blue uniform jacket and took a deep breath. As the newest bellhop at the Grand Marigold, he had been given a singular task: to welcome the vibrant stream of guests by carrying not just their luggage but the weight of their secrets hidden underneath layers of silk and wool. Douglas was a wiry young man of twenty-two with a mop of messy dark curls and sharp green eyes that sparkled with curiosity. He stood readily by the gilded door, his polished shoes reflecting the bobbing lights above.

Today's guests included everyone from high-society matriarchs to artists and the occasional dignitary, and each arrival tugged at Douglas's imagination and hinted at stories begging to unfold. The lobby bustled with life, and he could already feel the thrill of the unknown wafting around him. Little did he know, that in the coming days, his role as a bellhop would evolve into something far more complex, as the hotel began to reveal its hidden tales—perhaps one that would lead him down a path toward his own destiny, intertwined with those who walked through the Grand Marigold's grand doors.
