Title: *Under Blue Skies*

Setting: The quaint town of Willow Creek, known for its charming Victorian homes and tree-lined streets, nestled between rolling hills and a glimmering river. The sun rises early, painting the rooftops gold and casting long shadows over the cobblestone walkways. The scent of fresh-cut grass fills the air, blending with the faint, sweet aroma of blooming wildflowers that adorn the gardens in front of each house. The sound of hammers and nails resonates as rooftops get renewed, harmonizing with the distant laughter of children playing outside.

Opening:

As the sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow across the rooftops of Willow Creek, Benjamin Thomas Carpenter adjusted his tool belt and surveyed the array of shingles sprawled before him. With a practiced eye, he made quick calculations, ensuring he had everything he needed for the day’s work. Benjamin, a sturdy man in his thirties with a sun-kissed complexion and an ever-present grin, had spent the better part of a decade atop these very roofs, bringing new life to aging homes.

Today, he was tackling the roof of the Thompson residence, a sprawling Victorian house with lace-like trim and a turret that spiraled toward the sky. Benjamin had climbed many roofs in his lifetime, each one holding a story, a memory, and a little piece of someone’s life. He carefully maneuvered a ladder into place, allowing his mind to wander as he ascended. With each step, he breathed in the fresh morning air, feeling a sense of purpose wash over him. 

It was just another day of work, but as Benjamin reached the summit, the world below seemed to fade away, leaving only him and the endless sky above. He took a moment to savor the view—the vibrant green of the town below, the patchwork of fields bordering the river, and the way the sun danced on the water’s surface. This was where he belonged, amidst the shingles and beams, creating safe havens for families to find solace in their homes.

But as the day progressed, Benjamin sensed an unusual energy in the air, something lingering just beneath the surface. Perhaps it was the thrill of a new project ahead or the promise of unexpected encounters. Little did he know, this day would be anything but ordinary, guiding him towards a destiny he had never dared to dream.
