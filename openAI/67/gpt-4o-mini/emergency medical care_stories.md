Title: **Echoes in the Night**

Setting: The small coastal town of Havenridge lay shrouded in a thick fog, the salty breeze swirling through the narrow streets, carrying with it the faint sounds of the waves crashing against the rocky shoreline. Once a cheerful haven filled with laughter and light, it now bore the weight of a restless silence, broken only by the distant wailing of sirens that seemed to echo endlessly into the night. Beneath the dim glow of streetlights, shadows danced, and the air was thick with unspoken fears and secrets waiting to be unearthed.

Opening: In the heart of this quiet town, where life teetered on the edge of the extraordinary and the mundane, Kelly Marie Andersson stood by the ambulance, her heart pounding in rhythm to the pulsating lights flashing behind her. As a dedicated emergency medical technician, she was the first line of defense amidst the chaos, the one who navigated the nightmare of each call with a calm and steady hand. Tonight, however, the air was charged with a different energy; a suspicious fire had erupted at the old lighthouse, and she was racing against time to reach the remnant of those trapped inside.

With her dark ponytail swaying and her uniform pressed against her body in the cool breeze, Kelly’s mind raced with the possibilities of what lay ahead—injuries, fear, confusion. She focused her thoughts, envisioning the steps she would need to take, the lives she would need to save. But as she turned her gaze toward the flickering flames consuming the lighthouse, a nagging feeling tugged at the edges of her intuition. Something didn’t sit right. There was more to this fire than met the eye, and as the sirens blared in the distance, Kelly whispered a silent promise to uncover the truth lurking within the shadows.
