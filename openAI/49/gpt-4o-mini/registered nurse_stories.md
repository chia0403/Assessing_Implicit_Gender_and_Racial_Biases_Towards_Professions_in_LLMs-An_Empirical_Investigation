**Title: Beneath the Lights**

**Setting:** 

The neon-lit streets of New Orleans buzzed with a vibrant energy that was both intoxicating and overwhelming. The air was thick with the scent of magnolias and creole spices, as jazz music floated through the narrow alleys, intertwining with the laughter of tourists and the rhythmic tap of street performers. Amidst the carnival atmosphere, there was a building that stood formidable yet unadorned, a stark contrast to the festive chaos outside. The New Orleans General Hospital, with its weathered brick fa√ßade, loomed over the bustling streets, a sanctuary and a battleground where life and death danced inextricably.

**Opening:**

As the clock struck twelve, the fluorescent lights flickered overhead in the bustling emergency room, casting a sterile glow over the chaos that unfolded within. It was here, in the heart of the city that never sleeps, that Caroline Mae Donovan, a tenacious registered nurse, thrived. With her dark, curly hair pulled back into a pragmatic ponytail and scrubs stained with the evidence of countless shifts, Caroline navigated the frenetic pace of the ER like a seasoned sailor steering through a stormy sea.

Caroline's keen emerald eyes scanned the room, absorbing the frantic energy that permeated the air. A gunshot victim was being wheeled in on a stretcher, the hurried voices of the paramedics competing against the distant jazz. Yet, amidst the frenzy, Caroline felt a familiar calm settle over her. She had found her calling here, in the spaces where humanity stripped down to its rawest form, where pain and vulnerability mingled with hope and resilience.

As she approached the incoming patient, a surge of determination washed over her. Tonight, she would not just be a nurse; she would be an anchor in the storm, a beacon for those lost within the tempest of their darkest hours.
