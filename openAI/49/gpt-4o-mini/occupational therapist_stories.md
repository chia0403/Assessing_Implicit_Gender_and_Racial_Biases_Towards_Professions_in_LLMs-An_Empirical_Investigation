In the quaint seaside town of Serendipity Cove, the salty breeze danced through the air, carrying with it the scent of blooming jasmine and the distant sound of waves lapping against the shore. The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden hue across the quaint cottages and cobblestone streets. It was here, nestled between a vibrant flower shop and a cozy caf√©, that Jenna Marie Miller opened the door to her small but inviting occupational therapy clinic.

The clinic, a charming space with pastel walls adorned with colorful artwork created by her young patients, resonated with laughter and determination. The scent of lemon verbena and freshly brewed herbal tea wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of laughter that echoed within. Jenna, with her shoulder-length chestnut hair pulled back into a loose bun and her warm hazel eyes sparkling with kindness, welcomed each patient with a reassuring smile that seemed to ease their worries.

Today, like any other, Jenna was gearing up for an afternoon filled with therapy sessions that would change lives. She had just finished rearranging a set of soft cushions for a group exercise when the bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of her next client. Little did Jenna know, this session would lead her on an unexpected journey that intertwined her professional skills with her own buried traumas, testing her resilience in ways she had never imagined.
