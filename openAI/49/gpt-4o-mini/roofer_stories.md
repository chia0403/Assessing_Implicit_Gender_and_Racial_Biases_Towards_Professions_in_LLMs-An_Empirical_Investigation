**Title: High Above the World**

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Windmere, framed by rolling hills and the endless expanse of the ocean. The sun rises each morning, casting a golden hue over the pastel-painted cottages and historic buildings that line the cobblestone streets. The scent of salt is carried on the breeze, mingling with the sweetness of blooming wildflowers. Despite its charm, Windmere feels overshadowed by the distant cliffs, where a lighthouse stands steadfast against the crashing waves, serving as a metaphor for the residents’ hopes and dreams.

**Opening:**

Caleb Henry Atwood cradled his tool belt like a well-worn companion, peering out over the edge of a roof that seemed to scrape the sky. It was a Friday morning, and the sun cast a warm glow over the shingles, making them radiant beneath his fingertips. He loved this part of the job—the exhilarating rush of height, the rush of wind against his face, and the sprawling view of Windmere sprawled out below him.

As he adjusted his baseball cap, the beachgoers began to trickle in, their laughter and shouts faint echoes of joy that floated up to his lofty perch. Caleb had spent the better part of the week repairing the roof of the old Weatherly house, a sprawling structure that had seen better days. The house, with its chipped blue paint and sagging porch, had character, a whisper of stories shared and secrets kept.

But Caleb's mind was not solely on the weathered beams above him or the seagulls that danced in the air; it was far from the roofs and eaves of Windmere. He was caught in a storm of his own, battling against the weight of expectations and dreams that felt more monumental than the peak he now stood upon. Since his father's passing, the family roofing business had become more than a livelihood; it was a legacy, a burden he had yet to fully embrace. 

With a sigh, he secured a loose shingle and looked out towards the horizon, where the sun seemed to kiss the water's edge. Little did he know, just beyond the rooftops of Windmere, a challenge was brewing that would change everything he had ever known about love, responsibility, and the rooftops he called home.
