The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a golden hue over the wide expanse of Highway 47, a two-lane ribbon slicing through the heart of the Colorado plains. As the first rays of light spilled over the horizon, illuminating the jagged edges of distant mountains, the serenity of the morning was broken only by the distant hum of an early-morning truck and the faint rustle of wind through the tall grasses.

At a small, makeshift site near a closely-manicured patch of wildflowers, a figure bent low, inspecting the worn yellow stripe that marked the edge of the road. This was Leonard Mitchell, a highway worker well-acquainted with the pulse of the tarmac beneath his feet and the ever-shifting landscape beyond it. His decades of experience and practicality had made him a fixture along this stretch of highway, where he had spent countless hours patching, painting, and contemplating life.

Leonard, with salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from beneath his hard hat, stood up and surveyed his surroundings. The air smelled of fresh asphalt and summer pine, and small clouds of dust danced like fireflies in the morning light. Today was different; it was not just another day at work. Just last week, he had received an unexpected phone call that would challenge everything he thought he knew about his life, igniting a flicker of hope amidst the monotony of his routine. Little did he know, this new chapter would unfold along the very highway he had come to love.
