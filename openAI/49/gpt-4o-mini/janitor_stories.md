**Title: The Echoes of Midnight**

**Setting:**
In a sprawling, aging mansion that has been converted into a prestigious art gallery, the hallways whisper tales of forgotten grandeur. The sun has dipped below the horizon, leaving behind slivers of violet and gold. Shadows stretch across the polished marble floors, casting a somber tone on the intricate murals that adorn the walls. Each room is filled with the scent of varnish and old paper, where the remnants of a bygone era mingle with the contemporary pieces that now claim the space. Once a home to opulent soirees, the gallery is now a silent titan, its only witnesses the flickering lights overhead and the echo of footsteps against the hollowed echoes of history.

**Opening:**
By the time the last gallery patrons trickled out, the brilliance of the day had given way to the muted tones of twilight. It was at this hour that Adrian Malcolm, the unassuming janitor of the Verity Gallery, began his nightly routine. Crouched low, he snaked a mop across the floor, the bristles gliding over the smooth surface, stirring dust and forgotten memories. Adrian was a quiet man in his forties, his unkempt hair and well-worn uniform painting a picture of someone whose life had been spent in the shadows. Over the years, he had come to know the space intimately, not just for its aesthetics but for the secrets it harbored beneath layers of lacquered paint and silence.

As he worked, his hands moved instinctively, but his mind wandered through the corridors of the past, pondering the stories each painting concealed. Tonight, though, there was an unusual stillness that enveloped the galleryâ€”a thick blanket of anticipation that stirred something deep within him. With each swipe of the mop, he felt the tug of hidden truths lurking just out of sight, almost daring him to uncover them. Little did Adrian know, this night would be unlike any other, and those secrets were not only waiting to be found but were bound to change the course of his life forever.
