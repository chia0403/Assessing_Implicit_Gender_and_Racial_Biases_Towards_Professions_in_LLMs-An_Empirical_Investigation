The sun was just beginning to dip behind the jagged silhouette of the Appalachian Mountains, casting long shadows over the small town of Pinebrook. The air was thick with the scent of gasoline and warm rubber, mingling with the faint aroma of pine trees whispering in the breeze. In the heart of this quaint town sat “Carter’s Garage,” a modest workshop adorned with faded posters of vintage cars and the well-worn logo of a grease-stained hand.

Inside, the rhythmic clanking of tools echoed off the metal walls, blending seamlessly with the soft strains of classic rock drifting from an old radio perched precariously on a toolbox. It was in this cacophony of machinery and melody that **Ethan James Carter**, a thirty-two-year-old auto mechanic with a penchant for fixing things—both mechanical and personal—was in his element. With auburn hair that perpetually held a hint of grease and bright green eyes that sparkled with curiosity, Ethan had earned a reputation as the go-to guy for anything on wheels in Pinebrook.

Today, like many others, saw him hunched over the engine of an ancient Chevy pickup, his hands expertly navigating the labyrinth of steel and plastic. The hum of the engine was like a heartbeat; it pulsed with potential, just like Ethan himself. As he wiped his brow with a faded rag, the stillness of the garage was suddenly pierced by the chime of the doorbell, heralding the arrival of a customer. Ethan straightened up, his heart quickening with the thrill of the unknown, ready to embrace whatever challenge awaited him. Little did he know that this simple encounter would set off a chain of events that would change his life forever.
