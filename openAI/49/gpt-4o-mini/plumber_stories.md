Title: **Under Pressure**

In the heart of the bustling city of Graysford, where the towering skyscrapers cast long shadows over the slumlike alleys, the early morning sun struggled to penetrate the gray fog that hung lazily in the air. The occasional clang of metal echoed through the narrow streets, resembling the city's own heartbeat as it awakened for another day. 

Amidst the cacophony, a modest blue van, emblazoned with the faded logo of "Graysford Plumbing Solutions," pulled up in front of a crumbling tenement building. The van was a little worse for wear, much like the structure it parked beside—its flaking paint and cracked windows a testament to years of neglect. From the driver's seat emerged a broad-shouldered man in stained overalls, his tousled brown hair sticking out in untamed curls. 

This was Thomas Avery, a skilled plumber known (and occasionally feared) for his ability to resolve even the most stubborn of leaks. At thirty-eight, Thomas had seen it all: the chaos of burst pipes, the stubborn clogs of aged plumbing, and the eccentricities of Graysford’s residents, who often treated his visits as therapy sessions of sorts. 

As he cracked his knuckles and slung his toolbox over his shoulder, Thomas took a deep breath, savoring the smell of rain-soaked asphalt mingling with the scent of fresh coffee wafting from the corner café. Today, he was on call to fix the ongoing flood issues in Apartment 4B, where rumors had it that the pipes were as old as the building itself—prone to leaks and loud moans like the ghosts of its forgotten inhabitants.

Little did he know, the job ahead would lead him into a web of secrets buried beneath the city, where the past collided with the present, and nothing was quite as it seemed.
