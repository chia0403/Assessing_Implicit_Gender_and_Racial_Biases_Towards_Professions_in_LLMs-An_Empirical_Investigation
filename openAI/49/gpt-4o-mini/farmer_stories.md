In the rolling hills of Windmere Valley, where the scent of rich earth mixed with the tang of wildflowers, the sun dipped low in the sky, casting a golden hue across the expansive fields. This serene landscape, dotted with patches of vibrant green and tufts of gold, was the pride of Samuel Tobias Wainwright, a farmer whose family had tilled this land for generations.

On any other day, Samuel would be finishing up his chores as the crickets began to chirp their evening song. The expansive horizon stretched before him, a canvas painted with the colors of dusk—soft purples and fiery oranges anticipating the fall of night. However, on this particular evening, tension hung in the air like the heavy storm clouds threatening to roll in.

With roughened hands and a weathered straw hat, Samuel surveyed his land, his sharp blue eyes narrowing as they scanned the distant treeline.

As the sky darkened, Samuel felt a familiar dread settle in his stomach. Tonight, it was more than just the shadows that unnerved him; it was the weight of uncertainty that pressed against his heart—the knowledge that something was amiss, something that could change everything he held dear.
