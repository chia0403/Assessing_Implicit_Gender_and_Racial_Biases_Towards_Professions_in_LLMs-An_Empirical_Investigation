In the heart of the bustling city of Edison Grove, where the clatter of traffic echoed through every alley and the luminescent glow of neon signs painted the night, stood the venerable Edison Tower. Once a marvel of Art Deco elegance, the building now blended into the modern skyline, its grandeur muted by time and the ever-growing forest of skyscrapers around it. Amidst the daily hustle and ceaseless flow of people rushing in and out of its gleaming glass doors, there was one figure who moved with a calm unhurried rhythm, seemingly impervious to the chaos that surrounded him. 

His name was Thomas "Tommy" Briggs, the diligent janitor of Edison Tower. Tommy was a man of wiry build, with a few graying hairs and laugh lines etched into his kind, discerning face. At fifty-two, he had worked in the tower for nearly two decades, having seen tenants come and go, businesses rise and fall, and young professionals climb the rungs of their corporate ladders. 

Each morning before the world awoke, Tommy would roll his large, squeaky cleaning cart through the polished hallways, his old, worn-out earbuds frequently playing the comforting classics of Motown into his ears. As the first rays of dawn broke through the large glass windows, casting shimmering patterns across the marble floors, Tommy took pride in ensuring every surface was spotless. 

He knew every crevice of the Edison Tower intimately, from the grand lobby with its aging brass fixtures to the dimly lit maintenance corridors that snaked behind the scenes. Yet lately, he had sensed an unfamiliar presence, an inexplicable pulsation, as if the building itself was trying to whisper something to him. 

Though he dismissed the feeling as a figment of imagination or a result of his late-night readings of mystery novels, curiosity flickered within him, one that promised unexpected revelations in the days to come. Little did Tommy know his routine days were about to transform into something extraordinary, as the Edison Tower was poised to share its secrets with its most loyal keeper.
