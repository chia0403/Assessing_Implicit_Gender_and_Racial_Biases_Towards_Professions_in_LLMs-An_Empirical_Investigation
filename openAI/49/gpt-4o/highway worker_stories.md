Rain swept across the open plains in relentless sheets, transforming the narrow highway into a gleaming ribbon under the stormy sky. The distant rumble of thunder echoed through the expanse, mingling with the hum of engines from the few vehicles brave enough to journey in such weather. In this desolate stretch of Colorado's Front Range, where the horizon seemed to stretch infinitely in every direction, the landscape felt like a living entity, wild and untamed.

Henry "Hank" Waverly stood by the side of Highway 285, his neon orange safety vest a stark contrast against the muted grays that enveloped the scene. At forty-two, Hank had spent nearly half his life as a highway worker, patching up roads and handling emergencies in the best and worst of conditions. Today was no exception. He kept a vigilant eye on the stretch of asphalt before him, marked by potholes that had grown like hungry mouths after the relentless downpour.

The wind tugged at the brim of his weathered hat, and he adjusted it with a practiced hand. Around him, the crew worked in orchestrated chaos—each man and woman contributing to the rhythm of construction. Machines roared, gravel crunched, and voices shouted against the storm, forming a symphony of labor under the brooding sky.

Despite the cold wetness seeping through the seams of his jacket, Hank felt the familiar warmth of purpose. There was something profoundly satisfying about repairing what others took for granted—ensuring the paths of thousands were safe, even if his own remained solitary. Today’s task was no small feat, but in the heart of every challenge lay the quiet promise of accomplishment, a promise Hank had learned to chase with the dawn of each workday.
