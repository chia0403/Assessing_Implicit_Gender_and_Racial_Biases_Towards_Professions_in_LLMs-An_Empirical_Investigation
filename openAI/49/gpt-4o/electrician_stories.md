In the quiet town of Hazelwood, nestled between lush, rolling hills and a meandering river, the early morning light filtered through a tangled canopy of autumn leaves. The town stirred gently awake as the sun cast its warm glow on the narrow cobblestone streets and the quaint houses that lined them. The scent of fresh dew mixed with the aroma of baking bread from the local bakery, creating a welcoming embrace for the town's sleepy residents.

At the edge of Hazelwood, where the town began to merge with the sprawling countryside, stood a modest, weathered cottage with a garden that seemed perpetually caught between wildness and order. This was home to Theodore "Theo" Montgomery, the town's dedicated electrician. Known for his quick hands and quicker wit, Theo was as much a fixture in Hazelwood as the ancient oak in the town square.

Theo had started his day before the sun had risen, as was his custom. He was already in his workshop, a bright but cluttered space filled with the tools of his trade and the half-finished projects that never seemed to stop multiplying. With his trademark leather apron on and an old transistor radio humming softly in the background, Theo meticulously wrapped a coil of copper wire. He was preparing to fix the flickering streetlights that had been causing quite the stir in the town’s gossip circles.

Despite his early start, Theo was never in a rush. He had learned long ago that every job, no matter how small, deserved his full attention—a philosophy passed down from his father, who had been an electrician before him. As he packed his toolkit and locked up the workshop, he took a moment to appreciate the serenity of the morning, breathing in deeply the crisp, cool air that signaled the arrival of another beautiful autumn day in Hazelwood.
