In the small coastal town of Seabrook, where the salty breeze danced across the cobblestone streets and seagulls sung their morning chorus, Clara Bennett began her day. The sun crested over the deep blue horizon, casting a golden glow across the storefronts and spilling light into the narrow alleys. It was a town that felt like a perpetual snapshot of summer, framed by the gentle lapping of the ocean waves and the scent of blooming jasmine.

Clara, a dedicated dental hygienist, was known for her kindness and precision. Her office, nestled between an old-world bakery and a charming antique shop on Main Street, was a reflection of her personality—bright, welcoming, and meticulously organized. With soft pastel walls and a wicker basket brimming with lavender by the window, the space put every patient at ease from the moment they stepped inside.

Clara took pride in her work, finding a sense of calm in the routine of her days. She loved the rhythm of cleaning and the satisfaction of helping others, often going the extra mile to ensure even the most anxious patients left with a smile. Today, as she prepared for another busy schedule, she took a moment to savor the tranquility before the buzz of the day began.

It was in this peaceful coastal enclave that Clara Bennett would soon find her life subtly altered by the unexpected events that unfolded, beginning with the arrival of a stranger at the dentist’s chair—a man with a charming smile and a mysterious past that seemed to echo with secrets of the ocean.
