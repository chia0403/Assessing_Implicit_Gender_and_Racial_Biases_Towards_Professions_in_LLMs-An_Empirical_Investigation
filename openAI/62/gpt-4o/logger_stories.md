In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where towering Douglas firs brushed the sky with emerald needles and the ground was a soft carpet of pine needles, her story began. Eleanor "Ellie" McTavish stood at the edge of the forest, her silhouette outlined against the dawn's slender light. The morning air was brisk, filled with the scent of earth and pine, and the distant cry of an eagle echoed through the valley.

Ellie’s axe rested easily on her shoulder, its handle smooth from years of grip. Around her, the logging camp was stirring to life—the rhythmic clink of metal on metal as saws were sharpened, the murmur of rough, familiar voices greeting the day, and the comforting hiss of the campfire promising warmth and coffee.

The deep green world around Ellie, seemingly endless and alive, was her home and her livelihood. Generations of McTavishes had lived and worked in these woods, their legacy etched into each tree felled and every new sapling planted. She felt an unspoken connection to this land, a responsibility woven into her being like the threads of the plaid shirt she wore. As she listened to the rustle of the wind through the branches, Ellie knew that this day, like countless others before it, would demand all of her strength and skill.

Yet, beneath the tranquil beauty of the forest, there lay stories untold and mysteries unearthed with each fallen giant. Today felt different, a brewing undercurrent in the air hinting at changes soon to unfold. Ellie, unaware of what fate had in store, tightened her grip on the axe, ready to delve deeper into the day's work—unaware it would lead her into the heart of something much larger than the trees she knew so well.
