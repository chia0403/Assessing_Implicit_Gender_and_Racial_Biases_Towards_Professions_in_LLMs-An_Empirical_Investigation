In the small, bustling town of Riverton, nestled between emerald hills and snaking rivers, the morning sun cast a golden hue over the red-brick buildings lining Main Street. Here, amidst the soft clatter of early bird commuters and the savory aroma of freshly baked bread from Baxter's Bakery, stood Denison & Co. Drafting Firm, a storied establishment with a history as vivid as the ink on its blueprints.

Inside, at the far corner of the open-plan office, where wooden beams still whispered tales of the building’s past, sat Eleanor "Ellie" Cartwright. Slender and meticulous, with curls perpetually in a loose yet somehow deliberate disarray, Ellie was immersed in her work. The gentle hum of an oscillating fan blended with the rhythmic scratching of her drafting pen, filling the space with an industrious melody. Her desk, much like her mind, was a blend of organized chaos: rulers and compasses juxtaposed with sketches of quaint houses and sprawling parks.

Ellie had always been drawn to the fine art of drafting, a passion ignited in childhood when her father, a revered local architect, placed her first drawing pencil in her eager hand. Now, as one of the most skilled draftsmen in Riverton, her designs were not just lines on paper but dreams of spaces waiting to welcome life and foster memories. This morning, however, brought a project that promised to challenge her expertise and spark her creativity—a new library set to become the heart of Riverton’s slowly expanding community. The weight of its significance felt palpable.

As Ellie adjusted her glasses and leaned closer into her work, the office phone rang—a sound as familiar and constant as the roaring river outside the town. Little did she know, this call would draw her into a series of events that would reshape not only her life but the very landscape of Riverton itself.
