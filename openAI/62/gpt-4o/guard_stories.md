In the predawn stillness of Elderglen Keep, the crisp air seemed to shimmer with anticipation. The ancient stone fortress stood resolute atop a hill shrouded in swirling mist, its age-old walls whispering tales of battles long forgotten. Lanterns flickered along the winding cobblestone paths, casting warm pools of light that faded seamlessly into the dark velvet of the night.

At the northern gate, where the silhouette of the fortress bisected the first streaks of dawn, stood Sir Evan Dunleigh. Clad in weathered but meticulously maintained armor, Evan was the steadfast sentinel of Elderglen. His sharp eyes, accustomed to the dimness of pre-morning hours, scanned the horizon with practiced vigilance. The gentle rustle of leaves in the groves beyond was the only sound to accompany the rhythmic clink of his sword against his side as he shifted his weight.

Sir Evan, a man of few words and firm resolve, had been the watchful guardian of Elderglen for more than a decade. Beneath a sky slowly transforming from night’s depths to dawn’s embrace, he felt the familiar weight of duty settle across his shoulders like an old, comforting shawl. This realm had known peace for years, but in Evan's heart was a flame of readiness that never waned.

Within the mighty walls of Elderglen Keep, nestled amid forests teeming with secrets and legends, Sir Evan Dunleigh was more than just a guard; he was the keeper of its peace, the bulwark against the unknown that lingered just beyond the mist-veiled trees. And with each daybreak, as darkness gave way to light, Evan stood ever watchful, a silent promise to protect those who lived within their haven.
