As dawn broke over the expansive swathes of the Midwest plains, a thin layer of mist lay snugly across the quiet highway like nature’s own blanket. The sky was a canvas of purples and pinks, hinting at the sun's imminent arrival. The countryside was silent, save for the occasional rustle of leaves as the crisp morning breeze gently whispered through the trees lining the road.

Standing at the edge of the asphalt, just where the green of the endless fields met the gray of the highway, was Marshall Everett Langford. Clad in his orange reflective vest, which glowed faintly in the dim light, Marshall was ready to begin another day’s work, a familiar ritual that intertwined his life with the ever-changing face of the roads that snaked across the land.

With his work boots planted firmly on the soft gravel shoulder, Marshall took a deep breath, savoring the fresh air tinged with a hint of dew. His rough hands, etched with lines like a map of well-trodden paths, grasped the handle of his shovel, his most trusted companion. It was here, in the quiet solitude of early morning, before the roar of engines and the busyness of the day, that he found a strange sense of peace.

To the casual passerby, the highway might have appeared merely as a system of connections from one destination to another. But to Marshall, it was a living entity — a testament to human ambition, a constant reminder of journeys begun, completed, or yet to be taken. And in his own way, he was its custodian, ensuring its paths were safe and open, weaving the fabric that held communities together.

Today, much like any other day, Marshall would patch the road, mend the guardrails, and clear debris. Simple tasks, perhaps, but critical nonetheless. As the sun finally crested the horizon, casting golden rays that danced across the tops of cornfields, Marshall knew that he, too, was about to embark on a journey of his own — one paved not just with asphalt but with purpose.
