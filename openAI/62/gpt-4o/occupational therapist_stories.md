Amidst the bustling heart of Boston, cradled between the historic charms of Beacon Hill and the fresh innovations of Seaport, stood Riverside Rehabilitation Center, a warm enclave of healing and hope. The center thrived within the timeless bricks of a red-brownstone building, where giant, arching windows offered sweeping views of the Charles River shimmering in the afternoon sun.

Inside, amidst the hum of purposeful activity, soft voices mingled with the gentle clinking of therapeutic tools, creating a soundscape that was both soothing and invigorating. It was here, under the variegated light casting gentle patterns on the polished wooden floors, that Selene Harper began her day. An occupational therapist with a heart as determined as her vocation, Selene approached each challenge with a blend of scientific acumen and unparalleled empathy, her passion gleaming as much in her eyes as in the meticulous care she bestowed upon her clients.

Today, as she peered out through those grand windows, her gaze lingered thoughtfully on the river, tracing the dance of light upon its surface. The cityâ€™s rhythm was a steady backdrop to her thoughts, providing a constancy against which she measured countless tales of transformation and perseverance. Selene knew that every session held a story and every client a hero, and it was her calling to help them rediscover their strengths and rewrite the endings to their own narratives.
