In the heart of the bustling city of Riverton, where the air was perpetually tinged with the mingling scents of gasoline and fresh rain, a small, unassuming garage sat nestled between a row of weathered brownstones. The sign above the door read "Harrison's Auto Repair" in fading blue paint, a testament to the decades it had served the community with unwavering diligence.

Inside the garage, the rhythmic clank of metal on metal harmonized with the low hum of a blues tune playing softly from an old radio perched on a shelf. The space was a chaotic symphony of half-dismantled engines, tangled wires, and the rich aroma of motor oil, punctuated by the occasional hiss of a pneumatic wrench.

Bent over the open hood of a rust-speckled sedan was Maxine Harrison, known to most as Mack. Her coveralls, once a deep navy blue, were now a patchwork of grease stains, each a story of a car brought back to life. With her hair tied back in a crimson bandana, Mack's hands moved with the assured precision of someone who knew engines like they were old friends who spoke in clicks and clanks, eager to share tales of their travels.

Maxine Elizabeth Harrison, armed with her trusty wrench and a profound love for all things mechanical, had been the heart and soul of the garage ever since she inherited it from her father, George Harrison, a decade ago. Though the city outside never slept, with its ever-changing skyline and relentless pace, Mack found solace within these oil-slicked walls, where the world made sense in terms of torque, tension, and the simple satisfaction of a job well done.
