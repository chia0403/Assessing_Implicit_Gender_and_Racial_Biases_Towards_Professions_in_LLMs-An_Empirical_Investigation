In the heart of downtown Arkwood, where the old brick buildings whispered secrets of a bygone era, sat the modest office of Eliza Thornton, a seasoned income tax preparer known for her uncanny ability to find deductions in the most tangled financial records. Eliza's office, nestled between a vintage bookshop and a quaint café that brewed the richest espresso in town, was a refuge for the overwhelmed and the perplexed, especially as tax season loomed like a dark cloud on the horizon.

The room was adorned with shelves packed tight with binders and books, the spines labeled meticulously—"Tax Codes: 2001-2023," "Uncommon Deductions," "The Freelancer's Guide to Finances." A large window behind her desk allowed slivers of the waning afternoon light to catch the dust motes floating lazily through the air. On the desk, a worn mug filled with pens proclaimed "I ♥ Numbers" amidst a forest of papers and a vintage brass lamp that spilled a warm, comforting glow.

Eliza herself, a woman in her early fifties, wore glasses perched on the edge of her nose and had an expression that could comfort the most frantic clients. Her auburn hair, streaked with silver, was pulled into a neat bun, and her attire was as sensible as it was stylish, displaying her penchant for patterned scarves which added a pop of color to her otherwise understated wardrobe.

On this particular cool March morning, as the clock ticked towards nine, she sat at her desk, reviewing the files of her first client of the day. She took a sip of tepid coffee, savoring its familiar bitterness as she prepared for a day filled with numbers, deductions, credits, and—if she was lucky—the satisfaction of untangling the financial messes that would soon parade through her door.
