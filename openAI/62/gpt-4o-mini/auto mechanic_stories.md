Underneath the great expanse of a cobalt sky, the small town of Maplewood buzzed with the sounds of a late summer afternoon. Dust motes danced in the sunlight streaming through the open garage doors of "Johnson’s Auto Repair," a weathered building with chipped paint and an old neon sign that flickered occasionally, casting a ghostly glow across the cracked asphalt. 

Inside the garage, blended scents of motor oil and fresh gasoline mingled with the sweet, tangy aroma of the barbecue sizzling from the food truck parked just outside. The rhythmic clang of metal tools echoed as the town's unsung heroes came in and out, the cars gathering dust as they awaited their turn on the workbench.

In the heart of the hustle and bustle, grease-streaked and focused, stood Andrew Charles Johnson—a man whose brawny frame was nothing short of a testament to years spent under the hoods of countless vehicles. With tousled dark hair that seemed perpetually dusted with soot and piercing green eyes that glimmered with determination, Andrew had earned a reputation not just as a mechanic, but as a wizard of sorts, able to bring even the most forgotten vehicles back to life.

As he wiped his hands on a rag and reached for his trusty wrench, the afternoon sun poured through the open door, illuminating the intricate tattoos that snaked up his forearms—each a story of his past, a reminder of the roads he had traveled. Yet, as Andrew cast a glance toward the horizon, a sense of restlessness stirred within him. While Maplewood had always been home, he felt an unshakeable longing for something... different, a desire for an adventure that extended far beyond the confines of his garage. Little did he know, that adventure was about to come hurling around the bend.
