**Title: The Last Receipt**

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of brightly colored packages lining the shelves of Miller's Grocery Mart. The faint scent of ripe bananas mingled with the industrial aroma of cleaning supplies. It was a late October afternoon, and the crisp autumn air drifted into the store every time the door swung open, bringing with it a hint of fallen leaves and a promise of change. Outside, a gentle drizzle began to coat the pavement, making the world beyond the glass doors shimmer with muted colors.

**Opening:** As the clock inched toward 5 PM, the steady rhythm of cash registers filled the air, punctuated by the occasional chatter of customers gathering last-minute items for dinner. Among the clutter of shopping carts and cereal boxes stood twenty-two-year-old Clara Jean Thompson, her name badge glinting like a beacon against her dark blue apron. She had worked as a cashier at Miller’s for nearly three years, but today felt different. 

Clara’s fingers danced over the keys of the register, her mind wandering as she scanned the items beneath her gaze—a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, a pack of gum, the last two pumpkins on the markdown shelf. A chill ran down her spine as raindrops tapped rhythmically against the glass, and she caught a glimpse of her reflection, the faintest hint of worry crossing her brow. Pushing a stray curl behind her ear, Clara couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to change, not just outside where the storm threatened, but within the walls of the grocery mart that had become her second home. Today, she would discover the power of a single receipt—one that contained much more than just numbers and prices.
