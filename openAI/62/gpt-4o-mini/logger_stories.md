In the shadow of towering pines, where the mist clung to the earth like an age-old secret, the air was thick with the scent of fresh-cut timber and damp earth. The sleepy town of Cedar Hollow, nestled deep within the Oregon Cascades, awakened each morning to the rhythmic thrum of life — the hearty calls of loons across the lake, the distant rumble of trucks on the logging paths, and the occasional whistle of the wind through the trees.

At dawn, the sun struggled to break through the heavy canopy, casting long shadows over the forest floor where William "Will" Tanner, the town’s most rugged logger, tightened the laces of his worn boots. Will stood a solid six feet tall, with broad shoulders and calloused hands that told tales of hard work and determination. His tousled dark hair peeked from beneath a green and brown plaid cap, while a scruffy beard framed a weathered face marked by sun and toil. 

Today, like every day, he would be out there—saw in hand, navigating the delicate balance between nature and necessity. Each tree felled was a decision weighed against the needs of his family and the demands of an industry that considered the wilderness merely a resource.

As the first rays of sunlight pierced the air, illuminating the droplets of dew that clung to the ferns, Will stepped into the embrace of the forest. The peaceful stillness before the day’s labor churned in his mind, haunted by reflections on the legacy he would leave behind and the land he fought desperately to preserve from the ever-encroaching chaos of modern life. Little did he know, this day would be unlike any other, for amidst the familiar sounds of nature, a strange noise echoed—a whisper of change that would challenge everything Will Tanner thought he knew about logging, responsibility, and the heart of Cedar Hollow itself.
