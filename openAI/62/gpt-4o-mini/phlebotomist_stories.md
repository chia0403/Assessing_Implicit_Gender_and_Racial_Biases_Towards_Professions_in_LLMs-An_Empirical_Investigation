In the heart of Maplewood, a small town cradled by rolling hills and whispering pines, the air was thick with the scent of autumn leaves. The sun dipped low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the quaint streets as residents hurried home, their breath forming little clouds in the brisk evening air. Among them was Dr. Eliza Jane Aldridge, a phlebotomist at Maplewood General Hospital. 

Inside the bustling facility, the fluorescent lights flickered slightly, illuminating the pastel-colored walls adorned with cheerful artwork created by local children. Eliza swiped her identification badge against the scanner at the entrance of the phlebotomy lab, the familiar beep of the machine a comforting sound in her otherwise hectic world. Here, her tools of the trade lined up neatly—needles gleaming like polished silver, and vials waiting patiently to be filled with life’s essence. 

Eliza had always felt a calling to the medical field, but it was the art of drawing blood—the delicate dance of precision and care—that captured her heart. She thrived in the chaos of the hospital, finding solace in the quiet moments between patients, where each heartbeat whispered stories of hope and healing. As she prepared for another busy shift, a hint of unease nestled in her chest, a feeling she couldn’t quite shake… something was brewing just beneath the surface of her routine.
