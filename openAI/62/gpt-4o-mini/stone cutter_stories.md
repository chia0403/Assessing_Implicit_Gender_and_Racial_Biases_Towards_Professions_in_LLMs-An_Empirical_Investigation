Beneath the towering cliffs of the Listran Mountains, where the wind whispered ancient secrets and the sun cast a golden hue over the rugged terrain, lay the small village of Eldor Hollow. Nestled in a verdant valley, the village was known for its skilled artisans, particularly those who worked with stone. Among them was Dorian Thorne, a master stone cutter whose hands were as strong and steady as the very rocks he carved.

Dorian stood at the entrance of his workshop, a weathered stone structure adorned with intricate sculptures that seemed to breathe life under his skilled touch. The smell of fresh earth lingered in the air, mingling with the sound of chisels striking stone. Each day, he awoke before dawn, the chill of the morning air biting at his skin, but it was a small price to pay for the joy of creating beauty from the raw, untamed rock he so loved.

His workshop was a sanctuary, filled with the echoes of his labor, where blocks of granite and marble transformed into exquisite pieces of art. The villagers often came to marvel at his creations—from elegant fountains that danced in sunlight to majestic statues that seemed to tell stories of their own. But Dorian's true passion lay not in the admiration of others, but in the quiet conversations he held with the stone, the way it yielded to his touch, revealing the hidden depths within.

On this particular morning, as the first rays of sunlight began to crest the mountaintops, Dorian glanced up from his workbench. His gaze swept over the valley, a world so alive and vibrant, yet he felt a sense of restlessness gnawing at him. Something, he couldn't quite put his finger on, was calling to him—a whisper that transcended the rhythm of his chisel and echoed through the quiet of his heart. Little did he know, the journey that awaited him would lead to a discovery far greater than any stone he had ever shaped.
