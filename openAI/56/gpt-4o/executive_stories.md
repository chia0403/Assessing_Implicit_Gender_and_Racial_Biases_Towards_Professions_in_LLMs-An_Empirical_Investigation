In the heart of Manhattan, where the skyline kissed the clouds, the morning sun filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows of a corner office on the 38th floor of the renowned Helios Tower. The city hummed with its usual vigor, taxis weaving through the streets below and pedestrians rushing with caffeinated determination. At 9 o'clock sharp, an espresso machine purred to life in the luxurious office, releasing the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee into the air.
