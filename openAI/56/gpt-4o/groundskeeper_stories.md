At the break of dawn, when the world was still cloaked in the soft hues of morning mist, the sprawling estate of Larkspur Manor began to stir. Dew clung like silvery jewels to the emerald grass, and the air was filled with the crisp promise of a new day. Birds began their morning symphony, hidden among the towering oaks and fragrant lilacs that bordered the vast lawns.

Amidst this serene backdrop, a lone figure moved with quiet purpose. Lucas Gardner, the manor’s devoted groundskeeper, made his way down the cobblestone path that wound through the heart of the gardens. With each step, his worn boots left faint impressions on the damp earth, a testament to the decades he had dedicated to this place.

The morning was Lucas's sanctuary, a time before the world fully awakened, before the estate's staff bustled about with their daily duties. His grayish-blue eyes, sharp and observant, took in every detail—the tiniest bud beginning to blossom, the tendril of ivy daring to reach beyond its confines.

Lucas was a man of the earth, his hands calloused but gentle as they passed over the delicate petals of the roses he tended with such care. To him, the land was alive, a tapestry of stories waiting to be uncovered beneath its surface. And so, in the heart of Larkspur Manor, his journey began anew with each sunrise, every dawn a new chapter of tending to both the beauty and secrets that lay beneath the soil.
