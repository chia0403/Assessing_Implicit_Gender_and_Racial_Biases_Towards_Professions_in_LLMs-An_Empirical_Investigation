Title: *Echoes of The Grand Riverton*

In the heart of Manhattan, where the city never seems to sleep, stood the Grand Riverton Hotel, resplendent and timeless, a monument to the golden age of hospitality. Its gothic facade, adorned with elegant wrought-iron balconies and gilded flourishes, watched over the bustling streets below, a stoic witness to the ebb and flow of countless stories that emerged within its hallowed halls. The lobby, with its high ceilings and dazzling crystal chandeliers, was a sanctuary of opulence and refinement, echoing with whispers of the past and the soft shuffle of hurried guests.

Amidst the whirl of travelers and the hum of languages from all corners of the globe, there moved Jonathan "Jack" Halston, a bellhop with a quick smile and an even quicker step. The uniform he wore—a deep burgundy with gleaming brass buttons—was always impeccably pressed, as though he emerged each morning ready to meet the day with purpose. At twenty-seven, Jack carried with him an easy charm, an innate understanding of how to blend into the background while being indispensable to those he served.

Jack's days were marked by the rhythm of arrivals and departures, by the cadence of suitcases rolling across marble and the subdued chatter of secrets exchanged in passing. But beneath his composed exterior was a keen observer of humanity, privy to the triumphs and tragedies that unfurled among the guests of the Grand Riverton. Here, amidst the grandeur of the hotel and the city's unceasing pulse, Jack would find himself at the heart of a mystery that would change the course of his life forever.
