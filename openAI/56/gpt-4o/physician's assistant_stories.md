On an overcast morning in early November, the coastal town of Harborside was shrouded in a fine mist, the kind that blurred the line between land and sea. Along the cobblestone streets, remnants of fallen leaves clung stubbornly to the ground, their vibrant reds and golds muted by the damp air. The old lighthouse stood sentinel on the cliffs, its light cutting a silent path across the gray waters, guiding the few fishing boats braving the chill into the safety of the harbor.

Amidst this quiet tableau, nestled between the quaint bookshop and the local caf√© where the scent of freshly baked pastries mingled with the briny air, was Lakeside Health Clinic. It was here, in a small office adorned with both medical charts and maritime photographs, that Alexander "Alex" Bennett began his day. As a physician's assistant, Alex was no stranger to the ebb and flow of life in Harborside, where the tides of the sea often mirrored the tides of the community.

With a gentle click, Alex opened the blinds, allowing the subdued light to filter into the room. He took a moment to gaze out the window, noting how the mist softened the edges of the world, casting everything in a dreamlike hue. It was a setting he had come to love deeply, with its ever-changing skies and the comforting rhythm of waves meeting shore. Adjusting his stethoscope, Alex readied himself for the morning's patients, knowing each would bring a unique story shaped by the sea and the quiet yet vibrant life led in this small town.
