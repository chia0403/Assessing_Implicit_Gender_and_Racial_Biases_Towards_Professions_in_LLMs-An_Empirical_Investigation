In the heart of the bustling city of Seattle, where the skyline kissed the low-hanging clouds, stood the Brookside Rehabilitation Center, a beacon of hope nestled between glass giants. Here, amid the whir of daily commutes and the distant cry of seagulls drifting in from the nearby bay, Olivia Clarke thrived. At thirty-two, Olivia had become one of the most respected occupational therapists in the area, her reputation founded on an unwavering dedication to restoring independence and dignity to her patients.

The center, a renovated brick building adorned with ivy tendrils and large bay windows, had the warmth of a long-forgotten sanctuary. Stepping through its doors was like being embraced by a comforting whisper of calm. Inside, the scent of fresh coffee mingled with the crisp notes of eucalyptus, and the walls were lined with vibrant murals—scenes of meadows and seas, painted by artists whose lives had been touched by the rehabilitation journey.

Olivia's office overlooked a small courtyard garden where bursts of marigold and lavender provided a sensory symphony of color and scent. Each morning, she paused by her window, sipping her tea, watching patients ease into their routines with therapists by their sides. Today, as gray clouds began to tangle with the peaks of nearby mountains, she prepared to meet a new group of clients, hopeful and determined—a mirror to her own resolve to help them find their footing in the world anew.
