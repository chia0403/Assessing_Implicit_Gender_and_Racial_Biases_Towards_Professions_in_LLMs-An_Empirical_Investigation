In the rust-streaked heart of Oldtown, a city where the past clung like moth-eaten wallpaper, the morning sun poured through the dust-streaked window of a cramped drafting studio. Blueprints sprawled across every available surface, whispering tales of ambitious skyscrapers that would breathe life into the ghosts of abandoned factories. The air was tinged with the sharp scent of graphite and the warm, musty odor of aging paper.

At the center of this chaotic sanctuary sat Tobias Leonard Hayes, a diligent drafting worker with ink-stained fingers and eyes that flickered with a quiet intensity. As he meticulously traced the sweeping lines of a new design on his drafting board, he barely noticed the way the sunlight caught the curls of his dark hair or how the faint lines around his eyes deepened with each concentrated furrow of his brow. To Tobias, the world beyond those walls was a blur; all that mattered was the careful crafting of dreams on parchment.

But today felt different, charged with an undercurrent of possibility. The city was on the brink of a significant redevelopment project, and whispers of change danced through the streets like the rustling leaves outside. For Tobias, each pencil stroke was not just a job, but a spark of hope that perhaps this time, with the right plans and the courage to act, he might build something that would truly matter amid the ruins of a forgotten era.
