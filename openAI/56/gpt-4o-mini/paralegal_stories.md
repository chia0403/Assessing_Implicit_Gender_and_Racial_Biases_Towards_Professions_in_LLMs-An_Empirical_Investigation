**Title: Shadows of Justice**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden light over the bustling streets of downtown Portland. The air was thick with the scent of fresh coffee and rain-soaked pavement, remnants of an earlier storm. Pedestrians hurried along the sidewalk, their footsteps echoing against the glassy façades of towering office buildings, a cacophony of life and ambition.

Inside the towering structure at 421 West 12th Avenue, a small sanctuary resided on the 14th floor—a law office known for its fierce advocacy for the underdog. This was the world of Ashley Marie Prescott, a dedicated paralegal whose passion for justice often outweighed her paycheck. Her desk, laden with case files and towering stacks of law books, bore the signs of tireless devotion and relentless pursuit of truth.

Ashley, with her chestnut hair pulled into a neat bun and vibrant green eyes that sparkled with determination, was known for her fierce intellect and unwavering loyalty to her clients. She thrived in the chaos of the courtroom, navigating the intricate maze of legal jargon and procedural hurdles for a team of attorneys that recognized her as their backbone.

As she typed feverishly on her computer, the rhythmic tapping of keys filled the air, drowned out only by the murmur of conversations and the occasional beeping of a fax machine. In that moment, a call came through on her desk phone—a deep voice with an unsettling edge. The message shivered down her spine: “I have information about the case you’re working on. Meet me at the Old Willamette Bridge tonight. Come alone.”

With her heart pounding, Ashley glanced at the clock—6 PM—and knew this could be the lead she’d been waiting for. Whatever it held, it was about to take her down a path she never anticipated, a journey into shadows and justice where the stakes were higher than she could have ever imagined.
