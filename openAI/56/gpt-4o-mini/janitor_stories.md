In the dim before dawn, the quiet corridors of Albright University echoed with a sort of nostalgia, the kind that clung to its grand oak paneling and the faded portraits of long-ago dignitaries. The building, a hodgepodge of ivy-clad brick and glass, was at once a sanctuary of knowledge and a keeper of secrets. Even now, as the fluorescent lights flickered to life in a fog of buzzing electricity, the shadows whispered tales of sleepless nights spent studying and the laughter of students roaming its halls.

At this hour, however, the only living soul wandering the university was Theodore James Miller, a janitor with a penchant for daydreaming and a heart bound to the stories hidden in the books borrowed from the library. Clad in a work shirt stained with decades of memories and a pair of sturdy boots that had long lost their shine, Theo pushed his squeaky-clean cart filled with mops, brooms, and an assortment of cleaning supplies. His eyes, a warm hazel, sparkled with curiosity, often darting around to take in the beauty of the old building, the way the light filtered through the tall windows like golden strands of hope.

As he moved through the sprawling campus, the scent of freshly mopped floors mingled with the faint aroma of aged paper and polished wood, bringing him solace. It was a ritual he cherished, the early hours when the world was still asleep. Here, among the empty lecture halls and the silent libraries, he often imagined he was part of something larger—a guardian of knowledge, if only for a little while.

But today felt different. As he wiped down a table in the student lounge, a flash of movement caught his eye—a dusty leather-bound book lying on the floor, partially hidden beneath a worn-out armchair. Intrigued, Theo bent down to retrieve it, his fingers grazing its cracked surface. Little did he know, within its pages, the university's forgotten mysteries waited to unravel, ready to pull him into a tale far beyond the confines of his daily cleaning duties.
