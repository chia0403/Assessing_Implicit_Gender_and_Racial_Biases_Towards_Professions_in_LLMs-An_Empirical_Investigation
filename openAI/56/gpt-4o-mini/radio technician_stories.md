**Story Opening and Setting**

The sun had barely risen over the small coastal town of Maple Bay, casting a golden glow across the waves that lapped lazily at the shore. Sea gulls cried out their morning greetings as they circled above, while the scent of salt and damp earth hung softly in the air. The streets, almost empty at this hour, were lined with quaint, weathered houses painted in cheerful hues, remnants of a time when the town bustled with fishermen and sailors.

In the heart of this sleepy town stood a modest workshop, its sign swinging gently in the breeze. The door creaked open to reveal the cluttered interior filled with the hum of machinery and the faint crackle of static. Shelves lined with components, diodes, and old circuit boards spoke of years spent tinkering away. Amidst the organized chaos sat twenty-eight-year-old **Ethan Albright**, a dedicated radio technician known for his uncanny ability to breathe life back into obsolete equipment.

Ethan, with his tousled dark hair and smudged glasses, was hunched over a workbench cluttered with parts from a vintage radio transmitter he had salvaged from a nearby shipwreck. The project was more than just a repair; it was a portal to another era, a chance to connect with voices from the past that spoke in static and resonance. Outside, the town was waking up, but Ethan was lost in a world of frequency and waveform, his fingers deftly navigating the delicate components as he adjusted the tuning dials, hoping to capture a faint signal from beyond the horizon.
