In the heart of Stonebridge, a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and verdant pastures, stood a small butcher shop known as “Harrison’s Meats.” The shop was a humble structure, its wooden sign hanging slightly askew above the door, the letters chipped and faded yet still proud in their declaration. The savory aroma of cured meats and rich broths spilled onto the cobblestone street, mingling with the sweet scent of blossoming wildflowers that danced in the gentle spring breeze.

Behind the sturdy oak counter, meticulously arranged with cuts of meat glistening under the warm glow of a hanging lantern, was a man of sturdy build and weathered hands — Ezekiel Thornton. Known to the locals as "Zeke," Ezekiel was a master butcher who had inherited the craft from his father, who had in turn learned from his own father. The legacy of the knife ran deep in the Thornton family, and Zeke treated each cut as a work of art, finessed with years of tradition.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the village, Zeke sharpened his blade with precision, each scrape of steel against stone echoing softly in the shop. Outside, the villagers began to drift home from market stalls and sweet-smelling bakeries, their laughter and chatter creating a lively backdrop to Zeke's quiet concentration. But tonight was different; an unusual tension crackled in the air, and as he glanced out the window, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was stirring beneath the surface of their tranquil community.
