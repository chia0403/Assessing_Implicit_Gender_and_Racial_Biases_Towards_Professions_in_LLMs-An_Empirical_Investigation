In the dim light of dawn, the fortress of Eldrath loomed against the horizon like a sentinel of stone. Its towering walls, pockmarked with the scars of time and battle, stood resolute against the creeping mist that rolled in from the surrounding woods. As the first rays of sunlight cast a golden hue over the battlements, a solitary figure made his rounds along the parapets, his silhouette sharp against the sky.

This was Aelan Corwin, a stalwart guard of the realm, clad in a weathered gambeson that bore the marks of countless encounters. His face was rugged and worn, a canvas of years spent in unwavering service. Aelan was not just any guard; he was the last line of defense for Eldrath, a stronghold that had endured generations of conflict and treachery. As he paced the ramparts, the chill of the early morning air nipped at his cheeks, a stark reminder of the long day ahead.

The residents of Eldrath were still shrouded in slumber, unaware of the shadows that had begun to stir beyond the safety of the fortress walls. Aelan’s keen eyes scanned the treeline, searching for movement in the stillness. He could feel the weight of his duty pressing upon him, not just to protect the sprawling land of Eldrath, but to safeguard secrets that, if revealed, could shatter the fragile peace they had fought so hard to maintain.

With the sun rising ever higher, Aelan’s thoughts drifted to the legends whispered among the guards—tales of an ancient power hidden deep within the forest, waiting for a champion brave enough to uncover it. Little did he know, destiny was already weaving its intricate tapestry around him, promising adventure beyond his wildest dreams and challenges that would test his loyalty and courage like never before.
