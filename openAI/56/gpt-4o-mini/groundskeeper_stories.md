In the heart of Everwood Manor, where sprawling gardens and ancient oaks whispered secrets to the wind, the scent of damp earth filled the air as dawn's light pierced through the morning mist. The grand estate, with its ivy-clad stone walls and ornate wrought-iron gates, stood as a testament to a time of opulence long past. The flowerbeds bloomed in wild abandon, a riot of colors battling for attention, while the perfectly manicured lawns seemed to roll like waves beneath the early spring breeze.

Among this floral splendor moved Arthur Pembroke, the manor's dedicated groundskeeper. With hands well-worn from years of toil and a sun-kissed face creased into a thoughtful frown, he tended to his domain with a devotion that bordered on reverence. A tattered straw hat perched atop his head shielded his greying hair, while a faded green apron adorned his frame—a symbol of both his craft and his quiet pride.

As Arthur knelt to prune a stubborn rose bush, the tranquility of the morning was disrupted by a distant barking sound, growing louder with each passing moment. Setting his clippers aside, he rose to his feet, the earthy smelling of soil clinging to his jeans, and turned his attention toward the edge of the estate where the sprawling woods met the manicured gardens. The air crackled with an undercurrent of tension, and Arthur felt a familiar stir in his gut—a sense that today would bring an unexpected visitor, and with that, change was afoot.
