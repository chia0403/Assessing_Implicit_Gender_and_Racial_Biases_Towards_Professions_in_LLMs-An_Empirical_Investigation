The sun had just begun its descent behind the jagged mountains, casting long shadows over the cracked asphalt of Highway 57. Dust swirled in the late afternoon light, caught in the glow of fluorescent orange cones lining the road like sentinels guarding the scene of a laborious ballet. The steady hum of passing cars echoed in the distance, a reminder of the world speeding by while one man stood still.

Ethan James Holloway adjusted the brim of his weathered hard hat, his hands calloused and worn from years of toil under the sun. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his glove, every fiber of his being tuned to the rhythm of the job that anchored his life. The scent of hot asphalt mixed with the earthy aroma of sagebrush, familiar and oddly comforting to him. Farther down the roadside, flanked by his fellow workers, heavy machinery rumbled as they repaired the crumbling infrastructure that served as the veins of the community.

It was a typical day on the job, but as Ethan surveyed the encroaching twilight, he noticed something unusual flickering in the distanceâ€”a light, steady and persistent, dancing just beyond the horizon. The sensation of being watched prickled at the back of his neck, urging his instincts to rise. Distracted, he turned to his crew, their laughter and camaraderie a stark contrast to the shadow lurking in his thoughts, unaware that their shared laughter might soon be replaced by an ominous silence.
