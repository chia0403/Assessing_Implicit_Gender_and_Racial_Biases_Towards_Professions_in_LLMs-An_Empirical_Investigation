The sun was just beginning to set, casting a warm golden light across the gleaming marble floors of the Grand Verity Hotel. The lobby was a hive of activity, bustling with guests and staff alike, as the faint tinkling of a grand piano echoed from the lounge. The air was thick with the scent of expensive perfume and polished wood, a testament to the hotel’s illustrious history.

At the center of this whirlwind was twenty-two-year-old Timothy Harrington, a bellhop with a flair for brightening the gloomiest of days. Dressed in his crisp black uniform with a cheerful red cap perched at a jaunty angle, Timothy moved effortlessly through the crowd, his arms loaded with bags and luggage of all shapes and sizes. He had an infectious smile that could light up even the darkest corners of the old hotel, and remarkably, none of the stress of the bustling lobby seemed to touch him. 

As he navigated the mingling guests—families checking in, couples sharing tentative glances, and the occasional high-powered business mogul lost in thought—Timothy couldn’t help but feel a thrill of anticipation. He had been at The Grand Verity for just a year, but each day promised new encounters and stories. With an eager heart and a head full of dreams, he stepped toward the ornate elevator doors, ready to whisk another batch of guests to their awaited rooms, wondering what adventures awaited him beyond the polished elevators and shimmering chandeliers.
