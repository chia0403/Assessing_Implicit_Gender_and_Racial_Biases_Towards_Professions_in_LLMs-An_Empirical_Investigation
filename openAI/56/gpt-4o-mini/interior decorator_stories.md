The first rays of sunlight streamed through the large bay windows of the Fiddler’s Point estate, casting a warm glow on the remnants of the previous night’s rain. Beads of water clung to the glistening leaves of the magnolia tree outside, a gentle reminder of the storm that had rattled the sleepy coastal town of Southampton.
