In the early hours of dawn, when the sky was a subdued tapestry of deep purples and blues, Cole Harrington stood at the edge of a long stretch of highway known to locals as the Moonlit Mile. The road cut through an expanse of endless green fields, undulating slightly like a dark ribbon laid gently across a quilt of early mist. In the distance, the faint silhouettes of the Appalachian foothills rose like guardians of the horizon, their peaks veiled in the lingering touch of night.

Cole's boots crunched on the gravel shoulder, the sound echoing in the cool, crisp air as he surveyed the task ahead. His sharp eyes, seasoned from years of early morning starts, caught every imperfection in the asphalt, each crack and divot a reminder of the relentless passage of time and weather. The pale yellow beam of his flashlight danced across the road, casting long shadows that danced and flickered like specters retreating from the approaching dawn.

A solitary figure in his orange reflective vest, Cole was the embodiment of steadfast dedication—a silent sentinel ensuring that the arteries connecting small towns and distant cities remained open and safe. As a highway worker for the state, he found a certain kind of peace in these moments before the world awoke, where the only sounds came from the whispering breeze and the occasional rustle of a small animal in the underbrush.

By the time the sun would crest over the hills, painting the sky with hues of gold and crimson, Cole's team would be out in full force, machinery rumbling and tools clattering, transforming the solitude of this morning stillness into a symphony of progress and repair. But for now, in this brief sanctuary of silence and solitude, Cole allowed himself a rare and fleeting smile, content with the knowledge that he was part of something larger—a keeper of the roads that wove together countless lives and stories.
