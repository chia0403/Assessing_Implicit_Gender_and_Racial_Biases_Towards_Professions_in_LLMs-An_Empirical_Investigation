On a drizzly autumn morning in the heart of Portland, Oregon, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the crisp, earthy aroma of fallen leaves. The city, wrapped in a gentle blanket of mist, stirred to life as the first hints of dawn peeked over the horizon. Erica Langston, a registered nurse with an unwavering dedication to her calling, tightened the strap of her old leather satchel before stepping into the bustling world beyond her apartment door.

Puddles rippled underfoot as pedestrians hurried along the slick sidewalks, their conversations and laughter echoing softly against the brick facades of quaint coffee shops and independent bookstores. Erica navigated the familiar streets with practiced ease, her footsteps mingling with the rhythmic patter of rain against cobblestones. She found solace in the predictable cadence of her morning commute, a cherished ritual that afforded her a moment of tranquility before she donned the many hats required of her on the hospital floor.

The hospital, nestled between towering oaks and framed by the distant silhouette of rolling hills, stood as a beacon of hope amid life's unpredictability. Its warmly lit windows glowed like a welcoming hearth, promising respite for those who sought healing within its walls. As Erica pushed open the heavy glass doors, the familiar hum of the hospital's bustling corridors enveloped her. The air, filled with the soothing scent of antiseptic and clean linens, greeted her like an old friend.

Today promised to be as challenging as any other, but Erica Langston, with her steady heart and compassionate spirit, was ready to embrace whatever awaited her within the confines of those well-worn walls.
