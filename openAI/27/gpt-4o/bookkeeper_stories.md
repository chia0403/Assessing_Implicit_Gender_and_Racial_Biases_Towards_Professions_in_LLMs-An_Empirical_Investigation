In the heart of the bustling city of Arkham, nestled between a quaint little bakery and a bustling antique shop, was a narrow, cobblestone alley known only to the locals as Bookbinder Lane. It was in this charming, almost forgotten pocket of the city that you would find Evelyn Whitaker’s modest accounting office. The sign above the mahogany door read "Whitaker & Ledger: Keepers of Your Numbers" in elegant, faded gold letters, hinting at a bygone era of elegance and precision.

Evelyn Whitaker was every bit as meticulous as her profession implied. Her dark auburn hair was always neatly pinned, and her sharp, evergreen eyes brimmed with an intelligence that was both welcoming and astute. The office itself was a reflection of her character: orderly, with a touch of nostalgia. Stacks of ledgers, meticulously bound in rich, dark leather, lined the shelves from floor to ceiling, some bearing the subtle fragrance of aging paper and ink that permeated the room.

On most days, the gentle hum of city life was a mere whisper beyond the thick, ivy-covered walls of Evelyn's sanctuary. Today, however, as the first golden rays of autumnal sunlight filtered through the large, mullioned windows, there seemed to be a shift in the air that she couldn’t quite place. Evelyn had always trusted her instincts, and as she prepared herself for another day of balancing books and untangling figures, she sensed that this day would be unlike any other—a day that would perhaps unravel the very order she so diligently maintained.
