In the heart of downtown Cloverfield, where skyscrapers clawed at the sky and the streets below pulsed with the ceaseless rhythm of city life, stood the majestic old Warner Building. A relic of the roaring twenties, its once-glorious stone façade now bore the marks of time; weathered and wise like an ancient titan silently observing the passage of generations. It was within these hallowed halls that Eugene "Gene" Calder, a janitor with a heart as vast as his collection of vintage vinyl records, found his life's purpose.

As dawn's tender light began its gentle creep over the horizon, slipping slyly between the narrow alleys, Gene arrived at his post—a rusted set of keys jangling at his hip in harmony with the quiet patter of his steps. The lobby of the Warner Building seemed to awaken at his presence, the checkerboard floor gleaming under the touch of his mop and the brass detail of the elevator doors shining a little brighter with each pass of his cloth.

Gene, who had grown up in the shadows of towering tenements in East Cloverfield, had always been a listener in a city full of talkers. And here, amidst the whispers of history embedded in the building's walls, he found solace and a sense of belonging that eluded him elsewhere. His hands bore the calluses of a thousand shifts, and his deep-set eyes, though perpetually framed by fatigue, sparkled with the quiet satisfaction of a man who cherished every tick of the clock and every echo of the past within those stone corridors.
