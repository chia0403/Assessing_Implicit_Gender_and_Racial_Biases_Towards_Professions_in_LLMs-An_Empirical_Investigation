In the quiet town of Willow Creek, where the morning mist clung to the surface of the river like a secret half-shared, the sun rose lazily over rows of quaint, timber-framed houses. This was a place where everyone knew each other's names and life moved at the gentle pace of the river's current.

On the corner of Maple and Sycamore stood a modest brick bungalow, its eaves lined with vibrant pots of petunias that swayed in the crisp morning breeze. A well-used tool bag rested by the mailbox, as familiar to its owner as the morning ritual of coffee and toast. This was the home of Tobias "Toby" Elliston, Willow Creek's only electrician, a man whose skill and kindness lit up as many lives as it did homes.

Toby was a man in his early thirties, with the kind of rugged charm bestowed by hours spent coaxing life into the wires that threaded the town. His hair was a riotous tumble of chestnut curls, constantly speckled with dust and stray flecks of insulation tape. There was a certain steadiness about him, an anchor in a town prone to drifting with the seasons. Each morning, he could be found seated on his porch, sipping the last of his coffee while surveying the sleepy streets like a captain at the helm of a contentedly idling ship.

As the sun climbed higher, spilling gold across Willow Creek's streets, Toby slung his tool bag over his shoulder and headed for his trusty van parked on the gravel driveway. Today was set to be unlike any other, yet he met it with the same quiet resolve. The air crackled with something more than electricity this morningâ€”a sense of impending change that even Toby's practiced hands couldn't quite ground. Little did he know, the tasks of the day would lead him to places his heart had long forgotten how to navigate.
