In the dense heart of Oregon's sprawling timberland, where the early morning mist clung to the towering evergreens like a ghostly shroud, Rory Langston started his day. The forest seemed endless, a sea of verdant giants stretching skyward, their branches whispering secrets carried by the brisk dawn wind. Rory, a seasoned logger in his mid-thirties with steel-gray eyes and calloused hands that spoke of years spent in labor, stood at the edge of a logging site, the rumble of chainsaws and the acrid scent of pine resin filling the air.

The sun was just peeking over the horizon, casting long shadows across the landscape littered with stumps and scattered timber remnants. It was a raw, untamed place, where nature's beauty met the rugged demands of Rory's trade. His father had worked these woods before him, and the legacy of generations was etched in every fallen tree and every path forged through the underbrush.

Rory's truck rested nearby, its bed sagging under the weight of freshly cut logs, each needing to be carefully loaded and transported to the sawmill on the other side of the valley. He surveyed his domain, the forest's enormity both humbling and empowering. Here, amidst the cacophony of the logging world, the wilderness was both ally and adversary, a realm where Rory Langston's life and work were inextricably entwined.
