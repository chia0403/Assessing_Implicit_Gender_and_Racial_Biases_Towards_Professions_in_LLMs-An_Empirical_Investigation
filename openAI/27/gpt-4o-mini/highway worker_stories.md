**Title: Paving Shadows**

**Setting:**
The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden hue over the quiet stretch of Highway 47, where the asphalt shimmered like a black mirror reflecting the vastness of the open fields beside it. This remote stretch of road, bordered by wildflowers and tall grasses swaying gently in the late afternoon breeze, was often overlooked by travelers more intent on reaching their destinations than appreciating the simple beauty of the landscape. A constant hum of cicadas filled the air, their song punctuating the silence of the rural highway. A weathered sign indicating the nearest town was barely visible through the undergrowth, hinting at the isolation that surrounded it.

**Story Opening:**
On this languid afternoon, the sound of crunching gravel and rumbling machinery broke the stillness as the sun-baked earth vibrated beneath the thrum of construction equipment. Clad in a bright orange safety vest, the sun reflecting off his hard hat, thirty-eight-year-old **Walter James McGraw** wiped the sweat from his brow, his calloused hands steady against the handle of the tar kettle. The aroma of fresh asphalt filled the air, mingling with the sweetness of blooming clover—an unusual scent combination that had become all too familiar for him over the years.

Walter had been a highway worker for as long as he could remember, each day a repetition of the last—the sun rising, the earth being laid down layer by layer beneath him, and the small victories found in the achievement of a freshly paved road. He often thought of the people who would drive over the surfaces he'd helped to create, blissfully unaware of the sweat, laughter, and occasional arguments that went into every mile. 

As he knelt to inspect the smoothness of the asphalt patch before him, memories flashed through his mind—of long summers spent with his father, the lessons learned on the job, and the promise he had made to himself to honor their work. But today was different; a shroud of unease loomed over him. The sky had darkened with heavy clouds on the horizon, and something about this stretch of road felt unsettling, as if the land itself was whispering secrets long buried. Walter paused, squinting into the distance where the trees lined the highway, shadows creeping closer as the light began to fade.
