In the heart of Dawson Hollow, where the old brick buildings stood like silent sentinels against the backdrop of a gray autumn sky, the faint scent of electricity crackled in the air. It was early afternoon, and the sun struggled to break through the thick clouds, casting a muted glow over the town. Leaves danced in the chilly breeze, fluttering to the ground like the whispered remnants of summer’s warmth.

At the edge of town, just beyond a dilapidated fence lined with overgrown weeds, sat a once-vibrant Victorian house now cloaked in shadows. Its paint peeled like forgotten whispers, and the windows were darkened eyes that seemed to watch the world pass by. It was here that Carson Matthew Peppers, a seasoned electrician with a knack for bringing life back into the forgotten corners of old buildings, approached with his toolbox in hand.

Carson had always been drawn to the unseen magic of wiring and circuits. Each time he stepped into a darkened room, it was like stepping into a world of possibility, where the flick of a switch could brighten the darkest of spaces. Today, he was called to the Victorian for what was rumored to be a serious electrical issue—one that frightened away potential buyers from this crumbling jewel. Dressed in his worn flannel shirt and sturdy work boots, he took a deep breath, feeling the weight of history in the air as he opened the gate. Little did he know, this job would uncover far more than faulty wiring—it would unravel secrets that had long been hidden within the walls of the old house.
