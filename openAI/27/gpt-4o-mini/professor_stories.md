Title: **Whispers of the Forgotten**

Opening:

The scent of aged parchment and ink filled the air of the dimly lit library, the towering shelves casting shadows across the polished wooden floor. Outside, the first droplets of rain began to patter against the tall, arched windows of Harwood University, a venerable institution nestled in the heart of a sleepy New England town. Inside, Professor Lillian Margaret Hargrove stood at her desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and half-finished manuscripts, the soft glow of her desk lamp illuminating her determined expression. 

As she adjusted her glasses and glanced at the cluttered notes strewn about her workspace, Lillian’s heart raced with the thrill of discovery that had driven her for over a decade. She was on the cusp of unraveling a mystery hidden within the pages of history, one that could challenge everything her colleagues believed about the founding of the university itself. Yet, as the storm outside intensified, a sense of foreboding settled over her—a reminder that some secrets were meant to remain buried. 

In that moment, she couldn’t shake the feeling that someone, or something, was watching her from the shadows of the library, waiting for her to uncover what had long been forgotten.
