The moon hung low in the indigo sky, its silvery light spilling over the worn cobblestones of Eldermere's fortress. Shadows danced in the corners of the courtyard, where the whispers of ancient stones spoke secrets of the past. The air was crisp, a hint of winter’s breath creeping in from the northern woods beyond the walls. 

At the fortress’s entrance stood Tobias Aldencrest, a sentinel in the service of Duke Lysander. Clad in a weathered leather uniform, his chestnut hair was pulled back into a neat braid that hung down his back, while his sharp azure eyes scanned the surrounding darkness with unyielding vigilance. The chill in the air nipped at his skin, but he paid it little mind; he had spent years patrolling these grounds and knew that danger often lurked where least expected.

As the clock tower tolled midnight, a faint rustling stirred in the nearby shrubbery, and Tobias tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword. Eldermere had seen better days, and tales of restless spirits and thieves had become all too common. With a steady breath, he prepared to confront whatever dared to break the fortress's stillness, knowing that tonight, the shadows might hold more than just echoes of the night.
