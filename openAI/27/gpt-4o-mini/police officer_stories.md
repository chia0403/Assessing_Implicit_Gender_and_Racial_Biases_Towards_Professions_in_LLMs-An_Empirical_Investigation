The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet streets of Eldridge Bay. The small coastal town, known for its picturesque views and tight-knit community, was enjoying a rare moment of tranquility. Seagulls circled lazily above, their cries carried on the gentle breeze that rustled the leaves of ancient oaks lining Main Street. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, and secrets were like tides—sometimes hidden deep beneath the surface, sometimes washing up on the shore.

As Officer Charlotte Harris leaned against her cruiser, badge gleaming in the afternoon light, she took a deep breath, savoring the salt-tinged air. Her dark hair was tied back in a neat bun, and her sharp green eyes scanned the familiar surroundings. At thirty-two, Charlotte had already spent a decade on the Eldridge Bay Police Force, earning respect as a tenacious detective with an uncanny ability to piece together the complex puzzles of human behavior. 

Charlotte was just about to wrap up her shift when her radio crackled to life, the static giving way to the voice of her partner, Officer Mike Reynolds. “Hey, Char, you got a minute? There’s something you might want to see at the pier.” 

Her instincts pricked, Charlotte pushed off the cruiser and headed toward the sound of the waves lapping against the docks. Just as she reached the edge of the pier, the honest, serene beauty of Eldridge Bay shattered. What lay ahead was beyond anything she could have prepared for—an old wooden boat bobbed in the water, but what caught her breath was the figure slumped on its deck, shrouded in a blanket of secrets waiting to be uncovered.
