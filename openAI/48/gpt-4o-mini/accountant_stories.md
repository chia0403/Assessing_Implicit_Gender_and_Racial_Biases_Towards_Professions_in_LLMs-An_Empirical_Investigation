**Title: The Numbers Beneath**

**Setting:** 

The small town of Eldridge lay nestled between rolling hills, where the early morning fog clung to the ground like a soft blanket. The streets were lined with charming brick buildings, their aged facades whispering stories of generations past. At the heart of Eldridge stood a quaint accounting firm, McAllister & Co., nestled between a bakery that wafted the scent of fresh pastries into the air and a bookstore filled with the rustle of turning pages. It was a bustling yet serene environment, where the community felt tight-knit, and every day seemed to unfold at a deliberate pace.

**Opening:**

As the sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm golden light across the office of McAllister & Co., Olivia June Harper sat at her desk, surrounded by a sea of neatly stacked papers and glowing computer screens. The rhythmic tapping of her keyboard punctuated the quiet as she meticulously entered figures into her accounting software, her brow slightly furrowed in concentration. Olivia, a thirty-two-year-old accountant with an unyielding passion for numbers, had always found solace in the precision of her work. Her auburn hair was pulled into a tidy bun, and her tortoiseshell glasses perched delicately on her nose, giving her a scholarly air.

Today, however, was different. A troubling anomaly had surfaced in the financial reports for one of her long-time clients, the local hardware store, Hargrove’s Tools & Supply. As she pored over the figures, a sense of unease curled in her stomach. Amidst the perfectly aligned columns and familiar line items, something felt amiss, beckoning her toward a truth hidden just beneath the surface. Little did Olivia know, this would be the beginning of an unexpected journey that would intertwine her life with the mysteries of Eldridge—and test her skills in ways she had never imagined.
