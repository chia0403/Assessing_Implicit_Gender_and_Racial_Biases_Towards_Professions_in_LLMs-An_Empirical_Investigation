The sun dipped below the jagged horizon of the Rocky Mountains, casting long shadows over the small town of Silver Creek. The air was crisp and laced with the scent of pine, a far cry from the chaos that often filled the sky above. Amelia Grace Harrington stood outside her weathered Cessna 172, running her fingers over the smooth, sun-faded blue paint that had once gleamed like the summer sky.

Amelia was the only female pilot in town, a title she wore with a mixture of pride and defiance. At thirty-two, she was the owner of Silver Creek Aviation, a flight school nestled between the mountains and the sprawling meadows where wildflowers danced in the evening breeze. Despite the comforting routine of her job, a restless spirit tugged at her heart, hinting at adventures yet to unfold.

As the last rays of sunlight spilled over her shoulders, she felt a familiar pull towards the sky—a reminder of her father’s words, whispered to her as a child: “The world looks different from up there, Amelia. Never stop dreaming.” With her hands still resting on the plane, she gazed up at the vast expanse of indigo, dotted with the first twinkling stars. Tonight, like so many before, the sky beckoned her, promising stories untold and places unseen. Little did she know, a storm was brewing on the horizon, one that would challenge everything she thought she knew about the world—and herself.
