The sun had barely crested the horizon, casting a muted golden light across the sprawling city of Eldergrove. The air was thick with the scent of damp concrete and fresh paint, remnants of the construction next door that had been ongoing for weeks. In the heart of this bustling metropolis, where glass towers kissed the sky and the streets thrummed with the energy of morning commuters, lay a modest drafting studio tucked between two high-rises.

Inside, the hum of fluorescent lights mingled with the soft scratch of pencils gliding over paper and the low buzz of conversations. It was within these walls that Avery Malcolm, a dedicated drafting worker with an eye for detail and a passion for design, sat hunched over her workstation. Her fair hair was pulled back tightly into a bun, accentuating the determined furrow of her brow as she scrutinized the blueprints spread out before her. 

Avery had always found solace in the precise lines and calculated measurements of her work. Each project represented a world of possibility; a dream slowly taking shape beneath her fingers. Today, she was focused on the architectural plans for a new community center—a project that could breathe life into the aging neighborhood they called home. As she traced the outline of a curved roof, she felt the weight of responsibility on her shoulders, knowing that her designs could either uplift the community or fall flat, like so many half-finished buildings that surrounded her.

Outside, the city awoke around her—the distant wail of sirens, the laughter of children heading to school, the rhythmic thud of footsteps on the pavement. In here, it was just Avery, her drafting table, and a world waiting to be born. But today, something felt different; an unspoken tension hung in the air, as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for a spark that could ignite the day.
