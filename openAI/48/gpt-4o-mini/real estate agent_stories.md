The first light of dawn crept over the skyline of Brighton, casting a golden hue across the glistening waters of the Atlantic. It was a city already coming to life, where the salt air mingled with the scent of fresh coffee wafting from bustling cafes. On this particular Tuesday morning, Eleanor Margaret Collins stood at the expansive window of her sleek office, the glass framing her view of the beach that had once been her second home. 

Eleanor had always viewed the world through the lens of opportunity—each shimmering wave a potential new beginning for her clients, and every sun-drenched street a canvas for their dreams. As a leading real estate agent in the area, she held a treasure trove of listings: quaint bungalows, modern lofts, and sprawling coastal estates, all waiting for the right person to unlock their doors. 

Today, however, felt different. Eleanor could sense an undercurrent of change in the air, as if the salt breeze carried whispers of secrets just waiting to be unveiled. She pulled her dark hair into a tidy bun, letting out a breath that echoed her determination. With a self-assured nod, she straightened her tailored blazer, glancing at the framed photos of happy clients on her desk—memories of moments made possible through her hard work and unwavering dedication.

Tapping her phone, Eleanor reviewed her schedule. The usual meetings, property viewings, and market analysis loomed ahead, but hidden within the day’s agenda was a listing that could alter everything—a historic mansion rumored to be haunted, tucked away on the outskirts of town. Intrigued, Eleanor couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t just another sale; it could very well be the key to unlocking her own past as well.
