**Title: Spirits of the Past**

**Setting:** The Moonlit Tavern, a cozy, dimly lit bar nestled along the cobblestone streets of Old Town. The walls are adorned with vintage photographs of the city from decades past, and the warm glow of amber light casts playful shadows over wooden tabletops. The faint sound of jazz drifts from an old piano in the corner, a testament to the establishment’s storied history. Outside, a gentle rain patters against the narrow windows, creating a comforting rhythm that harmonizes with the soft conversations inside.

**Opening:**

As the clock struck eight, the door to The Moonlit Tavern swung open, letting in a swirl of misty air and the faint scent of rain-soaked asphalt. Behind the polished mahogany bar, Mira Elowen Harris wiped a glass clean and placed it upside down on the shelf, her mind drifting between the swirling notes of the jazz melody and the memories held within the tavern’s walls. With her auburn hair tied back in a loose bun, and a small silver hoop earring glinting under the warm lights, she was a picture of calm efficiency. 

Mira had been tending bar at The Moonlit Tavern for nearly five years, yet each night felt like the first in a place that breathed stories. Regulars settled into their favorite stools, the low hum of laughter mingling with the soft clinking of ice in glasses as she crafted classic cocktails. However, this particular evening, a chill crept into the air, hinting at secrets waiting just beyond the horizon.

“Mira!” called out an all-too-familiar voice, breaking her reverie. She turned to see Charlie, an old friend with a penchant for mischief, navigating the crowd. “You won't believe who I just spotted outside!” 

Mira raised an eyebrow, curiosity piquing as she wiped her hands on her apron. In a bar where memories flowed as freely as the whiskey, there was always a chance that the past would come knocking at the door.
