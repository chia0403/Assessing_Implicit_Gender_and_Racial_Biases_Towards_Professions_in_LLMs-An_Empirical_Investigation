**Story Opening:**

The morning sun filtered through the tall pines that lined Maplewood Lane, casting dappled shadows across the charming New England village. Nestled between a quaint café and a small bookstore, **Harmony Chiropractic Clinic** stood with a rustic sign swaying gently in the light breeze. The air was crisp with the scent of early autumn; leaves were just beginning to blush in vibrant shades of orange and gold.

Inside the clinic, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, filled with soft instrumental music and the faint smell of lavender from the essential oil diffuser. **Dr. Evelyn Grace Thornton**, a dedicated chiropractor in her early thirties, meticulously arranged her treatment room. With her warm hazel eyes and a reassuring smile, she had a way of making her patients feel at ease almost instantly. Each day brought new stories and challenges, yet Evelyn approached them with the same unwavering passion that had inspired her to open her own practice.

As she placed a stack of fresh towels on the shelf, Evelyn reflected on the dream that had driven her for so long. It was more than just a job; it was a calling to help others regain their strength, mobility, and happiness. Today, however, felt different. There was an undercurrent she couldn’t quite shake, a sense of change looming just beyond her cozy world—a feeling she brushed aside as she prepared for her first patient. Little did she know, the day would unravel a mystery that could alter the course of her life and practice entirely.
