The sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the ancient stone walls of Blackthorn Keep. The air was thick with the scents of earth and damp moss, mingled with the faint tang of the sea that crashed against the nearby cliffs. It was in this rugged fortress, a sentinel against invaders from the north, that Gregory Alaric jones perched near the battlements.

Gregory, a soldier of mixed heritage with fiery auburn hair and keen emerald eyes, stood vigilant under his heavy chainmail, the weight of his duties evident in the lines etched on his brow. Blackthorn Keep had seen centuries of conflict, and its walls whispered the tales of those who had fought and fallen beneath its banner. His gaze swept over the rolling hills that shrouded the village of Eldermere, a quaint settlement nestled in the valley belowâ€”a place where children played and laughter often mingled with the clanking of metal from the forge.

As twilight deepened, the first stars twinkled faintly above, illuminating the secluded paths that wound through the woods. Gregory's thoughts drifted to his younger sister, Lila, who lived in Eldermere. She brought color to his otherwise disciplined life, her laughter a balm against the weight of his responsibilities. Just then, the stillness of the evening was shattered by the clamor of hooves on cobblestones, pulling his attention from reverie.

He adjusted his grip on the spear, eyes narrowing as a group of riders topped the hill. Cloaked figures on horseback, their intentions unknown, bore down toward the keep at a troubling speed. The night was young, but the shadows had a way of concealing danger, and Gregory felt an unsettling ripple of foreboding skitter down his spine. He had sworn to protect this place, to guard the secrets it held, and now, it seemed, those secrets were about to be tested.
