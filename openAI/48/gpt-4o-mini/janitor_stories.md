**Title: The Echoes of Yesterday**

In the dimly lit hallways of Alderwood High, where the scent of aged books mingled with the remnants of chalk dust, Lawrence Edgar Palmer navigated the labyrinthine corridors with his trusty broom in hand. The clock struck seven, casting long shadows as the last remnants of daylight slipped through the tall windows, leaving the once bustling school in an eerie stillness. 

Every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Lawrence transformed from a mere janitor into the silent observer of the echoes that haunted Alderwood. He had worked here for nearly a decade, sweeping away the remnants of neglected dreams and forgotten ambitions, yet it was the secrets of the school that intrigued him the most. 

With a keen eye that had seen much more than dirt and debris, Lawrence often wondered about the stories trapped within these walls: the laughter that once filled the gymnasium, the tears shed in the quiet corners of the library, and the whispers of a thousand students who walked these halls before him. As he ventured deeper into the shadows, a familiar creak echoed beneath his feet, the old wooden floorboards seeming to sigh with the weight of history. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A chill snaked through the corridors, and the air crackled with an unusual energy. Lawrence paused near the entrance of the chemistry lab, where remnants of an experiment lay scattered across the counter—a testament to frenetic youth that had faded like the ghosts that lingered. He gripped his broom tightly, feeling the wood's rough familiarity, and took a breath, ready to sweep away the drifts of another ordinary night. Little did he know, he was about to stumble upon a mystery that would change everything he thought he knew about Alderwood High—and himself.
