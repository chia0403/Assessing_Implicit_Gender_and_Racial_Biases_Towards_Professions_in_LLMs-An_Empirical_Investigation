**Title: Beneath the Asphalt Sky**

**Setting:**  
The sun hung low over the edge of the asphalt highway, casting long shadows that stretched like fingers across the endless ribbon of pavement. The air was thick with the scent of hot tar and the faint hum of cicadas, mingling with the occasional rumble of passing trucks. A state-of-the-art road crew vehicle was parked just off the shoulder, a patchwork of traffic cones outlining the work zone. Wisps of golden grass poked through the cracks in the concrete, resilient and stubborn, much like the men and women who toiled there.

**Opening:**  
James Arthur Monroe stood with his hands on his hips, surveying the stretch of highway that seemed to ripple under the unrelenting summer sun. With his hard hat tilted slightly forward, the sweat trickling down his brow served as a reminder of the relentless August heat. James, known simply as “Monroe” to his crew, had been working the highways for over a decade, patching, fixing, and mending the thoroughfares that connected the bustling towns dotting the map. 

Today was different, though; there was a knot of unease coiling in his stomach as he watched the horizon. It wasn't just the heat making the air shimmer—there was something in the way the clouds loomed, swollen and heavy, threatening a downpour that could wash away the week’s work. As he reached for his walkie-talkie, he couldn’t shake the feeling that today’s shift would push him beyond a simple day’s labor. The road ahead, both literal and figurative, felt uncertain, and beneath the familiar cadence of honking horns and the distant crunch of gravel, he sensed a storm brewing—a storm he wasn’t quite ready to face.
