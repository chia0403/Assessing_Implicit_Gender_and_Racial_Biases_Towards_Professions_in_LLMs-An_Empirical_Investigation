The morning sun spilled gently through the tall windows of the Grand Sovereign Hotel, its rays casting golden pools across the polished marble floors of the lobby. The air was alive with the subtle hum of conversation, the clatter of luggage wheels, and the distant tinkling of a piano from the lounge. Guests bustled in and out, their faces a kaleidoscope of excitement and fatigue, each bearing stories from distant lands and dreams of once-in-a-lifetime adventures.

In the midst of this grand symphony, Nathaniel "Nate" Montgomery stepped forward, his smartly pressed uniform a vivid royal blue, trimmed with gleaming gold buttons. His cap sat snugly on his head, casting a shadow over his inquisitive green eyes. Nate had been a bell hop at the Grand Sovereign for nearly five years, and yet, despite the countless comings and goings, he never tired of the stories that every new guest brought with them.

Today, as Nate moved gracefully from guest to guest, his gaze drifted toward the towering chandelier that dominated the lobby, its crystals dancing in the morning light. It was said to have been imported from a castle in Austria, a gift from a prince to his long-lost love. Nate liked stories like that—grand, sweeping tales that found their place in the echoes of the past and slid quietly into the present, much like the guests he welcomed every day.

But for Nate, there was a story of his own unraveling, one that began not with the clinking of luggage nor the echoing footfalls but with a letter—a letter that had arrived only this morning, bearing news that would change everything he thought he knew about the place he had come to call home.
