Detective Evelyn Martinez stood at the edge of the Cobblestone Harbor, the wind tousling her chestnut hair as she surveyed the misty expanse of water before her. The city of Riverton rose behind her, its skyline a jagged silhouette against the gray morning sky. Boats bobbed gently in the inlet, their paint chipped and names half-erased by years of salt and sun. It was a hauntingly beautiful place, where the past seemed to whisper from every creaking dock and weathered brick.

Evelyn had always found a certain solace in the harbor, a quiet retreat from the chaos that often engulfed her life. As a detective with Riverton's Major Crimes Unit, her days were filled with the grittier realities of the city—cases that knotted her mind and often kept her awake until the first light of dawn. But here, at this threshold between land and sea, she could momentarily forget the weight of her badge and the darkness it sometimes entailed.

This morning, however, solace was not her purpose. Evelyn was here following an anonymous tip—a cryptic message that had left more questions than answers. "The truth lies beneath the tide at the Cobblestone Harbor," the note had read. The words had gnawed at her ever since, a mystery she couldn’t ignore.
