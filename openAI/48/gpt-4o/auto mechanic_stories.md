In the dusty outskirts of Willow Creek, where the highway stretched endlessly into the horizon, a small auto repair shop hummed with life. Rusty’s Auto Works stood sandwiched between a faded billboard advertising a long-abandoned amusement park and an old diner known for its greasy spoon specials. The morning sun cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt parking lot, hinting at another sweltering summer's day in the sleepy town.

Inside the shop, the smell of motor oil and metal mingled with the comforting sound of clanging tools and murmured radio tunes from a bygone era. Ethan "Rusty" Carver, the shop’s owner and sole mechanic, wiped his grease-stained hands on a rag as he tightened the bolt of an engine he'd practically rebuilt from scratch. Tall and broad-shouldered, with a rugged face tanned and lined by years under the hot sun, Ethan was known throughout Willow Creek not only for his mechanical skills but also for a heart as reliable as the engines he mended.

As the shop door swung open with a familiar creak, Ethan glanced up to see the morning light streaming in, silhouetting a figure standing against the brightness. It was yet another customer, no doubt in need of his expertise. But in Willow Creek, every car came with a story, and Ethan had learned long ago that fixing engines often meant untangling the knots of people’s lives.
