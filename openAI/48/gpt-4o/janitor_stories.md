In the heart of the bustling city of Eldridge stood the once-majestic Windsor Arena, now a slightly faded but still beloved venue for local performances and community events. The late afternoon sun cast long, golden shadows through the narrow windows, painting a mosaic of light and shadow across the scuffed parquet floors. The gentle hum of the city seeped through the walls, a constant, comforting reminder of life beyond the arena.

Inside, amidst the echoes of laughter and applause from shows gone by, worked Martin Elwood Finch, the arena’s dedicated janitor. For over two decades, Martin's days had begun and ended within these walls, like the steady rhythm of a heart beating to its own tune. With each careful sweep of his broom and purposeful glide of his mop, he maintained the dignity of the place. 

In his early sixties, Martin was a quiet man with kind eyes hidden behind round spectacles, a touch of silver in his hair marking years filled with both challenge and charm. To the community, he was a fixture as beloved as the building itself, though many took for granted the humble dedication he poured into his work.

The lobby was his favorite place, a grand space that welcomed visitors with its high ceiling and intricate moldings—a remnant of a more opulent era. Here, he could often be found as the evening approached, pausing from his tasks to gaze at the framed photographs lining the walls, each capturing a piece of the arena's storied history. 

Today was different, though. Tonight, the Windsor Arena was hosting an event that promised more than the usual crowd, and Martin sensed a lingering anticipation in the air, as though the walls themselves were holding their breath. With his tools of the trade in hand, he was ready to prepare the arena for another night of community and celebration, but not before indulging in a moment's reflection, a brief conversation with the echoes of those who had come before.
