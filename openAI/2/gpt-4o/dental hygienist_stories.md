In the heart of Portland, Maine, where the brisk Atlantic wind carried whispers of the sea through the cobblestone streets, Jenna Caldwell began her day much like any other. The small dental practice on Middle Street, with its charming brick fa√ßade and ivy-covered walls, was a familiar comfort to her. Inside, the scent of vanilla candles mingled with the faint, sterile aroma of antiseptic, creating an oddly soothing atmosphere.

Jenna, a dedicated dental hygienist with a penchant for colorful scrubs and an unwavering smile, had lived in Portland her entire life. Her days were framed by the rhythmic ebb and flow of the ocean tides and the gentle hum of downtown life. As the golden light of early morning streamed through the large bay window of the office, casting elongated shadows across the waiting room, Jenna set out the tools she'd use for her first patient.

Outside, the city was waking up. Commuters sipped coffee from steaming paper cups, their breath visible in the crisp autumn air. Seagulls called out from above, circling in the clear sky over the wharf. Jenna loved this time of year, when leaves turned brilliant shades of orange and red, and the air carried a hint of impending frost. It was a time of change, of preparation for the long winter ahead. As she glanced out at the bustling street, she wondered what changes this new day might bring to her own life.
