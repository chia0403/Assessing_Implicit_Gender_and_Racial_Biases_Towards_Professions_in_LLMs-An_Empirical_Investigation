As the sun began its slow descent behind the jagged silhouette of the Rocky Mountains, a sprawling tapestry of oranges and purples painted the sky above the endless stretch of Interstate 70. The rumble of a solitary eighteen-wheeler—a seasoned Peterbilt 389—cut through the vastness, its headlights piercing the early twilight.

Emma-Jane Harrington, a seasoned trucker known to fellow road warriors as EJ, gripped the wheel with a familiar sense of purpose. Her fingers deftly drummed a rhythm on the worn leather, keeping time with the country ballads streaming from the radio. A collection of state maps lay dog-eared on the passenger seat, though these days EJ could navigate the winding routes and hidden truck stops with her eyes closed.

Beyond the windshield, the land undulated into a patchwork of open plains and scattered farmhouses, each backdropped by towering wind turbines spinning lazily in the evening breeze. EJ had always found solace in the openness of it all—a vast freedom that mirrored her own restless spirit. She understood the highways like old friends, their subtle curves and stretches woven into the fabric of her life.

Her thoughts wandered to the destination ahead—Palisade, Colorado, known for its orchards and vineyards nestled on the Western Slope. The promise of a warm meal and a quiet motoring inn after hours of solitude on the road held a certain allure. But it was the journey itself, the hum of the tires on asphalt, that fed her soul, driving her ever onward into the heart of the lingering dusk.
