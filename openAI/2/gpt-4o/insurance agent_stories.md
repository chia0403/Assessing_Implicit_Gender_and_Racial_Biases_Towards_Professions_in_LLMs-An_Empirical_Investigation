In the heart of the bustling city of Inverness, nestled between the antiquated charm of cobblestone streets and the incessant hum of urban life, stood an unassuming building with a weathered sign that read, "Highland Assurance Agency." The office, situated on the third floor, overlooked the River Ness, its waters shimmering under the mid-morning sunlight. Inside, surrounded by the soft chatter of typewriters and the scent of fresh coffee, sat Callum Fraser McGregor, a man whose astute mind and steady demeanor had earned him a reputation as one of the city's most reliable insurance agents.

Callum's tidy desk was adorned with a small collection of photographs from his many hiking trips into the Scottish Highlands, a stark contrast to the meticulous stacks of paperwork that framed his workspace. His thoughtful gray eyes often shifted from the documents at hand to the window, where he found a momentary escape in the serenity of the river's flow. Though Callum thrived in the precision and order of his profession, it was this quiet connection to nature that truly fueled his spirit. As the clock ticked toward the top of the hour, the phone on Callum's desk rang, cutting through the office's background buzz and heralding the start of another day unraveling the intricacies of human risk alongside the unpredictable beauty of life itself.
