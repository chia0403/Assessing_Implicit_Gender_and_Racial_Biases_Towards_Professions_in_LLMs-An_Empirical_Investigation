In the small, rain-soaked town of Holben, cradled by towering pines and whispering streams, life followed a predictable rhythm. The air was perpetually tinged with the earthy scent of damp moss and the distant murmur of water rushing through narrow, winding creeks. Here, amid the verdant backdrop of the Pacific Northwest, time seemed to stand still, with days unfurling like chapters in an old, beloved book.

It was in this serene yet stoic place that Leonard "Leo" Mattingly plied his trade. Holben’s sole plumber, Leo was both a master of his craft and a keeper of its secrets—one who understood that every drip told a tale, every rush of water sang a song of years gone by. His eyes, a deep umber, held the quiet wisdom of someone who had seen the world through the lens of pipes and faucets, drains and boilers.

Leo’s home, a modest craftsman cottage, sat on the edge of town, its garden neatly trimmed and bursting with late summer blooms. Mornings found him in his small workshop, the gentle clink of tools meeting eager ears that awaited his steady hands. Though his work often led him to the aged homes scattered through the town, it was his van, with its classic "Mattingly Plumbing - Reliable Repairs," painted in worn, but enduring letters on the side, that marked his presence—a symbol of aid as recognizable as the crowing of the morning rooster.

On one particularly mist-laden morning, as the fog clung to the ground like an old friend unwilling to say goodbye, Leo received a call that promised to disrupt Holben’s steadfast calm. As the phone rang in his workshop, echoing against the wooden walls, a feeling Leo couldn't quite place settled in his bones. There was something in the air, something that whispered of change. As he set down his mug of steaming coffee and reached for the receiver, Leo had the distinct impression that whatever awaited him on the other end was the beginning of something unexpected.
