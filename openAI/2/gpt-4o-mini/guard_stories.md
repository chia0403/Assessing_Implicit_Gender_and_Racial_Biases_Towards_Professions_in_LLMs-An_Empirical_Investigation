In the shadowy depths of Valtor Keep, a fortress perched on the jagged cliffs of Eldrim, the air was thick with the scent of moss and damp stone. Echoes of distant waves crashing against the rocks below reverberated through the narrow stone corridors, a constant reminder of the wild sea that guarded this ancient stronghold. Torches flickered against the walls, casting dancing shadows that seemed to whisper secrets of a long-forgotten past.

At the entrance to the Keep, clad in a weathered tunic marked by the insignia of the Silver Guard, stood the stalwart sentinel, Sir Aelric Thorne. With a square jaw and piercing blue eyes that seemed to absorb the pale light, he radiated an air of unwavering vigilance. His armor, though scratched and stained from countless encounters, gleamed dully, reflecting his steadfast commitment to the realm.

It was dawn, and the first rays of sunlight crept hesitantly over the horizon, filtering through the thick clouds that often shrouded Eldrim in an eternal twilight. As the village below slowly awoke, Aelric’s thoughts were consumed by whispers of unrest that had recently reached his ears—rumors of shadows lurking beyond the cliffs and a darkness creeping closer to their shores. 

As the sea breeze tousled his dark hair, Aelric tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, determination etching lines across his brow. Today, he would not just guard the entrance to Valtor Keep; he would uncover the truth hidden in the depths of those shadows, and perhaps, save his home from the encroaching threat that loomed just beyond the horizon.
