In the heart of the rugged mountains of Eldergrove, where ancient pines whispered secrets to the wind and the sun’s rays danced atop jagged cliffs, lay a village cradled in stone and shadow. Among its modest dwellings, tucked away beneath a great overhang of granite, stood the humble workshop of Callum Thorne, a master stone cutter whose hands bore the marks of a lifetime spent shaping the earth’s solid heart.

Callum’s workshop was a symphony of echoes—the rhythmic tap of his chisel against stone, the gentle sigh of dust settling in the waning light, and the distant call of hawks soaring overhead. In this secluded sanctuary, he spent long hours breathing life into raw rock, transforming unyielding boulders into intricate sculptures and sturdy foundations for the homes that sheltered his fellow villagers. The air was infused with the earthy scent of damp stone and the faint tang of metal, as chisels hung from the walls like medals of honor.

Yet, it was not only the stone he shaped; Callum himself was molded by it—by the weight of his tools, the beauty of his creations, and the silent stories held within each fragment of the mountainside he carved. As shadows lengthened and the sun dipped low, new whispers of destiny stirred in the air, hinting that the mountain had more to reveal than just the art of stone.
