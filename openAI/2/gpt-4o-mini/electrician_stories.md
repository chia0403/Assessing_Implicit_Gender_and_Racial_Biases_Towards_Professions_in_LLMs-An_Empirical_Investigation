**Story Opening:**

The air was thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and the distant rumble of thunder when Nathaniel Clark wrestled his toolbox out of the van. Dubbed Nate by friends and family, he had spent years perfecting his craft as an electrician, navigating through tangled wires and flickering circuits with a learned ease. Tonight, however, was different. As he stood in front of the old Crestwood Manor—its once-grand façade now cloaked in peeling paint and creeping ivy—he felt a shiver dance up his spine. The wind howled like a banshee, and low clouds obscured the moon, casting long shadows that flickered in the dark like the ghosts of the past, haunting the overgrown estate.

Nate’s heart raced a little faster as he retrieved his flashlight from the toolbox, the beam cutting through the gloom like a knife. The manor had stood empty for years, whispered about in town as a restless place, harboring secrets that would send a chill down the spine of the bravest souls. But a strange job interview had drawn him here, one that promised not only a hefty payday but also the chance to restore power to the furthest reaches of the creaky old house. He couldn't say no, no matter the unsettling stories he'd heard.

As the first drops of rain began to splatter against the pavement, Nate took a deep breath and stepped toward the heavy wooden door. It creaked open before he could knock, revealing a dimly lit hallway lined with fading photographs and the remnants of a forgotten elegance. He steeled himself and crossed the threshold, not knowing that within those walls lay more than just electrical problems—there were secrets waiting to be unearthed, and perhaps a storm brewing far beyond the weather outside.
