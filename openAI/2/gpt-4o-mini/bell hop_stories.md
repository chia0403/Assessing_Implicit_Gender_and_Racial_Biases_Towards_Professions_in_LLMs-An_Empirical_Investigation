In the heart of New York City, nestled between flashing neon lights and the relentless pulse of pedestrians, stood the opulent Grand Crescent Hotel. An architectural marvel from the 1920s, its polished brass fixtures and marbled floors whispered tales of luxury and forgotten glories. The lobby, adorned with crystal chandeliers that cast a warm glow on the bustling crowd, buzzed with the laughter and chatter of travelers from around the world. 

As the clock neared noon, the revolving door spun endlessly, ushering in guests laden with luggage and hopes of adventure. Among them was a youthful figure dressed in the crisp, emerald uniform of the hotel’s bellhop. His name was Oliver Bennett, a bright-eyed twenty-three-year-old with an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond the hotel’s grand façade.

Oliver had always been enchanted by the stories that drifted through the lobby — tales of romance, adventure, and the faint scent of mystery that seemed to linger in the air. He maneuvered through the crowd with practiced ease, his small frame able to weave between guests like a whisper, always ready to assist with a smile. After serving at the Grand Crescent for nearly a year, he could recall faces and luggage with an impressive memory that often left guests in quiet admiration.

Today, however, held a different air. There was a storm brewing outside, the sky growing darker as ominous clouds gathered like a secret society. As Oliver prepared to make his rounds, a sharp crack of thunder echoed through the lobby, and the lights flickered momentarily. He glanced out the expansive glass doors, half-expecting to see a flood of umbrellas pouring in. Instead, his gaze fell upon a single, drenched figure standing just beyond the threshold—a woman, her expression half-cast in shadows, as if she were stepping from a world unknown. 

Little did Oliver know, this encounter would spark a chain of events that would draw him into a mystery far more thrilling than anything he had ever imagined, challenging his perceptions of reality itself.
