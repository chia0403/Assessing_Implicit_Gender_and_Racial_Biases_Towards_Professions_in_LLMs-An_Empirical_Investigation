In the shimmering light of a late summer afternoon, the coastal town of Crescent Cove bustled with the vibrant energy of tourists and locals alike. Salt-kissed breezes danced through the narrow cobblestone streets, carrying with them the laughter of children and the distant sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore. The air was thick with the scent of fried dough and fresh seafood, enticing passersby to sample the many food stalls that lined the water’s edge. 

At the heart of this lively scene stood a quaint little gallery, its windows adorned with colorful prints of marine life and breathtaking sunsets over the ocean. Inside, beneath the warm glow of soft yellow lights, stood the gallery’s owner and principal artist: Seraphina Claire Everett. Known for her keen eye and undeniable talent, Seraphina was a photographer who captured not just images but stories, each frame a window into the souls of her subjects—from the weathered fishermen hauling in their nets to the curious children chasing the frothy tide.

Today, however, Seraphina was preoccupied, her fingers lightly brushing the edge of a glossy print hanging on the wall. She was preparing for her latest exhibition, a collection that promised to reveal an unseen side of Crescent Cove, one that lay hidden beneath its sunlit facade. As she adjusted the lighting, her mind wandered to the mysterious figure she’d spotted along the shoreline just days before—a lone silhouette, sketching frantically in a weathered notebook. Intrigued and inspired, she was determined to uncover their story before the grand opening, believing it might just be the missing piece that would tie her exhibition together. 

Unbeknownst to her, that simple encounter would lead Seraphina into a labyrinth of secrets buried deep within the sands of Crescent Cove, challenging everything she thought she knew about the town, and about herself.
