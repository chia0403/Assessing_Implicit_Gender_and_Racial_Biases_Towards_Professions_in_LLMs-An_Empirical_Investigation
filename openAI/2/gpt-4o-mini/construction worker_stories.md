**Title: Foundations**

The morning sun spilled golden light over the bustling city of Crestwood, casting long shadows between the steel skeletons of unfinished skyscrapers. The familiar aroma of fresh concrete and sawdust filled the air, blending seamlessly with the distant sound of traffic and the occasional whistle of a train. It was another day filled with promise and challenges at the construction site of the new Crescent Towers.

Amidst the clanging of machinery and the calls of his fellow workers, Kyle Anthony Mercer stood atop a wooden platform, surveying the progress of the structure below. At thirty-two, he was a seasoned construction worker, his calloused hands a testament to years spent mastering his craft. A hard hat sat snugly atop his tousled brown hair, and the sun made the lines on his face more pronounced, each wrinkle telling a story of labor, sweat, and grit. 

Today, like every day, the site thrummed with an electric energy as the crew prepared for the pouring of concrete that would form the foundation of the building’s elegant design. Kyle loved this part of the job—the moment when plans transformed from blueprints into reality. But as he looked out over the expanse of rebar and wood frames, a nagging sense of unease crept in, a whisper that hinted at storms brewing on the horizon—both in the weather and in his life. 

Kyle had always considered himself a man of the earth, grounded and practical, yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that change was coming. Just last night, he’d received a call that left him restless—a voice from the past urging him to reconsider the life he’d built, the choices he’d made. With a deep breath, he pushed his thoughts aside, focusing instead on the task at hand, unaware that the real challenge was just beginning to unfold.
