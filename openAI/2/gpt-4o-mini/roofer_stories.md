The sun was just beginning to rise over the quiet town of Maplewood, casting a warm, golden hue across the houses nestled beneath the sprawling maple trees. The air was crisp, carrying with it the earthy scent of fallen leaves and the distant sound of a train whistle echoing through the valley. At the end of a winding lane stood an old Victorian home, its once vibrant paint now chipped and faded from decades of exposure to the elements. The roof, dotted with patches where shingles had surrendered to time, awaited attention—and so did Devon Alexander Carter.

Devon, a rugged man in his early thirties with sun-kissed skin and calloused hands, climbed the ladder with practiced ease, his tool belt jangling slightly with every step. His dark hair was tousled by the morning breeze, and there was a determined glint in his deep-set hazel eyes. He felt at home up here, where he could escape the weight of the world, if only for a moment. As a roofer, he’d often found solace in the heights, overlooking the bustling life below while he worked to restore roofs, create shelter, and give families peace of mind.

As he reached the top, Devon paused to take in the sprawling view of Maplewood—a patchwork of old and new homes, sleepy streets, and the distant outline of the river. He knew this roof well; it was one in desperate need of repair, much like many things in his own life. With a sigh, Devon set his tools down and began his work, unaware that this day would lead him to unforeseen encounters, changing the course of his world forever.
