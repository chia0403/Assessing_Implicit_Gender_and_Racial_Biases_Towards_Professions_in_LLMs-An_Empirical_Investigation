In the small coastal town of Gullswing Bay, where the sound of the ocean was a constant companion and the air carried a hint of salt, Dr. Elise Manning began her day as she often didâ€”sipping a steaming cup of chamomile tea on the creaky porch of her century-old cottage. The sun was just rising, casting a soft golden glow over the rooftops and the cobblestone streets that led down to the tranquil harbor. Tall grasses swayed gently in the breeze, their rustling harmonizing with the distant cries of seagulls.

Dr. Elise Manning, a compassionate and insightful counseling psychologist, had chosen this serene enclave for its tranquility and sense of community. Here, surrounded by the charm of historic Victorian homes and the whisper of the ocean, she had opened her practice, offering solace and guidance to those who needed it. Her office, housed in an old brick building with ivy climbing its walls, overlooked the bay, providing her clients with a view that seemed to ease the weight of their troubles.

As Elise glanced at the small clock on her mantel, she knew she would soon head into town for another day of listening and gentle nudges toward healing. The town, with its cobbled pathways and quaint shops, was just stirring to life. She took one last sip of tea, savoring the peace of the morning before the day's stories began to unfold and intertwine with her own.
