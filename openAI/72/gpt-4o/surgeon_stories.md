Dr. Evelyn Carter stood at the large glass window of her corner office, staring out at the cityscape of downtown Seattle. The morning sun glinted off the high-rise buildings, casting long, elegant shadows that danced over the bustling streets below. Her hospital, Ridgeway General, was nestled in the heart of the city, a monumental structure of modern architecture with its sleek lines and towering fa√ßade. Inside, its labyrinth of corridors and operating rooms thrummed with the rhythmic pulse of a place that never truly slept.

Evelyn, dressed in scrubs and a white coat embroidered with her name and title, was a paradox of calm amidst the constant urgency of saving lives. Her reputation as a skilled surgeon had been hard-earned, through long nights and countless surgeries, and it followed her like a subtle aura of confidence. At 42, she commanded both respect and admiration, not just for her expertise with a scalpel, but for her unwavering commitment to her patients.

The morning was deceptively serene, a stark contrast to the vibrant, sometimes chaotic energy that filled the hospital's hallways. Yet, Evelyn knew that within these walls, anything could change in an instant. The anticipation of what lay beyond the start of her day was a familiar sensation, a quiet thrill akin to the opening notes of a symphony yet to unfold. As she turned back to her desk, the pager clipped to her waist buzzed to life; her first challenge of the day awaited.
