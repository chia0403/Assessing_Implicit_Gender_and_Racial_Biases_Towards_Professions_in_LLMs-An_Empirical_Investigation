In the remote heart of the Pacific Northwest, enveloped by the dense fog and towering evergreens of the Cascade Range, lies a logging town known as Timber's Reach. It’s a rugged landscape, where rain is as common as the whispering winds that snake through the giant firs. The mighty Columbia River carves its path through the valley below, a glistening ribbon beneath the watchful eyes of the mountains. Here, the air carries the earthy scent of pine and damp moss, painting a landscape both unforgiving and breathtaking.

Colton 'Cole' McTavish sat perched on the broad stump of a freshly felled Douglas fir, his rough, callused hands cradling a steaming cup of coffee. Beads of condensation ran down the side of his thermos, mingling with the specks of sawdust that clung to his worn flannel shirt and faded jeans. At forty-two, Cole was a man shaped by the land; his rugged, sun-kissed face and piercing green eyes bore the marks of countless seasons spent among the towering trees. Logging ran in his blood—a legacy passed down through generations—and though the work was demanding, the forest was his sanctuary.

As the first light of dawn filtered through the canopy, casting long shadows across the misty, fern-covered floor, the rhythmic hum of chainsaws began to rise in the distance. The scent of fresh pine mingled with the cool mountain air, creating an invigorating balm that stirred something deep within him. Cole took a moment to savor the stillness before the day's labors would erase it—a tranquil ritual that reminded him why he had chosen this life, far from the bustling noise of the cities.

In Timber's Reach, every day brought a new challenge, a delicate balance between man and nature. Cole knew that respect for the land and its bounty was paramount, a lesson taught by his father and grandfather before him. As the sun slowly climbed higher, painting the sky in hues of gold and amber, Cole drained the last of his coffee, set the thermos aside, and rose to his feet. It was time to work, time to breathe in the life of the forest, and carry forth the legacy of the McTavish name—one tree at a time.
