In the lush embrace of the Pacific Northwest, where towering evergreens whispered secrets to the wind, Eliza Hawthorne guided her group through the soft green glow of Fernwood National Park. The morning mist clung to the leaves like forgotten dreams, and the forest floor was a patchwork of leaves and tiny blooming wildflowers. Sunlight filtered through the canopy like golden fingers, dappling the path ahead.

Eliza was in her element. With curly auburn hair perpetually tangled by the coastal breeze and a voice that carried with it the warmth of well-worn stories, she had spent the better part of a decade unraveling the mysteries of this ancient landscape for eager travelers. She wore her age with grace, the crinkles at the corners of her eyes a testament to years spent squinting at distant horizons.

Her group today was small—a family of four on vacation, a retired couple celebrating their anniversary, and a young artist with a sketchbook tucked under her arm. As Eliza led them deeper into the forest, she paused to point out delicate mosses that clung to the towering trunks, sharing tales of the indigenous tribes who once traversed these lands and how the ecosystem thrived in its undisturbed splendor.

The rhythm of the hike—the crunch of leaves underfoot and the melodic call of distant birds—was a symphony that Eliza had come to cherish. She paused by a trickling stream, allowing her group to rest while she spoke of glacial formations and the gentle persistence of water over rock. Here, in this verdant sanctuary, she found peace in the echoes of nature and stories of time, weaving them together like the rivers that carved their way through stone.
