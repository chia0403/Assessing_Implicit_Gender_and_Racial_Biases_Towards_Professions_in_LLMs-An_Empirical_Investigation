Dr. Emily Harper sat at her desk, the morning sun streaming through the large bay windows of her clinic in Birchwood, a quaint coastal town nestled along the rocky cliffs of Maine. The rhythmic sound of the ocean waves lapping against the shore provided a tranquil soundtrack to her work, a soothing contrast to the hustle and bustle that defined her weekdays. From her desk, she could see the distant lighthouse, its whitewashed walls standing proudly against the azure backdrop of the sea and sky.

The clinic, Harper Wellness and Alignment, was housed in a charming Victorian building with soft sage siding and a wraparound porch adorned with hanging pots of geraniums and ivy. Inside, the walls were lined with diplomas and certificates, a testament to the years Emily had dedicated to her craft. Books on anatomy and holistic health filled glass-fronted cabinets, sharing the space with cozy armchairs and a well-worn rug, giving the place an inviting, lived-in feel that put her patients at ease.

As she scanned through her morning appointments, Emily felt a familiar thrill. Each patient brought a unique story, often accompanied by layers of tension and pain woven into their muscles and bones. It was her job, her passion, to listen, to understand, and with gentle adjustments and precise techniques, ease away the burdens they bore.
