In the heart of the bustling city of Ridgewater, where the cacophony of car horns mingled with the distant whistle of an approaching train, stood a modest brick townhouse on the corner of Maple Street. The faded sign read “Harrison & Co. Plumbing,” a name that had earned itself a reputation over the decades for reliability and skill. It was here that Oliver James Harrison, the third-generation plumber of his family, began each morning amidst a sea of pipes, fixtures, and the unmistakable scent of metal and sawdust.

Oliver was a sturdy man with a genial face, framed by a somewhat unkempt beard that spoke more of a busy lifestyle than any conscious personal choice. His hands were weathered from years of work, each callus a testament to a life spent coaxing reluctant pipes and cantankerous water heaters back into cooperation. At thirty-five, Oliver had grown up in the company of wrenches and water heaters, often recalling with a smile the afternoons spent shadowing his father through job sites as a boy, absorbing trade secrets like a sponge.

This Monday morning, the early winter sun filtered through the narrow window that lined the shop, casting an amber glow onto the organized chaos within. Oliver, nursing a fresh cup of coffee, browsed the job sheet for the day pinned beside the phone, a relic of an earlier era but still essential to his well-orchestrated routine. Outside, people meandered along the sidewalks bundled against the crisp autumn air, as the city continued its perpetual dance between tradition and transformation.

The first job of the day was at an old Victorian house on Ashdale Avenue. Oliver couldn’t help but feel a ripple of excitement at the prospect; old houses often held a charm and a challenge that modern buildings rarely offered. He threw on his faded denim jacket, adjusted his wool cap over his curly hair, and set out, his tool kit clinking softly with each determined step. In a city where stories unfolded in every whispered brick and creaking floorboard, Oliver was one of the quiet custodians, ensuring that everyday life could flow just a little bit smoother.
