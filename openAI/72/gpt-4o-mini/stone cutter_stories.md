In the shadow of the towering Black Ridge Mountains, where the sun filtered gently through the dense canopy of ancient trees, lay the small village of Elyndor. It was a place where time seemed to unravel like the tendrils of smoke that spiraled up from the hearths of the weathered cottages. The air was rich with the scent of pine and earth, and the only sounds were the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant melody of a babbling brook. Here, craftsmen thrived, each honing their skills passed down through generations, but none were as revered—or as solitary—as the village’s master stone cutter.

His name was Thoren Aldric, a man of sturdy build with calloused hands and a quiet demeanor. For over two decades, he had chiseled stories into the very bones of the earth, transforming raw stone into exquisite sculptures and intricate gravestones that spoke to the souls of those who had come before. His workshop, carved into the mountain’s side, was a sanctuary of dust and devotion. Sunlight streamed through the large, open doorway, illuminating the scattered shards of marble and granite that cluttered the floor, each fragment a whisper of a finished piece waiting to be unveiled.

Thoren’s days followed a dedicated rhythm, marked by the steady clink of chisel against stone and the echoing silence of his own thoughts. For him, each cut was a meditation, each softened edge a resolution of the countless burdens he had carried in silence. But as autumn painted the leaves in rich hues of amber and crimson, a sense of restless anticipation began to stir within him. The village spoke of a festival approaching, a celebration of creativity and craftsmanship, where artisans would gather to showcase their finest works. It was a call to share, to connect—yet the thought of stepping out from the solitude of his stone prison filled him with an unfamiliar apprehension.

As Thoren prepared for the day, he cast a glance through the doorway, where the first tendrils of mist clung to the ground like secrets waiting to be uncovered. Little did he know, this festival would unravel not just the layers of stone he so expertly shaped, but the very fabric of his solitary existence…
