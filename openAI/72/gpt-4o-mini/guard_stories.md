In the heart of Eldergrove, a town embraced by ancient oaks and thick fog, stood the formidable walls of the Albright Keep. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and moss, a lingering reminder of the storm that had swept through the night before. As dawn broke, casting eerie shadows across the cobbled courtyard, the weary figure of Parnell Rowan adjusted his dented helmet and tightened the grip on his sword's hilt, readying himself for another day of dutiful watch.

Parnell, a seasoned guard of the Albright family, had taken up his post three years prior, a lifetime in the eyes of the restless townsfolk. His robust frame was both an asset and a burden; scars from past battles marked his forearms like a tapestry of loyalty and courage. The chill of early morning seeped through his woolen cloak as he stepped to his station atop the parapet, the wind tousling his dark hair. Below, the sounds of the town waking—children's laughter, market vendors setting up their stalls, the distant clamor of blacksmiths—filtered through the air, yet Parnell's gaze remained sharp and focused on the road.

The keep had a way of whispering secrets to him, and today, it felt particularly restless. An unease unfurled in his gut, a tingling sensation that had become all too familiar. Little did he know that the delicate threads of fate were intertwining, and that this day would unravel not just the quiet dignity of Eldergrove, but also the very essence of the honor he held dear.
