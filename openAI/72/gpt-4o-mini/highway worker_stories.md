Title: "Through the Asphalt Canvas"

In the early hours of dawn, as the first light spilled across the quiet mountains of Eldridge County, the world was a palette waiting to be painted. The scent of pine mingled with the distant aroma of fresh asphalt, a blend that would become all too familiar to Morgan James Walker over the course of the summer. 

Morgan, a compact figure with sun-kissed skin and unruly chestnut hair, stood at the edge of Highway 63, eyes squinting against the golden rays that sliced through the mist. The rhythmic whoosh of passing cars was a steady backdrop to her thoughts—a cacophony that both thrilled and terrified her. With her reflective vest pulled snug, she mentally prepared for another day of repairing the cracks and potholes caused by the unforgiving Nevada weather.

The highway stretched endlessly, ribbons of black tar winding through the rugged terrain, punctuated by patches of wildflowers that dared to thrive in the unforgiving environment. Morgan had learned to love this stretch of road and the stories it held—a haphazard mix of travelers, lost and found, each with a destination that might change the course of their lives. She felt her heart quicken as she recalled the tales she had overheard during her breaks: a couple celebrating a long-awaited reunion, a lone driver seeking solace after a heartbreak, and a family on their way to a long-lost relative’s funeral.

But today felt different. As the sun ascended higher in the sky, illuminating the steel-grey clouds looming in the distance, an inexplicable unease crept into her bones. There was a story yet to be uncovered beneath the asphalt, and Morgan sensed that she was about to become a part of it—a turning point for both herself and the travelers she encountered along this vital route. With her toolbox in hand and determination reflective in her emerald-green eyes, she stepped onto the highway, ready to embrace whatever the day might bring.
