In the small, rain-soaked town of Riverton, where cobblestone streets wound through clusters of Victorian homes and the scent of damp earth mingled with the distant aroma of brewing coffee, stood the Riverton Pharmacy. The pharmacy, a charming brick building adorned with ivy and a faded wooden sign, was a cornerstone of the community. Inside, shelves were lined with colorful boxes and neatly labeled bottles, each containing a remedy for both body and soul.

At the heart of this establishment was Eleanor Grace Thompson, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist known for her encyclopedic knowledge of medications and her uncanny ability to remember the name and story of nearly every customer who walked through the door. With her sensible shoes and a stethoscope draped around her neck like a token of her dedication, she greeted each visitor with a warm smile that could cut through the town’s persistent gloom.

It was a typical autumn afternoon, the kind where the leaves danced off the trees in hues of gold and crimson, as Eleanor prepared for a busy day ahead. The bell above the door jingled softly each time another patron entered, and Eleanor's focus shifted between filling prescriptions and offering advice on over-the-counter remedies. Yet, beneath her calm exterior lay an undercurrent of worry; the town had been gripped by a series of mysterious ailments that seemed to sweep through without warning, leaving many of her customers fatigued and anxious. Eleanor couldn’t shake the feeling that something deeper was at play, lurking just beneath the surface of this quiet, unsuspecting town.
