Title: **Whispers of the Forgotten House**

Setting: The story opens in the quaint yet eerie town of Eldergrove, known for its sprawling forests and a thick blanket of mist that curls around its ancient trees. At the edge of the town stands an old Victorian mansion, once the pride of the area, now cloaked in neglect and rumors of the past. Its faded turquoise paint drips like tears in places, and wild vines weave through cracked windows. The scent of damp wood and faint floral wallpaper lingers in the air, whispering tales of a long-lost grandeur.

As the sun sets, casting long shadows across the overgrown garden, the figure of a solitary woman can be seen making her way up the cracked stone path. She is **Margaret Eloise Finn**, a capable and determined housekeeper whose resilience rivals the tangled roots of the trees around her. At forty-two, Margaret carries the weight of years spent caring for others, her hands calloused but gentle, her demeanor calm but watchful. She’s arrived at the mansion not out of choice, but necessity; the renowned, if eccentric, owner of the house has recently passed away, leaving behind a trove of memories—and secrets—for someone like Margaret to uncover.

As she pushes open the heavy door, it creaks ominously, revealing a dimly lit foyer adorned with dust-covered portraits whose eyes seem to follow her every move. Little does Margaret know that her arrival will awaken the echoes of the past, intertwining her fate with that of the forgotten house.
