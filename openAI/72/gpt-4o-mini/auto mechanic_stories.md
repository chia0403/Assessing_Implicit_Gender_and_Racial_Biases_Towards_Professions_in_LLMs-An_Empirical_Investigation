**Title: Rusted Dreams**

**Setting:** The small town of Riverton, nestled in the shadow of sprawling mountains and surrounded by the kind of dense pine forests that whisper secrets to those who wander through them. The town, with its main street lined with quaint cafés and antique shops, carries an air of nostalgia, as if time has slowed to allow the echoes of the past to play out in the present. The local auto repair shop, “Mason's Garage,” sits at the end of this street, a charming but weathered building with faded blue paint and an old sign swinging gently in the breeze. The aroma of oil and gasoline lingers in the air, mingling with the rich scent of mountain pine.

As the sun dipped behind the rugged peaks, casting a golden hue over Riverton, Ethan James Mason wiped his hands on a shop rag, a habit ingrained into his routine after long days spent beneath the hoods of cars. With grease-stained coveralls and a streak of engine oil across his cheek, Ethan embodied the essence of his craft—a dedicated auto mechanic never too far from the grit and grind of his work. At thirty-two, his brown hair was perpetually tousled, flecks of silver beginning to mix in, a testament to years of late nights and stubborn engines.

Inside Mason's Garage, the rhythmic clanging of metal carts and the gentle whir of power tools provided a comforting symphony. A crescent moon hung high overhead, quietly illuminating the shop’s interior, where the hint of nostalgia clung to every corner. Old photograph frames, capturing moments of laughter and triumph, adorned the walls—memories of a childhood spent in this very shop with his father, learning the intricacies of mechanics like other kids learned to ride a bike. 

Ethan paused for a moment, his gaze drifting to a half-finished project—a vintage Mustang, its deep red exterior dull beneath layers of dust. It was a passion project, a promise to his late father that he would one day bring the beauty back to life. As the last rays of sun slipped away, Ethan wondered if he could still find the spark to resurrect not just the car, but also the dreams he had buried beneath his responsibilities.

Little did he know, this night would set in motion a series of events that would challenge the very foundation of those dreams and lead him on a journey far beyond the confines of Riverton.
