Beneath the sprawling canopy of ancient oak trees at Waverly Estate, the autumn sun flickered through the colorful leaves, casting dappled shadows on the manicured lawns below. It was a serene afternoon, with a gentle breeze carrying the scent of damp earth and the distant sound of a creek bubbling over smooth stones. Amidst this picturesque landscape, Richard Alistair Greene knelt on the ground, his weathered hands tenderly tending to a bed of vibrant chrysanthemums. 

A life spent in the service of nature had bestowed Richard with a deep understanding of the land he nurtured, a skill passed down through generations. His face, lined with care and sun-kissed from long days spent outdoors, reflected a quiet pride in his work. The world had its complexities, but here, amid the blossoms and the whispering winds, it felt uncomplicated—a sanctuary he had cultivated with patience and love.

As Richard straightened, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand, he glanced toward the grand mansion that loomed in the distance. Shadows danced in the windows, hinting at the lives that played out behind those ornate walls. But today, there was a sense of unease in the air, the kind that made the leaves tremble slightly more than usual—a feeling that something was shifting just beneath the surface of his tranquil routine. Little did he know that today would unravel the very foundation of his peaceful existence, drawing him into a mystery that reached back over a hundred years.
