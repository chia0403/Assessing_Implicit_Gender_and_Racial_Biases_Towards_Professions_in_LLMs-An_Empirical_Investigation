The neon lights flickered above the entrance of The Rusty Anchor, casting a hazy glow over the rain-slicked streets of Chatham Bay. It was the kind of night where the air held a bite of early winter, a chill that wrapped around patrons as they hurried inside to escape the drizzling rain. The sounds of laughter, clinking glasses, and the faint strum of an acoustic guitar spilled out into the night, drawing in wanderers and regulars alike.

Behind the polished oak bar, a figure moved with practiced ease, pouring cocktails with an artistry that had turned the establishment into a local haven. Lila Mae Patterson, a thirty-two-year-old bartender with a cascade of chestnut hair and clever green eyes, expertly shook a cocktail shaker as she listened to the lively conversations around her. Tattooed arms revealed glimpses of her past, each inked design telling a story of adventure and mischief. 

As she garnished a vibrant margarita with a sprig of fresh mint, she stole a glance out the window, her mind drifting to the countless nights she’d spent in this place. The Rusty Anchor was more than a job; it was her sanctuary, a refuge from the memories she carried and the choices that had led her here. But tonight felt different—charged with a kind of energy that hinted at the unexpected. Unbeknownst to Lila, the arrival of a stranger at the bar would soon unravel the fabric of her carefully constructed world.
