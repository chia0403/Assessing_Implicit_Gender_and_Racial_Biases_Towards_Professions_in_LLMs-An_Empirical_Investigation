In the heart of Crescent Grove, a small town long accustomed to the gentle hum of nature and the occasional buzz of suburban life, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting golden streaks across the sky. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, remnants of an autumn rain that had washed the streets clean. It was here, in this quiet town, that Wyatt Jasper Ellison found solace in the gentle rhythm of his work.

As the local electrician, Wyatt had become a familiar figure, his toolbox a trusty companion and his hands weathered but sure. He was the type of man who could fix a broken circuit as easily as he could replace a flickering bulb, his knowledge of electricity both a craft and a calling. His small workshop, wedged between Rita's Diner and an old hardware store, was cluttered but cozy, filled with wiring diagrams and the soft glow of neon lights that flickered like fireflies in the dusk.

On this particular evening, as the last rays of sunlight softened into twilight, Wyatt was wrapping up a long day’s work, the hum of tools and the faint scent of soldering iron lingering in the air. Yet something felt different about the night—a tension hung about it like the static before a storm. As he gathered his things, he noticed a flicker outside, the streetlights momentarily dimming, then brightening as if caught in a heartbeat. With a furrowed brow, Wyatt stepped out of his workshop into the cool evening, the air now charged with something electric, something foreboding. Little did he know that this night would usher in more than just darkness; it would pull him into the heart of a mystery that would challenge not only his skills but his very understanding of reality itself.
