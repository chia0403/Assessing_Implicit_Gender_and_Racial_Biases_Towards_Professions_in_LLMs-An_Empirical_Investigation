**Story Opening:**

The early morning sun filtered through the dusty windows of the sprawling warehouse, casting elongated shadows across the rows of drafting tables that filled the space. The air carried the faint scent of varnish and freshly sharpened pencils, a familiar aroma for those who lived and breathed design. As the clock on the wall struck eight, a cacophony of clattering chairs and murmured greetings erupted, marking the beginning of another day of meticulous planning and intricate schematics.

In the far corner, enveloped in a cocoon of sketches and blueprints, sat Cornelia Mae Turner, a dedicated drafting worker known for her meticulous eye and unparalleled attention to detail. With her hair pulled back into a practical bun and a faded plaid shirt rolled up to her elbows, Cornelia was the very picture of focus, completely absorbed in the technical drawings sprawled across her desk. The soft hum of conversation around her faded into white noise as she traced the outlines of architectural structures—each line a promise of the life that would one day inhabit them.

Cornelia’s passion for drafting was rooted in her childhood, when her father, a carpenter, would bring home scraps of wood and invite her to sketch her wildest designs. Now, at twenty-eight, she poured her heart into every project, each blueprint a calculated step toward something far greater than mere lines on paper. But today, something felt different. Outside, the sky was overcast, a storm brewing on the horizon, and a sense of anticipation lingered in the air, threatening to upend the familiar routine of the workplace.
