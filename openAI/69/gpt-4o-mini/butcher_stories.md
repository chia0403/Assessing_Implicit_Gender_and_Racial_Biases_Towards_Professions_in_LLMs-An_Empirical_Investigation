In the heart of Eldridge Hollow, a small village cradled by dense woods and rolling hills, stood a weathered shop with a faded red awning that read “Miles McKenzie’s Butchery” in curling gold letters. The scent of smoke and spices wafted through the narrow cobblestone streets, inviting both locals and wanderers. Inside, the walls were adorned with vintage knives and hung with gleaming cuts of meat, each more meticulously prepared than the last. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating the specks of dust that danced in the golden rays.

Miles Augustus McKenzie, a burly man with broad shoulders and a well-groomed beard flecked with gray, stood behind the counter, deftly slicing through a thick piece of sirloin. He wore a simple white apron stained with remnants of his craft, and as he worked, his hands moved with a practiced grace, betraying none of the toil that had earned him a reputation as the finest butcher in the region.

Though Miles was known for his skill with a cleaver, it was the warmth of his personality that drew customers in. He remembered the names and stories of everyone who crossed his threshold— from the bustling families preparing for feasts to the solitary souls who stopped by for a hunk of jerky. Yet, beneath his genial exterior lay a past he seldom spoke of, a shadow lurking just beyond the sunlit threshold of his shop.

As the village prepared for the annual Harvest Festival, anticipation filled the air, and the townsfolk began to gather around the butcher’s shop. Miles had promised to provide the centerpiece for the feast, a succulent roast that would bring everyone together. Little did he know, this year would not be like the others. Secrets were stirring, and before night fell, Eldridge Hollow would be changed forever.
