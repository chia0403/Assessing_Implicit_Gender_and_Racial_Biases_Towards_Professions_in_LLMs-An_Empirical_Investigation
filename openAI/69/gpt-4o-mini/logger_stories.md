Deep in the heart of Oregon's Cascade Mountains, where towering Douglas firs wove a tangled canopy over the forest floor, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine resin. The serene beauty of the landscape was a stark contrast to the thrum of machinery that echoed through the trees. In this quiet corner of the wilderness, the sun filtered through the leaves, casting dappled patterns on the mossy ground. 

At the edge of a clearing, a rugged wooden cabin stood, weather-beaten yet sturdy, a testament to years of toil and dedication. Beside it, a well-used pickup truck sat idling, smoke curling from its exhaust like a lazy snake. This was no ordinary logging operation; it was the lifeblood of the community—a small, family-run business called Oak & Iron Timberworks.

Standing atop the dusty dirt road, a heavy-set man with calloused hands and a sun-kissed face wiped the sweat from his brow. His name was Lyle Harold Whitaker, a logger with a deep love for the trees he worked and the land he called home. At forty-three, Lyle had spent more than two decades carving out a living in this rugged terrain, navigating the delicate balance between nature and industry.

With a red plaid flannel shirt that clung to his broad shoulders and a faint hint of a beard shadowing his jawline, Lyle looked like a figure sculpted from the very timber he harvested. Today, however, something felt different in the air—a tension electrified the forest, as if the trees themselves were whispering secrets he couldn’t quite hear. As he surveyed the realm he knew so well, Lyle could not shake the feeling that change was on the horizon, just beyond the edge of the woods.
