Dr. Eliza Hartman adjusted her glasses as she walked across the dew-laden campus of Lincoln High School, the early morning light filtering through the towering oaks that lined the pathway. The golden hues of autumn leaves crunched softly underfoot, as students hurried by, their laughter and chatter creating a lively symphony that echoed in the crisp October air. The school stood as a red-brick sentinel against the backdrop of the awakening town, its windows reflecting the promise of a new day.

Dr. Hartman had always loved this time of year, when the world seemed to settle into a comforting rhythm after the rush of summer; when the scent of musky leaves mingled with the sharp bite of cold promising the coming winter. As the school psychologist, her office was tucked away in a corner of the bustling maze of the education block, a warm and inviting space filled with colorful bean bags and shelves crammed with books ranging from child psychology to fantasy novels—carefully curated to engage both the mind and the imagination of her young visitors.

Settling into her chair, Dr. Hartman opened her notebook, preparing for another day of listening, understanding, and guiding. Here, among the stacks of case notes and softly-ticking clock, she was both confidante and detective; a navigator of the intricate labyrinth of youthful minds. Today, as always, she would walk alongside the students, helping them find their way through the challenges of growing up—all while seeking to unravel the mysteries of her own life.
