In the heart of the bustling city of Portland, beneath a canopy of tall pines and the shimmering reflection of the Willamette River, sat St. Mary's General Hospital—a historic edifice blending old-world charm with modern medicine. Its red-bricked façade, draped in emerald ivy, stood as a testament to the lives saved and the countless stories woven within its walls. Every morning, the air around the hospital buzzed with anticipation and the subtle, comforting fragrance of fresh rain mingled with the faint scent of blooming lilacs from the nearby park.

Amidst this tapestry of life and hope, Claire Hastings stepped through the revolving glass doors, her white sneakers tapping gently against the polished, age-worn tiles of the lobby. Claire, a registered nurse known for her gentle touch and unwavering perseverance, had become a cornerstone of the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit over the last decade. Her uniform, crisp and accompanied by a navy blue cardigan, bore witness to the myriad of emotions she navigated each day—joy, sorrow, relief, and redemption.

Today, like most days, Claire arrived early, savoring the quiet moments before the hospital awoke fully to the rhythm of bustling life. The tranquil stillness of the break room called to her, offering a brief respite before her shift began. She cherished these minutes when the city outside had not yet shed its early morning mist, and the whispers of the river seemed to echo in the halls of St. Mary’s. Claire took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of freshly brewed coffee that mingled welcomingly with the aroma of antiseptic, and prepared herself for the day ahead, ready to weave her own threads into the ever-evolving tapestry of St. Mary’s General Hospital.
