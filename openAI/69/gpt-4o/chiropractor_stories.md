On a crisp autumn morning in the heart of Maplewood, a small town nestled between rolling hills and vast, colorful woodlands, Dr. Eliza Montgomery prepared to open her clinic. Her practice, Montgomery Chiropractic, occupied a charming brick building on the corner of Main Street and Pine Avenue, its large bay windows framed by climbing ivy and the glowing embers of turning leaves. Sunlight poured through the glass, casting a warm, golden light across the polished oak floors and shelves lined with medical texts and holistic remedies.

Eliza, a tall woman in her mid-thirties with curly auburn hair and an easy, reassuring smile, was known throughout the community not just for her skillful hands, but for her compassionate heart. She had returned to Maplewood after years in the bustling city, seeking the tranquility of her childhood home and a closer connection with her patients—people she often lovingly referred to as extended family.

The sound of chimes announced the arrival of her first patient, and as Eliza moved to greet them, she couldn’t shake the sense that today would bring something more than the usual alignment of bones and easing of tensions. Maplewood had a way of keeping life interesting, interweaving unexpected stories with its gentle rhythms, and Eliza, as always, was ready to meet whatever lay ahead.
