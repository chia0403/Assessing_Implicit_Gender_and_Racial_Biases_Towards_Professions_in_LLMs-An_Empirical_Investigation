In the heart of the bustling city of Langford, where the rhythm of daily life hummed with the clatter of streetcars and the distant wail of factory whistles, there lay a quaint little alley named Wisteria Lane. Tucked away from the chaos, this narrow street seemed to exist in its own bubble of time, marked by cobblestones that echoed with the footsteps of decades past. Alongside quaint shops with sun-faded awnings and weathered brick fa√ßades stood a small, unassuming establishment: Everett & Co. Bookkeeping Services.

Inside the dimly lit office, the air carried the comforting scent of aged paper and ink. Shelves stacked with ledgers lined the walls, and a vintage ceiling fan cut through the thick afternoon with a steady, soothing whir. At a large oak desk that had seen the turn of two centuries, sat Abigail Lorraine Whitman, the meticulous keeper of numbers and secret symphonies of finance. Her nimble fingers danced over the keys of an old typewriter, eyes fixed on the columns of figures that filled the lined pages before her. 

Abigail, known to her clients as Miss Whitman, was as much a fixture of Wisteria Lane as the buildings that lined it. Her sharp mind and gentle smile were well-known to the shopkeepers and business owners who sought her expertise. Her days were a blend of structured calculations and quiet reflections, punctuated by the chime of the doorbell that signaled a new client or a returning friend. Yet, even amidst the predictable flow of numbers, Abigail sensed that today, the steady cadence of her life was on the verge of an unexpected interruption.
