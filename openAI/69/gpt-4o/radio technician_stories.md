Amidst the sprawling deserts of southern New Mexico, where the distant mountains etched the horizon in a jagged line, the sun began its slow descent. It cast long shadows over the cracked earth, painting the landscape in hues of orange and amber. A solitary radio tower stood tall against the backdrop of an indigo sky, its metal frame glinting like a beacon in the approaching twilight.

Beneath this tower, nestled in a small, weather-beaten shack festooned with antennae and tangled wires, Claire Harrington sat absorbed in her work. As the only radio technician within a hundred miles, her days were spent coaxing life from outdated equipment. With nimble fingers dancing over a soundboard and a penchant for fixing things that others deemed too far gone, Claire had become something of a legend in these parts.

To outsiders, the place was isolated and desolate, but for Claire, it was a haven of quietude and endless skies. The radio waves were her playground, a vast expanse where she could listen and be heard, bridging gaps between lonely souls scattered across the desert. Today, as she tuned into the frequencies that crackled around her, she sensed that something unusual was about to interrupt her eveningâ€™s routine tranquility.
