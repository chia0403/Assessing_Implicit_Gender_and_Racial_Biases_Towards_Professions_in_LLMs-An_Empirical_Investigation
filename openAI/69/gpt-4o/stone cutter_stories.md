In the quiet village of Elderglen, nestled at the foot of the towering Silverpeak Mountains, a gentle morning sun began its ascent, casting a golden hue over the lush, dew-kissed meadows. The air was crisp and carried with it the subtle fragrance of wild lavender and pine. At the village's edge, the rhythmic sound of chisel against stone echoed softly, a familiar melody to the townsfolk as they commenced their daily routines.

Here, in a modest workshop made of timber and thatched by skilled hands, dwelled Henry Aldenstone, known far and wide as the finest stone cutter in all of Elderglen. His hands, calloused and steady, moved with an artisan's grace, as if guided by some ancient knowledge etched deep within the granite he meticulously shaped. The workshop, cluttered yet organized, was filled with granite slabs, intricate sculptures in various stages of completion, and the sweet smell of stone dust hanging delicately in the air.

Henry, a man in his early forties with a mane of salt-and-pepper hair and eyes the color of stormy seas, turned his focus on a large, unyielding block of stone. Today, he carved an angel for the old chapel atop the hill, a task of immense importance, as it was said to bring solace and protection to the village.

Though the world beyond Elderglen lay vast and unknown, with its promise of adventure and untold stories, Henry found his heart at peace here, amidst the chiseled echoes of his ancestors, his life woven into the fabric of each stone he brought to life. It was a craft that ran in his blood, and as he continued his work, the sun climbed higher, illuminating the workshop and the promise of a new day.
