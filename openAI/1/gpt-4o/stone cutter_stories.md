In the quaint village of Eldertide, nestled between the whispering glades and the foot of the rugged Stonemantle Mountains, the air was perpetually scented with the earthy aroma of chiseled rock and pine. The bustling heart of this community was its stone quarry, where the symphony of chisels striking granite created a rhythm as ancient as the land itself. Here, amidst the dust and echoes, worked Nathaniel Greene, a master stone cutter whose reputation for turning cold, unyielding stone into works of art reached far beyond the village borders.

The morning sun crested over the peaks, casting long shadows that danced playfully on the ground. Nathaniel stood in front of a massive block of marble, its surface smooth but untamed, waiting to reveal its hidden form at the touch of his skilled hands. His tools lay neatly organized around him—each one a trusted companion, worn with use but steadfast in their purpose.

Nathaniel was a man of few words, preferring the silent dialogue between chisel and stone. His fingers, calloused and strong, moved with the precision of an artist and the force of a craftsman. Today, he envisioned the marble transforming into the shape of a poised stag, capturing the spirit of the forest dwellers that roamed freely in the woods he knew so well.

As he worked, villagers passed by, nodding in greeting or stopping briefly to admire the emerging creation. Nathaniel, with his sandy hair lightly dusted by stone powder and deep-set eyes that seemed to hold a piece of the mountain's core, carved not just with his hands, but with his heart. For him, each piece was more than stone; it was a story captured in solid form—a story waiting to be told under the skies of Eldertide.
