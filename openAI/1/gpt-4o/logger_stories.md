Amidst the quiet majesty of the Pacific Northwest, where the ancient Douglas firs stretched their limbs like sentinels into the mist, Jameson "Jay" Ashford tightened the straps of his weathered boots. As he stood on the forest floor, the morning air was dense and rich with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar and comforting melody to his senses. The faint, distant hum of a chainsaw echoed through the tree lines, a sound as natural to him as his own breathing.

This part of Washington State, nestled between the peaks of the Cascade Mountains and the ever-expansive sky, was a place where nature’s raw power and silent grace existed in harmonious balance. Here, the earth did not merely support life; it crafted stories in the rings of elder trees and whispered legends through the crisp you catch on the wind. It was a world away from the gleaming steel and glass cities sprawling on the fringes like parasites clinging to nature’s bounty.

Jay had spent most of his thirty-five years in these woods, following in the bootsteps of his father and grandfather, who had carved paths through the forests long before he did. Ashfords were loggers by blood, crafting their legacy from timber and toil, regarded with a mixture of respect and caution by those who lived nearby in the sleepy village of Elkwood.

Settling the brim of his cap low against the sun’s emerging rays, Jay took a moment to listen to the forest awaken around him. Birds launched into their morning anthems, and the rustle of unseen creatures through the underbrush underscored the symphony. It was here, amidst this vibrant tapestry of life and regeneration, that Jay found his purpose.
