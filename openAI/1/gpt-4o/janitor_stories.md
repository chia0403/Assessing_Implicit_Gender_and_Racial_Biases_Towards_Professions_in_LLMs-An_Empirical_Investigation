In the heart of the bustling city of Solace Harbor, where the skyline pierced the clouds and the streets hummed with life, stood the once-grand Meridian Theater. The building, with its art deco façade and faded neon marquee, defied time like an old film reel flickering in the glow of nostalgia. It was here, amid the whispers of the past and the soft patter of janitorial brooms, that Harold Finnegan began his nightly ritual.

Harold was a man of steady hands and gentle demeanor, often unnoticed in the hustle of city life. His eyes, a shade of deep ocean blue, held stories of the theater that no one else would ever know. Harold had been the janitor of the Meridian for over three decades, a guardian of shadows and echoes, possessing an intrinsic knowledge of every creak and groan the old building made.

As the last of the day’s audience trickled out into the night, Harold stood alone in the lobby, inhaling the lingering scent of buttered popcorn and history. The grand chandeliers above, dusty yet dignified, cast a soft golden glow around the room. Outside, the rain began a gentle dance on the rooftops, a soothing percussion to accompany Harold’s solitary symphony.

The city outside was a cacophony of sirens and chatter, but inside the theater, there was only the rhythmic swish of Harold’s broom across the ornate mosaic floor. Tonight, like every other, he would listen to the theater’s secrets, whispered to him in the solitude of his work. If walls could talk, they would speak to Harold Finnegan, the quiet keeper of the Meridian’s soul.
