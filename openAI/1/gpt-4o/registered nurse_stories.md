In the quiet pre-dawn hours, when the world was still veiled in shadows and the air carried the crisp promise of a new day, Laney Morgan stood on the rooftop terrace of St. Augustine's Hospital. Below her, the city of Seattle stretched out like a patchwork quilt, dotted with the twinkling lights of streetlamps and early risers stirring to life. The sky was painted in deep indigo, with the first blush of sun beginning to creep over the horizon.

Laney, a registered nurse with over a decade of experience, inhaled deeply, savoring the rare moment of solitude before the chaos of her shift began. The familiar scent of antiseptic and fresh coffee wafted up from the floors below, mingling with the salty tang of the nearby Puget Sound. It was a smell she had grown accustomed to, one she both loved and loathed, as it signified the life she had committed herself to—a life spent in the service of others.

St. Augustine's was a sprawling complex, a blend of towering modern architecture and older brick buildings that had stood since the early days of the hospital’s founding. Laney often found herself drawn to the rooftop, a secret escape where she could gather her thoughts and prepare for the long hours ahead. In those early moments, the hospital felt like a sleeping giant, its endless corridors and bustling wards temporarily at rest.

As she leaned against the railing, Laney's mind drifted to the patients she’d cared for and those she had yet to meet. In a few short moments, she'd be immersed in a world of charts, IVs, and vital signs, her capable hands moving with practiced precision. Today, though like any other, carried the unpredictability that kept her grounded—a new emergency, a patient's sudden turn, the quiet gratitude of a family caught in grief.

The horizon brightened, heralding the dawn. With a final glance at the awakening city, Laney Morgan steeled herself for the day ahead and turned towards the door, feeling the weight of responsibility settle comfortably on her shoulders. As she descended the stairwell, she carried with her the resolve of someone who knew that within the walls of St. Augustine's, she could make a difference.
