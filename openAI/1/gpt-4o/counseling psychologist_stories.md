Dr. Eleanor Hughes gazed out of her office window, where a tapestry of autumnal hues painted the landscape of Riverton, a small town nestled in the embrace of the Appalachian Mountains. The morning sunlight filtered through the canopy of vibrant trees, casting dappled shadows on the cobblestone streets below.

Her office was a sanctuary of calm and warmth, decorated with soft earth tones and accented by the gentle glow of a Himalayan salt lamp perched on the corner of her mahogany desk. Shelves lined with books on psychology, mindfulness, and the human spirit adorned the walls, while a well-worn leather armchair invited patients to take respite and share the burdens they carried.

Dr. Hughes, in her mid-thirties, possessed an air of quiet assurance tempered by compassion. Her eyes, a deep, comforting shade of brown, were the kind that encouraged confidences. Today, as she sipped her morning coffee, she was preparing for a new patientâ€”a young man haunted by past traumas. The echo of the grandfather clock in the hallway marked the passing minutes, a gentle reminder that time, while constant, often felt at odds with the healing process.
