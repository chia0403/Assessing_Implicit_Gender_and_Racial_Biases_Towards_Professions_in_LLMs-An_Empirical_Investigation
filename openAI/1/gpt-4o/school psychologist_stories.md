Title: **Whispers in the Hallway**

As the crisp autumn air wove through the slender tree branches, painting the small town of Elmwood in shades of gold and crimson, Dr. Eleanor Sage made her way down the familiar corridor of Maple Grove High School. The school bell had just rung, releasing waves of students whose chatter echoed off the pale blue lockers. Eleanor, known to her colleagues and students as Dr. Sage, stepped lightly through the throng, her leather satchel swinging gently at her side.

Her office, tucked away in a quieter wing of the building, offered a sanctuary from the boisterous energy outside. The room was warmly decorated, with shelves lined with books on child psychology, a plush sofa to welcome students, and a small window where sunlight trickled in, casting gentle rays across the worn wooden floor.

Eleanor took a deep breath, appreciating the scent of freshly brewed coffee that lingered in the air, and settled into her chair. Her day's appointments lay neatly in a planner on her desk, and her first visitor would be arriving shortly. As she prepared for the day's work, a soft knock at the door pulled her attention. 

Opening the door, Eleanor was greeted by Jordan, a sophomore whose freckled face was framed by untamed curls. There was an air of hesitation about him, the kind Eleanor recognized in many of her students. 

"Morning, Jordan," she said with a warm smile. "Come on in."

The morning sun bathed the room as Jordan took a seat. A sense of reassurance enveloped them as Eleanor leaned in slightly, ready to listen as the story of yet another young soul began to unfold in her quiet haven amid the bustling school.
