In the small, sun-drenched town of Willow Creek, where the mountains cradled the horizon and the air carried the scent of pine and diesel, there was a garage on the corner of Main Street that buzzed with life. The sound of spanners clanking against metal and the occasional hiss of hydraulics were as much a part of the town’s symphony as the chirping of cicadas or the distant whistle of a train winding through the valley. 

Amidst this orchestra, Jackson "Jack" Morrison was in his element. With grease-stained hands and an eye for precision, Jack was the town's revered auto mechanic. He had taken over the Morrison's Auto Repair Shop from his father, who had first raised the roof of what was little more than a tin shack back in the days when Willow Creek had been swept up in the hopeful promise of prosperity. Now, the building stood as a patchwork testament to years of service, with its red and white paint faded but resilient, a beacon for those in need of a fix.

Jack was as much a fixture of the town as the garage itself. His easy smile and ready laugh were well-known from the diner to the general store. Folks trusted him with their vehicles, of course, but also with the stories of their lives, which they’d share as he adjusted carburetors and balanced tires. There was something about the rhythmic consistency of the shop—lift, fix, listen—that fostered a sense of confessional ease, encouraging people to speak while Jack worked his magic.

The early morning sun filtered through the dusty windows, casting warm streaks of light across the concrete floor as Jack wiped his hands on a rag, ready for the day's first project. As he glanced out into the street, he saw old Mrs. Caldwell pulling up in her vintage Chevy, the engine sputtering just enough to let him know his day was about to begin with the familiar, comforting challenge of coaxing life back into the soul of a classic.
