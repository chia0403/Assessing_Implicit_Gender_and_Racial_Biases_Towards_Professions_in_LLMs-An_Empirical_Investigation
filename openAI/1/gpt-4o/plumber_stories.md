In the heart of the bustling coastal town of Seabrook, beneath an azure sky streaked with the first hints of dawn, Alexander "Alec" Thompson embarked on his daily routine. The salty breeze swept through the narrow, cobblestone streets as he navigated his trusty, albeit well-worn, van through the early morning bustle. The town was alive with the chorus of seagulls and the distant sound of waves lapping against the harbor's edge. 

Seabrook was a place where everyone knew everyone, a quaint mix of old-world charm and modern-day hustle. Its narrow alleys and colorfully painted houses hinted at a time when life moved a bit slower, yet the busy docks reminded all of its vibrant present. Alec, whose reputation as the town's most reliable plumber was as solid as the pipes he fixed, was particularly fond of the townâ€™s antique Victorian-style houses. Their intricate plumbing systems were both a challenge and a delight, a puzzle from another era that he took pride in solving.

As he parked in front of the first job of the day, the sprawling Oldham Residence, Alec felt the familiar thrill of anticipation. The Oldham Residence was one of the town's historic gems, a place filled with character and, undoubtedly, its own set of unique plumbing issues. He grabbed his toolkit, its weight a comfortable reminder of his trade, and walked toward the house, ready to face whatever mysterious leaks or creaking pipes awaited him inside.
