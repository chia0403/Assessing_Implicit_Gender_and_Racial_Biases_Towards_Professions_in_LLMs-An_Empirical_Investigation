Title: Inherit the Earth

Setting: A vibrant coastal town named Seaward Cove, known for its stunning beaches, charming cottages, and a burgeoning art scene. The town's Main Street bustles with local shops, quaint cafes, and the melodic sounds of street musicians. The sky above is a deep cerulean, dotted with fluffy white clouds, and the salty breeze carries the scent of the ocean.

Story Opening:

The morning sun spilled golden rays over Seaward Cove, illuminating the pastel-colored facades of the storefronts that lined Main Street. Sandwiched between an artisanal bakery and a quaint antiques shop, the office of Tessa Mae Colton Real Estate stood proudly, a polished glass door reflecting the lively ebb and flow of the town. Tessa Mae Colton, a thirty-three-year-old real estate agent with unruly chestnut curls and an infectious smile, leaned against the glossy cherry wood desk in her sunlit office, thumbing through the latest listings.

As the local real estate market thrived with newcomers wanting to call Seaward Cove home, Tessa’s phone buzzed on the desk beside her. She picked it up, and a familiar name flashed across the screen—Sammy Blake, her best friend since kindergarten and self-proclaimed town historian.

“Tessa! You’re not going to believe what I just found in the old registry,” Sammy exclaimed, her voice crackling with excitement.

Tessa raised an eyebrow, curiosity piqued. “Another ghost story? You know I’m trying to sell houses, not hauntings.”

“Better! It’s about that abandoned cottage on Crescent Point! You need to see this!” 

With a shrug, Tessa grabbed her denim jacket from the chair and tossed it on. The thought of an old dilapidated cottage piqued her interest—but it was more than just the allure of hidden potential; it was a story waiting to unfold, something she always embraced in her line of work.

“Okay, I’m on my way. But if I see any ghosts, you’re coming to negotiate the deal!” she teased before hanging up, her heart racing with the thrill of discovery. Today was not just another day at the office; it was the dawn of a new adventure, one that might just hold the missing piece to the town's history—and perhaps, her own.
