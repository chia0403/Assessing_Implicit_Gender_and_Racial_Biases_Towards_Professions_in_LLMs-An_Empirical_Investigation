Title: Beneath the Surface

In the small, forgotten town of Eldridge Hollow, where the ancient oak trees whispered secrets to the wind and moss-covered stone houses leaned into one another for support, a steady rhythm of life went on, punctuated only by the distant chime of the church bell and the bustling of the local diner. The streets were lined with narrow, winding paths and clinging ivy, remnants of a time when the town thrived. But beneath this quaint facade, Eldridge Hollow harbored a world unseen—one of tangled roots and hidden depths.

In the heart of this town lived Oliver Frederick Hayes, a plumber with grease-streaked hands and a heart that beat for simplicity. With his work boots scuffed and his tool belt always at the ready, Oliver embraced the challenges of pipes and valves like an artist with his canvas. On an overcast Tuesday morning, the sky hung heavy with the promise of rain, but Oliver saw it only as another opportunity to weave through the underbelly of his familiar surroundings.

He stood before the worn, wooden door of a once-vibrant Victorian home, now dulled by time and neglect. The sound of water trickling echoed faintly from within, a troubling but familiar melody. As he reached for the tarnished doorknob, he couldn’t shake the feeling that today would uncover more than just a leaky pipe. It was as if the house itself was calling to him, begging for help, as if its rotting walls held secrets waiting to be unraveled. Oliver took a deep breath, his heart steadying with purpose, and stepped inside.
