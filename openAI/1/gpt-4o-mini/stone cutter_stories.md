In the shadow of the rugged Penrose Mountains, where the sun dipped low and cast golden hues across the craggy landscape, the small village of Eldersvale thrived amid towering pines and glistening streams. Here, the air was alive with the rhythmic sound of chiseling—a melody familiar to the townsfolk who had long relied on the skilled hands of their resident stone cutter.

Arnold Blake had spent nearly two decades shaping granite and marble, each strike of his hammer resonating with purpose and precision. His workshop, a weathered stone shed nestled behind his modest cottage, was cluttered with rough-hewn blocks and glistening chippings that sparkled like stars across the floor. The scent of the earth was rich here, mingling with the aroma of cedar and the distant melody of the stream that wound through the forest.

Arnold, with his broad shoulders and calloused hands, had the kind of face etched by time and toil, a testament to the many hours he spent laboring under the sun. He was a man of few words, yet those who knew him well understood that behind his humble demeanor lay the heart of an artist. Each piece he crafted told a story, capturing the essence of the land and the spirit of those who inhabited it.

As autumn approached, the leaves began to turn a fiery orange and crimson, hinting at the change to come—not only in the seasons but in Arnold's life as well. Rumors had begun to swirl in Eldersvale about a mysterious request from the town council: a monument was needed to honor the village’s history, a tribute that would stand the test of time. Arnold felt a stirring in his chest, as if fate were beckoning him toward an uncharted path, one that would lead him to a discovery far deeper than mere stone.
