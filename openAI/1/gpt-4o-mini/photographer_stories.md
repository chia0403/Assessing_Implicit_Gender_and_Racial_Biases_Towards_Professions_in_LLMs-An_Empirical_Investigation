**Title: Shadows of the Past**

The October sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Bellhaven, a quaint coastal town nestled between rugged cliffs and roaring waves. Artisanal coffee shops and eclectic boutiques lined the streets, their charming storefronts adorned with autumn leaves that danced in the crisp breeze. The salty scent of the ocean mingled with the earthy aroma of fallen leaves, creating a sensory tapestry that enveloped the town in warmth despite the approaching chill of winter.

In a small, cluttered studio above a gallery, Francesca Mae Wright stood with her camera poised, the soft click of the shutter echoing like whispers between the frames of her latest collection. Francesca, known simply as Frankie to her friends, had always been captivated by the interplay of light and shadow. With unruly curls the color of chestnuts and a passion for capturing the world through her lens, she approached every photograph as if it were a piece of her soul — a silent conversation with the world around her.

Outside, the fading light painted the town in hues of gold and crimson; it was the kind of evening that begged to be captured. She could sense the yearning in the air, an unspoken promise of stories waiting to be uncovered. As she slid into her well-worn leather jacket and stepped onto the streets, her heart raced with the thrill of a new adventure. Little did she know, this night would lead her to the heart of Bellhaven’s most haunting mystery — a tale steeped in shadows, a legacy hidden in the very photographs she sought to immortalize.
