Dr. Eliana Margaret Hayes stood at the edge of her small, sunlit office at Red Maple Hospital, fingers poised over the keyboard, the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders. Outside the window, a crisp autumn breeze rustled the golden leaves of the towering maple trees that lined the hospital grounds, their vibrant colors mirroring the warmth and energy she used to feel about her work. But today, the sun seemed a little dimmer, the echoes of laughter from the pediatric ward a little fainter.

Eliana was a brilliant cardiothoracic surgeon, known for her precision and compassion in the operating room. The plaques and accolades adorning the walls surrounding her desk bore testament to her capabilities and dedication. Yet, as she stared at the patient file in front of her, dread coiled in her stomach. She was about to perform a complicated surgery on a ten-year-old boy, someone who had already faced more battles than most adults. The pressure was unimaginable, and with each passing moment, she could feel the weight of her own expectations and the haunting specter of her past decisions creeping closer.

In the small, intimate waiting room outside her office, the boy's parents whispered softly, clinging to one another as they waited for news. Eliana took a deep breath, trying to gather her strength, and turned to the mirror hanging on the wall. She met her own eyesâ€”a blend of determination and doubt. Today, for better or worse, her choices would reshape lives. The familiar chirp of her pager broke the silence, signaling that it was time to step into the operating room, where the battle for young Tomas's life awaited her.
