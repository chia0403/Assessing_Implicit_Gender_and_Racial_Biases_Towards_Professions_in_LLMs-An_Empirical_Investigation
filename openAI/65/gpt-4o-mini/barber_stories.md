In the heart of Crestwood, where the streets were lined with cherry blossom trees and time seemed to stretch a little longer, there stood a rustic barbershop named “Timber & Blade.” The delicate smell of sandalwood mingled with the clinking of scissors and the soft hum of conversations, creating a warm atmosphere that felt like stepping into a cherished memory. Sunlight filtered through the large front windows, casting a golden glow over the mismatched vintage furniture and the wall adorned with old photographs of local residents and their haircuts through the decades.

At the center of this inviting space was one Edwin Baxter, a master barber with a twinkle of mischief in his eyes and a well-groomed beard that nearly matched the elegance of his craft. Edwin had spent the past fifteen years shaping not just hair but stories, transforming his clients' fleeting moments into lasting confidence. With each expert snip, he created a canvas of self-expression, his hands moving deftly while his laughter echoed like a familiar tune. 

It was a Tuesday morning, and the quiet hum of chatter was interrupted only by the occasional rattle of the bell above the door. Edwin was meticulously working on Mr. Hollingsworth—a regular with a fascination for tales spun in the barbershop chair. As he expertly blended the sides of the older man’s thinning crown, their conversation drifted from the latest happenings in the neighborhood to the wild rumors swirling around an abandoned estate just on the outskirts of town. 

Unbeknownst to Edwin, the secrets whispered in his shop this day would soon shake the very foundation of Crestwood, bringing unexpected visitors and stirring old ghosts from the past.
