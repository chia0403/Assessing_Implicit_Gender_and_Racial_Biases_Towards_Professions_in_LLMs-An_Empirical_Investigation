The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows over the cracked asphalt of Highway 61, a lifeline stretching between small towns and vast stretches of forgotten fields. A gentle wind whispered through the open window of the cab, carrying the scent of pine and the distant hint of rain. Dust motes danced in the golden light that spilled through the glass, illuminating the interior of the truck, which was both a sanctuary and a mobile home for its driver.

Beneath the faded caps and well-worn flannels, Lee Joseph Sanderson sat behind the wheel of his 18-wheeler, “Big Blue,” a name painted boldly on the side alongside the company logo. With calloused hands, he checked the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of the two-lane road winding through the landscape. At forty-five, Lee knew the rhythm of the road better than he knew the faces of his neighbors back in Oakdale, a small town that had all but faded from memory. Every mile behind him brought its own stories, a mosaic of lives he glimpsed in fleeting moments: the hitchhiker with a worn backpack, the farmer waving from a field, the diner waitress who served him coffee with a knowing smile.

Tonight, as twilight deepened into indigo, Lee had a heavy load—a cargo of farm equipment bound for a Mennonite community just outside of St. Louis. It was a route he had taken countless times, each journey unveiling new chapters in the book of his life. But there was something in the air this evening, an electric tension that prickled at the back of his neck, as if the world beyond the windshield held secrets yet to be revealed. With an easy confidence borne of experience, he tightened his grip on the wheel and set his course, ready to embrace whatever the road had in store for him.
