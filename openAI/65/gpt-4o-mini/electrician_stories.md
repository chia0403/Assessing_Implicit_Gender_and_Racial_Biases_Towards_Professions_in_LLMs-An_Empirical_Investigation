The sun had just dipped below the horizon, casting a deep indigo blanket over the quiet town of Eldridge. Streetlamps flickered to life one by one, illuminating the cobbled streets and the muted facades of Victorian houses. In a small workshop tucked between an old bakery and an art gallery, the smell of engine oil and varnished wood mingled with the faint scent of fresh-baked bread.

Inside, the warm, dim light of a single overhead bulb cast soft shadows across the cluttered workbenches. Tools of every size filled the walls, from pliers to voltage testers, their organized chaos a reflection of the man who worked there. This was the domain of Samuel Grant, a skilled electrician known for his creative problem-solving and affable nature. With slightly wavy brown hair and a scruffy beard that hinted at long hours on the job, Samuel was both a craftsman and a dreamer. He was the kind of person who could coax life back into an aging circuit, piecing together the remnants of forgotten homes with the same passion he brought to restoring antique radios for the local collectors.

But on this particular evening, a nagging feeling pulled at Samuel. He had just finished installing new wiring in a century-old house on Maple Street, but something felt out of place, as if the shadows danced slightly out of sync with the creaking floorboards beneath him. He shook off the thought—after all, an electrician’s mind often wandered to the rhythms of wires and current, not ghost stories. He grabbed his tool belt and stepped out into the cool evening air, unaware that the ordinary tapestry of his life was about to unravel in a way he could never have imagined.
