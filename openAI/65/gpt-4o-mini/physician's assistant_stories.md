**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting:**

The small coastal town of Gray Harbor was known for its dramatic cliffs and azure waters, but as the sun dipped below the horizon, the once-vibrant community cloaked itself in a shroud of fog. The salt-scented air carried whispers of secrets, the kind that lingered in the corners of the town’s quaint coffee shops and echoing through its narrow streets. At the heart of Gray Harbor stood the Gray River Clinic, a weathered brick building adorned with ivy that clung precariously to its walls, a timeless reminder of the town's rich history. Inside, the scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee, creating an unusual but strangely comforting atmosphere.

**Opening:**

As the last hues of twilight melted into darkness, Clara Mae Thompson hastily organized her desk at the clinic, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead like a swarm of restless bees. At thirty-one, Clara had carved out her niche as the town's only physician's assistant, providing care with a warmth that patients often said felt like home. Tonight, however, was different. The usual chatter from the waiting room was replaced by a tense silence, punctuated only by the distant crashing waves outside. An emergency call had just come in—an accident at the cliffs—and the urgency made her heart race.

She grabbed her medical bag, the weight of it reminding her of the countless lives she had touched over the years, and mentally prepared herself for what lay ahead. The storm brewing on the horizon mirrored her unease, but Clara was resolute. In a town where everyone knew each other’s names and stories, she felt the pressing weight of responsibility. This time, she wouldn’t just be mending wounds or diagnosing illnesses; she would be a lifeline in a moment of need, perhaps uncovering more than just physical injuries in the process.

With a deep breath, Clara stepped out of the clinic and into the fog, ready to confront whatever awaited her at the edge of the cliff—and in the depths of Gray Harbor’s secrets.
