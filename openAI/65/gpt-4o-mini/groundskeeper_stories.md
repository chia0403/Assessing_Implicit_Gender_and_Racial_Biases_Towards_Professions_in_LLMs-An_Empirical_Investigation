The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows over the sprawling grounds of Eldridge Manor. The estate, a relic from the Victorian era, stood proudly amidst the rolling hills, its once-vibrant gardens now a patchwork of wildflowers and unruly hedges. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint rustle of leaves in the gentle evening breeze.

At that moment, Samuel Everett, the manor’s dedicated groundskeeper, knelt beside a weathered stone bench, his calloused hands digging into the soil. With each handful he scooped, he unearthed memories of a time when the gardens bloomed in a riot of color and life. Samuel had tended to this land for nearly two decades, a solitary figure in faded green overalls and a worn straw hat, channeling his energy into reviving the manor’s weary grounds.

As the last rays of sunlight slipped beneath the horizon, Samuel paused, wiping the sweat from his brow. He glanced up at the house, its darkened windows staring back like hollow eyes, and he felt a familiar tug of longing. The old manor held secrets, its walls steeped in stories yet untold. Though he had served as its faithful steward, he felt a connection to the place that went beyond duty—a bond that hinted at an unwritten history waiting to be discovered. The cool evening air whispered of change, and for the first time, Samuel wondered if the shifting seasons might bring more than just new blooms to the forgotten garden.
