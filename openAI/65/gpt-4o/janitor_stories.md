In the heart of a bustling metropolis, where the skyline pierced the heavens and the labyrinthine streets thrummed with life, stood the venerable Eaton Tower—a monument of glass and steel that whispered tales of its half-century's existence. Amidst the symphony of ringing phones and hurried footsteps, there existed a more subdued melody, one created by the humble swish of a mop and the steady hum of an industrial vacuum.

This was the domain of Samuel "Sam" Donovan, Eaton Tower's night janitor. Sam had been a fixture in the building for over twenty years, a quiet guardian who tended to the hushed hallways and vacant offices long after the city's daytime denizens had retreated. The world above rushed and clamored, but below, in the pulse of the night, there was an ordered tranquillity that only Sam commanded.

Sam's story began in a forgotten corner of the basement—an expansive warren of utility rooms and storage spaces transformed into his sanctum. Here, the air was thick with the mingled scents of bleach and aged wood, and the gentle buzz of fluorescent lights cast a soft glow over the rows of cleaning supplies neatly cataloged on metal shelves. An old radio, its antenna slightly bent, crackled softly with the crooning of distant jazz, providing an accompaniment to Sam's thoughtful solitude.

This evening, as Sam prepared for his nightly rounds, a tingling sensation of anticipation pricked at the edges of his consciousness. It was as if the very walls of Eaton Tower were holding their breath, waiting for something to unravel in the hours before dawn—a promise of change beneath the familiar mantle of routine.
