As the first light of dawn crept over the jagged peaks of the Spine Range, casting long, amber shadows across the valley, Roland Kincaid tightened his grip on the cool iron bars of the gate. He stood solitary at his post, a lone sentinel in the stillness that enveloped the outer perimeter of Castle Windermere. The castle loomed behind him, a formidable silhouette etched against the awakening sky, its ancient stones whispering tales of bygone eras.

Roland, dressed in the forest green and deep navy garb of the Windermere Guard, surveyed the landscape with a seasoned eye. The air was crisp, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and pine—an olfactory reminder of last night’s rainstorm that had battered the battlements with relentless fervor. His breath formed ephemeral clouds, only to vanish in the cold morning air, much like the unease that had settled in his chest since news of the recent unrest in the neighboring territories reached the fortress.

For years, Roland had walked the cobbled paths and patrolled the fortress's walls, knowing every creak and moss-covered stone by heart. Yet, today felt different. A foreboding quiet draped over the land, and the village nestled at the castle's feet remained shrouded in an uncharacteristic stillness.

His gaze drifted beyond the imposing walls to the dense, shadowy outlines of the Silverwood Forest. Tales of mythical creatures and ancient ruins hidden within its depths had filled Roland’s childhood, stories whispered by candlelight in his family’s modest cottage just beyond the castle’s reach. Despite his years of service and his loyalty to the castle, the forest still beckoned with promises of adventure and unearthed secrets.

As the village began to stir, sending wisps of smoke curling towards the sky from chimney pots, Roland prepared himself for the day’s duties, aware that the peace he guarded was as fragile as the morning mist, ready to dissipate with the rising sun. Little did he know, the day would unravel events that would turn legend into reality, thrusting him into a journey that would reshape the very fabric of his beliefs.
