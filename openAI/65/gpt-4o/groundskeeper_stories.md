In the earliest hours of dawn, when the world was still wrapped in the gentle embrace of mist, Edward "Eddy" Thompson began his day at Northfield Manor. The estate sprawled across acres of vibrant green fields and ancient oaks, their branches whispering secrets from centuries past. It was here, amidst the rolling hills and neatly trimmed hedges, that Eddy found his purpose.

Northfield Manor was an old-world estate tucked away on the outskirts of Wiltshire, England. Its grand stone façade and towering turrets peeked out from behind a veil of morning fog, lending an air of mystery to the grandiose structure. The manor's gardens, famed for their beauty and precision, were a testament to Eddy's diligent care. Paths of cobbled stones meandered through the grounds, bordered by flowerbeds exploding with color and carefully pruned rose bushes that climbed gracefully up weathered trellises.

Eddy, a stalwart figure with kind eyes and calloused hands, had been the manor's groundskeeper for over three decades. His fondness for the land was evident in every corner of the estate; each plant was placed with thought, every stone path laid with care. As he walked the grounds in his worn leather boots and woolen cap, he was an artist painting with nature, ensuring everything remained as immaculate as the day before.

The manor itself had stood for generations, home to the Montgomery family, but it was the gardens that held the true stories, whispering through rustling leaves and babbling brooks. Eddy had promised himself he would preserve these stories, for he had come to know them as intimately as his own. Under the canopy of the old oak trees, surrounded by sculpted topiaries and vibrant tulips embracing the first light, Eddy felt a deep connection to the land—a bond that was as unyielding as the roots beneath his feet.
