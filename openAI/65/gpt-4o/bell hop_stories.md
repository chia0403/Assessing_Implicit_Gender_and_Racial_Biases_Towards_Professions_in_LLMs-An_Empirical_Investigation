In the heart of the bustling city of New York, where towering skyscrapers loomed like sentinels against the ever-changing sky, sat the historic Coventry Grand Hotel. Its façade, a testament to the grandeur of a bygone era, was adorned with ornate carvings and art nouveau detailing that whispered stories of elegance and opulence from a different time. 

This was a place where the whispers of soft-soled shoes on marble floors mingled with the gentle hum of elegance, where travelers from far and wide came seeking the allure of luxury and history intertwined. Inside, the lobby gleamed with polished mahogany and shimmering chandeliers, casting warm, golden light on the faces of those who passed beneath their glow.

Amidst this tapestry of movement and elegance worked Oliver Barrett, the hotel’s youngest bell hop. At just twenty-three, Oliver had already become a fixture at the Coventry Grand, known for his ready smile and uncanny ability to anticipate the needs of the guests before the requests even formed on their lips. His uniform, crisp and tailored, was a testament to his pride in being part of the hotel’s storied legacy.

Oliver's day began before dawn broke over the city, when the air was still crisp with the quiet and promise of new beginnings. He navigated the labyrinth of corridors and suites with practiced ease, each baggage cart a part of the endless dance between comings and goings. But while his tasks might have seemed mundane to an outsider, Oliver saw himself as a guardian of the hotel’s many secrets, privy to the rich tapestry of stories that unfolded within its walls.
