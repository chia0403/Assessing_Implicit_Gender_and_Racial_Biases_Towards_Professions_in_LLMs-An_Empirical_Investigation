In the serene embrace of early autumn, when the trees wore crowns of amber and auburn, Dr. Eliza Monroe found herself standing at the threshold of Crestwood Elementary School. The familiar creak of oak doors welcomed her like an old friend as she stepped inside, the scent of fresh pencils and chalk dust swirling in the crisp air.

Crestwood was nestled in the heart of Mapleton, a quaint town cradled by rolling hills and sprawling fields. Its red-bricked facade was a landmark of education and history, having nurtured generations under its sturdy roof. The schoolyard echoed with the laughter and chatter of children, their vibrant energy painting the golden afternoon with life.

Dr. Monroe, a dedicated school psychologist, had spent years within these walls, weaving through the stories and struggles of countless young minds. Her office, a cozy corner just past the rows of lockers, was an oasis of calm among the daily whirlwind. The shelves overflowed with books on childhood development and art supplies that often doubled as therapeutic tools.

Today's visit wasn't unusual, yet something in the brisk morning air whispered that change loomed near. Eliza adjusted her satchel, heavy with case files and the comforting weight of knowledge, and tucked a stray curl behind her ear. It was just another day at Crestwood, but for Eliza Monroe, it promised to be anything but ordinary.
