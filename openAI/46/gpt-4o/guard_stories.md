Title: **The Last Watch at Hollow Hill**

---

As the first light of dawn crept over the jagged peaks of the Ebon Ridges, a solitary figure stood on the barren expanse of Hollow Hill. The wind whipped around him, carrying with it the scents of pine and distant storm. Here, amidst the crumbling stones of what was once a formidable bastion, Edgar Lysander, the last guard of the forgotten watchtower, kept his steady vigil.

Edgar's eyes traced the familiar contours of the landscape before him: the dark, twisting canopy of the Mistwood Forest that pressed against the base of the hill like a sleeping beast, and the silver thread of the Cinderbrook River that wound its way through the valley. Though Hollow Hill was etched with the scars of countless skirmishes and the ghosts of history whispered through its corridors, it was Edgar's home, his duty, and his sacred charge.

The once-proud walls of the watchtower stood as a testament to a kingdom long gone. Vines crawled over the stones, and the faint echo of past lives seemed to linger in the cool morning air, but Edgar saw beauty in the desolation. For years, he had walked its perimeter, ensuring that its secrets remained undisturbed, its dignity preserved.

Despite the desolation, Edgar Lysander knew his role was not finished. He bore the weight of countless generations before him, guardians of the realm who had pledged themselves to watch and protect. Each dawn, he reaffirmed his oath to stand guard over Hollow Hill, to await the return of whatever unknown might from the past could one day threaten the future.
