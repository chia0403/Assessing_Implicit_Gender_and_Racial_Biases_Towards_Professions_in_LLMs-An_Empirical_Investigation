In the heart of the bustling city of Riverton, where the streets hummed with the rhythm of daily life, a small plumbing shop nestled between a vintage bookstore and a lively café went largely unnoticed by the hurried passersby. The sign above the door read "Pipes & Pros," a no-nonsense name that perfectly suited its owner, Thomas "Tommy" Calder.

Tommy Calder was known throughout Riverton not just for his skill in fixing leaks and unblocking drains, but for his unfaltering dependability and hearty laugh that echoed through the narrow alleyways. Standing at over six feet with a sturdy build—strengthened by years of wrestling with stubborn pipes—Tommy was easily recognizable as he traversed the cobblestone streets in his faded blue overalls and trademark red cap.

The morning sun peeked over the tall city buildings, casting long shadows, and spilling golden light over the quiet street. Inside Pipes & Pros, the air was filled with a symphony of clinking metal, the soft rustle of paper invoices, and the gentle hum of an old radio perched on a shelf. The shop, though modest in size, was neatly organized; shelves lined the walls, stacked with every imaginable tool and spare part. A comforting scent of fresh coffee mingled with the earthy metallic tang of Tommy's trade, making the small establishment feel both vibrant and homey.

Today, as he sipped his morning brew, Tommy rolled out a well-worn blueprint across the wooden counter, a pensive look on his face. An unexpected job had come his way—a call from the grand Riverton Mansion at the city's edge. It was a sprawling relic of the past, rumored to be filled with twists and mysteries as complex as its labyrinthine plumbing. And for Thomas Calder, no job was too daunting, for in every tangle of pipes lay stories waiting to be uncovered.
