On the outskirts of the bustling city of Hollow Point, where the neon lights of skyscrapers fade into the soft glow of suburban streetlamps, stood the once-grand Riverton Theatre. Now a relic from another era, its ornate facade bore the wear of forgotten years and whispered tales of past glories. The evening air hummed softly with the distant echoes of city life, and a gentle breeze carried the scent of rain yet to fall.

Inside, the theatre was a cavernous space filled with shadow and silence. Dust-moted beams of light pierced through cracked, stained-glass windows, casting colorful spectres upon faded velvet seats. Amidst this chorus of stillness, the rhythmic swish of a broom could be heard, guided by the steady hand of Elias Monroe.

Elias, with his calm demeanor and unassuming presence, was the guardian of these empty aisles and haunted balconies. In his late fifties, with silver flecks in his curly black hair and eyes that mirrored the theater's storied deep greens, he had spent years sweeping through its echoes. To him, every room whispered secrets, each creak of the floorboards was a lingering laugh, and every piece of litter was a fragment of stories untold.

He moved with a quiet precision, knowing every corner of this aging kingdom, every quirk and groan it offered. The theatre was his domain, each sweep of his broom a symphony performed for an audience of none. To many, Elias was just a janitor, a gentle presence in the shadows. But within the theatre's silent embraces, Elias Monroe was both historian and artist, a silent storyteller in a world fading into memory.
