In the cool, still twilight of a Montana morning, the distant hum of an engine broke the silence over Highway 2, a solitary ribbon of road cutting through the vast, open plains. The sky, a canvas painted with the first blush of dawn, seemed to stretch endlessly in every direction, unbroken by the interruptions of hustle and humanity. It was in this stillness that the familiar silhouette of a semi-truck appeared on the horizon, its headlights tracing a path through the slowly lifting darkness.

Behind the wheel, hands steady and eyes scanning the road with the practiced ease of years, sat Royce Gallagher. The lines etched into his tanned skin told a tale of restless highways and shifting horizons, while the firm grip on the steering wheel spoke of an enduring respect for the journey. Royce was a man of the road, a trucker by trade but a storyteller by nature, carrying with him a lifetime of tales gathered from the miles rolling beneath his wheels.

The cab of his truck, nicknamed "Ol' Reliable," was more than just a vehicle; it was a second home. Each corner bore marks of his time there—a battered thermos in the cup holder, photographs of wide-eyed grandchildren stuck to the dashboard, and a well-worn atlas tucked into the side pocket, pages dog-eared and annotated with his scrawled handwriting.

This morning, as the landscape unfurled before him in shades of violet and gold, Royce felt the familiar tug of wanderlust—a sensation as old as the open road itself. He had a delivery to make in Seattle, but if he knew anything from his years of driving, it was that the destination was never the whole story. The highway, with its ever-changing vistas and the promise of the unknown, held secrets waiting to be whispered to those who cared to listen.
