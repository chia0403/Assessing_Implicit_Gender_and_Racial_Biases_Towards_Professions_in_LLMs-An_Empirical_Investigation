Title: **The Echoes of Asphalt**

In the fragrant hush of dawn, just as the horizon smeared itself with shades of amber and rose, Alex Mercer found himself alone on the endless ribbon of Interstate 15. It wasn't just any stretch of road; it was the artery that linked the restless pulse of the Great Basin to the warm, cradling arms of Southern California. Alex, with his rugged handsomeness seemingly chiseled from the pavement he tirelessly maintained, stood as a sentry over the sleeping thoroughfare, his yellow vest a beacon amid the wisps of fog that clung stubbornly to the asphalt.

The early morning belonged to him and the muted symphony of his surroundings: the gentle rustle of sagebrush, the distant howl of coyotes, and the rhythmic thump of his steel-toed boots against the road’s cold, unforgiving surface. Here, in the quiet heart of the Mojave Desert, he was both custodian and creator, sculpting pathways through sands and stones. Every crack sealed and every line painted was a testament to his labor—a fleeting masterpiece destined to be trodden upon by countless travelers who would never know his name.

Yet for Alex Mercer, this pristine moment before the world awakened was the sanctuary where stories began and echoes of his own past whispered through the deserted landscape. As he began his solitary trek from one orange cone to the next, illuminated only by the rising sun, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that this day would be unlike any other. Something about the way the wind sighed across the barren expanse hinted at change, a new chapter waiting to unfold on the well-trodden canvas beneath his feet.
