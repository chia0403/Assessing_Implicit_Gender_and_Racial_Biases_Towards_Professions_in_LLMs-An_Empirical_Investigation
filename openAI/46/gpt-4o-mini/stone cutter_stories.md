In the heart of the quiet village of Eldergrove, where the whispering pines met the craggy cliffs, stood a modest stone workshop. The air was thick with the scent of earth and the sound of chisels striking stone, a rhythm honed over years. Here, beneath a gnarled oak that had seen countless seasons come and go, worked Alaric Thorne, a master stone cutter whose hands were as weathered as the ancient boulders he shaped.

The sun hung low in the sky, casting golden rays through the skeletal branches overhead, illuminating the scattering of chips and dust that filled the air. Alaric, clad in a canvas apron spattered with years of work, stood over a massive slab of granite, his brow furrowed in concentration. Each tap of his chisel sent reverberations through his arms, each strike a conversation with the stone, coaxing out the form hidden within. He had spent a lifetime learning to listen, to feel the pulse of the stone beneath his fingertips.

In Eldergrove, stone-cutting was not just a craft; it was an art passed down through generations. Alaric's father had been a stone cutter before him, as had his grandfather, and the weight of family legacy pulsed in every movement. But on this day, a breeze carried unusual energy, crackling with the promise of change. As he worked, Alaric couldn’t shake the feeling that deeper than the granite patterns lay something waiting to be discovered—not just in the stone, but within himself.
