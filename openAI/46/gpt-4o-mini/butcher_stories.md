Title: **The Last Cut**

In the quaint village of Elderswood, where cobblestone streets curved gracefully and the scent of pine mingled with the crisp autumn air, there stood a small, unassuming butcher shop known as “Redwood Meats.” The faded wooden sign creaked gently in the breeze, its letters painted a vibrant crimson that had begun to chip away over the years. Inside, the warm glow of hanging incandescent bulbs illuminated the pristine white tiles that lined the walls, reflecting the rich hues of the cuts of meat displayed in gleaming glass cases. 

At the heart of this establishment was George Eldridge, the butcher whose reputation for crafting the finest sausages and curing hams had drawn villagers from far and wide. With hands calloused from years of slicing and shaping, George approached his work with a reverence that often went unnoticed by customers who hurried in and out for their daily purchases. His broad shoulders hunched slightly as he meticulously arranged the day’s offerings: neatly tied bundles of herbs, glistening cuts of beef, and glimmering racks of pork that hinted at the artistry behind his craft. 

Yet, as autumn leaves danced through the air outside, a shadow lingered in George’s heart—a burden he carried in silence. The familiar clang of the shop's bells and the jovial banter with patrons couldn’t mask the unease that had settled over his mind. Elderswood was changing, and so too was the art of butcherery. Little did he know, the coming weeks would challenge everything he believed about his craft and the village he called home.
