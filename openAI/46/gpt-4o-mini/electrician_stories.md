Title: **The Current Beneath**

Setting: The small coastal town of Blackwater Cove, known for its charming old homes painted in fading pastel colors and the salty breeze that carries whispers of the ocean. The town’s unique lighthouse, a relic from a bygone era, stands as a sentinel on the rocky cliffs, its light sweeping the dark waters in rhythmic intervals. This quiet town, where everyone knows one another, is about to unravel secrets hidden beneath its picturesque façade.

It was early morning when the first slivers of dawn illuminated the cluttered workshop of Grant Silvers. The faint sound of waves crashing against the cliffs outside mingled with the sharp clatter of tools on his weathered workbench. Grant, a thirty-two-year-old electrician with tousled chestnut hair and calloused hands, had loved the tactile satisfaction of his job since he was a boy tinkering with old radios and broken appliances. His workshop was a testament to his passion, crammed with coils of wire, vintage circuit boards, and well-worn manuals that spoke of light and power.

Today, however, felt different. There was an unusual energy in the air—one that sent a shiver of anticipation up his spine. As he grabbed his worn leather tool belt and stepped outside, the salty breeze wrapped around him like an old friend, invigorating and familiar. The sky was painted in hues of peach and lavender, casting a soft glow over the dewy grass. Yet, somewhere in the depths of Blackwater Cove, hidden from sight and sound, lay an unresolved mystery that tugged at Grant's curiosity and unspoken fears.

With every step toward his first job of the day, a flicker of unease danced through him—an electrical current that left him questioning not just the wiring he was about to inspect but the very pulse of the town he called home. The light from the lighthouse blinked steadily in the distance, a beacon calling him toward hidden truths waiting to be discovered.
