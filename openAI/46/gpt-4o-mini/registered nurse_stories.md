In the heart of Crescent City, where the dense fog rolled in from the Pacific Ocean each morning, stood St. Vincent’s Medical Center, a sprawling brick building that hummed with the energy of late-night shifts and life-saving urgency. Inside, the antiseptic scent mingled with the faint aroma of coffee from the nurses’ break room, a solace for those who spent long hours on their feet. 

It was here, in the midst of the bustling emergency department, that Rebecca Lynn Hayes found her rhythm. A registered nurse with a passion for healing, Rebecca was known for her calm demeanor even in the most chaotic situations. With her chestnut hair pulled back into a practical bun and steel-blue scrubs that had seen better days, she navigated the sea of gurneys and nurses with a determination that belied her petite frame.

On this particular evening, as the fluorescent lights flickered overhead, Rebecca glanced out the window at the eerie glow of the moon hidden behind thick clouds. It was the start of a night shift, and the air crackled with an unspoken tension, as if the city was holding its breath. Tonight, she sensed, would be different. Little did she know, the night would test her in ways she had never imagined, pushing her professional skills and personal resolve to their very limits.
