The evening air was thick with humidity as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the grand façade of the Marquess Hotel. Tall and ornate, the building stood like a sentinel at the edge of the bustling city, its marble pillars gleaming under the vibrant neon lights that began to flicker to life. The sound of laughter and clinking glasses floated from the rooftop bar, mingling with the distant honking of car horns and the restless buzz of the urban sprawl.

Inside the lobby, plush red carpets cushioned the footsteps of the well-heeled guests gliding past the polished marble floor, while the persistent tinkle of an ornate brass bell echoed gently through the air. At the center of it all stood a young man in a crisp, navy uniform that gleamed with gold accents, the emblem of the hotel shimmering on his breast pocket. His name was Nicholas Raymond Braxton, but everyone simply called him Nick. 

Nick had been a bellhop at the Marquess for just over a year, learning the ins and outs of the job with the kind of eager enthusiasm that only comes from youth. His tousled dark hair and warm brown eyes reflected both his hard work and charm as he deftly maneuvered a heavy luggage cart across the lobby, nodding politely to the guests he passed. Each new arrival was a chance for Nick to practice his well-rehearsed lines and make small talk, hoping to glean a bit of excitement or intrigue from their stories, which often felt more vibrant than his own.

As he reached the elevator, its brass doors sliding open with a soft chime, Nick couldn’t help but feel a sense of anticipation. This night felt different—charged, as if the very air around him thrummed with unseen possibilities. He had a good feeling that something unexpected awaited him, and that this night at the Marquess Hotel would shift the course of his life in ways he had yet to imagine.
