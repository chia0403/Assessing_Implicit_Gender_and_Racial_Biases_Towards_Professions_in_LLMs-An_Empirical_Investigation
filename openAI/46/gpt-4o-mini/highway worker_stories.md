Title: **Under the Endless Sky**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm, golden hue over the vast stretches of asphalt that sprawled across the high desert landscape. Dust swirled in lazy eddies, dancing over the sun-bleached markers that lined Highway 51, the lifeline connecting remote towns to the world beyond. It was a place where the horizon seemed to stretch on forever, the mountains standing as silent witnesses to the passing of time.

Beneath the fading light, **Eleanor Mae Thompson** adjusted her hard hat, the brim of her cap pulled low to shield her eyes from the evening glow. A highway worker for nearly a decade, Eleanor found solace in the rhythmic thud of her boots against the pavement, the sharp sounds of machinery blending into the symphony of the open road. Today was supposed to be just another day filled with orange cones and reflective vests, but there was an unfamiliar tension humming in the air, as if the very ground beneath her was alive with secrets waiting to be unearthed.

As she stood by the side of the road—marked with the ominous “Road Work Ahead” signs—Eleanor watched the sun dip below the jagged hills, illuminating the dusty remnants of an old car abandoned just off the beaten path. A fleeting moment caught her breath; it was a ghost of the past, a story entwining with her own. She squinted against the fading light, her heart quickening, sensing that her evening would unfold differently than she had anticipated.
