The sun dipped low over the horizon, casting long shadows across the stone walls of Eldridge Keep. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint sound of waves crashing against the cliffs beyond. As twilight descended, the flickering torches along the battlements cast dancing shadows, illuminating the rugged features of a solitary figure standing watch.

This was Brynden Alaric, a seasoned guard of the keep, known for his unwavering loyalty and keen instincts. He stood tall, his posture rigid yet weary, his weathered leather armor creaking softly as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. The weight of his sword hung heavily at his side, a constant reminder of his duty to protect the realm from whatever threats lay beyond the ancient stone walls.

As he peered into the growing darkness, Brynden’s mind wandered to the stories whispered around the fire in the guardhouse—the tales of marauding bands that had once terrorized the countryside and the dark forces said to be lurking in the shadowy woods. Yet tonight, there was an unsettling calm, an eerie silence that draped itself over the landscape like a shroud. He could hear the distant hoot of an owl and the rustle of leaves in the soft evening breeze, but beneath that veneer of tranquility, an anxious gnawing stirred deep within him.

Somewhere out there, in the gathering gloom, something was stirring. And Brynden Alaric knew that it was only a matter of time before it came to claim its prey.
