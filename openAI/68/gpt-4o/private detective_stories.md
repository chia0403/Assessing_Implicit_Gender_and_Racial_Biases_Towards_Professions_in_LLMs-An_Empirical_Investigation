In the heart of a storm-soaked city, where the rain danced on rooftops like eager percussionists, the hum of neon signs lit up the dimly lit streets with a kaleidoscope of colors. The mournful wail of a saxophone from a nearby alley wove through the air, blending seamlessly with the murmur of voices and the distant rumble of thunder. 

Perched above this concrete jungle was the office of Eliot Carmichael, Private Investigator. It was a cramped space on the fourth floor of an aging brick building, just one flickering bulb away from being condemned. Against one wall, a battered wooden desk bore the weight of old files and unanswered letters, while a coat rack sagged under the weight of trench coats that remembered better days. The window, grimy from years of neglect, offered only a blurred view of the city, as if it refused to unveil its secrets too easily.

Eliot sat behind the desk, leaning back in his creaky leather chair with a glass of bourbon resting in his hand. The liquid caught the dim light, casting warm amber reflections onto the floor. He was a man whose sharp eyes had seen too much and rested beneath a furrowed brow that spoke of countless unsolved mysteries. His trench coat, draped loosely over his shoulders, was worn at the edges—a testament to the many nights he’d spent chasing shadows.

A gentle knock at the door broke the rhythmic patter of rain, drawing Eliot’s gaze. It wasn’t a sound that promised an easy case or a simple answer, but instead, the kind of knock that precedes the unraveling of lives. Adjusting his fedora, Eliot set his drink down and rose to his feet. This was his city, drenched and dire, and for Eliot Carmichael, its mysteries were his to solve—or die trying.
