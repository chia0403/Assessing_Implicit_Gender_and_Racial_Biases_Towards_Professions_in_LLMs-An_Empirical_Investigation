The grand lobby of the Starlight Regency Hotel buzzed with the endless shuffle of hurried guests, their laughter and chatter echoing off the marble floors and ornate ceilings. Crystal chandeliers glimmered overhead, casting a warm, golden glow that enveloped everyone in a soft embrace. Near the entrance, a massive revolving door spun rhythmically as streams of travelers entered and exited, pulling behind them a parade of well-worn luggage and weary expressions.

Amidst this timeless whirl of movement stood Oliver Harrington, perfectly poised in his crisp, navy-blue uniform, complete with gold-trimmed lapels and a gleaming name tag. Oliver, with his charcoaled hair neatly tucked under a matching cap, watched the scene unfold from his post by the antique brass luggage cart. His eyes sparkled with a keen awareness of the bustling world around him, yet held a quiet composure that spoke of years spent in the elegant dance of the hospitality industry.

To many, Oliver was more than just a bell hop; he was the silent guide to their frantic journeys, the first to greet them with a welcoming smile and the last to bid them farewell. Today, however, as the afternoon sun stretched shadows across the marble floor, he sensed something unusual in the airâ€”a subtle shift, as if an unseen hand was about to turn a new page in the story of the Starlight Regency, and Oliver Harrington, perhaps unwittingly, would stand at the very center of it.
