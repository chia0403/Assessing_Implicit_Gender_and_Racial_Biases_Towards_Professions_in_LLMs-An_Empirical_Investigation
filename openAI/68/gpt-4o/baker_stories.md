Amelia Hartman awoke to the gentle chime of her alarm, the notes mingling with the soft pastel light of dawn creeping through her small kitchen window. The tiny village of Windmere was still shrouded in the soft hush of early morning, the cobblestone streets empty save for the occasional stray cat slipping into shadowed alleys. The fragrance of lilacs, which bordered the garden just outside, drifted lightly through the open window, hinting at the promise of spring. 

Amelia stretched, shaking off the remnants of sleep, and moved swiftly, her footsteps a whisper against the cool tiles of the bakery adjoining her modest home. She lit the lamps hanging from rustic beams overhead, their golden glow casting dancing shadows across walls lined with copper pans and glossy jars of spices. The heart of the bakery, a well-worn oak worktable, stood ready at the room's center, its surface dusted with a thin coating of flour from the day beforeâ€”a promise of the labor and reward that awaited her.

As she tied her apron, its fabric soft from years of use, Amelia breathed deeply and imagined the aroma of freshly baked bread that would soon fill the air, mingling with the morning mist. She relished this tranquil hour before Windmere awakened, when the world was hers alone and the boundaries between hope and comfort blurred, transformed by the simple alchemy of flour, water, yeast, and time.
