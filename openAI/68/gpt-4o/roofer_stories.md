In the small, windswept town of Harbor’s Edge, where the Atlantic waves crashed tirelessly against the rugged cliffs, Geraldine “Gerry” Simmons started her mornings before the sun had the courage to rise. The smell of salt and tar lingered in the brisk air as she loaded her work truck with worn but trusty tools: a battered hammer, sturdy ladder, and a roll of waterproof underlayment. Her fingers, calloused from years of hard work, moved skillfully, oblivious to the chill that crept from the sea to blanket the town in a cool embrace.

Gerry, a roofer by trade and a poet at heart, found solace in the rhythm of her daily labor. Each rooftop she mended or built anew was a stanza; every nail hammered into wood, a deliberate beat in her life's composition. The houses here were stubborn old souls, built to withstand the harsh gales that battered them year-round, and Gerry was their whisperer—a guardian who kept the storms at bay.

As she drove through the sleepy streets in her faded blue pickup, her destination loomed ahead: a century-old cottage perched precariously on the edge of the world. It belonged to Mrs. Callahan, a widow known for her scones and stories, each woven with threads of whimsy and truth. Her roof had borne the brunt of time and weather, and it was Gerry's mission to restore its strength against the upcoming winter.

The sun, a timid apprentice to the roaring ocean, began its ascent, painting the morning sky in hues of orange and pink. Gerry parked her truck, stepped out, and took in the view. This was her office—a place where the earth met the sea, and the wind whispered secrets of distant lands. Harbor’s Edge might have been just another dot on the map to some, but to Gerry, it was both home and inspiration, a sanctuary where every rooftop held a story waiting to be re-told.
