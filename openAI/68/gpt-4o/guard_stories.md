In the heart of the ancient city of Brenton, where cobblestone streets meandered like serpentine rivers beneath the glow of wrought-iron lanterns, stood the imposing silhouette of Castlegate Tower. It was a bastion of old-world charm, its stone walls etched with the passage of time, whispering tales of heroism and shadowed secrets. This was where Alexander Rhys Morgan, the stalwart guardian of Castlegate, began his nightly watch.

Alexander, known to most as "Alex," was a seasoned guard whose presence was as steady as the tides that lapped the city's outer walls. Tall and broad-shouldered, with a watchful gaze and a calm authority, he roamed the parapets with an air of quiet confidence. The resonance of his boots against the ancient stone echoed throughout the narrow corridors, a symphony of solitude amidst the tranquil night.

The air was crisp and carried with it a scent of distant rain mingled with the salt of the nearby sea. As the moon cast a silvery veil over the city, Alex paused to survey his surroundings. From his vantage point atop the tower, he could see the sprawling tapestry of Brenton unfurl below himâ€”a maze of rooftops and hidden alleys, each corner holding stories both past and yet to come.

Tonight, however, there was an unspoken tension in the air, a sense of something amiss that tugged at the edges of Alex's intuition. As the silence deepened, he felt the weight of his duty press upon him. With a final, contemplative gaze at the city he was sworn to protect, Alexander Rhys Morgan resumed his patrol, unaware of the fateful events that the night had quietly set into motion.
