The summer air was thick with the scent of gasoline and the hum of engines, a symphony only a true gearhead could appreciate. In the heart of Cedar Mills, a town nestled between dense forests and rolling hills, stood a modest workshop known far and wide as Rhea's Garage. Through its open doors, the clang of metal rang out, echoing along the quiet street.

Rhea Thompson, a name synonymous with mechanical wizardry, wiped the sweat from her brow with the sleeve of her oil-stained coveralls. Her chestnut hair was pulled back into a no-nonsense ponytail, and her bright green eyes were filled with a rare blend of determination and warmth. Rhea had taken over the garage from her father, a local legend in his own right, and had spent years honing her craft, becoming the go-to mechanic in the county.

Stacks of old tires and rows of gleaming tools surrounded her, each item meticulously organized in its place. A worn-out radio on the workbench crackled softly with classic rock tunes, providing the perfect backdrop to the rhythmic squeak of Rhea's ratchet.

It was early morning, and the sun had just begun its ascent, casting a golden glow over the small town. Birds chirped lazily in the trees, and the world began to stir. Rhea was in her element, lost in the intricate puzzle of a disassembled engine spread out before her. Little did she know, this peaceful morning would soon tumble into chaos, setting off a chain of events that might just change everything she thought she knew about her small, seemingly ordinary world.
