**Title:** Miles of Silence

**Setting:** The sun hung low over the vast expanse of Route 66, casting long shadows across the cracked pavement and the occasional stretch of parched desert landscape. A few gas stations dotted the roadside, their neon signs flickering hesitantly as the dusk settled in. It was an unforgiving stretch of road that seemed to stretch endlessly toward the horizon, flanked by rugged mountains and the vast, open sky that turned to hues of orange and purple as night fell.

**Opening:**

Gordon James McGraw had mastered the art of solitude. Behind the wheel of his rumbling Peterbilt, he felt like a phantom gliding through a dreamscape of faded billboards and swaying tumbleweeds, each mile carrying him further away from the life he once knew. With the radio tuned to a crackling country station, the familiar tunes swirled around him, a bittersweet melody that echoed the loneliness of open highways. As he steered the truck toward the next rest stop, his weathered hands gripped the wheel with a practiced ease, but his mind was a landscape of its own—filled with fragmented memories of home, echoes of laughter, and the gentle whisper of the wind sweeping through the prairie grass.

Gordon's thoughts drifted to the last phone call with his brother, a reminder of the lives they once shared and the dreams they had left behind. It had been two months since he’d felt the warmth of a loved one’s voice. Most nights, he preferred the company of the stars overhead to the silence that filled the cab like smoke. But tonight, as a hint of storm brewed on the horizon, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was just beyond his reach on this endless road—something he hadn’t allowed himself to confront for far too long. 

Out of nowhere, the headlights of an oncoming vehicle cut through the dusk, and Gordon squinted, shaking off the cobwebs of his thoughts as the truck barreled past—a reminder that life still rushed forward, whether he was ready or not.
