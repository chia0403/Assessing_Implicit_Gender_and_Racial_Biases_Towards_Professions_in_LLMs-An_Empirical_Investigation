The early morning light spilled through the tall pines, casting a dappled pattern over the dewy grass of the sprawling estate known as Briarwood Manor. Nestled on the outskirts of a small town, the mansion was an imposing structure, its weathered stone facade whispering tales of a bygone era. The breath of autumn hung in the air, crisp and fragrant, as leaves danced gently to the ground, their vibrant hues painting the landscape in shades of amber and crimson.

Amidst this serene tableau, Walter Edgar Thompson meticulously tended to the gardens that embraced the manor. With calloused hands and a sun-chapped face, Walter moved with a practiced grace, his trusty spade resting comfortably at his side. For over two decades, he had been the groundskeeper—guardian of the sprawling lawns and intricate flower beds, custodian of the memories that lingered in every wooden bench and cobblestone path.

Despite the beauty surrounding him, Walter often felt a solitude that stretched beyond the edges of the lush estate. The residents of Briarwood Manor had long ceased to be a constant presence; the grand home had become a place of whispered stories and shadows. Yet, it was within the silence of this sprawling garden where he found a peculiar sense of belonging, tending to the flora as if it were a family of its own.

But today, as he knelt by the azalea bushes, a chill in the air hinted at change—a feeling that the past was not done with him yet. Walter wiped his brow, noticing something glimmering beneath the roots of an ancient oak tree. Curiosity piqued, he leaned closer, a knot of unease forming in his stomach. Little did he know that this mundane morning would soon unravel secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of Briarwood Manor, secrets intertwined with his own life in ways he could not yet imagine.
