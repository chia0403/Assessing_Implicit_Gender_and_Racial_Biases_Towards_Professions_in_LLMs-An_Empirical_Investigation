The neon lights of "The Velvet Glow" flickered rhythmically, casting a warm yet melancholic hue over the bar's polished hardwood counter. Outside, the rain pattered against the window, blurring the view of the bustling city streets, while inside, the faint sound of jazz floated through the air, mingling with the low hum of conversation. The bar was a refuge for the weary and the wanderers, a sanctuary where stories unfolded in whispers over clinking glasses.

At the center of it all stood Maxwell Oliver, a bartender with a knack for mixing drinks and an ear for listening. His dark hair was tousled in a way that suggested a long day followed by a longer night, and his sharp blue eyes held a depth of understanding that made patrons feel at ease. He wiped the counter with practiced ease, eyeing the half-empty glasses scattered like memories on the bar. Maxwell had seen it all—first dates, breakups, celebrations, and losses—and he wore each story like a badge of honor.

As he poured a bourbon for a regular who sat slumped over the bar, the door swung open with a creak, and a gust of cool air swept in. In walked a figure wrapped in a rain-soaked trench coat, the hood pulled low over their face, casting an intriguing shadow. Maxwell’s instincts flared; he sensed this newcomer was not just seeking shelter from the storm but was also carrying a story of their own, one that was about to intertwine with his own life in ways he could not yet imagine.
