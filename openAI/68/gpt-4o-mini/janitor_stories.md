The air was thick with the scent of lingering disinfectant as Marcus Alexander Wright pushed his cart down the long, sterile corridor of Belmont High School. It was early morning, just before the students would flood the hallways, and the sunlight filtered through high windows, casting long shadows on the polished linoleum floor. The school was a sprawling structure of red brick and glass, its hallways adorned with photos of past graduates and trophies that gleamed under fluorescent lights. 

Marcus had worked at Belmont for nearly a decade, his presence as much a part of the school as the worn-out banners hanging in the gymnasium. Over the years, he had come to know the rhythms of the placeâ€”the early risers scrambling for last-minute homework by their lockers, the teachers bustling in with coffee cups and hopes for a perfect day, and the echoes of laughter that bounced off the walls during lunch.

With his mop in one hand and a bucket in the other, he moved with a quiet grace, his faded blue jumpsuit a stark contrast to the vibrant artwork lining the walls. He was an unassuming figure, but his sharp eyes missed little. Each stain on the floor told a story, and he often found himself pondering the lives and struggles of the students who passed through his domain. 

Today, however, felt different. The hum of activity was subdued, and a lingering sense of anticipation hung in the air. As he rounded the corner near the science lab, he noticed the door slightly ajar, a flickering fluorescent light spilling out into the hallway. Curiosity piqued, Marcus paused, feeling an unusual prick of intuition that today would unveil secrets hidden beneath the everyday hustle of school life.
