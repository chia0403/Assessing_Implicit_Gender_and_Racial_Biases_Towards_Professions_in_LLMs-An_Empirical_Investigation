Title: **The Edge of Dawn**

**Setting:**  
The city of Aldermere lay shrouded in the early morning mist, the faint glow of streetlamps flickering like distant stars against a backdrop of fog-drenched pavement. The skyline, a jagged silhouette of modernity and history, loomed against the auburn hues of sunrise peeking over the horizon. Amidst the quiet hum of a city awakening, the faint wail of a siren broke the stillness, a reminder that for some, the night was far from over.

**Opening:**  
Emergency Medical Technician Clara Mae Thompson tightened her grip on the steering wheel of the ambulance as she navigated the slick streets of Aldermere, her heart thumping in time with the rhythmic thrum of the engine. It was a typical Friday morning, one that promised the usual fare of accidents, overdoses, and the occasional heart attack. The radio crackled to life beside her, announcing a call for assistance in the downtown district—a place that never seemed to sleep, even in the early hours. 

Clara, rising through the ranks of her profession with both tenacity and compassion, had seen enough in her five years on the job to know that every call was a window into someone's life, a story paused at the edge of crisis. Today, she wore her field uniform like armor, its familiar weight a comforting reminder of her mission to keep others safe amidst chaos.

As the ambulance turned a corner, an old brick building came into view, adorned with ivy and crowned with a weathered sign that hung askew. The call had reported an unconscious male on the sidewalk. Clara took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever awaited them—a split-second decision could mean the difference between life and death. Minutes felt like hours as she raced against time, determined to save a life before the dawn broke fully over the city.
