In the heart of the bustling town of Elderswood, where cobblestone streets twisted around age-old buildings like vines around a trellis, stood McGregor’s Meats, a quaint butcher shop with timeworn charm. The scent of freshly cut herbs and smoked bacon wafted through the air, enticing passersby to step inside. The glass display case gleamed under the warm glow of antique pendant lights, showcasing an array of meats—juicy steaks, marinated roasts, and neatly stacked sausages, each meticulously crafted and expertly arranged by the shop's owner.

Walter Finnegan McGregor, a burly man with a weathered face and hands roughened by years of skillful work, stood behind the counter, his apron streaked with flecks of blood and spice. Walter had inherited the shop from his father, a legacy steeped in tradition and craftsmanship that had been passed down through generations. Now in his forties, with a thick mane of salt-and-pepper hair tied back and a perpetual twinkle in his deep-set blue eyes, he approached his craft with a blend of reverence and pride.

As dawn broke each morning, casting golden rays through the shop's tall windows, Walter prepared for the day ahead, his mind drifting between the rhythms of the knife and the echoes of his family’s history. But today felt different. A sense of anticipation hung in the air, thicker than the aromas that filled the shop. As he cleaved through a primal cut of beef, a heavy knock rattled the front door, pulling his attention from the hum of the familiar routine. Little did he know that the journey awaiting him would change the very fabric of his life, unearthing secrets buried deep in Elderswood’s shadows.
