**Title: The Secrets Beneath Oakwood High**

**Setting:**
Oakwood High School, an aging brick structure adorned with ivy and surrounded by tall oak trees, looms on the edge of a sleepy town. The hallways echo with the remnants of laughter and learning, but shadows linger in the corners, remnants of secrets long buried. On a chilly autumn evening, as leaves crunch underfoot and a waning sun casts long shadows through the cracked windows, the school hums with a quiet energy. Vibrant posters of past achievements line the walls, while lockers clang shut one final time as students rush out, leaving behind the echoes of their day. 

**Opening:**
Jorge Elias Ramirez stood in the center of the empty hallway, his mop in hand and a bucket filled with soapy water at his feet. He was a tall man, with skin bronzed from years of hard work and a thick mane of dark hair peppered with gray. At fifty, he had grown accustomed to the hum of fluorescent lights and the rhythmic sound of his own footsteps on the linoleum floor. As the janitor of Oakwood High, he found solace in the quiet moments after the last bell rang—before the ghosts of the day began to whisper their stories.

Tonight, however, the air felt different. There was an electric tension that prickled the back of his neck as he moved along the corridor, a feeling he couldn’t quite shake. As he rounded the corner near the chemistry lab, he paused, nearly dropping his mop. The door hung ajar, a sliver of light spilling out into the dim hallway. Faint whispers drifted from within, a curious sound in the otherwise silent building. Jorge’s heart raced as he leaned closer, caught between his instinct to investigate and the knowledge that he had a job to do. 

He had worked at Oakwood High for over a decade, cleaning up after the students, packing away memories and forgotten belongings. Yet tonight, he felt the weight of something more significant pressing down like the autumn air—an unspoken mystery waiting just behind that door.
