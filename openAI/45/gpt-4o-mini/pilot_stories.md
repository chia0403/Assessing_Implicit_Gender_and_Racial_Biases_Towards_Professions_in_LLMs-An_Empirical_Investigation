**Title: Skies of Reckoning**

**Setting:** The story opens at the bustling St. Helens Aerodrome, a regional airport nestled between the rugged peaks of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. The sun hangs low on the horizon, painting the sky in streaks of orange and pink, as the early morning fog begins to lift from the tarmac. The air is filled with the familiar hum of small planes taking off and landing, mixed with the invigorating scent of pine from the surrounding forests.

**Opening:**

As the first rays of sunlight broke through the mist, casting a golden hue across the runway, Captain Althea Mae Morgan stood by her trusty Cessna 182, a gentle breeze tugging at her tousled chestnut hair. A seasoned pilot with ten years of experience under her belt, Althea was known around St. Helens for her unwavering determination and skill. Today was particularly special: she was set to embark on a solo flight into the heart of the wilderness, a journey that would test both her navigational acumen and her resolve.

Althea’s vibrant emerald eyes adjusted to the morning light as she conducted her pre-flight checks, her heart racing in anticipation of the adventure ahead. This wasn’t just another flight; it was a chance to reforge her connection with the skies after a year-long hiatus following an accident that had shaken her confidence and left eerie echoes of doubt in her mind.

With the roar of the engine rumbling to life beneath her, Althea flashed a determined smile, recalling her late father’s words: "The sky isn’t just a place to fly—it’s where you find yourself." Today, as the fog lifted completely and revealed the endless expanse of blue overhead, she was ready to reclaim not only her wings, but also her spirit.
