Dr. Eliza Harper tapped her desk rhythmically with a pen as she reviewed the day's schedule. Her dental practice, nestled in the heart of Briarwood, a quaint seaside town known for its cobblestone streets and picturesque lighthouse, had been steadily growing over the past five years. Patients often commented on how the building's ivy-covered red brick exterior matched perfectly with the town's old-world charm.

Through the window of her cozy corner office, Eliza could see the morning mist lifting from the ocean, revealing a shimmering blanket of blue that stretched to the horizon. Seagulls circled in the sky, their cries mingling with the soft sound of waves lapping against the shore. Inside, the practice exuded a comforting warmth with its soft, pastel-colored walls adorned with framed photographs of smiling patients and pulled wisdom teeth.

As Eliza glanced up from her desk, the familiar hum of the sterilization machine filled the air, mixing with the distant chatter of her dental assistants prepping the first operatory room. Today felt different, though. Perhaps it was the anticipation of her appointment with Mr. Callahan, the town's oldest resident, or maybe it was the arrival of a new patient rumored to have an interesting connection to Briarwood's storied past. Whatever the reason, Eliza felt a curious excitement she couldn't quite place, as if the day held the promise of an unexpected revelation.
