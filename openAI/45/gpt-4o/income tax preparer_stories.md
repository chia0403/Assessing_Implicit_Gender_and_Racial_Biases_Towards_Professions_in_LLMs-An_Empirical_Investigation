In the bustling heart of Chicago, the rhythmic tapping of keyboards was the symphony that accompanied the early morning rush at Harrison & Co. Tax Services. Outside, the Windy City lived up to its name, as a cold breeze swept through the treetops lining Michigan Avenue, rustling leaves that clung desperately to the edges of autumn branches. Inside, the office was a warm haven, filled with the scent of fresh coffee and the promise of quiet determination.

Evelyn Parker sat at her desk, sipping her first espresso of the day as the world outside stirred to life. Evelyn had a knack for numbers that was almost uncanny, a gift inherited from her grandfather, who had been a foreman in one of the city’s earliest stockyards. The charm laid more in her commitment to her clients than her proficiency with spreadsheets and deductions. She knew each of them by name, understood the weight of their stories, and felt a sense of privilege in helping them navigate their financial landscapes.

Her office was a curious mix of old-world elegance and modern efficiency, with dark mahogany shelves crammed with leather-bound ledgers and the latest tax code manuals. A single window offered a stunning view of Lake Michigan where the sun was just beginning to cast its golden reflection on the water, matching the glint of opportunity that Evelyn saw in every new day.

As the clock ticked towards eight, Evelyn prepared to meet her first client of the season, a kindly retired schoolteacher named Mrs. Thompson, who had been one of Evelyn’s very first clients nearly a decade ago. Checking her laptop one last time, Evelyn allowed herself a brief pause to savor the quiet anticipation that always accompanied the start of tax season—a time of year that, to her, represented both challenge and change.
