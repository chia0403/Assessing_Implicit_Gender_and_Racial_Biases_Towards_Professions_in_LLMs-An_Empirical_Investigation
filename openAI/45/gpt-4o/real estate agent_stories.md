In the heart of the sunlit coastal town of Seabreeze Hills, where the ocean's whispers entwine with the rustling palms, stood the elegant yet unassuming office of Olivia Jameson, a real estate agent known for her knack of turning dream homes into reality. The town itself was one of those rare gems along the eastern shoreline, boasting a montage of pastel-colored cottages, sprawling estates with sun-drenched verandas, and a timeless main street that hummed with the scent of saltwater and fresh coffee. Morning light danced across the water, slipping through the window slats of Olivia’s office, casting gentle shadows onto her meticulously organized desk. Today marked the beginning of a new chapter for Olivia, as she prepared to unveil her latest property—a forgotten manor nestled at the edge of the tranquil Everwood Forest, rumored to hold secrets of its own.
