The sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, casting the suburban airfield of Evergreen Valley in a soft, golden hue. Wind whistled gently through the rows of neatly parked Cessna planes, and the smell of fuel blended with the distant aroma of pine trees that bordered the runway. The dusk was alive with the chirping of crickets, a gentle soundtrack that accompanied the end of another day.

Rebecca "Becky" Caldwell stood just outside the hangar's wide doors, adjusting her aviator sunglasses atop her head and shielding her eyes as she gazed towards the sky. As the chief pilot and manager of Evergreen Aviation, she had practically grown up with wings, having spent her childhood summer days watching her father fly the same kind of small aircraft she now managed with care and authority. At 34, Becky was a testament to persistence and passion, having dedicated her life to mastering the skies and helping others reach for them.

Her olive-green flight jacket fluttered lightly in the evening breeze, the embroidered wings on its chest glinting in the soft light. The air was cool as it swirled around the hangar, bringing with it a sense of serene anticipation. Tonight, Becky was preparing for an aerial tour she cherishedâ€”one that promised not just the thrill of flight, but also an opportunity to share her love of the sky with those who dared to join her.
