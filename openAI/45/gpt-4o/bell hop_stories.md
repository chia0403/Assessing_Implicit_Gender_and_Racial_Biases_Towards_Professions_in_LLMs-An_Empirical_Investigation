On the misty banks of Lake Elenshire, nestled amidst towering pines and ancient oaks, stood the grand Rivermore Hotel. Its faded Victorian charm whispered secrets of yesteryears, each room a repository of stories untold. The air was brisk with the scent of pine and impending rain, as dawn broke over the enigmatic silhouette of the hotel’s spires against a murky sky.

Inside, the polished marble floors gleamed under the glow of ornate chandeliers, and the echoes of whispered conversations danced through the corridors. It was here, in the heart of such storied elegance, that Thomas “Tom” Braddock, the ever-reliable bell hop, began his day.

With an unwavering smile and well-practiced precision, Tom maneuvered the grand luggage trolley through the opulent foyer. Clad in his crisp burgundy uniform, every button perfectly aligned, he was a fixture as much as the intricately carved woodwork or the eternally ticking grandfather clock by the entrance. Tom’s youthful brown eyes, glinting with curiosity, took in every detail, every guest interaction, for to him, the Rivermore was as much a theater as it was his place of work. 

But today, a subtle shift lingered in the air, as if the lake itself held its breath. A peculiar note had been left for him at the concierge's desk—a delicate envelope sealed with a crimson wax emblem he didn’t recognize. As Tom skated the trolley across the polished floors, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this morning heralded not just the arrival of new guests but of mysteries waiting to unfold.
