In the dim, early morning hours, when most of the city still lay wrapped in sleep, Henry Caldwell pushed open the heavy, metal door of the Garrison Building. The arid wind of the desert town of Red Rock rustled his graying hair as he entered the silent lobby, the lingering smell of bleach and worn carpet greeting him like an old friend. Built in the late 1960s, the Garrison Building was an odd construct in a town mostly avoided by tourists; its twelve floors stood prominently against the flat skyline, a testament to past ambitions that never quite materialized.

Henry, the building's janitor for over two decades, shuffled past the reception desk. The jerseys of past local football heroes hung on the walls, their colors faded with time, beneath the flickering fluorescent lights. Despite its aging state and the rattling air vents, this place had become more than just a workplace for himâ€”it was a repository of stories, and memories, layered in dust and whispers that only someone like him would notice.

With a deep sigh, he retrieved his mop and bucket, preparing for another day of quiet observations and unnoticed labor. As he began his methodical routine, Henry wondered what secrets today's floors might reveal, or what stories might unfold in the solitude of his morning rounds.
