In the quiet predawn hours, an amber glow tinted the horizon, stretching across the expanse of flat, open road that seemed to unfurl infinitely into the heartland. It was the kind of morning where the world held its breath in a serene pause, enveloped in the soft hum of nature waking. Birds had yet to stir, and a light fog clung to the damp ground like a silken shroud.

Jack “Tennessee” Murphy adjusted his worn-out cap, the one with the frayed brim that had seen every state line and truck stop coffee pot from El Paso to the eastern seaboard. He settled comfortably into the driver’s seat of his eighteen-wheeler—an old but trustworthy rig with a faded blue cab and the name 'Starlight Express' emblazoned on the side in peeling white letters.

Truckers like Jack knew every subtlety of the Interstate, every twist and turn as intimately as the lines on their own palms. He had stopped at every diner counter, swapped stories and laughter with fellow wanderers under buzzing neon signs, and cradled countless mugs close, more solace in their warmth than the caffeine they offered.

On this quiet Tennessee morning, he was hauling a cargo of hopeful beginnings—a load of books destined for small-town libraries scattered across the Midwest, each destination a place where stories untold would find homes. Jack glanced over at the passenger seat, an empty space usually adorned with his old brown journal—a collection of tales, destinations, and musings from years on the road.

The hum of the engine was a familiar lullaby, comforting in its predictability as he pulled onto Highway 40, the gravel crunch of the truck stop fading behind him. As Jack eased the truck onto the open road, he felt the gentle embrace of solitude, the open sky above and the certainty of miles to go, a promise hanging like morning mist gathered around the bases of rolling hills. For Jack “Tennessee” Murphy, every sunrise was the start of a new chapter, and today was no different.
