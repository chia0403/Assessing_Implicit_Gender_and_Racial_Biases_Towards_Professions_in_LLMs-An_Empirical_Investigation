In the heart of the small, mist-veiled town of Garret's Hollow, where the cobblestones seemed to whisper underfoot and the timbered houses leaned conspiratorially towards each other, stood a quaint, timeworn shop that had seen generations pass through its wooden doors. This was Milton Hughes' butcher shop—a place that had been known for its excellence long before he took up the cleaver.

Milton, a burly man in his late forties with a disposition as hearty as the meats he prepared, was setting up the display counter as slivers of dawn crept their way through the frosted windows, casting a golden glow over the polished oak interior. The air inside was a welcoming blend of spices and fresh herbs, each carefully sprinkled over the day's array of offerings—succulent roasts, marbled steaks, and his particular pride, sage-infused sausages.

Despite his robust frame, Milton moved with the precision of an artist, his hands deftly orchestrating a symphony of butchery; each slice, a note in his morning melody. To the townsfolk, Milton Hughes was more than just a butcher; he was a custodian of tradition, a man who understood the intricate dance between knife and flesh, maintaining a craft that spoke of old-world authenticity in an age bending toward mass production.

Outside, the town began to rouse from its slumber. The baker across the street was already hard at work, and the scent of fresh bread mingled harmoniously with the aromas from Milton's shop. As patrons filtered in, drawn by both the wares and the warmth of Milton's familiar greeting, Garret's Hollow came alive, and within its cradle, the rhythms of everyday life thrummed through the arteries of its cobbled streets.
