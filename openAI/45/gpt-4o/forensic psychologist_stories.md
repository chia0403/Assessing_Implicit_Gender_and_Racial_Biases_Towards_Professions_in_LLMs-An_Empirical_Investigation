Dr. Evelyn Carter had always found a peculiar solace in the quiet hum of pre-dawn New York City. As the first light of day crept tentatively over the jagged skyline, she stood by the window of her modest ninth-floor apartment, a steaming cup of coffee warming her hands. The apartment was nestled in a historic brownstone building on the Upper West Side, its creaky wooden floors and art-deco fixtures whispering hints of a bygone era. Outside, the streets below were slowly coming to life, the sounds of delivery trucks and distant subway rumbles blending into a symphony of urban renewal.

Evelyn, a highly regarded forensic psychologist, was known among her peers for her keen insights into the minds of criminals. Her office, housed within the towering glass structure of the New York City Criminal Courthouse, was a stark contrast to her cozy home. There, everything was modern and metallic, designed purely for function over form, much like the methodical and often grueling work she undertook. Yet, Evelyn had a knack for finding patterns where others saw chaos, taking fragmented glimpses into the darkest recesses of the human psyche and assembling them into coherent narratives. 

Today, a new case awaited her—a high-profile murder trial that had captured the city’s attention with its lurid headlines and salacious details. As she prepared to step into the whirlwind of the city's justice system once again, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that this case held secrets even she might struggle to uncover. There was a chill in the air, both inside and out, whispering of impending revelations.
