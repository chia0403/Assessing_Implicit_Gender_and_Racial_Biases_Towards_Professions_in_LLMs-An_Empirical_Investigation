In the heart of the bustling coastal town of Greyhaven, nestled between the emerald waves and the whispering pines, stood an old workshop with a hand-carved sign that read, “Harper Ellison - Master Carpenter.” The morning sun spilled golden light across the wooden facade, revealing years of loving wear on its surface.

Harper Ellison, a craftsman known far and wide for turning the ordinary into extraordinary, had spent decades perfecting his art in this very spot. Today, as the familiar scent of sawdust danced in the crisp air, he pushed open the creaking double doors, flooding the shadowed interior with the promise of a new day. Inside, every tool hung in immaculate order, gleaming in anticipation of the work to come. An array of unfinished projects, future masterpieces in waiting, lined the walls; each told a story of its own, whispering to the soul of the wood from which it would soon emerge.

As Harper moved through the room, the steady rhythm of waves crashing against the nearby shore seemed to sync with his heartbeat, a reminder of life’s ebbs and flows. This shop, both sanctuary and muse, had been his refuge since inheriting it from his father—a legacy woven from the fibers of dreams and memories. Today, it cradled a new venture, one that Harper felt would push the boundaries of his craftsmanship and perhaps even his understanding of himself. With a deep, calming breath, he picked up a smooth piece of cedar, its rich scent filling his senses, and began.
