The morning sun crept slowly over the horizon, casting a warm, golden hue across the quiet town of Middleton, nestled between rolling green hills and a serene, winding river. The town was just beginning to stir, as shop owners flipped their signs from "Closed" to "Open," and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee began wafting through the streets.

In the heart of the town stood an old brick building with a large bay window that displayed picturesque landscapes from around the world—tropical beaches, majestic mountains, bustling cityscapes. Above the door, a well-worn sign read, "Wanderlust Travel Agency."

Inside, beneath the soft glow of hanging Edison bulbs, Amelia Hartley busied herself at her desk, a steaming cup of Earl Grey by her side. As Middleton's only travel agent, Amelia had curated countless dream vacations over the years, her reputation built on a deep well of knowledge and an uncanny knack for finding the perfect getaway. Her office was a testament to her passion; maps covered the walls, and brochures overflowed from every available surface.

Today, however, there was a peculiar excitement in the autumn air, unlike any Amelia had felt before. It wasn't just the anticipation of arranging yet another memorable journey for her clients. No, there was something different—something that whispered of a new adventure waiting just beyond the horizon, one that promised to change her life in ways she had only ever imagined.
