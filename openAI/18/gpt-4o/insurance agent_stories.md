On a rainy Tuesday morning, the city of Crestwood was enveloped in a thick blanket of fog that seemed to embrace the towering buildings and cobblestone streets. The sound of raindrops tapping against the windowpanes formed a melancholy symphony, setting the tone for a day that felt as though it belonged to the somber days of November, rather than early spring.

The streets were slick with rain and the usual hustle of the morning rush hour was muted, as if the entire city was operating in slow motion. People scurried along the sidewalks, umbrellas held tightly against the persistent drizzle, their figures wraithlike in the mist.

In his modest, second-floor office, located above a quaint bakery on Maple Street, Samuel Harrington sat at his desk, the glow of his computer screen illuminating his tired eyes. As an insurance agent in this bustling city, Samuel was accustomed to the rhythmic pulse of Crestwood and the everyday challenges that came with crafting policies meant to protect lives and livelihoods. The walls of his office were adorned with various accolades and framed photographs—a testament to his years in the business, but that morning, even the hum of the city seemed far away.

Samuel was a meticulous man in his mid-forties, distinguished by his neatly combed dark hair and the pair of silver-rimmed glasses perched permanently on his nose. Today, however, something was different. He paused from the report he had been scrutinizing, glancing out the rain-streaked window, his thoughts slipping into the spaces between the falling drops. There was a feeling in the air, something intangible yet heavy, as if the day held secrets waiting to unfurl.

With a sigh, he returned his focus to the screen, fingers dancing over the keyboard with precision. There was a policy review scheduled for later, a routine matter, yet Samuel couldn’t shake the tingling sense of anticipation brewing at the back of his mind—an uneasy feeling suggesting that today was anything but ordinary.
