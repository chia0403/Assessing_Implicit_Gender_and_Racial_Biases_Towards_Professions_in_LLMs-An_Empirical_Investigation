The early morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets of Ashwick, a small coastal town tucked away along the rugged cliffs of the Pacific Northwest. The air was crisp and carried the fresh scent of pine mingled with the saltiness of the ocean, creating a sense of serene isolation. Wooden houses with faded paint lined the narrow streets, their windows glistening with dew under the muted glow of street lamps.

Dr. Elara Finch paused at the corner of Pine and Elm, adjusting the woolen scarf tucked beneath her charcoal grey coat. Her breath formed small clouds in the chilly air as she surveyed the familiar scene. A sense of quiet familiarity filled the town in the early hours before its residents stirred to life, a sharp contrast to the complexity of the human minds she often delved into.

With a well-worn leather bag slung over her shoulder, Elara made her way towards the old brick building where she had set up her practice. As a forensic psychologist, her days were steeped in the tangled web of thoughts and secrets, unraveling the darkest corners of those brought to her door by the justice system. Her footsteps echoed along the empty street, a solitary sound in the awakening town.

The Ashwick Institute of Behavioral Studies stood three stories tall, its imposing structure softened by climbing ivy. Inside, the heavy wooden doors creaked open, welcoming her into the warmth. For Elara Finch, each day was a new story, a dive into the unseen depths of the human psyche, where truth lay hidden beneath layers of deception and pain. And today, she felt, would be no different.
