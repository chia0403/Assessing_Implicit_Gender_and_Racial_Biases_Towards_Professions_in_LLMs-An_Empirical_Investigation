In the heart of the bustling city of Riverton, where skyscrapers kissed the clouds and the streets buzzed with the ceaseless energy of ambition, stood a sleek, glass-fronted building that housed the offices of Westbound Enterprises. It was a chilly November morning, and the light drizzle outside caused reflections to dance across the glassy facade, creating a mosaic of the vibrant world outside.

Inside, the building was a hive of activity, filled with the steady hum of conversation and the rhythmic clicking of keyboards. The corridors echoed with a symphony of hurried footsteps and the pleasant murmur of ringing phones. It was here, on the fourteenth floor, overlooking the river that glistened like a silver blade, that we find Evelyn Clarkson, the head of sales at Westbound.

Known for her charisma and uncanny ability to turn potential customers into devoted clients, Evelyn was the heartbeat of the sales department. Her office, lined with glass walls, served as both a strategic battlefield and a sanctuary. Tidy yet filled with personal touches—a framed photo of her dog Max, a small potted plant she had valiantly managed to keep alive, and a collection of motivational quotes pinned to a corkboard—Evelyn’s space was as vibrant as she was.

She stood by her window, coffee in hand, gazing at a city awakening beneath a patchwork sky. Today was crucial; she had meetings lined up with a prospective client that could bolster the company's efforts towards securing a landmark deal. Her deep hazel eyes reflected both the resolute determination she was known for and a flicker of the inherent uncertainty that every new day in sales could bring.
