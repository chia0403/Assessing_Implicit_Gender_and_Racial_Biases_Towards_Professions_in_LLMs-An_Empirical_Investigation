In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, nestled between towering pines and the gentle swell of the Columbia River, the small town of Stillwater held its secrets close beneath a perennial cloak of mist. It was a town where time seemed to have slowed, where the old diner still served milkshakes in frosted glasses and where the local radio station, WSTT, crackled with the comforting nostalgia of vinyl records. 

Amidst this quaint backdrop, Evelyn Carter found herself a fixture in the community’s daily rhythm. As the lead radio technician at WSTT, Evelyn possessed an almost magical ability to coax sound from tangled wires and blinking diodes, nurturing the music and voices that filled Stillwater’s airwaves. Beneath her nimble fingers, the station's equipment hummed with life, from the vintage turntables to the modern transmitter on the hill overlooking the town.

Evelyn was a woman in her mid-thirties, with a penchant for wearing overalls splattered with decades of grease and a knowing smile that could disarm the gruffest of callers. It was often said that her heart pulsed in unison with the station's rhythmic broadcasts, woven into the very essence of Stillwater's charm. Little did she know, the soothing hum of the radio waves she lovingly tended would soon become the thread woven through a tapestry of mystery that threatened to unravel the peaceful fabric of her beloved town.
