The morning sun filtered through the lace curtains of the Carlton Manor, casting delicate patterns on the polished oak floor. Edith Granger, the manor's diligent housekeeper, began her day as she did every morningâ€”with a quiet stroll through the main hall, ensuring everything was in its rightful place before the household awoke. The sprawling estate, perched on the edge of the sleepy village of Elderglen, was a labyrinth of secrets woven into its tapestry-covered walls, and Edith knew each whisper and creak as well as she knew her own.

The air was crisp, the scent of wax and lavender lingering from the previous day's efforts. Edith, a woman of hearty stock and steady hands, had worked for the Carlton family for nearly two decades. Her keen eyes missed nothing, from the smallest speck of dust to the slightest wrinkle in the curtains. As she walked through the grand hall, her sensible shoes barely making a sound, she mentally checked off her long list of tasks for the day.

In the drawing room, portraits of the family's ancestors gazed down sternly. Edith paused, straightening a wayward painting of Lady Beatrice Carlton, a woman whose stern eyes seemed to follow her each morning. Pulling out a neatly ironed handkerchief from her apron pocket, Edith polished the gilded frame with a sigh, her mind drifting back to the unusual conversation she overheard the evening before.

The manor, majestic yet somber, had seen generations of Carltons come and go, each leaving their mark. As Edith moved through its corridors, she pondered the inner workings of the household, unaware that today was the dawn of secrets beginning to unfurl, ones that would draw her, unwittingly, into the very heart of the Carlton family's tangled web.
