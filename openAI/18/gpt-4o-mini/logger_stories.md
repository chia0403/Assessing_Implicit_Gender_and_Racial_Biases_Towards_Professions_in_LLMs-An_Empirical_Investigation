On the outskirts of Cedar Grove, where the sun dripped golden light through a tapestry of towering pine and fir, a small logging town bustled with a rhythm only those who lived among the trees understood. The air smelled of damp earth and the rich scent of wood, a comforting blend that was as familiar to its inhabitants as family. Among the hardworking souls of this town was Wyatt Joseph Thorne, a logger carved out of the rugged landscape itself.

Wyatt, with his broad shoulders and calloused hands, had spent the last fifteen years hanging from the edge of cliffs or standing knee-deep in cool streams, the earth his unending frontier. Today, as he stood beneath the shadow of a magnificent Douglas fir, surveying the landscape, he felt an unsettling mystique in the forest’s whispers. The morning mist wove itself through the trees, a silken shroud obscuring his view, and he squinted at the towering giants around him, as though expecting them to reveal secrets long buried beneath their roots. 

The rhythmic thud of an axe echoed in the distance, a reminder of the labor that bound the townsfolk together, but in that moment, Wyatt felt a pull toward the deeper shadows of the woods. It was as if the woods were speaking to him, calling him toward something unknown, something that lay just beyond the reach of the day’s light. Easy to ignore, perhaps, but there was a stir in his bones that suggested this day would not unfold as the others had.
