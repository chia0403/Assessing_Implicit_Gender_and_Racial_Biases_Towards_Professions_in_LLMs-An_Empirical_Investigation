**Title: The Lines of Tomorrow**

**Setting:**
Amid the bustling streets of Riverton, a city where innovation flickered like neon lights against a backdrop of history, stood a towering glass structure known as the Apex Design Studio. Inside, the hum of machinery blended seamlessly with the spirited conversations of architects and engineers. Vast drafting tables adorned the expansive room, each cluttered with blueprints, 3D models, and the vibrant markers that spilled stories of projects yet to come. Outside, the sun dipped below the skyline, casting a warm glow that reflected off the pristine windows, but the work within continued, fueled by ambition and dreams.

**Opening:**
Cordelia Jane Miller squinted at the digital display in front of her, her brow furrowed in concentration. A faint glow illuminated her face, highlighting the smudges of graphite that clung to her fingertips—telltale signs of a long day in the drafting department. As a drafting worker at Apex Design Studio, she had mastered the art of transforming abstract ideas into precise illustrations, a skill that not only brought life to the visions of others but also ignited a fire within her. 

Tonight, however, felt different. It was the eve of the city’s Grand Infrastructure Initiative presentation, where her designs would be laid bare before a panel of investors and city officials. Cordelia pushed aside a clutter of sketches and took a deep breath, the scent of fresh ink mingling with the faint aroma of coffee from the break room. The project promised to redefine more than just the cityscape; it had the potential to change countless lives. With her heart racing, she leaned back in her chair and whispered her own mantra into the silence: ***Every line tells a story.*** 

Above her, the flickering overhead lights cast an intermittent glow, making shadows dance on the walls around her. Outside, the first stars began to pinprick the twilight sky, as if sharing their own kind of stories—a silent encouragement for Cordelia as she prepared to weave her narrative into the fabric of Riverton’s tomorrow.
