In the small, sun-dappled town of Willow Creek, the morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets like a delicate veil, whispering secrets of the night. The sound of birds chirping harmonized with the distant laughter of children walking to school. Nestled between a quaint bakery and a vintage bookstore was a modest plumbing shop, its windows lined with brass fixtures and a rustic wooden sign that read “Carter’s Plumbing.”

Inside, amidst the scent of grease and metal, was 38-year-old Douglas Arthur Carter, a seasoned plumber who wore his trade like a well-worn badge of honor. With his calloused hands and a heart as big as the tools he carried, Doug had built a reputation in Willow Creek for being the go-to man for everything that flowed—both water and community spirit. As he tightened the last bolt on a gleaming sink in the shop, the soft clanging echoed through the space, mingling with the gentle hum of the radio tuned to an oldies station.

Today promised to be just another routine Wednesday, or so he thought, until the bell above the door chimed, startling him out of his daydream. A figure stood silhouetted against the morning sun, an unexpected client whose presence would soon entwine Doug's fate with the very heartbeat of the town itself.
