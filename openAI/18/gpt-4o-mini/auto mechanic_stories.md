Title: **Grease and Grit**

**Setting:** A dusty, sun-soaked auto repair garage nestled on the outskirts of a small town named Willow Creek. The sharp scent of motor oil mingles with the nostalgic aroma of aged metal and burnt rubber. The garage is cluttered yet organized in its chaos, with tools hanging from pegboards and a collection of vintage car parts scattered across workbenches. Outside, a weathered sign reading “Tommy Hargrove’s Auto Repair” creaks in the breeze, its paint chipped and faded, reflecting years of hard work and dedication.

**Opening:**

Tommy Nathaniel Hargrove leaned against the side of a gleaming red muscle car, the sunlight glinting off its polished hood like a jewel. His brow furrowed in concentration, he wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his grease-stained hand, a testament to the long hours spent beneath hoods and inside engines. At thirty-three, his hands were rough and calloused, the fingers nimble and dexterous from a lifetime of tinkering with machinery. 

The garage door stood wide open, inviting the sounds of the outside world: the distant laughter of children playing, the chirping of crickets, and the soft hum of an approaching car. Tommy exhaled deeply, the ebb and flow of his surroundings grounding him. Little did he know, today would not only bring another routine repair but also a twist that would change the course of his life. 

As the figure stepped out of the driver’s seat—a woman in a leather jacket and combat boots—Tommy felt an unexpected flutter in his chest. Determined to keep his focus on the car rather than the newcomer, he picked up his wrench, ready to dive into yet another day of grease and grit.
