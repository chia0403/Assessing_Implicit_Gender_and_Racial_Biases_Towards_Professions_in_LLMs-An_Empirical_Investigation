In the heart of Eldergrove, a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and thick, ancient forests, stood a modest yet bustling butcher shop named “Riverside Meats.” It exuded the rich, savory aroma of smoked sausages and fresh cuts, beckoning passersby with its warm and inviting charm. The hand-painted wooden sign creaked gently in the autumn breeze, its colors faded but the lettering still clear: “Graham Aldridge, Master Butcher.”

Graham Aldridge, a stocky man in his mid-forties with a neatly trimmed beard peppered with gray, was known throughout the village not only for the quality of his meats but for his unparalleled skill with a cleaver. Each morning, he would rise before dawn, his hands calloused yet deft from years of craftsmanship, and prepare for the day ahead. The locals often marveled at his ability to transform a simple cut into a culinary masterpiece, weaving stories into every recipe he shared.

On this particular brisk morning, with leaves crunching beneath his worn leather boots, Graham arranged the fresh products on the display counter, humming a tune from his youth. The air was crisp, and the first hints of winter lingered, hinting at the change of season—the time of feasts and gatherings. Little did he know, however, that this day would bring more than just the usual customers looking for dinner ingredients. As the bell above the door jingled to announce the arrival of a customer, Graham looked up, expecting to greet the familiar face of Mrs. Hargrove, who always arrived promptly at nine o'clock. But instead, he found himself staring into the eyes of a stranger—a cloaked figure, shrouded in mystery, with secrets that could alter the course of his quiet life in Eldergrove forever.
