Title: **Highway Shadows**

Setting: The sun had just dipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden glow across the long, empty stretch of Route 66. The sound of cicadas filled the humid summer air, mingling with the faint hum of an idling diesel engine. In the distance, the outline of a small diner flickered to life as neon signs buzzed ominously. To the west, dusky orange painted the sky, while the east already welcomed the initial stars of twilight.

Main Character: **Vince Tobias Hawthorne**

Story Opening: 

Vince Tobias Hawthorne squinted against the fading light as he pulled his rig into the diner’s gravel lot, the rumble of his eighteen-wheeler punctuating the stillness of the evening. After twelve hours on the open road, he was tired—exhausted, really—but there was always something comforting about the familiar scenery of roadside diners. They were like oases for men like him, battered souls in search of a moment’s rest and a cup of strong coffee.

He swung open the door of the cab, the sound of heavy metal slamming against his heart like a reminder of all the miles he had put behind him. Vince stepped down and stretched, his broad shoulders releasing the tension that had settled in for the long haul. Dressed in a faded flannel shirt and weathered jeans, he looked every bit the part of a seasoned trucker, a man who wore his years on the road etched into every crease of his face.

As he approached the diner, a hint of nostalgia washed over him. The flickering neon sign emitted a soft, inviting glow, and the aroma of frying bacon and fresh coffee wafted through the air. He spotted a couple of familiar faces sitting at the counter—other truckers, men whose stories were as long as the roads they traveled. But tonight felt different. Something about the air was charged, and Vince couldn’t shake the feeling that he was about to drive into uncharted territory, not just on the road, but within himself.
