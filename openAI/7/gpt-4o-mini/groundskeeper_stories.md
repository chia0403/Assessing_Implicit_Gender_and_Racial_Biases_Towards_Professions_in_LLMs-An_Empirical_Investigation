The crisp autumn air was filled with the earthy scent of damp leaves and the faint sound of rustling branches. In the heart of Evermore Estates, a sprawling estate known for its centuries-old oak trees and immaculate gardens, the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden hue over the manicured lawns. Copper and gold leaves danced in the wind, scattering across the cobbled path leading to the grand mansion, a sight that seemed to belong to a storybook.

At the far end of the estate, behind the swaying hedges and under the watchful gaze of the century-old oak, Samuel Ezekiel Thorne knelt on the ground, his hands buried in the cool, dark soil. As the appointed groundskeeper for the estate, Samuel had spent nearly a decade learning every curve of the terrain, every bloom that flourished beneath the changing seasons. With the sun setting behind him, he adjusted his wide-brimmed hat and wiped the sweat from his brow, oblivious to the chill that marked the turn of the season.

Samuel’s olive green work shirt and worn canvas pants bore the marks of a life spent in the pursuit of nurturing the land, while his calloused hands told stories of both toil and tenderness. He prided himself on knowing not just the lay of the land but also its secrets—whispers of a forgotten garden, tales of lost blooms, and the oddities hidden beneath the roots of the estate's beloved trees. 

But today felt different, as if the estate held its breath. Glancing up at the mansion, with its wide, almost watchful windows, Samuel noticed a flicker of movement behind the glass—a fleeting shadow that disappeared just as quickly. He frowned, curiosity prickling at the back of his mind. There were rumors of strange happenings in Evermore Estates, stories of echoes from the past that lingered in the twilight. And with the arrival of autumn, Samuel knew that some secrets were due to surface, like leaves tossed into the chilly breeze.
