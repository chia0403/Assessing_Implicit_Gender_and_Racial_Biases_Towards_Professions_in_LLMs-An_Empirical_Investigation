**Title: The Manuscript of Shadows**

---

The sun dipped below the jagged skyline of Old Town, casting long shadows on the cobblestone streets. A light drizzle had begun to fall, each drop rhythmically tapping against the windows of Ravensworth Publishing, an aging building that had seen decades of literary ambition. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of coffee and worn paper, an intoxicating blend that inspired both creativity and, on occasion, desperation.

In her sixth-floor office, the flickering light of a desk lamp illuminated a mess of manuscripts stacked haphazardly around Avery Margaret Carlton. Tall and slender, with sharp cheekbones and a mane of auburn curls that fell chaotically around her shoulders, Avery had the look of someone who had spent the night wrangling words rather than sleeping. The silver frames lining her desk were filled with the smiling faces of authors she had championed, and tonight's task was no different. She sat hunched over her laptop, her blue eyes darting with fervor as she poured over the latest draft of a suspense novel that promised to be another bestseller.

The clock on the wall ticked louder as the rain intensified, frantically scattering against the glass like the racing thoughts in her mind. Avery was used to navigating the labyrinth of literature, but this particular manuscript, titled *The Midnight Veil*, dug its claws into her, shrouding her in an unsettling sense of foreboding. It captivated and terrified her all at once—just like the city outside. 

But as she turned the pages, something odd caught her attention. There, amidst the eloquent dialogue and expertly crafted plot twists, were annotations that felt almost… personal. They whispered secrets from a distant place, and an unexplained sense of unease settled in her chest. What had begun as an ordinary night of edits was poised to unravel into something far darker than she had anticipated.

Avery Margaret Carlton had always believed that the best stories weaved reality with fiction. Little did she know, this night would prove that some truths were whispered through the shadows, waiting to be brought into the light.

With this setup, the stage is set for Avery's journey into the enigmatic depths of a manuscript that could change everything she thought she knew about storytelling—and herself.
