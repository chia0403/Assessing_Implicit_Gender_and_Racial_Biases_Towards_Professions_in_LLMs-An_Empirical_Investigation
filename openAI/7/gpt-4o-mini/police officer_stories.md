In the heart of the bustling city of Riverton, a thick fog settled over the streets like a heavy shroud, weaving through the tall buildings and casting an ethereal glow from the flickering streetlights. Neon signs from the nearby diner buzzed intermittently, their colors muted in the early morning haze. It was a typical Friday, and the city was waking up — the honking of buses and the chatter of early commuters filled the air, but beneath it all lay an undercurrent of tension.

Officer Nathaniel James Hargrove stood at the edge of Greenstone Park, a stark contrast to the urban chaos surrounding him. He leaned against the cool metal railing of a bridge that arched over a small, murky pond, lost in thought. The park’s usual vibrancy was dulled by the mist that clung to the grass, the trees looming like silent sentinels. He had been called here for a reason — the serenity of the park had been shattered, marred by the scent of fear and the stark realization that darkness had seeped into the heart of Riverton once again. 

As Nathaniel scanned the area, his experienced eyes noted the telltale signs of disturbance: a footprint half-buried in the muddy bank, a discarded cigarette butt nearby emitting ghostly wisps of smoke. Just moments ago, he had received a report about a mysterious figure seen lurking near the park; already, the weight of the impending investigation bore down on his shoulders like an unwelcome visitor. In Riverton, he knew all too well that shadows often hid secrets — secrets he was determined to bring to light.
