**Title: Shadows of the Mind**

**Setting:** The story opens in the small town of Alder Grove, a quaint place nestled among tall pines and rolling hills. The local middle school, Alder Grove Middle School, is a brick building with large glass windows that reflect the changing seasons. Inside, the air is filled with the soft hum of fluorescent lights and the faint sound of laughter echoing through the hallways, mingled with the whispers of students passing by. The walls are adorned with colorful artwork and motivational posters, yet there is a palpable tension lingering beneath the surface, as many students grapple with unspoken fears and insecurities.

**Opening:**

The clock struck eight, and as the morning sun streamed through the classroom windows, illuminating the patterned carpets and scattered backpacks, Dr. Margot Elise Thompson took a deep breath, adjusting her glasses and pushing aside the stack of evaluations she’d spent the weekend reviewing. Today marked the beginning of Mental Health Awareness Month at Alder Grove Middle School, and in her role as the school psychologist, she felt the weight of her responsibility pressing down on her. 

Dr. Thompson was known for her keen intuition and compassionate demeanor, but there was something different in the air this week. Whispers of anxiety were swirling among the students, a dark undercurrent that hinted at deeper problems lurking just beneath their youthful exteriors. Over her ten years working in the district, she had learned to recognize when things were amiss, and right now, every instinct told her that this year was unlike any other.

Setting her coffee mug down beside a framed photo of herself with students from last year’s art therapy group, she glanced at the clock again, reminding herself that she had a full roster of counseling sessions ahead. But first came the morning announcements. In the soft glow of the fluorescent lights, she felt a mix of anticipation and apprehension about what this month might reveal. Dr. Margot Elise Thompson knew she needed to stay ready; the shadows of the mind can sometimes be the hardest to navigate.
