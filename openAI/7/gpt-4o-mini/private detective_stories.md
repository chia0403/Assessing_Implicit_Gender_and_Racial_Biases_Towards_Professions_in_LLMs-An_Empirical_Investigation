The rain pelted down on the streets of Ashwood City, a sprawling metropolis often shrouded in fog and intrigue. Neon signs flickered ominously through the downpour, casting a kaleidoscope of colors on the slick pavement. It was the kind of night that made people hurry past, heads down and collars up, eager to avoid the shadows that lurked behind the alleyway dumpsters and beneath the flickering streetlamps.

Inside a dimly lit office on the second floor of an aging brick building, just out of sight of the storm outside, private detective Clara Mae Westwood sat behind her desk, a half-empty cup of lukewarm coffee cooling beside her. The walls were plastered with newspaper clippings of unsolved cases, faded photographs of suspects and victims, and the occasional reminder of cases closed but never truly resolved. A leather-bound notebook lay open in front of her, a pen poised in hand, waiting for the next clue that didn’t feel like it was coming anytime soon.

Clara was no stranger to the dark side of the world; she had navigated the underbelly of Ashwood for years, her sharp wit and unyielding determination making her one of the most respected private investigators in the city. Her jet-black hair, usually pulled back in a tight bun, framed a face marked by the evidence of countless late nights spent untangling other people's messes. Heavy, green eyes assessed every corner of her office, as if expecting danger to leap from the shadows at any moment.

Tonight, however, was different. Clara had received a peculiar message earlier that day—an anonymous tip regarding a missing person case that had gone cold six months ago. As she stared out the rain-streaked window, the distant sirens of sirens echoed through the night, and a chill crept up her spine. She could feel that something was about to unravel, and as she carefully considered her next move, an unshakeable feeling settled in her gut: the shadows of Ashwood were stirring, and they were hungry for answers.
