In the heart of bustling New York City, where the symphony of honking taxis and the chatter of pedestrians played an endless tune, stood the illustrious Empire Crown Hotel. The building was a marvel of Art Deco design, with its ornate façade and gleaming marble floors that whispered tales of a bygone era. Crystal chandeliers hung like frozen fireworks from the ceiling, casting a warm, golden glow that softened the edges of hurried guests and weary travelers alike.

Amidst this grandeur, dashing about with a mix of urgency and finesse, was a young man named Samuel "Sam" Brighton. At twenty-five, Sam had been a bellhop for nearly three years, his uniform as crisp as his memory for names and faces. He practically glided across the polished floors, his attentive eyes ever-watchful for the slightest gesture that might signal a need for assistance. To him, the hotel was a living organism, each room a cell and every guest a vital part of its function.

Sam loved the rhythm of the place—the constant ebb and flow of people from all corners of the globe. He could often be found stationed covertly near the entrance, greeting newcomers with a polite nod or a welcoming smile. The Empire Crown was his stage, and he performed his role with subtle yet assured charisma, eager to make each guest’s experience seamless and memorable.

Today was no different, or so it seemed. As the early morning light streamed through the grand floor-to-ceiling windows, filling the lobby with a brightness that chased away the shadows of night, Sam sensed something in the air—a small shift in the usual cadence of the hotel's heartbeat. Little did he know, it was the beginning of an adventure that would change not only the course of his day but perhaps the direction of his life.
