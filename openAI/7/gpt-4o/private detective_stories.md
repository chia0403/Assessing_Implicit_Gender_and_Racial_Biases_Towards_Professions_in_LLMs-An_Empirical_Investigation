The rain fell steadily on the city of Elmsworth, casting a sheen on the cobblestone streets and providing a rhythmic backdrop to the late afternoon hustle. Nestled between the towering silhouettes of century-old brick buildings was a narrow alleyway that held more secrets than the city's archives. It was here, at the far end of the passage, where a rusted sign flickered against the persistent gloom: **Elliot Graves, Private Investigator**. 

Inside the dimly lit office, Elliot Graves sat behind a desk cluttered with open case files, glaringly yellow notepads, and a half-empty mug of cold coffee. A ceiling fan creaked lazily above, battling the stifled warmth with little success. Despite the chaos, there was a method to Elliot’s madness, a particular precision in his work that earned him a reputation as Elmsworth’s most astute detective.

Elliot, in his late thirties with dark hair perpetually tousled, had eyes that missed nothing—the kind of eyes that peeled back layers of deception as though they were fragile wallpaper. The clock on the wall clicked its way towards five, each tick underscoring the anticipation of clients who might walk through his weathered wooden door seeking truth or, in some cases, redemption. Little did Elliot know, the case that would change everything was just a whisper away, waiting to enter with the night.
