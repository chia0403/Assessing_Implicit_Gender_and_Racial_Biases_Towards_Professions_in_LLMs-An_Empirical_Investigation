In the heart of the bustling city of New Cresthill, where skyscrapers cast long shadows over cobblestone streets, stood the venerable Saint Joseph's Hospital. Founded over a century ago, the hospital was an architectural blend of the past and present, with ivy-clad walls anchoring its imposing stone facade. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and the incessant hum of activity, as doctors, nurses, and patients wove through its maze-like corridors.

Annalise Porter, Saint Joseph's most seasoned phlebotomist, maneuvered her way through the crowded hallway, her lab coat fluttering slightly as she moved. It was early morning, the sun just beginning to peek through the narrow, east-facing windows, casting geometric patterns of light and shadow on the tiled floor. Annalise had always loved this time of day, when the hospital was on the cusp of its frenetic life, yet still clinging to the remnants of dawn's stillness.

She paused for a moment, leaning against a worn wooden banister as she scanned her patient list for the day. It was a familiar ritual, akin to reading the chapters of a book she was about to engage with. Each name was a story, each room a world waiting to reveal itself in the brief moments that punctuated her daily routine. Annalise knew she was not just drawing blood; she was a confidant, a symbol of calm in the often chaotic lives of her patients.

Her first stop was Room 312, where an elderly man named Walter Brigham awaited her arrival. She tucked a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear and tightened her grip on her phlebotomy tray, a small smile playing at the corners of her lips. As Annalise stepped into the room, she prepared to be the reassuring presence so many had come to expect, armed with her gentle touch and kind words. Little did she know, today would mark the beginning of a journeyâ€”one that would lead her through the twists and turns of an unexpected mystery woven into the fabric of the hospital itself.
