Rain hammered down on the windshield of the big rig as Lawrence "Larry" McCain navigated through the winding roads of the Pacific Northwest. The truck's headlights cut through the dense mist that curled up from the asphalt, creating an ethereal glow in the dim light of early dawn. Towering evergreens lined the highway, their silhouettes looming against the graying sky, and the scent of pine was palpable even through the closed cabin.

Larry had been on the road for nearly twelve hours, hauling a load of timber from a sawmill near Bremerton to a lumberyard outside Portland. His thermos, which rested precariously in the cup holder, was nearly empty, yet he hardly felt the fatigue that had earlier threatened to claim him. Trucking was in his veins, a legacy passed down from his father, and though the hours were long, the solitude of the open road was a comfort he cherished.

He glanced at the photograph taped to the dashboard—a snapshot from years ago of a family fishing trip to Lake Chelan. In it, Larry stood in the center, a fish flailing wildly in his grip, grinning as his father and younger brother cheered beside him. It was a reminder of home and the promise of respite, where the open road had a destination and the journey—a story.
