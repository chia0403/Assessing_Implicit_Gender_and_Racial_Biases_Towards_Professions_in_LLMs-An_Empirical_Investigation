In the heart of Cedarville, a quaint town nestled between rolling hills and shimmering lakes, the sun rose slowly, casting soft golden rays through the windows of the sophisticated yet welcoming Rainsford Plaza Hotel. The air was thick with the scent of fresh pastries wafting from the nearby café, merging with the crisp scent of autumn leaves that danced lazily to the ground outside. 

Inside the hotel’s polished marble lobby, the rhythmic clicking of heels echoed against the walls. Eleanor Mae Fitzwilliam, known to everyone as Elle, expertly balanced a steaming mug of coffee in one hand while balancing a stack of fresh room keys in the other. Her dark curls framed her face, capturing the warmth of the morning light, and her deep green eyes sparkled with a blend of determination and kindness. As the receptionist for the past three years, she had become the heart of the Rainsford Plaza, the first point of contact for every guest who crossed its threshold. 

Elle's desk, adorned with a small potted fern and an array of colorful sticky notes, reflected her bright personality. Despite the routine of check-ins and phone calls, there was an undercurrent of excitement in the air—today marked the start of Cedarville’s annual Harvest Festival, an event that would draw visitors from far and wide, and she was ready for whatever chaos the day would bring.
