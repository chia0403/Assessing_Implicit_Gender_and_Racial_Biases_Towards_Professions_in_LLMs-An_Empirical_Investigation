The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the sprawling estate of Windmere Hall. Nestled at the edge of a dense, whispering forest, the grand mansion loomed with a presence both inviting and ominous. Ivy clung to its stone walls like a secretive friend, while the manicured lawns rolled out before it in a tapestry of greens and yellows, dotted with clusters of vibrant wildflowers that swayed gently in the evening breeze.

In the midst of this tranquil setting, Edmund Thorne hunched over his gardening tools, the quiet of the approaching dusk enveloping him like a familiar cloak. With calloused hands, he carefully pruned the rose bushes that flanked the gravel path, his brow furrowed in concentration. At fifty-seven, Edmund was a man of the earth—planted firmly in his role as the groundskeeper of Windmere Hall, a position he had held for nearly two decades. His grizzled hair was streaked with silver, framing a weathered face that wore the sun like a badge, and his dark eyes reflected the secrets of the garden he tended so diligently.

As shadows stretched across the lawn, Edmund’s thoughts drifted back to the day he had first arrived at Windmere Hall. He remembered the overwhelming sense of wonder that had coursed through him as he laid eyes on the estate for the first time; it had felt like stepping into a painting. But that enchantment was now tinged with an air of mystery. Whispers of the hall's hidden chambers and family secrets had slipped through the cracks of his daily routine, and as he leaned back, wiping sweat from his brow, he couldn't shake the feeling that something stirred just beyond the foliage, waiting for him to uncover it.
