In the small town of Elderswood, where autumn painted the trees in brilliant hues of gold and crimson, the air was thick with the savory aromas wafting from “Thorne’s Fine Meats.” The butcher shop stood at the end of Main Street, its weathered wooden sign swinging gently in the brisk breeze, the letters carved deep and painted a rich mahogany. Inside, the walls were lined with aged, dark wood, and the gleaming display cases showcased cuts of meat that glistened like rubies under the warm glow of hanging pendant lights.

Edgar Thorne, a burly man with a well-trimmed beard flecked with gray, stood behind the counter. He had a strong, jolly laugh that echoed throughout the shop, a sound as inviting as the smell of the slow-roasting pork lingering in his smokehouse out back. A leather apron hung around his neck, its surface marred with the marks of years spent honing his craft. With nimble hands, he deftly sliced through a slab of beef, his eyes sparkling with a mix of concentration and joy.

Though the townsfolk adored Edgar for his meats and his warmth, few knew of the secrets that lay beneath his jovial exterior. Every cut of meat, every recipe perfected over countless evenings, whispered tales from generations past, tales that Edgar himself sometimes wished he could forget—but the weight of legacy was a heavy mantle, and within the confines of his shop, the shadows held more than just memories. As dusk settled outside and the townsfolk finished their evening errands, the air in Thorne’s Fine Meats grew dense with an unspoken tension, hinting that this autumn might reveal more than just falling leaves.
