The sun rose reluctantly over Cedar Springs, its hesitant rays struggling to penetrate the thick veil of morning fog that clung to the highway like an unwelcome guest. Endless stretches of asphalt wound through the sleepy town, flanked by dense coniferous woods that whispered secrets to the early breeze. Rubberneckers often sped past the vast green hills, unaware of the stories hidden within the shadows. 

In the heart of this seemingly unremarkable stretch of road, Lewis Christopher Whitley stood at the edge of the asphalt, his fluorescent vest glowing weakly in the dim light. A veteran highway worker with hands calloused by years of labor, Lewis had watched Cedar Springs evolve over time—a town that once bustled with trucks and travelers was now a quiet remnant of its former self, its charm fading alongside the daylight.

Lewis, a man in his late forties with graying hair and a warm, weathered smile, took a deep breath, inhaling the earthy scents of moss and damp ground. His steel-toed boots were planted firmly in the gravel as he adjusted his hard hat, casting a wary glance at the horizon where the fog wrapped itself around the sun like a shroud. It was a day like any other—busy enough to warrant attentive caution—yet an inexplicable tension coursed through him, a sense that something was about to break through the monotony.

As he unrolled the orange and white caution tape, preparing for the day’s repairs, he couldn't shake the feeling that this seemingly mundane morning held more than just the promise of asphalt and traffic cones. Little did he know, a series of events would soon unfold that would shake the very foundations of Cedar Springs—and lead him on a journey that would change his life forever.
