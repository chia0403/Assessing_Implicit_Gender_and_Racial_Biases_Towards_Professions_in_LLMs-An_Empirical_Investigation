Title: **Highway Shadows**

Setting: The blazing sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows over the worn asphalt of Route 59, a two-lane ribbon that sliced through the heart of the desolate countryside. On either side of the highway, fields of golden wheat swayed gently in the warm breeze, their hushed whispers blending with the distant hum of cicadas. Rusting road signs lined the route, telling stories of forgotten travelers and once-bustling towns now reduced to mere ghosts. It was the kind of stretch where time felt as if it had come to a standstill, punctuated only by the occasional rumble of passing trucks and the far-off echo of a train crossing the horizon.

Main Character: **Ezekiel Monroe**, a seasoned highway worker, stood at the edge of the road, clad in his faded orange safety vest that had seen better days and a hard hat adorned with an array of stickers from various safety workshops. With calloused hands, he held a pickaxe, resting it against his hip as he surveyed the cracked pavement before him. At thirty-seven, Ezekiel had dedicated more than a decade to the relentless toil of maintaining the highway, forging bonds with the land and memories with the ghosts of passed drivers, both commemorated and forgotten. He was a man of routine, driven by an unyielding sense of duty, but today felt different. Something stirred within him, a premonition that this shift in the ordinary would draw him into a tale he never expected to live. 

As the sun dipped further toward the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and deep purple, Ezekiel sensed an unseen presence lurking just beyond the periphery of his awareness, beckoning him toward a hidden truth lying dormant beneath the surface of the asphalt.
