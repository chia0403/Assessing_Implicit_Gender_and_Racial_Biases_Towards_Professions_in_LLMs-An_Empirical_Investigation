In the quiet village of Eldergrove, nestled between rolling hills and dense woods that whispered secrets to those who listened, the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm, golden hue over the landscape. The air was rich with the scent of pine and fresh sawdust, a familiar aroma to Tenley Jasper Woodrow, the village’s beloved carpenter. 

Tenley had inherited his craft from his father, who had taught him the art of woodworking with patient hands and a keen eye for detail. Now, in his modest workshop at the edge of the forest, the rhythmic sound of his hammer striking nails echoed like a heartbeat. Tools hung meticulously on the walls, each one well-worn, each a testament to countless hours spent creating. 

As dusk settled in, the first stars began to twinkle in the velvety sky, and Tenley worked diligently on a special project—a sturdy oak table designed for the local inn, a centerpiece for the community gatherings that were the heart of Eldergrove. With every slice of his chisel and every gentle tap of his hammer, he envisioned laughter and warmth surrounding the table, a fitting legacy for the one who would come to cherish it most. Little did he know, that very night would set into motion events that would change the course of his life forever.
