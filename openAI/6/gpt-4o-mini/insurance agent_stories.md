In the quiet town of Maplewood, where the streets were lined with ancient oaks and every home held a story, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows over the brick-paved sidewalks. The air was tinged with the sweet scent of blooming magnolias, a fragrant reminder that spring had fully arrived. In this charming setting, where everyone waved hello and recounted tales over white picket fences, the workday was winding down, yet for one resident, it was just the beginning.

Catherine Eliza Kent, known to most as Cat, leaned over her polished oak desk in the modest office of Kent Insurance Services, her brow furrowed in concentration. The walls were adorned with local art—picturesque landscapes painted by her neighbors—and framed certificates of achievement from her decades-long career in insurance. Her small office, nestled between the quaint bakery and an antique shop, was a hub of trust for the community, where she had built her reputation as the go-to insurance agent for everything from homes to businesses.

Today, however, was different. A thick envelope had arrived, unmarked, and slipped under her office door while she was on the phone with a client. It bore no return address, but the weight of it felt significant. Cat's heart raced slightly as she set aside her spreadsheet and carefully opened the envelope. Inside was a letter that would soon unravel the quiet facade of Maplewood, revealing secrets that even she—the ever-watchful agent—had missed.
