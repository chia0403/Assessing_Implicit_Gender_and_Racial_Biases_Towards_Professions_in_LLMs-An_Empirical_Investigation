The sun had barely risen over the horizon, casting a soft golden hue across the sleepy town of Maplewood. Dew clung to the emerald blades of grass, and the air was fresh with the promise of a crisp autumn day. Tucked away on the corner of Baker Street was a small, weathered building, its façade a cheerful shade of pale blue, albeit chipped in places. The sign above the door swung gently in the morning breeze, etched with the words “Ellis & Associates: Bookkeeping Services”.

Inside, the scent of old paper mingled with freshly brewed coffee. It was here that Francesca Evelyn Thompson, known to her friends as Frankie, meticulously balanced ledgers and budgets from her cluttered desk, often surrounded by stacks of files and a few houseplants that she nurtured like her clients’ finances. At thirty-two, Frankie had transformed her once mundane role into a sanctuary for numbers. Each figure danced to the rhythm of her meticulous touch, whispering secrets about the lives they belonged to.

The warm glow of string lights strung overhead added a cozy charm to her workspace, but today felt different. As she adjusted her black-rimmed glasses, a flurry of concern fluttered in her stomach. The air was charged with an unfamiliar energy, as if something momentous was about to unfold. Outside, the leaves danced playfully along the sidewalk, and somewhere in the distance, church bells began to chime, echoing a sense of urgency that Frankie could not shake. Little did she know, today would not be just another day of balancing the books; it would be the beginning of an unexpected chapter in her life.
