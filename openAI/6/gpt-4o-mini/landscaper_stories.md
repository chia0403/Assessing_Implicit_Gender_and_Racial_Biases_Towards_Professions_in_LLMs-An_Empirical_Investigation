The sun hadn’t yet risen over Willow Creek, casting a pale blue light across the quiet neighborhood as the dew clung to the blades of grass like tiny jewels. The sound of a distant robin’s song filled the air, weaving through the hushed whispers of the trees swaying gently in the morning breeze. 

In the heart of this picturesque town, nestled between well-tended rose bushes and vibrant flower beds, stood the modest home of Ethan James Eldridge. As a seasoned landscaper known for transforming ordinary yards into breathtaking gardens, Ethan had a unique way of seeing the world—every patch of earth held potential, and every seed bore the promise of something beautiful. 

Today, however, a familiar pang of worry gnawed at him. He stood in his own garden, a sanctuary of color and life, but it was the vacant lot next door that held his gaze. The new neighbors were due to arrive any day now, and the disarray of overgrown weeds and stubborn thorns was begging for his attention. With a sigh, he hoisted his trusty gardening tool belt over his shoulder, determined to start the day’s work. Little did he know, this project would unearth not just lost seeds, but buried stories and secrets waiting to be discovered in the shadows of Willow Creek.
