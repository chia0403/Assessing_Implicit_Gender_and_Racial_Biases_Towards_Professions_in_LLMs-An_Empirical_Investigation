**Title: The Nurse’s Vigil**

**Setting:** The early morning light spilled through the large windows of Maplewood Hospital, illuminating the sterile yet comforting environment of the pediatric ward. Soft walls painted in pastel colors adorned with cheerful murals of animals and nature created a warm atmosphere, a stark contrast to the anxiety that often loomed in the air. The faint beeping of monitors and the occasional soft whir of medical equipment played a melodic background to the whispers of parents and the laughter of children that danced in the hallways.

**Opening:** As dawn broke, casting golden rays across the ward, **Emma Louise Caldwell**, a dedicated registered nurse with sharp green eyes and a compassionate heart, adjusted her crisp, blue scrubs. The warm scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with antiseptic, a familiar and reassuring aroma that filled her as she prepared for the day ahead. Although many of her colleagues still groaned about the early shifts, Emma embraced them, finding solace in the quiet moments before the bustling day began.

Today, she was particularly anxious, for little Liam Foster, a bright-eyed six-year-old with a head full of curly hair, was scheduled for an important surgery. Emma had developed a special bond with the boy during the past few weeks, their conversations about superheroes providing a much-needed escape from the reality of hospital life. She slipped into his room, her heart swelling at the sight of him coloring in a book, oblivious to the uncertainty that loomed just beyond his cheerful scribbles. Emma knelt by his bedside, a comforting smile on her face, ready to weave her magic—a blend of expertise and empathy—into the fabric of his experience, ensuring that he felt safe as the clock ticked down to surgery.
