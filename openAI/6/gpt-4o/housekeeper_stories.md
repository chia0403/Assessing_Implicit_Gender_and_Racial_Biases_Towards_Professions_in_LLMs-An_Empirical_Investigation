Marigold Everly had always found solace in the quiet rhythm of her work, the gentle sweep of her duster, and the soft thud of a broom against the polished oak floors of the historic Ashcroft Manor. The manor, nestled at the edge of Winslow Woods, stood like a silent sentinel of bygone days, its grandeur still echoing with the whispers of the past. Its towering turrets and creeping ivy cast shadows that danced with the evening breeze, creating an ever-shifting tapestry of light and darkness.

As the morning sun spilled through the tall stained-glass windows of the grand foyer, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the marble floors, Marigold set to her daily routine. Her footsteps were soft, almost imperceptible, against the halls that had known countless feet before hers. She had been the caretaker of this labyrinthine residence for nearly a decade, and yet, each day still unveiled something new—an untold secret hidden in the ornate wallpaper, a forgotten trinket tucked in the corner of an attic room.

Marigold's presence was as much a part of Ashcroft as its age-old stone, her quiet demeanor a perfect companion to the manor’s storied past. With her chestnut hair tied back in a neat bun and her apron pockets filled with tools of her trade, she moved with a practiced grace, her mind a world apart even as her hands expertly tidied and restored.

Amidst the crek and groan of the old manor, Marigold alone knew the comforting hum of its existence, the way it seemed to breathe with her every step, partaking in her solitude—a living, breathing entity marooned in time, just like her.
