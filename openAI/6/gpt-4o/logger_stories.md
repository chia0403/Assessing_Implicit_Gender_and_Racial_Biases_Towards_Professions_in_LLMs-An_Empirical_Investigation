In the heart of the sprawling Pacific Northwest, where the towering Douglas firs and ancient cedars brush the sky with their lofty crowns, a dense morning fog rolled lazily through the forest, weaving between the trees like a ghostly river. The air was thick with the earthy scent of pine and damp moss, a testament to the overnight rain that had left the ground slick and the leaves heavy with dew. The rhythmic sound of an axe biting into wood echoed through the woods, as steady as a heartbeat.

Lucas "Luke" Caldwell paused to wipe the sweat from his brow, his calloused hands gripping the worn handle of the axe with practiced ease. His father had always told him that the forest was in his blood, mapped out in the lines of his palms and the fibers of his muscles. Luke had been coming to these woods since he was old enough to swing an axe, raised by a legacy of loggers who had plied their trade here long before him. 

Tall and broad-shouldered, with a tangled mop of russet hair and a beard to match, Luke was a fixture in the small town of Timberbrook. He was known for his quiet strength and tireless work ethic, as unyielding and steady as the forest itself. As the first rays of dawn pierced the canopy, their golden light catching the swirling mist, Luke took a deep breath, the crisp air filling his lungs. This was his domain, and though the world beyond the forest might change, here, amidst the towering giants and whispering leaves, everything felt timeless.
