Dr. Evelyn Hartman stood before the towering glass walls of Riverdale General Hospital, her breath crystallizing in the brisk October air. The city of Riverton shimmered in the early morning light, the river that wound through the heart of the town reflecting a kaleidoscope of autumn hues. The hospital, an imposing structure of steel and glass, thrummed with the energy of a new day—ambulances arriving, nurses bustling, and the faint, urgent calls over the intercom creating a symphony of controlled chaos.

Inside, the sterile corridors gleamed under bright fluorescent lights, a stark contrast to the rich, earthy tones outside. The scent of antiseptic was almost overpowering, a sharp reminder of the life-saving work that lay within these walls.

Evelyn adjusted the strap of her surgical mask as she made her way to the elevators, her expression focused and intent. At thirty-five, she was the youngest head of cardiothoracic surgery the hospital had ever had—a testament to her talent, dedication, and unyielding drive. Her reputation for precision under pressure was legendary, both admired and envied by colleagues who marveled at her innate ability to navigate the complexities of the human heart.

Today, she would lead a team in a groundbreaking procedure, one that could redefine the possibilities of cardiac surgery. Yet, beneath her calm exterior, Evelyn sensed an undercurrent of unease—not about the procedure, but something more intangible, whispering to her amidst the echoing corridors of her mind.
