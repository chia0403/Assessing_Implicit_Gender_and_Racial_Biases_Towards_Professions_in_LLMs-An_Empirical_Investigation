In the hushed corridors of the once-grand Melville Auditorium, the whispers of history intertwined with the echoes of solitude. This aged, red-bricked building stood at the heart of Somerset University, a place where dreams had danced through polished halls and riveted audiences gathered to be swept away by symphonies or strident debates. Now, it was mostly quiet, a relic caught between reverence and disrepair, dust motes floating lazily in shafts of muted afternoon light filtering through tall, arched windows.

At the end of the long, dim corridor, a solitary figure moved with unhurried purpose. Oliver Bennett, a man of unassuming demeanor and steadfast duty, pushed his well-worn janitor’s cart past rows of faded posters and locked display cases. He had been tending to these halls for over two decades, watching generations of students come and go, their laughter and ambitions echoing through the corridors long after their departure.

Oliver's presence was a constant—a fixture as enduring as the building itself. He had seen the auditorium in the throes of celebration and near-abandonment, had felt its walls hum with the vibrancy of youthful exuberance and sigh into the quiet of forgotten glory. His hands, accustomed to the rhythms of care and maintenance, ran along surfaces with a gentle familiarity.

As he passed the main auditorium doors, he paused, taking a moment to regard the intricate woodwork and gilded carvings that framed the entrance. Inside, the air was thick with memories, the empty seats still holding the ghostly promise of applause. Oliver Bennett, with his keen eye for the overlooked and the talents of an unsung curator, was more than the keeper of keys and broom—he was the quiet custodian of a legacy, the last steward of a forgotten shrine.
