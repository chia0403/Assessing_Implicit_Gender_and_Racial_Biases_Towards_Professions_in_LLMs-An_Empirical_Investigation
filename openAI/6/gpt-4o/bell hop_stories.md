In the heart of downtown Chicago, nestled between the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, stood the Grand Meridian Hotel—a symbol of opulence and timeless elegance. Its grand façade, adorned with intricate carvings and brass embellishments, gleamed under the city lights. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the metropolis, the hotel lobby buzzed with life. Crystal chandeliers hung from the high ceilings, illuminating the marble floors and velvet furnishings that exuded a sense of old-world charm.

In the midst of this grandeur, Jonathan Everett Walsh, or simply "Jonny" to those who knew him well, maneuvered with practiced ease through the crowd of guests. As the hotel’s longest-serving bell hop, Jonny had a keen eye for detail, a skill honed over years of service at the Grand Meridian. Dressed impeccably in his maroon uniform with gold braiding, he carried himself with an air of professionalism that belied his youthful appearance. Jonny's quick smile and easygoing nature made him a favorite among both guests and staff, and he had a knack for remembering names and faces—a trait that often proved invaluable.

This evening, as the clock tower across the street chimed seven times, Jonny found himself assisting a new arrival: a distinguished gentleman with an air of mystery, whose presence seemed to draw whispers and curious glances. Stacking a collection of vintage suitcases onto his brass cart, Jonny felt a peculiar sense of anticipation, a feeling that this night might hold secrets waiting to be unveiled.
