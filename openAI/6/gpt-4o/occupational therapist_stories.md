Amelia Thompson stood at the edge of the expansive, sunlit therapy room, watching as rain painted gentle patterns on the wide, arched windows. The pitter-patter was a calming background symphony to the bustling energy of the Harborview Rehabilitation Center. Nestled in the heart of seaside Newport, Maine, the center overlooked the choppy waves of the Atlantic, its historic brick facade reflecting an era gone by. Windows framed by dark wood and the occasional ivy tendril gave the building a quaint charm, making it a beacon of hope for those seeking recovery.

Inside, the air was warm and inviting, punctuated by the scent of freshly brewed coffee from the staff lounge. The laughter of her colleagues and the determination of clients filled the room, a testament to the vibrant life within these walls. Amelia, a seasoned occupational therapist renowned for her gentle yet firm approach, was preparing for another day of guiding her clients through their next steps toward independence.

With her dark brown hair pulled back in a functional yet stylish bun, Amelia wore a soft, heather-gray cardigan over her tailored navy scrubs, exuding both professionalism and approachability. She glanced at the clock on the wall—its hands marked the beginning of her favorite time of day: the morning therapy session. Today, she would work with Robert, a retired fisherman learning to navigate his new reality after a stroke had altered his world.

As she gathered her notes, Amelia reflected on the familiar creak of the old wooden floors beneath her feet, a sound that spoke of stability and resilience. Here, surrounded by the rhythmic hum of progress and the salty scent of the sea drifting through the open windows, she felt grounded—determined to help guide her clients on their individual journeys toward healing and renewed strength.
