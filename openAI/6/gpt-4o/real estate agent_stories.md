In the heart of the bustling city of Charleston, South Carolina, where cobblestone streets met sun-dappled squares and the salty air whispered tales of a storied past, lived Victoria "Tori" Carlisle. An ambitious and astute real estate agent, Tori had a discerning eye for overlooked gems hidden within Charleston's charming, historic neighborhoods. Her days were spent weaving through the vibrant tapestry of the city, where she negotiated deals in stately, antebellum homes and modern waterfront condos alike.

Tori's office was nestled on King Street, in a renovated brick building that once housed a family-owned bakery, its exposed beams and rustic charm a reminder of simpler times. Through the large windows framing her cozy corner office, she watched as tourists and locals alike wandered past high-end boutiques and eclectic cafes, the air filled with the scent of blooming magnolias and freshly brewed coffee. It was in this vibrant, timeless setting that Tori found herself most at home, fueled by the energy of a city that never seemed to sleep, yet retained an inviting sense of Southern hospitality.

Every morning, Tori began her day with a walk through Marion Square, a lively park where farmers markets and festivals regularly filled the open spaces with life and laughter. This morning ritual, her time to gather thoughts and prepare for the myriad of tasks ahead, was sacred to her. Little did she know, on this particularly sunlit morning, her walk would not just prepare her for the dayâ€”it would change the course of her life.
