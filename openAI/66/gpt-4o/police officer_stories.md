In the small coastal town of Clearwater Bay, where the salty breeze entwines with the mist rising off the ocean, Officer Clara Rodriguez began her morning as she often did, with a steaming cup of coffee and the sun casting a golden glow over the sleepy streets. The town, nestled between rugged cliffs and a sprawling forest, seemed to shimmer with early light, each dewy leaf glistening as if dusted with diamonds. Clara had fallen in love with the place ever since she moved there five years ago, captivated by its serene beauty and the close-knit community that thrived within its limits.

Clara strolled down Main Street, where pastel-colored buildings lined the cobblestone road, their facades worn by time yet charming in their resilience. The gentle hum of a fishing boat returning to the docks reached her ears, mixing with the distant cries of seagulls. She nodded to Martha, the florist, who was carefully arranging blooms of every imaginable color outside her shop, filling the air with the sweet scent of lavender and roses.

As she continued her patrol, Clara's thoughts were interrupted by a call on her radio, the voice of dispatch crackling with urgency. A disturbance had been reported at the old lighthouse on the outskirts of town, a place that hadn't been operational for decades but stood as a silent sentinel at the edge of the world. Despite its abandonment, it was a landmark of mystery and lore, stories of lost souls and flickering lights whispered among the townspeople during stormy nights.

With a determined breath, Clara Rodriguez knew it was time to face whatever awaited her there. She finished her coffee with a resolute swig and made her way toward the lighthouse, the road winding through hills dotted with wildflowers and coastal pines bending in the breeze. The day was young, but Clara had a feeling it would not be like any other.
