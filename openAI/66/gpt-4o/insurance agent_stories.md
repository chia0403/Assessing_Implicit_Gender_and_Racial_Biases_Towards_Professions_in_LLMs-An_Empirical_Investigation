On the outskirts of Morningside, a small town cradled by rolling hills and whispering pine forests, stood a quaint, ivy-clad office building on Lancaster Street. It was here that Bennett Thorne, a diligent insurance agent, spent his days poring over paperwork and guiding clients through the intricate webs of policies and premiums.

The office, with its brass-handled oak door and the scent of freshly brewed coffee weaving through its halls, was a sanctuary of sorts for Bennett. Morning light streamed through the tall windows, casting warm patterns on the polished wooden floors and the old-world charm of the leather armchairs. Bennett always found a sense of purpose among the filing cabinets lined against the walls, each drawer labeled with names and numbers that spoke of lives he was sworn to protect.

The gentle hum of the town was constant, punctuated by the distant chimes of the church bell tower that marked the hour. Outside, Main Street bustled with life; shop owners greeted each other as they raised their awnings, and familiar faces exchanged cheerful nods. The rhythmic footsteps and occasional laughter floated in, blending with the quiet rustle of papers within Bennett’s corner office.

But beneath the serene surface of this sleepy town lay whispers of secrets, threading through the community like an undercurrent. Bennett could sense the undercurrent too, though he had yet to unravel its mystery – a task he suspected might soon find its way to his doorstep. For now, however, his attention was drawn to the file before him, underlined by a steadily ticking clock, as a new day began in Morningside.
