As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Meredith Collins locked her office door and headed towards the elevator. The rhythmic hum of computers winding down for the evening served as a backdrop to the quiet clatter of keyboards—a sort of symphony that marked the end of another day at Baldwin & Associates.

Meredith, an accountant known for her meticulous attention to detail and unflinching integrity, had spent the last eleven hours at her desk, poring over columns of numbers and rows of financial statements. Her office, situated on the eighteenth floor of a sleek high-rise in downtown Portland, Oregon, offered a panoramic view of the city's skyline, framed by the distant silhouette of Mt. Hood.

The building itself was a modern marvel—glass and steel that reached defiantly towards the sky, leaving even the most hurried pedestrians to pause and tilt their heads upward. Inside, the decor was minimalist, dominated by shades of cool gray, accented by polished wood finishes, and dimmed lights that cast a warm glow as evening encroached.

Meredith paused in front of the elevator, her reflection staring back at her from the shiny metallic doors. Her mind was still adrift in a sea of balance sheets and audit reports, yet there was a sense of accomplishment in knowing she'd found the elusive error that had been plaguing her client's books for weeks.

As the elevator doors slid open silently, Meredith stepped inside, dismissing the remaining thoughts of work. Ahead of her lay the promise of a quiet dinner at her favorite bistro just a few blocks away. Still, in the back of her mind, she couldn't shake the feeling that the numbers she'd scrutinized today were whispering something more significant—something urgent—that she had yet to uncover.
