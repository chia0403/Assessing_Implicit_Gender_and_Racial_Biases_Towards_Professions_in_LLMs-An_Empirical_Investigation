On a damp and fog-shrouded evening in late November, a lone figure cut through the obscuring mist along the dimly lit alleys of Old Town, Port Haven. The city's ancient cobblestones glistened under the sparse glow of flickering gas lamps, their golden pools of light weaving a path through the haunted whispers of history. Eerie shadows stretched and contracted along the narrow streets, sharing tales lost to time.

Intrepid but unobtrusive, Eleanor Blythe—known to the city's nocturnal inhabitants simply as "Ellie"—navigated the twisting maze of her beloved town with the poise of one who had explored every shadowed corner and whispered secret. As a private detective with a reputation for unraveling mysteries that taunted the common mind, Eleanor's presence in a place like this went unnoticed by most, save for those who knew where to look.

Port Haven itself was a city of contradictions—a sprawling maritime hub where yesteryears and the present coexisted uneasily. The clang of distant shipyard bells mixed with the quiet hush of the lapping tides, while grandiose merchant ships cast long shadows over derelict old wharves. Here, modernity butted heads with relics of a piratical past, and both smuggler and socialite rubbed shoulders under the indifferent gaze of timeworn monuments.

Tonight, Eleanor tread lightly on her leather boots, careful to avoid the evidence left behind by a recent downpour. Her destination was the Lantern's End, a once-glorious inn turned dingy tavern that clung stubbornly to the banks of the river. It was here, ringed by swirling fog and the echo of distant laughter, that her latest case had taken root.
