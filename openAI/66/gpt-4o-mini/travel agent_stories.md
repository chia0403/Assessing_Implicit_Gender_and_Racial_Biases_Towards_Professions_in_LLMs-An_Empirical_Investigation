**Title: The Whispers of Wanderlust**

**Setting:** The bustling streets of Portland, Oregon, where vintage bookshops blend with modern coffee houses and the aroma of fresh pastries wafts through the air. Amid the vibrant atmosphere stands a quaint travel agency called "Journeys Unraveled," adorned with maps from around the globe and posters of far-off destinations. Inside, the walls are lined with travel memorabilia: postcards, vintage suitcases, and a world map dotted with push pins marking her clients’ latest adventures.

**Opening:** 

As the first rays of sunlight began to stretch across the Portland skyline, Mira Elenora Graham sat at her cluttered oak desk, sipping a steaming cup of Earl Grey tea. The gentle hum of her small travel agency, "Journeys Unraveled," was like a soothing melody, a contrast to the frenetic energy of the city outside. Mira's deep-set hazel eyes flickered over the multitude of brochures strewn about her workspace, each one a gateway to a story waiting to be told. 

Mira had always believed that travel was more than just moving from one place to another; it was a chance to rediscover oneself and explore the forgotten corners of the Earth. On the wall behind her, a corkboard displayed photos sent by her clients—smiling faces in front of the Eiffel Tower, palm trees swaying in the Bahamas, and children playing in the vibrant markets of Marrakech. These glimpses of exploration were the lifeblood of her business, fueling her passion and driving her dreams. 

However, as she gazed out the window at the sun rising over the city, she felt an itch deep inside her—the nagging realization that she hadn’t stepped foot outside Portland in nearly a year. With an adventurous spirit that once led her backpacking through the highlands of Scotland and sipping chai in the bustling streets of Jaipur, Mira knew she was meant for more than just guiding others to their adventures. She sighed softly, tapping a pen against a postcard from Santorini while contemplating the uncharted territory of her own life that remained unharnessed. Today, as she took a deep breath, she made a decision: it was time to embark on her journey—it was time to wander.
