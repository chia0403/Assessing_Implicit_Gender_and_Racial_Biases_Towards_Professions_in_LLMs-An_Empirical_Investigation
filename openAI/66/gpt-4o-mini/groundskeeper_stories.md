In the heart of a fog-laden New England village, nestled between the gnarled branches of ancient oaks and the crumbling stone walls of long-abandoned estates, lay the sprawling grounds of Ashwood Manor. A once-thriving estate, the manor was now a shell of its former glory, its once-vibrant gardens swallowed by wild brush and the echoes of laughter lost to time.

It was on this misty morning, just as the sun began to pierce through the haze, that Thomas Alcott, the manor’s sole groundskeeper, awoke to begin another day of labor. At fifty-eight, Thomas’s hands were roughened from decades of toil, his silver-streaked hair blowing gently in the soft breeze that whispered secrets among the trees. Clad in his worn overalls and a weathered straw hat, he stepped out of his modest stone cottage, the scent of damp earth and pine filling his lungs.

The world around him was alive with the sounds of nature: distant bird calls, the rustle of leaves, and the occasional creak of the old oak trees standing sentry. Thomas surveyed his domain—the sprawling lawns and weedy flower beds that desperately clung to a semblance of beauty. A mist hung low, providing an ethereal glow to the landscape, as if concealing stories of forgotten guests who once wandered the paths he now tended.

As he pushed the gates open and strode down the gravel path leading to the manor, he couldn't shake the feeling that this day would be different. Perhaps, it was the unfolding day—or perhaps, it was the lingering shadows of the past that seemed to creep closer with each new dawn. Today, a mystery beckoned, buried beneath layers of overgrown ivy and time, waiting for Thomas Alcott to unearth it.
