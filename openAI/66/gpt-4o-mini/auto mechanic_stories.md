In the heart of the small town of Maplewood, where the scent of pine trees mingled with the faint whiff of motor oil, stood Andy Marshall’s Auto Repair. The shop was nestled between an old diner with seats faded from the sun and a bakery that filled the air with the sweet fragrance of fresh pastries. A rusty neon sign flickered stubbornly in the window, promising “Honest Repairs at Fair Prices,” but it was the reputation of its owner that drew customers in year after year.

Andy Marshall, a rugged man in his late thirties, sported a scruffy beard and calloused hands that told stories of countless hours spent under hoods and beside engines. He wore a collection of grease-stained T-shirts and well-worn jeans, with a baseball cap—often flipped backward—perched on his head like a second skin. Though he appeared tough on the outside, Andy had a kind heart and a quick smile, always ready with a joke to lighten the mood. On this particular Saturday morning, the sunlight filtered through the shop's grime-covered windows, casting a warm glow over the clutter of tools, parts, and the occasional stray cat napping in a tool chest.

As he pulled an old Camaro into the bay for a routine oil change, Andy couldn’t shake the feeling that today would be different. The air buzzed with a sense of anticipation, a whisper of change that tickled his raucous spirit. Little did he know, within the hum of engines and the rhythm of wrenches, a mystery was waiting to unfold—one that would challenge everything he believed about his life in Maplewood.
