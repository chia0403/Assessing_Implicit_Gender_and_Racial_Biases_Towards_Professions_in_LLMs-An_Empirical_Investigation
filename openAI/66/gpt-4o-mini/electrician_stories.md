The rain fell in heavy, relentless sheets, turning the streets of Havenwood into glistening rivers of asphalt. Dimly lit street lamps flickered in the downpour, casting an eerie glow on the slick pavement. In a small, weathered workshop tucked between an abandoned bookstore and a café that had seen better days, the steady hum of machinery could be heard over the patter of raindrops. 

Oliver Jackson, a dedicated electrician with an affinity for all things electric, wiped his hands on a faded blue rag and looked up from his workbench. The smell of copper and ozone filled the air, mingling with the earthy scent of rain. Oliver, with his tousled dark hair and a dusting of stubble, had a knack for breathing life back into the forgotten wires and circuits that lay strewn across his cluttered workspace. He had always found comfort in the predictable rhythm of soldering connections and untangling wires, a sanctuary from the chaos of the world outside.

But today was different. As he caught his reflection in the small, cracked mirror above the sink, he felt a flicker of unease in his chest. The storm roared into life, rattling the windows and making the old workshop creak. Oliver couldn’t shake the feeling that something was brewing, not just in the skies, but in the heart of Havenwood itself. Little did he know, as the winds howled and the thunder rumbled, a call for help was about to disrupt his quiet routine, pulling him into an unforeseen adventure that would test not only his skills as an electrician but also the very fabric of his character.
