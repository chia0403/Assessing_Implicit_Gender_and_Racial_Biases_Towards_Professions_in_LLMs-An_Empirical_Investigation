In the quaint town of Riverton, where the rustle of leaves blended harmoniously with the distant hum of the river, nestled a small drafting studio at the end of Maple Street. The sun cast long shadows of the overhanging elms on the pavement, creating a patchwork of light and dark that danced across the ground. Inside the studio, the faint scent of freshly sharpened pencils and old blueprints mingled in the air, a comforting aroma that spoke of creativity and diligence.

At the center of this modest workspace sat  Thomas Elliott Harper, a drafting worker with an eye for detail and a passion for design. His large, round spectacles perched precariously on his nose, magnifying his intense focus as he leaned over a large drawing board littered with notes, sketches, and the occasional coffee stain. In his early thirties, Thomas's tousled chestnut hair revealed an obsession with perfection; he was often lost in a world of measurements and angles, where every line had to be just right.

The walls of the studio were adorned with his conceptual drafts, each a testament to his dreams of building homes that would shelter stories, laughter, and life itself. As evening approached, the golden glow of the setting sun filtered through the windows, casting a serene light upon Thomas’s latest project—a detailed plan for a community center that he believed could transform the heart of Riverton.

But little did Thomas know that his meticulous designs were about to intersect with a series of events that would not only challenge his skills as a draftsman but also unravel secrets buried within the town he had called home for so long.
