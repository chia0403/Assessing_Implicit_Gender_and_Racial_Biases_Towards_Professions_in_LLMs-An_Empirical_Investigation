In the twilight of a fading day, the last rays of sunlight dipped below the jagged peaks of the Ironclad Mountains, casting long shadows upon the cobblestone streets of Eldenmoor. The ancient town, with its vine-laden stone walls and flickering lanterns, buzzed with the evening's bustle as townsfolk finished their daily toil. The air was rich with the scent of baked bread and the distant echoes of laughter ringing from the tavern at the square.

At the far end of the square, near the imposing stone walls that encircled Eldenmoor, stood a solitary figure clad in a weathered leather uniform adorned with tarnished metal insignias. His stern gaze swept across the gathering crowd as he adjusted the grip on his spear. This was Sir Alaric Thorne, a seasoned guard of Eldenmoor, and on this night, his duty felt heavier than usual.

Alaric, in his late thirties, wore the marks of his years both in the slight greying at his temples and the myriad scars etched into his forearms—a testament to countless encounters with intruders and the elements alike. His demeanor exuded a blend of rigidity and honor, forged from years of service, yet there was a flicker of concern deep within his emerald eyes. With the recent rumors swirling of increased tensions over the mountains, something in the air felt different.

As night encroached, Alaric took a deep breath, steeling himself for the watch ahead. He would not only guard the town against foes but also face the unspoken fears that gripped his heart—a silent worry that, in these unsettling times, the shadows may be hiding more than just the approaching darkness.
