Evelyn Bishop stood at the threshold of the bustling airport terminal, her navy-blue uniform crisp and flawlessly pressed. The early morning sun spilled through the expansive windows, casting elongated shadows across the polished linoleum floor. Around her, a symphony of rolling suitcases and distant announcements created a familiar tune, one she had grown accustomed to over her ten years of travel.

Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport was already humming with activity as passengers, wide-eyed with anticipation or weariness, drifted towards their respective gates. Evelyn glanced at her watch and quickened her pace, the rhythm of her sensible heels clicking sharply against the floors. Her flight to Tokyo was in just under two hours, and there were final checks to be made, safety protocols to run through, and a brief to attend with the rest of the crew.

Despite the constant motion and the transient nature of her work, Evelyn found comfort in these routines. The world within the airport was like another realm, a place where time was both fleeting and unimportant, where every destination promised a new story waiting to unfold. She took a deep breath, savoring the scent of freshly brewed coffee from a nearby kiosk, mingling briefly with the undertones of aviation fuel—a peculiar aroma she had grown fond of over the years.

Evelyn's thoughts wandered as she made her way through Terminal 5, her mind tracing back to a dream she had the previous night—an obscure vision of soaring over majestic landscapes untouched by time. With a light-hearted chuckle, she considered how her subconscious never seemed to wander far from the skies.
