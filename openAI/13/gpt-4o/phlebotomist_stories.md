In the early light of dawn, the city of Riverview was just beginning to stir, its narrow streets veiled in the gentle embrace of morning mist. The Riverview General Hospital stood as a solemn sentinel on the corner of Willow Avenue and Maple Street, its modern glass fa√ßade reflecting the pale hues of the waking sky. Inside, the sterile halls buzzed with the quiet hum of machinery and the muffled shuffle of nurses starting their shifts.

Amelia Hart, a seasoned phlebotomist, navigated the familiar corridors with a practiced grace, her white coat billowing slightly as she made her way to the lab. She had been with Riverview General for nearly a decade, her reputation as the most skilled in her field known throughout the hospital. Her days were spent in the labyrinth of the pathology department, surrounded by the muted clinks of test tubes and the soft humming of centrifuges.

Today was no different, yet as she prepared her station, checking her supplies and ensuring the sterilization of her equipment, a strange, inexplicable anticipation tingled at the edge of her senses. The quiet rhythm of her morning tasks usually brought comfort, but today it felt as though something was poised to disrupt the routine. Amelia glanced out the small window near her station, the city now a blur of movement, and wondered what the day would bring.
