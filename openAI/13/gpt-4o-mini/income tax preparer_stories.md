**Title: A Matter of Calculations**

**Setting:** The early spring of 2024 in the heart of Maplewood, a quaint mid-sized town nestled between rolling hills and an infinite expanse of blue sky. The streets are lined with cherry blossom trees, their delicate pink petals dancing through the air like confetti, heralding the arrival of tax season. The scent of freshly brewed coffee fills the local café, while the sound of laughter and chatter echoes off the brick façades of neighborhood shops.

**Opening:**
As the first rays of dawn peeked over the horizon, casting a golden hue on Maplewood's sleepy streets, Mary Anne Caldwell sat at her small, cluttered desk in Caldwell's Tax Solutions. The walls of her office were adorned with framed certificates and tax codes, but it was the flickering glow of her computer screen that illuminated her with an urgency that whispered of deadlines and numbers. A well-worn CPA guide lay open beside a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee, the pages bearing the burden of years of tax wisdom and countless late nights.

Mary was a seasoned income tax preparer, her mind a labyrinth of forms and figures, deduction strategies and ever-changing tax laws. This time of year was her battlefield, and she took pride in her ability to navigate these treacherous waters, ensuring that her clients emerged with the maximum refunds and minimal stress. As the clock ticked closer to eight, she pulled her hair back into a loose bun, steeling herself for the onslaught of clients who would soon stroll through her door, each bringing their own messy financial tales and hopes for a better return.

Today, however, felt different. Underneath the pile of W-2s and 1099s, Mary could feel a ripple of tension; a sense that something—or someone—was about to change the course of her well-ordered life. She glanced out the window just as a cool breeze swept through, catching the last of the cherry blossoms and sending them spiraling into the air, as if signaling the arrival of spring—and perhaps, a fresh start.
