The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the sprawling grounds of Hawthorne Estate. Nestled in the heart of the countryside, the estate was a relic of a bygone era, its ornate stone facade draped in ivy and flanked by meticulously trimmed hedges. The gardens, bursting with vibrant blooms and lush greenery, whispered secrets of their own, a tapestry woven by years of patient care.

As the evening breeze rustled through the trees, the scent of earth and blossoms hung thick in the air. A stone path wound through the gardens, leading to an ancient oak that stood proudly at their center, its gnarled branches offering a canopy of shelter to the untamed beauty below. It was here, beneath the old tree's watchful eye, that Elias Merriweather found solace amidst the tasks of his daily work.

Elias Thomas Merriweather had been the estate’s groundskeeper for over a decade, a quiet man with a deep-rooted connection to the land he tended. He wore his faded green overalls like a second skin, flecked with soil and the bright colors of the flowers he nurtured. With a weathered straw hat perched atop his tousled brown hair, Elias moved with a quiet purpose, his hands skilled and gentle as he pruned the roses that flanked the path.

Tonight, however, felt different. As he knelt to clip a wayward stem, a peculiar sense of unrest began to stir within him, as if the very earth beneath his fingertips was whispering a message only he could understand. The estate, steeped in history and shadow, held more than just the secrets of the seasons; it held stories, and Elias had always been a willing listener. But as night began to fall, he sensed something more—an urgency that called to him from beyond the hedges, waiting to be uncovered.
