The neon lights of the corner store flickered softly, casting a kaleidoscope of colors onto the cracked pavement outside. It was just past midnight in the small town of Maplewood, where every street seemed to hum with the whispered secrets of its inhabitants. The air was thick with the mixed scents of burnt coffee and stale pastries, the remnants from the day that lingered long after the sun sank below the horizon.

Inside, the familiar rhythm of the cash register punctuated the stillness as Sarah Louise McKinney stood behind the counter, her weary eyes scanning the shelves lined with candy bars and chipped mugs. At twenty-eight, she had grown accustomed to the monotony of her job, ringing up customers with weary politeness while the world outside drifted into slumber. The glow from the fluorescent lights above her head illuminated her dark curls and highlighted the soft smudge of ink on her forearm—a reminder of her daydreams of becoming a writer.

On most nights, the store was a sanctuary for the few insomniacs and night owls who ventured out. But tonight felt different. A chill hung in the air, and an unfamiliar tension crackled like electricity. As she absentmindedly arranged the gum displays, Sarah couldn’t shake the feeling that something unexpected was on the horizon, just waiting to cross the threshold of her life behind the counter.
