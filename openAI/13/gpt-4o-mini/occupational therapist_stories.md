**Title: Tides of Recovery**

**Setting: Seaside Town of Gull's Edge, Oregon**

The sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore filled the air, mingled with the faint scent of salt and pine. Gull's Edge, a quaint seaside town nestled between towering cliffs and the sprawling ocean, had an almost magnetic charm. Colorful beach huts dotted the coastline, while seagulls swooped overhead, their cries echoing against the backdrop of a brilliant sunset. This was a place where the rhythms of nature intertwined with the lives of its residents, each day a blend of tranquility and gentle chaos.

In a cozy office overlooking the beach, sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the shelves lined with vibrant therapy materials: tactile toys, weighted blankets, and colorful art supplies. Here, Amanda Jean Wright, a dedicated occupational therapist with a radiant smile and a passion for helping others, was preparing for her next session. With her golden-brown hair pulled back into a messy bun and a well-worn notebook in hand, Amanda was focused, yet her heart swelled with the fulfillment that came from her work. 

As she glanced out the window, the ocean shimmered like diamonds under the fading light, mirroring the hope she sought to instill in her clients. Today, she was especially eager to meet with Jacob, a spirited young boy recovering from an accident that had left both his body and confidence shaken. Little did Amanda know that their session would lead her to discover not just his strength, but the hidden resilience within herself.
