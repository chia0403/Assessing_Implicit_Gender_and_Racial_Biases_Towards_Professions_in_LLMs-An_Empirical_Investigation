The morning sun cast a golden hue over the quiet town of Maplewood, illuminating the rows of charming Victorian houses that adorned its streets. Each rooftop, with its unique angles and ornate gables, told a story of generations that had come and gone. Above it all, the sound of hammers rhythmically striking nails echoed as the sturdy figure of Benjamin Carter, a seasoned roofer, moved expertly across the slanted surface of a weathered slate roof.

Benjamin, known among locals as “Ben the Roofer,” had spent nearly twenty years perched atop these homes, mending and building with a precision that came only from experience. A soft breeze tousled his dark hair, while the faint scent of summer flowers wafted through the air, a stark contrast to the earthy smell of fresh shingles that surrounded him. With skillful hands, he worked methodically, his focus unwavering, as he carefully replaced the old tiles that had cracked under the weight of winter's snow.

With each swing of his hammer, memories flooded his mind—childhood days spent watching his father on similar rooftops, the laughter of neighbors mingling with sawdust and shingle debris. But today was different; beneath the mundane work lay an unsettling atmosphere that Ben could feel brewing in the undercurrents of Maplewood. Rumors had begun to circulate about the past of one of the town's most prominent families, the Hawthornes, who had recently returned after a long absence. As Ben positioned the new tile, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that this seemingly ordinary day might soon take an unexpected turn.
