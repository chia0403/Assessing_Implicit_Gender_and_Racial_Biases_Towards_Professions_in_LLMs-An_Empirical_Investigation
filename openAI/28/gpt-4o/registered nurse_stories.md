In the heart of Portland, where the Willamette River curved like a gentle smile through the city, the air was crisp with the first bite of autumn. Morning light danced across the quiet streets, casting long shadows from towering maples dressed in fiery hues of red and orange. The city was beginning to stir; café owners lifted their window shades, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee began wafting through the air, mingling with the earthy scent of damp leaves.

Sophie Caldwell adjusted her glasses as she stepped off the bus, her satchel slung over one shoulder, a sense of purpose in her stride. Her scrubs were a fresh sky blue, blending seamlessly with the clear morning sky above. As a registered nurse at St. Anthony's Hospital, Sophie had long since mastered the art of balancing compassion with efficiency, a skill that had earned her the admiration of colleagues and patients alike. The hospital was nestled at the edge of a bustling downtown district, its façade a blend of historic brick and modern glass, symbolizing the heart of a community that hugged both tradition and progress.

Inside the hospital, the halls were quiet, the day yet to fully unfold. Sophie greeted the early-shift staff with a nod and a warm smile, her natural warmth making the sterile environment feel just a bit more human. Today, as every day, she would walk those halls, knowing that within each room lay stories of hope, struggle, and the unyielding human spirit. But today, something felt different, an electric hum in the air, as if the world itself paused, taking a breath before whispering secrets only Sophie would be there to hear.
