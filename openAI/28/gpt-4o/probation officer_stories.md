On an unusually brisk October morning, the city of Port Cedarcove woke to a pale, silvery mist rising from the harbor. The echo of seagulls and the distant hum of commuter ferries punctuated the otherwise serene dawn, as the early sunlight peeked through the thick blanket of clouds overhead. Along the cobblestone streets, centuries-old lampposts still cast their golden glow, and the air carried the faint scent of sea brine mixed with freshly ground coffee from a nearby café.

Amidst this tranquil coastal backdrop, Miriam Hastings began her day. As she stepped purposefully out of her modest brick townhouse on Wentworth Lane, she pulled her woolen coat tighter to ward off the morning chill. Miriam, a seasoned probation officer, had long embraced the city’s temperament. She found both solace and strength in its contrasts—the gentle waves against the harbor’s edge, the energetic swirl of city life matched with its quieter corners.

Her morning walk to the downtown justice center was part of the routine she’d crafted over years of diligent service. With a reputation for being both compassionate and uncompromising, Miriam Hastings was a respected figure at the top of the courthouse stairs, where the scuffed brass plaque read, “Port Cedarcove Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections.” The building, with its grand Art Deco façade and sprawling marble interiors, was where she navigated the complexities of human nature daily, helping individuals return to society’s fold while maintaining the delicate balance of justice and hope.

As Miriam made her way down the bustling main avenue, she tipped her hat in acknowledgment to familiar faces, welcoming the challenge of another day. Today, however, held a particular sense of unease, a whisper in the air hinting that somewhere within the city’s winding alleys and vibrant neighborhoods, a story was poised to unfold, one that would test the very core of her beliefs and abilities.
