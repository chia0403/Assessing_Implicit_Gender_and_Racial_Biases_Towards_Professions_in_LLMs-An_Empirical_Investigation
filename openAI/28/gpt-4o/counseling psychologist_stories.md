Dr. Clara Everhart sat at her desk, gazing out the wide window of her office where the city of Portland stretched out in a patchwork of autumn hues. The golden leaves fluttered gently against the overcast sky, painting the streets with hints of amber and rust as the cooler winds swept through. Nestled on the fifth floor of an old brick building, the cozy confines of her practice offered a quiet refuge from the bustling world below. 

Clara's office was a sanctuary of calm; the walls were lined with bookshelves crammed with volumes on psychology, human behavior, and an assortment of literature she escaped into during her off hours. A plush, teal armchair sat invitingly across from her desk, where her clients would settle like weary travelers reaching an oasis. The soft lighting and the gentle aroma of lavender promised an environment of safety and attentiveness.

Today, as she prepared for her first session, Clara reflected on her journey. With a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology, she'd dedicated her life to understanding the complexities of the human mind, and it was in this sun-dappled room that she hoped to illuminate paths forward for those who sat before her. Her latest client, a young woman struggling through a complex web of anxiety and familial expectations, would be arriving soon. With a gentle sigh and a final glance at the calming view outside, Dr. Clara Everhart centered herself, ready to listen, understand, and guide.
