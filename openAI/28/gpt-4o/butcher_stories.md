On the outskirts of the quaint village of Glenwood Hollow, nestled between sprawling fields of sunflowers and the meandering banks of the River Elith, stood an age-old stone shop with a faded red awning. This was Everwood Butchery, a small yet bustling hub of the community, known for its quality cuts and the ever-present scent of savory herbs wafting through its doors. Inside, the morning light cascaded through tall, narrow windows, casting a warm glow that danced across the wooden floorboards.

Behind the polished oak counter, attended by gleaming knives and a meticulously arranged array of meats, stood Theodore "Theo" Blackwell. With shoulders broad from years of labor and hands skilled from handling his craft, Theo was a mountain of a man, whose presence was as steady as the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. His eyes, the color of stormy seas, moved with keen attention, inspecting each cut for precision and quality. A deep scar ran through his right eyebrow, a remnant of an incident long forgotten by everyone but him.

People came not just for the sausages that were reputed to be the finest in the county, but to exchange a word with Theo, whose honesty and warmth made even the briefest encounter feel significant. Yet, beneath his hearty butcher's apron and friendly demeanor lay layers of stories untold, whispers of journeys and mysteries that were hidden behind the flicker of his eyes. And as the first bell of the day chimed above the door, heralding the arrival of a new customer, another day began at Everwood Butchery, where the echoes of community resounded alongside the thud of cleaver on wood.
