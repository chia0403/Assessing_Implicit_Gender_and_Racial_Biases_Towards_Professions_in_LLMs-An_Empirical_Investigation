In the town of Everwood, where the streets were lined with aging sycamores and the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, a lone figure was hunched over a wooden desk inside Merriweather & Co., a quaint little accounting firm tucked between a bakery and a vintage clothing shop. The soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead played a quiet symphony against the backdrop of rustling papers and an old clock that ticked away the seconds with a gentle rhythm.

Margaret Jane Foster, the firm’s meticulous bookkeeper, tapped her pencil against the ledger as she focused intently on balancing the numbers before her. Her dark hair was pinned in a tidy bun, and her large, round glasses slipped down her nose as she squinted at the columns of figures in front of her. It was a comfortable chaos: stacks of invoices piled precariously on one side of her desk, her trusted calculator beeping softly, and a steaming cup of chamomile tea waiting impatiently for her attention.

Margaret found joy in the predictable, the steady rhythm of bills and expenses, a sanctuary from the unpredictable nature of the world outside. Yet today, as she flipped to the next page of her ledger, an unusual envelope caught her eye—its crisp edges stark against her more familiar paperwork. It bore no return address, only her name delicately scripted in elegant handwriting. A flicker of curiosity ignited within her, shattering the tranquility of numbers, and for the first time that day, she felt the weight of the unknown drawing closer.
