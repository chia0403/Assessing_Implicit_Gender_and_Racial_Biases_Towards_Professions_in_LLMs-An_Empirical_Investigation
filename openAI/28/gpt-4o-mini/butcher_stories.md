Title: "The Last Cut"

In the heart of Ashley Hollow, a small town nestled between rolling hills and thick evergreen forests, stood Weller's Butcher Shop, a weathered brick building with a crimson door that creaked open at the turn of any customer. The smell of aged wood and savory spices lingered in the air, mingling with the faint hint of smoke wafting from the old-fashioned meat smoker in the back. Sunlight poured through the large front windows, casting a warm glow on the gleaming steel counters and the rows of perfectly arranged meats, each cut a testament to the craftsmanship of its keeper.

Behind the counter stood the burly figure of William Jasper Weller, known as "Billy" to the townsfolk who came to rely on his exceptional skill and friendly demeanor. At fifty-two, Billy's hands bore the scars of years spent honing his trade, each line and crease telling a story of toil and dedication. His thick, curly gray beard framed a wide, welcoming grin, and his blue eyes sparkled with the kind of warmth that could only come from a life spent among neighbors and friends. 

As the early morning sun streamed in, Billy carefully polished his prized cleaver—a family heirloom passed down through generations, its blade still sharp enough to slice through flesh as if cutting through air. It was a ritual he performed every day, a moment of reverence before he welcomed the hustle and bustle of another day at the shop. 

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Ashley Hollow began to stir with life. The faint sounds of chatter and laughter floated in from the nearby café, where patrons sipped steaming mugs of coffee and shared stories of their own. Winter was just beginning to loosen its grip, and the first hints of spring brought a promise of renewal, both to the land and to the people who called this town home. 

As Billy stepped out onto the porch, his apron dusted with flour and bits of spice, he could feel the energy of the day wrapping around him like a warm blanket. Little did he know, beneath the surface of this peaceful life, dark currents began to swirl—a whisper of something sinister that would soon disrupt the harmony of Ashley Hollow. A series of unsettling events were about to unfold, with Billy unwittingly at the heart of it all.
