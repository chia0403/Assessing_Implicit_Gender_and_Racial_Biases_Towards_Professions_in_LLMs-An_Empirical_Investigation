**Title: Whispers in the Night**

**Setting:**

The small coastal town of Driftwood Bay lay nestled between jagged cliffs and the rolling sea, its once-bustling streets now cloaked in the tranquil stillness of a late autumn night. The air was heavy with the scent of salt and damp earth, overlaid with the faint aroma of burning wood from the town’s few bonfires. Orange and yellow leaves swirled in the brisk breeze, gathering in crunchy piles along the cobblestone pathways. The lunar glow illuminated the craggy shoreline, casting long shadows across the waves that lapped at the shore, whispering secrets of the depths below. In this sleepy harbor town, even the most significant events seemed to settle into the rhythm of the tides, until a storm broke the calm.

**Opening:**

Erica Mae Thompson peered through the windshield of her battered ambulance, the glow of the dashboard lighting her determined face. The radio crackled to life, a murmur of urgency breaking the stillness of the night. A call had just come through—a potential overdose at The Old Lighthouse, a local hangout for kids seeking adventure and a break from the predictable life of Driftwood Bay. With one hand gripping the wheel and the other reaching for the siren switch, Erica felt the familiar rush of adrenaline surge within her, mixing with the heavy weight of responsibility. 

At twenty-seven, Erica had been a paramedic for just over five years, yet every emergency still struck a chord deep within her. The walls of the small-town hospital had become her second home, the team of first responders her family. As she navigated the narrow, winding road leading to the lighthouse, memories of previous rescues danced in her mind—each one a delicate reminder of the lives she touched and those she could not save.

Tonight, however, felt different. The air was thick with an unnamable tension, as if the very waves were holding their breath in anticipation. Erica's heart raced as she breathed in the chill of the sea air, steeling herself for what lay ahead. In Driftwood Bay, amidst the tranquility, the shadows often hid deeper troubles, and she was determined to shine a light on them, one call at a time. As she rounded a bend in the road, the flickering campfire flames ahead drew her in like a moth to a flame, and she knew—whatever awaited her at the lighthouse would change everything.
