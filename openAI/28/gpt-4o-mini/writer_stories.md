In the quaint coastal town of Marrow’s Point, where the salt-tinged air mingled with the scent of wild lavender, Eliza Mae Hargrove sat at her weathered oak desk, overlooking the tumultuous waves crashing against the jutting cliffs. The late afternoon sun cast a golden hue over the landscape, illuminating the tattered pages of her latest manuscript scattered across the room like fallen leaves. 

Eliza, a writer of both fiction and memoir, had returned to Marrow’s Point after a decade of city life, lured back by the whispers of the wind and the haunting melodies of the sea. Her small cottage, a charming relic with peeling paint and a rickety fence, was nestled close to the shore, allowing her to immerse herself in the stories that seemed to rise from the depths of the ocean itself. 

As storm clouds gathered on the horizon, darkening the sky and the churning sea, Eliza’s pen danced furiously across the page, capturing the essence of a world that felt both familiar and entirely new. She knew that within the shadows of Marrow’s Point lay secrets waiting to be unearthed—secrets that might just inspire her next novel. But as the wind howled outside, she couldn’t shake the feeling that the very ghosts she sought to evade were just beyond her window, ready to reveal themselves when the time was right.
