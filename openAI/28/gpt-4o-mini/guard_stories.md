Under the weight of an unforgiving sky, the ancient stone walls of Eldrenth Keep loomed dark and imposing against the muted twilight. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and moss, the persistent drizzle transforming the hard ground into a squelching mire. A chill wind whispered through the narrow cracks in the battlements, carrying with it the distant echoes of the past—of battles fought, betrayals sealed, and long-forgotten secrets buried deep within the castle's bowels.

Atop the southern parapet, a lone figure stood vigilant, their silhouette sharp against the fading light. This was Sir Cedric Althorn, a guard whose duty was as much a part of him as the armor he wore. He was a man shaped by a life of service, his broad shoulders and weathered features reflecting the many seasons he had endured at the fortress’s watch. Cedric had devoted a decade to the preservation of this aging stronghold, his loyalty unwavering even as the world beyond the walls crumbled. 

Tonight, however, something felt amiss. As he scanned the darkening landscape, his keen gray eyes caught faint movements in the underbrush—a flicker of worry creeping into his heart. Shadows shifted as if aware of his scrutiny, and the normally calm expanse of the forest seemed to hold its breath. In the distance, thunder rumbled ominously, but it was not merely the storm that sent a shiver down his spine; it was the unshakable sense that change was afoot, and with it, the inevitability of conflict. 

With a sigh, Cedric tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, the weight of his responsibility settling heavily upon him. Little did he know, this night would challenge everything he believed about loyalty, honor, and the thin line between protector and predator.
