The sun dipped low over the small town of Willow Creek, casting long shadows across the narrow streets. The scent of motor oil and gasoline hung in the air, mingling with the earthy aromas of freshly cut grass from the nearby park. At the far end of Maple Avenue, nestled between an antique shop and a bakery, stood “Miller’s Garage,” a modest structure adorned with rusty tools and faded advertisements for motor oil pinned haphazardly to the walls.

Inside the garage, the rhythmic clanking of wrenches and the gentle hum of machinery created a comforting symphony for those who worked and passed through. Among the grease-stained workbenches and scattered parts was 34-year-old Benjamin Tyler Miller, known to everyone as “Ben.” With close-cropped hair, a pair of thick-rimmed glasses perched low on his nose, and an ever-present grease smudge on his cheek, he was the embodiment of a dedicated auto mechanic.

Ben was not just a tradesman; he was an artist of sorts, wielding his tools with the precision of a craftsman as he brought life back to the forgotten, rusty vehicles that rolled into his care. Each day unfolded like a new chapter in a book, filled with the stories of cars long past their prime, and each client was a character in his ongoing drama.

As he wiped his hands on a faded rag, he glanced out the garage window, watching as a storm brewed on the horizon. The scent of impending rain wafted through the open door, mingling with the intoxicating smell of his workplace. Little did Ben know that this storm would bring much more than just rain—it would wash away the mundane rhythm of his life and introduce him to a mystery that would challenge everything he thought he knew about himself and the town he called home.
