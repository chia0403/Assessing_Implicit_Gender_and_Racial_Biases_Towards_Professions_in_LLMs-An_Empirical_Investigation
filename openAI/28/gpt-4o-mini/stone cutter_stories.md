Beneath the shadow of the jagged, snow-capped peaks of the Seraphine Mountains, nestled in the valley of Eldergrove, lay a village of rugged stone cottages and winding cobblestone paths. It was here, amidst the echo of chiseling tools and the cool, damp scent of freshly hewn granite, that Titus Marrow found solace in his labor as a stone cutter. The sun began to rise, casting a warm golden hue over the world, illuminating the glistening shards of quartz and the deep, thick veins of iron that streaked the granite walls of the quarry.

Titus was a man forged by the very rocks he worked, with hands calloused from years of carving and shaping stone into homes, statues, and monuments. His brown hair, flecked with silver, brushed the collar of his weathered leather tunic as he knelt beside a massive block of granite, envisioning the statue of Eldergrove's legendary protector he had been commissioned to create. Around him, the rhythmic sound of chisels met stone filled the air, a symphony of creation that resonated with the heartbeat of the mountains.

As he struck the cold stone with his chisel, each blow sent reverberations through the ground, stirring the cool morning air. Yet, amidst the familiarity of his work, a stir of unease crawled beneath Titus's skin, a whisper of an encroaching storm that promised to change everything he knew.
