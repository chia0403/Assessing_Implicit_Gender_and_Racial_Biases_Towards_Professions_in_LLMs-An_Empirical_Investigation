**Title: The Road Beneath Our Feet**

**Opening and Setting:**

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden hue over the town of Maplewood. It was late afternoon, and the gentle hum of cicadas filled the air, merging with the distant roar of traffic on Interstate 15. Dust danced in the beams of sunlight as vehicles whizzed past, their tires thumping against the asphalt—a lifeline for commuters and travelers alike. 

Standing on the shoulder of the highway, dressed in a fluorescent orange vest and hard hat, Jacob Elias Thompson wiped the sweat from his brow. He was a highway worker, a sentinel of sorts, tasked with maintaining the very road that connected bustling cities and quiet towns. Today, he was inspecting a section of the freeway that had recently been repaved, the smell of fresh asphalt mingling with the earthy scent of summer. 

With tools strapped to his belt and a clipboard in hand, Jacob surveyed the freshly laid lines and the patchwork of tar that would soon bear the weight of countless vehicles. At thirty-five, he had grown accustomed to the rhythm of the road—a life built around the asphalt arteries that pulsed through his beloved state of California. Each crack and crevice told a story, and every repair he made felt like a small act of rejuvenation, a way to give back to the world that drove him forward. 

As he bent down to inspect a recently filled pothole, Jacob’s mind wandered to the life he had left behind—a small farmhouse, a loyal dog named Benny, and the quiet moments spent gazing at the stars. But here, at this intersection of labor and solitude, he felt a sense of purpose amid the chaos. Little did he know, this would be the last routine day on the road before fate would test his resolve in ways he could hardly imagine.
