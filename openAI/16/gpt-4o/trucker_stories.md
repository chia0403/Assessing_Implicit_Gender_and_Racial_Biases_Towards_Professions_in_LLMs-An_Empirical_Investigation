Settling into the rhythm of the highway, the rumble of the truck beneath him was as familiar to Jedidiah "Jed" Thompson as the steady beat of his own heart. Stretching ahead of him like an endless ribbon, Interstate 90 cut through the vast, open plains of Montana, where the land unfurled under a sky that seemed too large for any one place to contain.

The cab of his nineteen-wheeler had become a rolling sanctuary over the years, a place where the hum of tires on asphalt provided a meditative soundtrack to endless hours of thinking. The dashboard was cluttered with trinkets and essentials — a faded photograph of his family on the sun visor, a small dreamcatcher swaying gently from the rearview mirror, his trusty thermos rattling in the cupholder. All tokens of a life lived between the sun-dappled horizons and star-streaked nights.

It was early autumn now, and the promise of winter whispered in the chill that crept through the air. The fields on either side of the road were a patchwork of gold and green, the last of the summer's bounty giving way to the inevitable frost. Jed had always found beauty in this transition, the way the world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the first flake of snow to fall.

Today, a light rain pattered against the windshield, softly singing like a lullaby while the wipers kept time. Jed glanced at the expansive sky, where clouds gathered thick and gray, hiding the sun's warmth. His destination was the small town of Bridgeridge, nestled just beyond the jagged silhouette of the Rocky Mountains, where another load awaited and the promise of a hot meal at Minnie’s Diner kept him moving.

As mile after mile slipped away, Jed thought not just of the road ahead, but of the countless miles behind him, etched in every line of his weathered face. The open road had been both a friend and an adversary, offering him freedom, yet chaining him to solitude. But that solitude had its merits; it was here, surrounded by nothing but the vastness of the land and his own thoughts, that Jedidiah Thompson felt most at home.
