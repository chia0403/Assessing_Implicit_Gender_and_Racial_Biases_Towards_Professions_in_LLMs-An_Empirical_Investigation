In the quiet hours before dawn, the cavernous halls of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport buzzed with the sounds of cleaning machines and the distant murmur of conversations filtering through the still air. The fluorescent lights overhead flickered sporadically, casting long shadows across the polished floors. A few travelers, their faces etched with fatigue or anticipation, moved like specters toward departure gates, while the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted from an all-night café.

Olivia Hartley adjusted her navy-blue blazer, smoothing the fabric absent-mindedly as she made her way through the terminal. Her heels clicked a steady rhythm against the tiles, mingling with the echoing announcements from the intercom. She stood tall and poised, every inch the consummate professional, her identity as a flight attendant ingrained in her every movement. 

For Olivia, the airport was more than a workplace. It was both a beginning and an end—a liminal space where journeys started and memories concluded. The sweeping windows revealed a tarmac glistening with rain, the city’s perpetual gift to early risers. Outside, planes taxied lazily, great metal birds awakening from their brief respite. 

Today would see Olivia onboard one of those flights, racing the sun across time zones, shepherding passengers through skies of shifting blues. And despite the ungodly hour, she found a familiar thrill in the promise of a new boarding pass, a new destination. With a deep breath, Olivia steeled herself for another day in the clouds, another flight filled with untold stories.
