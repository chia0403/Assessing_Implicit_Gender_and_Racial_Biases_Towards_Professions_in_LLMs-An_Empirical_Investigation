In the bustling heart of Metropolis City, where skyscrapers pierced the sky and the pulse of urban life never quieted, there stood an unassuming, vintage building tucked modestly between its towering, glass-covered neighbors. The Salinger Building, adorned with intricate brickwork and arched windows, had witnessed a century of change yet remained steadfast in its timeless charm. On the fourth floor of this architectural relic, nestled away from the cacophony of the outside world, was the office of Harold L. Thornton, CPA.

Harold L. Thornton, a man of meticulous habits and quiet demeanor, had dedicated the better part of two decades to taming the wild numbers that dictated the fortunes of his eclectic clientele. With a reputation for precision that was both admired and envied in the city’s accounting circles, Harold had become the reliable guardian of financial secrets, navigating the turbulent seas of taxes, audits, and balance sheets.

The office, much like Harold himself, was an oasis of understated organization and calm. Mahogany bookshelves lined the walls, cradling an array of ledgers, regulatory guides, and tomes on fiscal theory. A steadfast, antique desk dominated the room, its surface meticulously clear aside from a lamp, a calculator, and a solitary, neatly stacked pile of current files. The street noise below was no more than a distant hum, muted by the thick, velvet drapes that framed the single window and filtered a gentle light into the room.

As Harold sat at his desk, reviewing the numbers for a local bakery that had recently expanded into international markets, the aroma of fresh coffee from the corner percolator mingled with the distant scent of rain-soaked city streets. The warm glow of the lamp cast a comforting halo on the papers before him, and he adjusted his glasses, ready to dive into the labyrinthine complexity that brought him not only challenge but also a peculiar sense of contentment.

Today, however, was not destined to follow the predictable patterns of debits and credits. An unforeseen mystery awaited Harold, one that would whisk him away from the familiar confines of the Salinger Building and into a realm where numbers told a story far beyond their face value…
