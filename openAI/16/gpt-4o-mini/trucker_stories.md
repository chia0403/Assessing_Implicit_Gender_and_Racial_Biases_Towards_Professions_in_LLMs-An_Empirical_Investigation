**Title: Miles to Freedom**

**Setting:** The sun hung low in the sky, painting the western plains in shades of orange and purple as it began to set. Dust swirled in the air, caught in the golden light of late afternoon. Along Route 66, a solitary truck cab hissed gently as it idled, its chrome bumper flickering halos of light in the evening glow. Rolling hills dotted the horizon, transitioning from the flat expanse of farmland to the rugged outcroppings of distant hills. The air was filled with the scent of fresh asphalt and the faint echo of a distant train.

**Story Opening:**
As he adjusted his worn baseball cap, Kenneth “Ken” Avery glanced at the clock on the dashboard of his freightliner. The red digits flickered ominously, counting down the minutes to his next delivery. He leaned back in his seat, the leather creaking under his weight. Ken was no stranger to the open road; it had been his home for nearly two decades. Swallowed by the solitude of the highways, he could lose himself in thought while the miles slipped away beneath the heavy tires of his rig.

He took a deep breath, letting the aroma of old coffee and diesel fuel fill him. With each journey from coast to coast, he had learned to navigate not only the rugged terrain but also the stories woven into the small towns and bustling cities he passed. Each rest stop was a fleeting reminder of his place in the world—a world of ever-changing landscapes and people who came and went like the seasons.

Tonight, however, felt different. The oppressive weight of the horizon mirrored a growing tension in his heart. Leaning back, he eyed the empty chip bag and crumpled energy drink can piling up in the passenger seat—the only company he had for miles. The radio crackled with static, struggling to find a station that played music instead of news—another reminder of how disconnected he felt from everything beyond the windshield. 

Breaking the stillness, his phone buzzed, the screen lighting up with a name that sent a jolt through him—Sara. It had been weeks since they spoke, her voice swallowed by the miles. Ken hesitated, a wave of memories crashing over him as he prepared for another evening alone on the road. But deep down, he knew it was time to confront what lay ahead, both in his journey and in the heart that had long since begun to drift.
