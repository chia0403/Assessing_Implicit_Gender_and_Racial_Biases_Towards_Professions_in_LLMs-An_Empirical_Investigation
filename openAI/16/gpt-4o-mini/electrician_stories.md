The sun dipped low in the sky, casting long shadows across the quiet streets of Maplewood, a small town known for its tight-knit community and charming Victorian homes. As the last light of day settled over the rooftops, the sound of a buzzing power drill echoed from a nearby house, breaking the semi-quiet of a late autumn afternoon. 

Inside the worn but cozy confines of the Johnson residence, 34-year-old Thomas Elliot deftly maneuvered his tools, a trusted set of pliers and screwdrivers in hand. Thomas had always felt at home in the world of wires and circuits. Years of working as an electrician had not only honed his skills but also instilled a deep sense of satisfaction as he brought light and energy into the lives of others. Today, with the shades of orange and gold draping the trees outside, he was preparing to install new fixtures in the dining room—a task that would breathe new life into the space for the family’s Thanksgiving gathering just a week away.

As Thomas twisted a wire, his thoughts wandered beyond the job at hand. He wondered about the family who lived here, about the laughter and stories that would fill the room once the installation was complete. In a town like Maplewood, every home held its own tale, and he was grateful to be a small part of so many of them.  Today, however, an unexpected sense of foreboding tugged at his mind, as if the sunset was a warning of shadows yet to come.
