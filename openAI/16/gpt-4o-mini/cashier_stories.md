In the small coastal town of Marigold Cove, the salty breeze swept through the rustic streets and mixed with the laughter of children playing near the water’s edge. The town, with its pastel-colored Victorian houses and bustling farmers' market every Saturday, boasted a charm that often felt like a postcard come to life. Nestled between a bakery that filled the air with the scent of fresh bread and a quaint bookstore filled with the whispers of forgotten tales was a modest grocery store named Lighthouse Mart.

It was here, beneath the flickering fluorescent lights, that Veronica Mae Bristol stood behind the checkout counter, her long chestnut hair pulled back into a loose braid. The bell above the door jangled lightly as customers came and went, chatting with one another about the latest happenings in town or the warm sunshine that seemed to bless Marigold Cove most days. As the cashier, Veronica greeted everyone with a bright smile, her hazel eyes shimmering with warmth and kindness. 

Yet, Veronica carried a secret weight in her heart. Though she enjoyed her daily interactions with the local townsfolk, a sense of restlessness lingered beneath her composed exterior. Each beep of the register was a reminder of her life as it was—one that clung to routine and predictability. As the sun dipped low over the horizon, casting an amber hue across the store, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something more awaited her just beyond the town's borders. The steady rhythm of her life was about to change, but she had no idea how close that change truly was.
