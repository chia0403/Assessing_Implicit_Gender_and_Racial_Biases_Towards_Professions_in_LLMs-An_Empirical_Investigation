**Title: Echoes of the Mind**

**Setting:**

In the heart of Silverwood, a quaint town nestled between the rolling hills of the Appalachian Mountains, the early morning mist curls lazily around the rustling leaves of ancient oaks. Sunlight peeks through the branches, casting a warm glow on the weathered brick buildings of Main Street. The town is alive with the soft hum of life waking up; the distant sound of a train whistle echoes through the valley, mingling with the melodic chirping of birds. 

At the corner of Maple and Pine, nestled between a cozy café and a vintage bookstore, stands a modest office with a frosted glass door. A small sign reading “Dr. Abigail Mae Ashford, Counseling Psychologist” sways gently in the breeze. The interior is filled with lush potted plants, warm earth tones, and shelves lined with books on psychology, philosophy, and self-help. A collection of art created by local artists adorns the walls, each piece reflecting the rich tapestry of human emotion and experience.

**Opening:**

Dr. Abigail Mae Ashford sat in her favorite armchair, the worn fabric offering comfort as the morning sun streamed through the window. With a cup of herbal tea cradled between her hands, she gazed outside, watching the world come alive. Her office had always been a sanctuary, a space where stories were shared and burdens gently lifted. Today, however, a subtle unease flickered within her. She had been reading about the phenomenon of “echo therapy” late into the night—a method where individuals confronted the echoes of their past to find healing in the present. 

Abigail’s mind wandered to the first client of the day, a woman who had battled shadows throughout her life, each session unlocking layers of forgotten pain. As the clock on the wall chimed softly, she took a deep breath, reminded of her purpose. She wanted to be the guiding light for those lost in their own thickets of despair, but today felt different. Sipping her tea, she felt a whisper of change in the air, like an incoming storm that brewed quietly on the horizon, beckoning her to dive deeper into her practice—and perhaps, into her own echoes.
