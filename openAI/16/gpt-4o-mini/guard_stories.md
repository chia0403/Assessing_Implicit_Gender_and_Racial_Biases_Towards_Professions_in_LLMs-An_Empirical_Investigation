In the heart of the wind-swept tundra of Arcturia, where the sun rarely peeked through the gray clouds, lay the ancient fortress of Frostbight Keep. Its granite walls, cloaked in a thick layer of frost, towered against the starlit sky like solemn sentinels. The air was crisp and biting, each breath coming out in clouds of white mist that danced away into the unforgiving night. Above, the moon hung low and full, casting silvery shadows that flickered through the narrow battlements.

Standing at the fortress’s imposing gate, a tall figure clad in a heavy woolen cloak peered into the darkness. This was Roland Emory, the steadfast guard of Frostbight. His auburn hair, streaked with strands of gray, was pushed back under a thick fur-lined hood. Roland's sharp green eyes scanned the horizon, alert for any sign of movement—be it friend or foe. Years of duty etched lines of determination on his weathered face, and though the cold bit at his fingertips, he stood resolute, a stalwart protector of the keep and its secrets.

It was the night of the Winter’s Veil, a time when the northern winds carried whispers of old magic and treachery. Legends spoke of ancient spirits awakening under the light of the full moon, and rumors had spread of dark figures seen prowling near the base of the keep. As the wind howled and sent a shiver down his spine, Roland felt a stirring of unease deep within him, a premonition that this night would bring more than just echoes of frost. He tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, ready to face whatever might come from the shadows.
