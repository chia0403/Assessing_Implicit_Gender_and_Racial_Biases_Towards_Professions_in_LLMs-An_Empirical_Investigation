The sun had barely risen over the mist-kissed hills of Maplewood Estate, casting a golden hue upon the dew-laden grass. The sprawling estate, with its towering oaks and meticulously pruned flower beds, lay nestled between patches of dense forest and the soft murmur of a nearby creek. It was a place of beauty, often hosting grand parties and lavish picnics, yet few recognized the tireless effort it took to maintain such perfection.

At the cusp of dawn, a figure moved through the grounds with the grace and quiet determination of a shadow. Leonard Thomas Grayson, the estate's dedicated groundskeeper, had already been tending to the gardens for nearly two hours. Clad in weathered work boots and a faded green cap, he maneuvered the heavy wooden wheelbarrow with ease, wheeling it from one flowerbed to another. His hands, rough and stained from years of nurturing the land, gently brushed against the tulips as he inspected their vibrant petals. 

Leonard often found solace in the dawn hours, when the world was still waking up, and Maplewood belonged solely to him. The chirping of the birds and the rustle of leaves created a symphony just for the two of them. Every corner of the estate held a memory for him—the ancient oak tree where he had once carved his initials, and the rose arch that had flourished under his care. But today felt different, as if the air crackled with a hidden tension that even the most delicate roses couldn’t ease.

Taking a moment to catch his breath, Leonard leaned against the wheelbarrow, his gaze settling on the old stone fountain at the center of the garden. Its waters had long stopped flowing, a remnant of a bygone era, just like the secrets that lay buried within the estate. As sunlight broke through the trees, illuminating the intricate carvings of the fountain, Leonard couldn’t shake the feeling that something long forgotten would soon resurface, possibly changing the fate of Maplewood forever.
