**Title: Whispers of the Forgotten**

**Setting:** The story unfolds in the cobbled streets of historic Charleston, South Carolina, where the air is thick with the scent of blooming magnolias and salty ocean breezes. The streets are lined with pastel-colored antebellum houses, adorned with intricate ironwork and vibrant flower boxes. As twilight falls, the warm glow of gas lamps begins to illuminate the town, casting flickering shadows that dance across the weathered bricks.

**Opening:**

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the historic district, **Olivia Mae Carter** adjusted her wide-brimmed hat and glanced at her watch. The moon would rise soon, and with it, the ghosts she claimed to know so well. As Charleston’s longest-serving ghost tour guide, she took pride in her ability to weave tales of tragedy, love, and betrayal into the fabric of the city's storied past. Tonight's group was a mix of eager tourists and skeptical locals; a perfect setting for Olivia, whose passion for the ethereal shadows of history often captivated even the hardest of hearts.

With a cheerful but mysterious smile, Olivia gathered her group at the base of the iconic White Point Garden, where the ancient oaks loomed like sentinels over the past. She gestured to the crumbling cannon that faced the harbor, her voice steady like the tide lapping against the shore. “Welcome to Charleston, where the streets whisper secrets only the brave dare to uncover. I’m Olivia Mae Carter, and tonight, I invite you to walk with me into the twilight of our past — if you listen closely, you might just hear the echoes of those who once walked these very streets.” 

The group hushed, eyes wide with curiosity, unaware that they were about to uncover not just the tales of Charleston, but the deeper mysteries entwined with Olivia's own life, secrets she kept buried like the cobblestones beneath their feet.
