Title: **The Edge of the Road**

In the early light of dawn, the sun began its slow ascent over the horizon, casting a golden hue across the sprawling fields that bordered Interstate 57. The air was crisp, and a light fog hovered over the asphalt, giving the world an otherworldly feel. A solitary figure stood near the highway's edge, clad in a fluorescent orange vest that glimmered like a beacon against the muted colors of the morning.

**Nathaniel "Nate" Hollister**, a highway worker with a weathered face and calloused hands, leaned against the side of his truck, surveying the stretch of road that lay ahead. Over the past ten years, he had become an unwitting guardian of this concrete ribbon that sliced through the heart of the Midwest. The rhythmic thrum of early commuters and the occasional roar of a passing semi-truck provided a familiar soundtrack to his daily routine.

Nate had always found solace in the monotony of the work—laying down fresh paint on faded lines, patching potholes, and clearing debris after storms. This stretch of road was his domain, each inch of pavement steeped in stories of travelers forging their own paths. But as he prepared to mark the asphalt for maintenance, a gnawing sense of unease wrapped around him, whispering warnings that things were about to change.

The scent of wet asphalt mixed with the earthy aroma of dew-soaked grass reminded him of simpler times when he had dreams of adventure and a future unfettered by the weight of responsibility. Yet, here he was, a sentinel of the road, a silent witness to the lives passing by—each car carrying a story he would never know. As he rummaged through his toolbox, the morning's tranquillity shattered with the distant wail of sirens, drawing Nate's attention down the highway, where a plume of smoke began to rise, twisting into the brightening sky.
