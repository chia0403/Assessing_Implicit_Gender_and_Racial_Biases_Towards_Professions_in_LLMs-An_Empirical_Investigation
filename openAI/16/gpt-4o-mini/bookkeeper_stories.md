The rain drizzled weakly against the windowpanes of Mulliner & Co. Accounting, casting a somber gray hue over the stacks of paperwork that cluttered the small office on the third floor of an aging red brick building. The rhythmic tapping of water created a quiet melody that harmonized with the faint hum of fluorescent lights overhead, a familiar backdrop for Eliza Margaret Voss as she meticulously tallied figures on her laptop. 

Eliza was a dedicated bookkeeper, known for her sharp mind and an uncanny ability to spot a discrepancy as easily as a hawk spots a mouse from the sky. With chestnut hair tied neatly in a bun, she wore round glasses that perched low on her nose, lending an air of scholarly determination to her otherwise unassuming demeanor. As she stared at the screen, the faint aroma of stale coffee hung in the air, a remnant of her late-night balancing acts. The persistent tick of the clock on the wall reminded her of the deadlines pressing against her: the end of the fiscal year loomed just two weeks away.

Outside, the world continued to bustle, but for Eliza, the office was a bubble of numbers and spreadsheets. It was a world that felt safer than the chaos beyond the rain-streaked glassâ€”a realm where every column had its place and every decimal point mattered. Yet beneath her calm exterior lay an unwavering restlessness, an unshakable sensation that something, perhaps beyond the confines of her well-organized spreadsheets, was waiting to disrupt her orderly life.
