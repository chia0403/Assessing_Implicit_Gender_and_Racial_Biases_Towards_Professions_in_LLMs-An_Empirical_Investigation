The sun hung low in the autumn sky, casting a warm golden hue over the small town of Crestwood. Nestled between rolling hills and thick clusters of oak trees, the town was a tapestry of quaint homes, their rooftops punctuated by sloping gables and weathered shingles. The scent of freshly fallen leaves mingled with the faint tang of cedar wood as the afternoon breeze danced through the streets. 

Atop the roof of a charming two-story house on Maple Lane, twenty-eight-year-old Samuel Richard Knoll knelt, the familiar rhythm of his trade grounding him in the moment. With his toolbelt jingling at his side, he surveyed the sprawling landscape below, the vibrant colors of autumn providing a stunning backdrop to his work. The glint of sunlight on the tools scattered around him reflected his meticulous nature, a trait he’d honed over years spent laboring in the sun.

Samuel had taken his father’s small roofing business and turned it into something more; he was known for both his craftsmanship and his unwavering dedication to quality. Each shingle he laid was a promise to the families of Crestwood that their homes would stand strong against whatever storms might come. He reveled in the solitude of the roofs, the way they offered him a world above the chaos of everyday life.

But today felt different. As he adjusted his glove, a sense of unease settled in his stomach, a whisper of something he couldn’t quite place. The wind seemed to carry secrets through the trees, and for the first time in years, Samuel Richard Knoll felt an inexplicable pull toward the horizon, as though change were drawing near, waiting to spill into his carefully structured life.
