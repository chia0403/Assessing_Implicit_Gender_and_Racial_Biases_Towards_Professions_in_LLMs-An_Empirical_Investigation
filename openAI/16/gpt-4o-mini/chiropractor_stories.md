**Title: A Twist of Fate**

**Setting: Riverside Springs, a small town nestled between the rolling hills of the countryside, where the scent of blooming wildflowers fills the air and the chorus of chirping birds creates a symphony of tranquility. The main street, lined with quaint shops and cozy cafés, radiates a sense of community. At the end of the street stands a charming brick building with large windows, home to “Smith Wellness Center,” where natural light floods the waiting room and the soothing sounds of soft music promote relaxation.**

**Opening:**

Dr. Olivia Mae Smith adjusted the framed degrees on the wall of her chiropractic clinic, each one a testament to her years of hard work and dedication. The late morning sun poured through the windows, illuminating the room and casting a warm glow on the comfortable chairs where her patients often waited, anxious but hopeful. Each day brought a new set of challenges: from athletes nursing sports injuries to grandmothers with persistent back pain, Olivia loved the diversity of her practice. 

Today, however, felt different. A sense of restlessness stirred within her tightly-wound soul. As she shrugged on her white lab coat, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror—her curly auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, a smudge of lavender essential oil lingering on her wrist. She breathed deeply, centering herself for the day ahead. 

Just as she settled at her desk to review her appointments, the bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of a new patient. Olivia looked up, a welcoming smile ready on her lips, only to find a tall figure standing in the doorway—a figure she had not expected to see again. It was Ethan Wilder, the former college football star whose life had taken unexpected turns, much like her own. The last time she had seen him, they were both students dreaming big, and now fate had brought him back to her in her sanctuary of healing. 

"Olivia," he said, an edge of uncertainty in his voice, “I could really use your help.” The weight of his words hung in the air, and in that moment, the future of both their lives began to shift.
