Dr. Eliza Montgomery stood at the edge of the rocky cliff, her silhouette framed by the rising sun that painted the horizon in hues of pink and gold. Below, waves crashed against the jagged rocks, rhythmically echoing the heartbeat of the ocean. The salty breeze carried the crisp scent of the sea mixed with the freshness of dew-kissed ferns that clung to the soil between the cliffside and the dense forest behind her.

This coastal enclave, far removed from the bustling city, was where Eliza found her refugeâ€”a small village named Windmere, nestled between the unyielding expanse of the Atlantic and the verdant embrace of ancient woods. The village was a place where time trudged forward with the languid pace of the tide, and the world beyond felt more like a distant memory than a reality.

Eliza had relocated to Windmere a few months ago, seeking respite from the relentless demands and deafening chaos of city life. The symphony of seagulls and the rustle of leaves swaying in the breeze offered a serenity that her soul craved after years of laboring in the bustling heart of metropolitan hospitals. Here, in a weathered cottage perched on the cliff, she began to rebuild her life, offering her therapeutic services to the local community.

In this idyllic setting, Eliza's days unfolded in gentle, predictable rhythm, much like the waves she now watched. Yet, beneath the tranquil veneer of Windmere, she sensed whispers of untold stories and unseen shadows, like the elusive movements beneath a smooth sea's surface. Little did she know, the peace she had sought was about to be stirred by the unexpected arrival of a stranger whose troubles would knot themselves intricately with her own, compelling her to confront the depths of her own heart and the past she had left behind.
