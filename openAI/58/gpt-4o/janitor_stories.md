In the dim light of early dawn, the city streets were still shrouded in a gentle hush, the silence only broken by the rumble of delivery trucks and the soft sweep of a solitary broom. Inside the cavernous expanse of St. Francis Central Library, tucked between the bustling avenues of the downtown district, Edgar L. Whitmore, the janitor, began his daily ritual.

The library was a grand relic of the early 20th century, with towering oak shelves and stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature. Once a bustling hub of community life, it now stood as a quiet refuge for those seeking solace and knowledge amidst the chaos of urban life. It was here, amongst the scent of old books and the echo of whispered stories, that Edgar found his sanctuary.

As he moved through the aisles, his mop gliding across the polished marble floors, Edgar couldn't help but feel a sense of kinship with the books around him. An unassuming man of few words, he was a keeper of secrets, much like the dust-laden tomes themselves. Though his world was largely contained within these walls, Edgar’s mind often wandered to far-off places and fantasy realms, spurred by the titles he cleaned each day.

At sixty-two, Edgar had learned to embrace the quiet moments of solitude his work provided. With each sweep of the broom or click of the light switches, he curated a world of order and calm in a building filled with stories waiting to be discovered. Yet, he carried his own untold story within him — one that even the most curious of readers had yet to uncover.
