In the rugged hills of Northern Carinthia, nestled between ancient pine forests and the jagged peaks of the Alpe-Adria Alps, lay the small, timeworn village of Steinbruch. Its cobblestone paths wound through clusters of medieval stone cottages, their time-weathered facades whispering tales of the past. In the early morning mist, the village bustled quietly, the sound of hurried footsteps mingling with distant bird calls and the gentle rush of the Obrunn River.

At the edge of this quaint settlement stood a humble abode, its welcoming facade built from the rich brown stone quarried from the nearby hills. The sign above the door read in faded letters: “Hannes Groth, Stone Cutter.” Hannes Groth, a giant of a man with a countenance carved with as much precision as his work, was renowned throughout the valleys for his masterful skill. His hands, rough and strong from years of working granite and marble, held an artistry that breathed life into cold stone.

The clang of his hammer resonated through the crisp morning air as Hannes tirelessly worked at his latest commission—a statue that would guard the entrance to the new town hall. His face, shaded by a well-worn hat, reflected both the determination and patience required by his craft. Dust clung to his apron and danced in the beams of sunlight filtering through the oak trees that bordered his workshop.

Hannes was a solitary man, much like the stone he shaped: steadfast and enduring. His life was as intricately sculpted and meticulously refined as his creations, shaped by the ebbs and flows of time just like the ancient rock he carved each day. And yet, there was an undercurrent of longing in his azure eyes, a restless yearning for something beyond the predictability of his chisel and mallet.

As the sun began its climb over the craggy peaks, casting long shadows across the workshop, an unexpected visitor approached, setting in motion events that would challenge the very foundations of Hannes Groth’s world and breathe new life into the stony silence of his heart.
