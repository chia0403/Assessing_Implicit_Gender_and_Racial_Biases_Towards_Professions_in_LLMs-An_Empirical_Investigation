Title: **Wires of Destiny**

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Eldermere, with its quaint cottages and cobblestone streets, is shrouded in the mist of early dawn. The salty breeze carries whispers from the sea, and the sun is just beginning to break through the clouds, casting a warm golden hue across the weathered rooftops. The sound of waves lapping against the shore mingles with the distant call of seagulls, painting a serene picture of a town waking up slowly. 

**Opening:**

Bradley James Hartman brushed his hands on his faded blue overalls, surveying the small, dilapidated cottage before him. It sat perched on the edge of a cliff, the Atlantic Ocean crashing violently against the rocks below. The peeling paint and jagged roof tiles spoke of years gone by, and the scent of damp wood filled the air as he opened the weathered front door with a creak that echoed through the empty interior. 

Eldermere had always been a place steeped in mystery, a town rich with stories of old sailors and lost treasures. But in recent months, whispers of something more sinister had begun to circulate among the townsfolk—tales of flickering lights and unsettling shadows appearing in homes, especially in this part of town. As an electrician, Bradley had heard the rumors just like everyone else. He’d dismissed them as the dark imaginings of his neighbors, but something in the air today felt different—an electric charge that made the hair on his arms stand on end.

With a toolbox in one hand and a flashlight in the other, Bradley stepped inside, the floorboards creaking beneath his weight. He flipped open his notebook, the pages filled with sketches of circuits and diagrams, and let out a small sigh. Perhaps it was just another day fixing wires and outlets, but something deep down whispered that today would be anything but ordinary.
