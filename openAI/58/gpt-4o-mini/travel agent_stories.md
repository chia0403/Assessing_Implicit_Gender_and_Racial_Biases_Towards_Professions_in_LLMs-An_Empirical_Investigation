**Story Opening and Setting:**

In the heart of vibrant Havana, where the sun bathed cobblestone streets in warm gold and the scent of fried plantains wafted through the air, a charming little travel agency nestled between a lively salsa bar and a bustling market. The sign above the door read “Wanderlust Travel Co.” in whimsical lettering, a promise of adventure and dreams waiting to be fulfilled.

Inside, the walls were adorned with colorful posters depicting idyllic beaches, majestic mountains, and bustling cityscapes from around the world. An antique globe sat in one corner, perpetually spinning, while a faint melody of music played in the background—a soothing blend of son cubano and distant laughter.

At the center of this world of travel possibilities was Sofia Isabella Morales, a passionate travel agent in her late twenties. With her tousled brown hair and bright, inquisitive hazel eyes, Sofia exuded an infectious enthusiasm that had made her a beloved figure among both locals and tourists. She thrived on helping others discover the magic of new places, creating itineraries filled with carefully curated experiences.

As the late afternoon sun streamed through the window, casting a golden hue across her desk cluttered with brochures and flight itineraries, Sofia picked up her phone for another call. It was time to help a client, freshly excited about their upcoming visit to Cuba, find their own slice of paradise amid the lively chaos of her hometown. Little did she know, this particular client would lead her on a journey far beyond what she had ever imagined.
