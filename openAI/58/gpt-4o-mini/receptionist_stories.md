**Title: The Last Call**

**Setting: Whispering Pines Hotel, a quaint, slightly worn lodge nestled in the lush hills of the Appalachian Mountains. The wooden structure boasts a rustic charm, with aged timber beams and a sprawling front porch adorned with rocking chairs. The lobby is a mix of vintage decor and cozy furnishings, featuring a stone fireplace that crackles softly in the afternoons. Outside, the vibrant autumn leaves dance in the crisp breeze, while the distant sound of a river provides a soothing backdrop.**

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the Whispering Pines Hotel, **Madeline Grace Hawkins** settled into her well-worn chair behind the front desk. Each evening, she marveled at the way the light filtered through the large bay windows, illuminating the dust motes that swirled like tiny, enchanted fairies. Madeline, known for her warm smile and quick wit, had spent the last five years greeting weary travelers and ensuring they felt at home in the lodge. 

With a well-thumbed book balanced on her knee and a steaming cup of chamomile at her side, she kept one ear open for the faint sound of the bell above the door. The lobby was empty, but the crisp evening air hummed with promise, hinting at the untold stories that would walk through those doors. Little did she know, tonight would be different. At that moment, as the branches outside tapped against the window like impatient fingers, an unexpected phone call echoed throughout the lobby, sending ripples of intrigue through the autumn air.
