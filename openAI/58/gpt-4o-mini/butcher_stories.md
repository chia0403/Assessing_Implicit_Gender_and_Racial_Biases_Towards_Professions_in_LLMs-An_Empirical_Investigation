In the small, fog-drenched town of Eldermere, where the cobblestone streets twisted like the tendrils of smoke rising from chimneys, there stood a humble butcher shop named “Graham’s Cut.” It was the kind of place that had seen generations come and go, its weathered sign creaking softly with each passing breeze. The sweet, rich smell of curing meat hung in the air, laced with the occasional sharp tang of spices that wafted from the back room, where Gerald William Graham toiled with a practiced hand.

Gerald was a burly man in his fifties, his hands deft and strong, marked with the scars of a craft perfected over decades. His thick, salt-and-pepper beard framed a face that had known both laughter and sorrow—the lines on his forehead etched like the memories of old friends in the town. Eldermere, with its whispered legends and quiet charm, had always been his home. The townsfolk would often stop by his shop, exchanging pleasantries and stories while Gerald wrapped their orders in crisp paper, sharing a piece of himself with each cut of meat.

On that particular morning, as the dense fog began to lift and the sun timidly broke through the clouds, Gerald noticed something unusual outside his shop’s foggy window. A black cat, sleek and silent, sat perched on the edge of a neighboring fence, its piercing green eyes locked onto Gerald's. An eerie chill danced down his spine. Something about the cat felt out of place in the sleepy town of Eldermere. Little did he know that this day would unravel secrets he never imagined, intertwining his life with those of his customers in ways he could not foresee.
