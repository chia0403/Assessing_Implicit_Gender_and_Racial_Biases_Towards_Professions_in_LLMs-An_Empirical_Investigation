In the heart of a bustling coastal town, where the salty breeze mingled with calls of seagulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore, a modest workshop nestled between a dilapidated fish market and a newly opened surf shop stood as a sanctuary for the sound waves of the world. The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden hue over the faded sign that read "Benson's Radio Repair."

Inside, the air hummed with the faint crackling of radio frequencies, punctuated by the occasional clatter of tools on metal surfaces. The workshop was a treasure trove of old radios, circuit boards, and assorted electronic gadgets, with shelves lined with dusty manuals and yellowed schematics. It was here, amid the nostalgia of forgotten tunes and the echoes of distant voices, that the town's beloved radio technician, Oliver James Benson, meticulously honed his craft.

Oliver, a wiry man in his forties with tousled hair and glasses that perpetually slid down his nose, had an affinity for decay and restoration that bordered on obsession. He believed every broken radio held a story, a history waiting to be reclaimed. As twilight enveloped the town, Oliver sat hunched over a vintage transistor radio, his deft fingers working through tangled wires like an artist weaving a masterpiece. Little did he know, that evening would herald the arrival of a curious mystery that would challenge not only his skills but also his understanding of the world around him.
