**Title: The Last Table**

The gentle hum of the city outside felt distant as Maria Elena Ruiz adjusted her apron for the umpteenth time. The dim, cozy ambiance of La Belle Époque wrapped around her like a familiar shawl, its walls adorned with vintage photographs and muted gold accents. The soft clinking of silverware and the faint laughter of patrons provided a comforting backdrop to the evening's rush. 

Maria had been a server at this French bistro for nearly five years, each day carving her place in its bustling atmosphere. With brown hair swept into a neat bun and a practiced smile, she glided from table to table, balancing orders with a grace she had perfected over countless shifts. The aroma of garlic butter and fresh bread filled the air, mingling with the sound of soft jazz, creating an inviting experience for the patrons.

But tonight felt different; the air crackled with an underlying tension. Outside, the sky had transformed from a lavender dusk to a deep indigo, the city lights twinkling like scattered stars. Maria could sense something stirring, a shift in the rhythm of the evening. She paused for a moment near the window, watching as people rushed by, their silhouettes framed against the glow of the streetlamps. The world beyond felt vibrant, alive with possibility, yet here she was, grounded to a role that often felt as unchanging as the old wooden tables.

With a deep breath, she turned back to her current table—a couple in their thirties, bright-eyed and seemingly in love, oblivious to the disquiet in her heart. Tonight, she thought, might just be a turning point, one that would lead her to something more than serving the same dishes day after day. Maybe, just maybe, she would find the adventure she had been dreaming of beyond the narrow confines of La Belle Époque.
