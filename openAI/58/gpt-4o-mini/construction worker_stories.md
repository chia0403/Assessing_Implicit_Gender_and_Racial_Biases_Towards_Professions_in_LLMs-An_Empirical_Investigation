Title: **Under the Steel Sky**

Setting: The sun was just beginning to rise over the sprawling city of Oakridge, casting long shadows from the skeletal structures of high-rises that clawed at the dawn sky. The air was laced with the smell of fresh concrete and damp earth, mingling with the faint aroma of brewing coffee from a nearby diner. Heavy machinery rumbled in the background, interrupted only by the sharp clang of steel beams being set into place. It was here, amidst the chaos of hammers and drills, that Jacob David Rivera arrived for another day on the job.

Opening: Jacob David Rivera adjusted the worn cap on his head as he stepped through the construction site gate, his steel-toed boots kicking up dust from the ground. He paused for a moment to take in the landscape of tilted towers and swirling cranes, a tapestry of promise and grit that defined his every day. As a child, he had often laid on the grass, staring up at the clouds, dreaming of building castles in the sky. Now, at thirty-five, he was living that dreamâ€”though these castles were fashioned from steel and concrete, not clouds. With a determined glint in his hazel eyes, Jacob greeted his fellow workers, letting the familiar camaraderie wash over him like the morning sun. Today would be a day to build, to sweat, and to carve out something lasting in a world that often felt temporary.
