The rain fell steadily, drumming a quiet rhythm against the windows of Whitcomb & Co. Accountants, a modest office nestled on the second floor of a century-old building in downtown Ashford. The scent of damp paper and freshly brewed coffee permeated the air, mingling with the sharp tang of ink from the many ledgers stacked on every available surface. It was the kind of place that time seemed to forget, where the flickering fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead, casting a pale glow over the rows of filing cabinets and the meticulous desks of dedicated bookkeepers.

In the corner office, behind a sturdy oak desk cluttered with papers and an ever-present cup of lukewarm coffee, sat Margaret Eloise Simmons, a woman whose sharp mind and meticulous nature had made her indispensable to the firm. At thirty-seven, Margaret had been balancing accounts since she was nineteen, finding solace in numbers when the chaos of life became overwhelming. She had golden brown hair, often pulled back into a tidy bun, and bright green eyes that sparkled with intelligence and a hint of mischief.

As the clock on the wall ticked toward five o'clock, Margaret's gaze drifted beyond the rain-speckled glass. She couldn't shake the feeling that something monumental was brewing just beneath the surface of her ordinary day. Hidden among the invoices and expense reports, she sensed the whispers of a story waiting to be uncovered, and it tugged at her curiosity like a thread begging to be pulled. Little did she know, the very ledger she was poring over contained not just numbers, but secrets that would soon thrust her into a mystery that stretched far beyond her world of ledgers and balance sheets.
