Beneath the sprawling canopy of ancient oak trees, the sun cast dappled patterns on the rolling expanse of Green Hollow Cemetery. Early morning mist clung to the ground, weaving an eerie shroud that swirled around worn headstones, many of which had seen better days. Here, amidst the whispers of the past, stood Charlotte Mayfield, the cemetery's sole groundskeeper. 

At thirty-three, Charlotte had spent nearly a decade breathing life into this sacred place, tending to its gardens with a fierce dedication that belied the ghosts of those interred within. Her calloused hands, stark against the vibrant greens of freshly cut grass, held a trowel like an artist with a brush, carving out beauty where neglect had left dark scars. Each day, she arrived before dawn, drawn not only by duty but by an inexplicable bond to the land and its stories, hidden in the roots of the trees and the echoes of the wind.

As Charlotte knelt beside a gravestone weathered by time, she noticed something unusualâ€”a glimmer of light peeking from the underbrush, tantalizing and out of place. Curiosity ignited within her, mixing with a sense of foreboding. She brushed aside the tangled ferns and discovered a small, intricately carved box, its surface marred by the passage of time yet radiating an aura of mystery. In that moment, Charlotte felt the weight of history shift, as if the cemetery itself had called upon her to unravel a secret long buried beneath the earth.
