The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the small town of Maplewood. The air was thick with the scent of pine and the distant sound of children playing in the park. In a modest workshop nestled between an old diner and a bustling hardware store, the hum of electric tools and the soft glow of incandescent bulbs filled the air. 

Inside, Arthur Benjamin Sparks—known to his friends as Ben—was bent over a workbench cluttered with various tools and electrical components. His hands were calloused yet steady, moving with precision as he assembled a complex circuit board. Behind him, the walls were adorned with photographs: family, friends, and the old classic cars he had a penchant for restoring. 

Ben had spent over a decade working as a licensed electrician, his days filled with both mundane repairs and intricate renovations. He prided himself on transforming dark spaces into illuminated vistas, ensuring that every flick of a switch brought the promise of light and warmth. As he polished off the last connection, the workshop door creaked open, bringing with it a gust of crisp autumn air—an unexpected visitor on the brink of a new job. 

He glanced up, wiping his brow with the back of his hand, curious to see who might need his services today, knowing all too well that in Maplewood, trouble often came with its own set of surprises.
