The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting an amber glow over the stone walls of Eldergrove Castle. The ancient fortress, with its timeworn battlements and sprawling gardens, stood as a sentinel over the lush valleys below. Despite its beauty, a thick fog of unease hung in the air, whispering secrets of the past and shadows of the future.

At the castle’s northern gate, a solitary figure stood vigilant against the encroaching twilight. Dressed in a uniform of deep navy blue, emblazoned with the crest of Eldergrove, the guard tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword. This was Cedric Alaric Thornwood, a man forged from the steel of duty and honor. His keen gray eyes scanned the path leading to the castle, searching for any sign of trouble that might threaten the peace of the realm.

Cedric had always been drawn to the life of a guard, finding purpose in protecting those who could not protect themselves. He’d witnessed the endless cycle of seasons in this place, the night watches filled with the sounds of rustling leaves and distant howls. Yet, there was something different about tonight — an electric charge in the air, as if the very stones of Eldergrove whispered of events yet to unfold.

As dusk seeped deeper into night, Cedric felt a chill that had nothing to do with the autumn air. The weight of an unseen presence pressed against him, and for the first time, he questioned whether the castle’s old legends held more than mere fantasy. With the sun finally swallowed by the horizon, shadows enveloped the castle, and Cedric braced himself for whatever darkness lay beyond the gates.
