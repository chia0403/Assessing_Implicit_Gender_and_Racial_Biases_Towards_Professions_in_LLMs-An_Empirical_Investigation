In the heart of downtown Riverton, where the bustle of the city mixed harmoniously with the whispers of the nearby Cedar River, stood the historic Harlow Building. Its red-bricked facade and arched windows were a testament to a bygone era, yet within its walls, life bustled on, freshly painted and perpetually moving forward. Among the many stories crafted within those walls was that of Oliver Bennett, a meticulous insurance agent known for his detailed eye and unwavering dedication to his clients. 

Every morning, Oliver arrived at precisely 8:15 a.m., his footsteps echoing through the marble lobby as sunlight streamed through the towering windows, casting lattice shadows along the floor. His office, on the fourth floor, overlooked the riverâ€”a gentle reminder of life's unpredictability, a feature Oliver found both poetic and fitting for his line of work. 

The room itself was a blend of modern efficiency and nostalgia, with sleek office furniture juxtaposed against a wall adorned with sepia-toned photographs of Riverton's past. A sense of order permeated the space, from the neatly stacked policy documents on his mahogany desk to the precise arrangement of pens, each representing a different shade of risk. Oliver, with his dark-rimmed glasses perched on his nose and an unwavering air of calm, prepared for another day of painstaking analysis and heartfelt conversations, his mind always on the balance between fate and foresight. Little did he know, today would bring an encounter that could tip those scales.
