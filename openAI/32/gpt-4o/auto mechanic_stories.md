Underneath the wide, cloud-streaked sky of Greenfield, a small town nestled between rolling hills and meandering rivers, stood Driftwood Auto Repair. The garage was a weathered structure, its corrugated metal walls bearing the marks of time and countless seasons. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of motor oil and worn leather, mingling with the occasional whiff of fresh pine from the trees outside.

It was early morning, and sunlight poured through the garage's open doors, casting long shadows on the concrete floor. The tools hung neatly on the walls, each with its designated placeâ€”a testament to the meticulous nature of the man who lay beneath the belly of a vintage Mustang, coaxing life back into its engine.

That man was Jackson Reed, a seasoned auto mechanic whose reputation reverberated throughout Greenfield and beyond. Known for his unyielding dedication and an uncanny ability to diagnose car troubles with a mere listen, Jackson was a local legend. His hands bore the evidence of a lifetime spent among gears and grease, yet his eyes held the spark of someone who genuinely loved his craft.

Jackson hummed quietly to himself, the rhythm matching the click and clank of his socket wrench as he tightened a stubborn bolt. At forty-five, he found solace in these moments, where the world outside faded, leaving him alone with the symphony of mechanical whirs and the promise of a revived engine.
