Under the gentle haze of an autumn morning, the sprawling metropolis of Ashford stirred to life. The sun cast its golden embrace over the steel and glass giants that pierced the sky, and the streets below buzzed with the rhythm of an ordinary Tuesday. Amidst the symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps, there was a corner of solace in the bustling downtown, where the tiny, old brick building of Davison & Affiliates stood resilient against the modern chaos surrounding it.

Inside its oak-paneled walls, Evelyn Morgan was already engrossed in her work. Her desk was a sea of legal briefs, case files, and color-coded sticky notes—a testament to the pressing demands of the legal world. As a paralegal with aspirations of becoming an attorney, Evelyn thrived in the challenges of each day, finding purpose in the meticulous detail that defined her profession. Her dark coffee rested by her side, serving as a constant companion through the quiet hours before the office would be fully awake, filled with the footfalls of colleagues embarking on their own busy days.

Evelyn, with her keen hazel eyes and a determined set to her jaw, brushed a stray lock of chestnut hair from her face. Her appearance was as polished as her work; a crisp white blouse paired with tailored black pants, and an ever-ready smile that softened even the most skeptical of clients. It was in this environment—a blend of tradition and the relentless pursuit of justice—that Evelyn Morgan found her calling, overlooking the city that in each waking moment offered as many challenges as it did opportunities.
