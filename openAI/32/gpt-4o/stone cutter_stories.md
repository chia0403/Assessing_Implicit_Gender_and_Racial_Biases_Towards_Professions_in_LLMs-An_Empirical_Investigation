On the windswept shores of the rugged Scottish Highlands, where the sea kissed the land with a savage grace, lay the quaint village of Kilnsea. The air was filled with the sharp, briny scent of the ocean, mingling with the earthy fragrance of heather and pine that cloaked the rolling hills. Amidst this natural tapestry stood a small, stone cottage, its weathered facade blending seamlessly with the ancient cliffs that loomed behind it.

In this humble abode lived Ewan MacTaggart, a man whose name was as much a part of the land as the mountains themselves. Ewan had the build of a highlander, broad-shouldered and strong, with hands calloused from years of shaping the unforgiving granite that made up much of the village's architecture. For generations, the MacTaggart family had been renowned stone cutters, sought out for their ability to coax beauty from the most stubborn of rocks.

Ewan's days were spent amidst the echoes of hammer on stone, each resounding strike a testament to his skill and patience. His workshop, a ramshackle yet sturdy structure nestled at the edge of the village, was a repository of tools and unfinished sculptures, the walls lined with ancient chisel marks. It was here, beneath the unyielding gaze of the ancient hills and the endless sky, where magic and purpose fused in the dance of craft.

Despite the solace he found in his work, Ewan carried within him a yearning as raw and unshaped as the stone he moldedâ€”a whisper of a destiny that seemed just beyond the reach of his steady hands. Yet, in the village of Kilnsea, where destinies were as set as the stones in the ancient cairns, few could imagine what lay in store for Ewan MacTaggart.
