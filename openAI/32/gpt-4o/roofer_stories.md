On the outskirts of Pine Hollow, where the rustic charm of rural life met the creeping tendrils of modernity, stood a patchwork of sturdy houses and open fields under an expansive sky. Here, in this serene yet ever-evolving backdrop, Dane Whittaker began his mornings before dawn, when the world was still kissed by the cold blue hues of night.

Dane leaned against his well-worn truck, a reliable relic from another era, and glanced up at the project before him. The Carter's farmhouse, perched on a gentle hill, was crowned by a roof in desperate need of his skilled hands. The rising sun set the landscape aglow, its fingers painting the horizon in shades of tangerine and gold, as if nature herself was unveiling a masterpiece for only Dane to see.

The quiet of the waking morning was punctuated by the chirp of crickets yielding to birdsong, and the rustle of leaves made music of the gentle breeze. It was these moments of tranquil isolation and purpose that Dane cherished most, where his mind was cleared of all but the task at hand.

He gathered his tools, savoring the moment before the gentle thrumming of the town’s activity picked up. Today was about more than just replacing shingles and waterproofing eaves; it was about maintaining the stories held aloft by those rafters and ensuring their endurance beneath the vast, changeable sky. As he strapped on his tool belt and climbed the ladder, Dane felt the familiar sense of connection to the rooftops he called his realm, his eyes drawn to the endless promise of the Spangled Belt—a nickname for the Milky Way, a constant companion on his early starts, now fading above him into the morning haze.
