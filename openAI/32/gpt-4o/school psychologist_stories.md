In the heart of the bustling city of Portland, where the rain often danced gracefully with the wind, Dr. Eleanor Hartley found solace in her cozy, book-lined office at Cedar Valley High School. The school was a sprawling red-brick building, tucked away amidst towering evergreens and blooming rhododendrons. Each morning, as students poured in from the chilly outdoors, the hallways echoed with a cacophony of laughter, chatter, and the distant hum of lockers clanging shut. 

Dr. Hartley, a school psychologist known for her gentle demeanor and empathetic eyes, sat in her well-worn armchair, jotting down notes for the day ahead. Her office was a sanctuary of sorts, filled with soft lamps casting a warm glow, shelves brimming with books on child psychology, and a corner devoted to plush beanbags, where teenagers often lounged and poured out their thoughts. With each case file she reviewed, Eleanor felt a renewed sense of purpose, ready to face whatever challenges her students brought through her door. Little did she know, today would unravel a mystery that would change the way she viewed her community forever.
