On a crisp autumn morning, the small town of Maplewood was wrapped in a golden embrace, with leaves swirling down the cobblestone streets in a gentle dance orchestrated by the wind. The air was filled with the scent of fresh rain mixed with the subtle hint of wood smoke trailing from chimneys, a testament to the community's readiness to ward off the growing cold.

At the edge of town, nestled between a grove of towering pines and a placid, shimmering lake, stood a quaint brick building that housed the town’s only radio station, WKRP Maplewood. Its white-painted wooden sign creaked in the breeze, offering a welcoming groan to those who ventured into its rustic confines.

Inside, the walls were lined with shelves abundant with equipment, some of it modern but much of it vintage, echoing the golden age of radio. Vinyl records shared space with state-of-the-art digital gear—a testament to the station's proud history and its attempts at modernization.

Here, amidst the hum of vacuum tubes and the soft crackle of static, Timothy “Tim” DeVries found his haven. Tim, a quietly ambitious radio technician in his mid-thirties, had a knack for breathing life back into machines that seemed long past their prime. His fingers, nimble and sure, danced over tangles of wires and circuits as he coaxed sound from silence.

A tall, lean figure with perpetually tousled sandy hair, Tim was perpetually clad in a utilitarian wardrobe of rolled-up sleeves and work boots, thereby marrying practicality with comfort. His eyes, a striking shade of cerulean, sparkled with a mix of curiosity and contentment as he busied himself with the station’s soundboard.

Though Tim often worked alone—content in the solitude that allowed him to focus—today was different. Today marked the week leading up to the station's annual Autumn Festival Broadcast, an event that drew listeners from the hills and hollows far beyond the town's modest borders. People depended on Tim to ensure that every note of live music and every crackle of the announcer’s voice would reach them, unmarred by technical trickery or ill-timed silence.

The festival was a tradition as old as the pines that surrounded the lake, and Tim took immense pride in his role as the silent guardian of the sound waves that carried Maplewood’s spirit out into the world. Through static and silence, reality and radio, this was the beginning of another unforgettable broadcast—a testament to the lingering magic of voice carried on the air.
