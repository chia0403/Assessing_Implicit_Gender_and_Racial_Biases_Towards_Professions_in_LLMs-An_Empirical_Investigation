In the dim glow of the early dawn, the city of Port Arlene stirred to life, its cobbled streets shimmering with the remnants of last night’s rain. Narrow alleys wove through an eclectic mix of Victorian and modern architecture, the scent of brine wafting in from the nearby harbor. The air was tinged with the faint clatter of fishing boats and the distant hum of the first tram rolling down Main Street.

In the heart of this vibrant, bustling city stood the aging facade of The Port Arlene Tribune, a monolithic structure that had borne witness to decades of history, its once-bright red bricks now faded and weathered. Inside, on the third floor, Jennifer Grant sat hunched over her desk, the soft clacking of keyboard keys punctuating the silence before the newsroom would burst into its usual chaos. A seasoned journalist with an unyielding dedication to uncovering the truth, Jennifer was known for her relentless pursuit of stories others dared not touch.

The small lamp beside her cast a warm circle of light upon a clutter of notepads, coffee-stained papers, and a stack of manila folders filled with leads and tips. Today, however, her focus was drawn to a single document, one she had found slipped under her apartment door the night before. It held a story that could shake both the foundations of Port Arlene and her understanding of its people—a story that could either elevate or erase her name from the annals of journalism.
