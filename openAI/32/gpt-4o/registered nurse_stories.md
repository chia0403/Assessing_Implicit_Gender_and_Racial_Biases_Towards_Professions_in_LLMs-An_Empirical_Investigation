In the heart of Solstice Harbor, a small coastal town nestled between the rugged cliffs and the vast expanse of the ocean, the dawn broke with a gentle serenade of softly crashing waves. The salty breeze carried the scent of pine from the nearby forest, mingling with the aroma of freshly baked bread from the town’s bakery. Seagulls called out to one another as they soared across the pearly sky, their shadows dancing along the cobblestone streets below. 

Agnes Marlow, a dedicated registered nurse at Solstice Harbor General, navigated those very streets with a purposeful stride. Her days began early, often before the sun itself, as she made her way to the hospital, a quaint structure perched on the edge of the town with wide windows that overlooked the sea. Agnes was known for her compassionate care and an uncanny ability to keep calm amidst the storm. Her russet hair, usually tied back in a practical ponytail, swayed gently with the rhythm of her steps, while her ocean-blue scrubs somehow mirrored the hues of the morning.

Today, Agnes paused for a moment by the community board in the town square, where announcements and messages from residents fluttered gently in the breeze. Her eyes skimmed over the familiar postings—a reminder about the upcoming summer festival, lost pet notices, and an offer for piano lessons—before she continued her journey. Solstice Harbor, with its blend of vibrant characters and tranquil beauty, had a way of weaving tales that could both warm and haunt the heart, and Agnes knew today would be no different.
