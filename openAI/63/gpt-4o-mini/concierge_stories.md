**Title: The Last Wish of Avalon Hotel**

**Setting:** The Avalon Hotel, an opulent establishment nestled in the heart of a bustling metropolis, stands tall against the skyline, its golden façade glinting under the soft glow of the streetlights. The grand lobby features a polished marble floor, intricate chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling, and an array of exotic plants that lend a touch of nature to the lavish decor. The scent of fresh flowers mingles with the rich aroma of coffee from the adjacent café, creating an inviting atmosphere for the guests who traverse its spacious halls. 

**Story Opening:**

In the early hours of dawn, as the city slowly awoke to the sounds of honking cars and chirping birds, Evelyn Claire Montrose adjusted her crisp, navy-blue blazer and smoothed her auburn hair into a neat bun. The weight of the world seemed to rest on her shoulders — a thought all too common for the head concierge of the Avalon Hotel. With the sun's first rays streaming through the grand lobby’s high windows, Evelyn straightened the stack of brochures at the front desk while stealing a glance at the large clock above, counting down the seconds until the day unfolded.

The Avalon was not just a repository of luxury; it was a sanctuary for the hopeful, the lost, and the restless. Guests checked in with dreams glittering in their eyes, a handful expecting adventure, and others seeking solace. Evelyn thrived in this vibrant tapestry of humanity, offering her expertise and a listening ear, ensuring every visitor felt special. 

As the clock chimed eight, a discordant sound caught her attention. A hurried shuffle came from the entrance. Evelyn turned to see a disheveled man in a charcoal suit, hair awry and eyes wide with panic. She recognized him instantly — Mr. Harold Finch, a renowned novelist whose latest book was rumored to be a bestseller, was checking in. 

“Good morning, Mr. Finch,” she greeted, her smile as warm as her demeanor. “Welcome back to the Avalon! How may I assist you today?”

The writer's fingers twitched nervously at the lapels of his coat. “Evelyn, I—I need help. Something is terribly wrong…” 

Evelyn’s heart raced. It was not unusual for her to encounter dramatic requests at the Avalon, but the gravity in his voice hinted at a story deeper than mere inconvenience. She stepped closer, her instincts sharpening. “Take a deep breath. Tell me what’s happened.”

As he leaned closer, anxiety written all over his face, the bustling sounds of the hotel around them faded, and Evelyn knew her day was about to take an unforeseen turn — the kind that could change not just Mr. Finch's fortunes, but perhaps her own path as well.
