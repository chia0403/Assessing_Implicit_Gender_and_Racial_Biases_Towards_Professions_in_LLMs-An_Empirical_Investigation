**Story Opening and Setting**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden hue over the quiet suburban street of Briarwood Lane. Pines swayed gently in the evening breeze, their needles whispering secrets to those who cared to listen. It was a typical Thursday evening in the small town, where families gathered for dinner and porch lights flickered on, igniting a warm glow against the encroaching twilight.

In the heart of this tranquil setting, the rhythmic sound of a power drill hummed from a modest two-story house, its faded blue paint peeling slightly at the edges. Inside, the air was filled with the faint scent of sawdust and the more prominent tang of copper wires being stripped and prepared for installation. Leaning against the kitchen counter, a sturdy man in his early thirties tightened the screws on the junction box while humming along to a classic rock tune playing from a small radio perched on the windowsill.

His name was Benjamin Carter, a hardworking electrician renowned in Briarwood for his unwavering reliability and knack for solving even the most challenging electrical issues. With a strong build and hands calloused from years of manual labor, Benjamin had an easy smile and a heart that beat for service—always ready to lend a helping hand to his neighbors, whether it was repairing a flickering light or fixing a blown fuse during a summer storm.

As he stepped back to admire his handiwork, a shadow crossed the threshold of the kitchen door. Peering into the house, his neighbor—a woman named Clara with two young children in tow—waved nervously, her eye twitching in concern. “Ben, I think something might be wrong with the power at our place,” she called out, a hint of urgency in her tone. Little did Benjamin know, this was just the beginning of a long night filled with unforeseen challenges, and a mystery entwined with the very fabric of Briarwood itself.
