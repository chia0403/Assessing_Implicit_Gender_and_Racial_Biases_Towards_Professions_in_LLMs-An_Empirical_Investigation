In the pale light of dawn, the world was drenched in a thick mist that clung to the earth like a shroud. The highway stretched out like a silver ribbon, disappearing into the dense woods that bordered it on either side. The rhythmic sound of a distant engine echoed in the silence, an occasional horn breaking the stillness as vehicles whisked by, unaware of the labor taking place just off the shoulder.

Amidst the haze, a figure clad in a bright orange work vest emerged, his silhouette cutting a crisp line against the somber backdrop. This was Gerald Andrew Brantley, a highway worker with weathered hands and a heart grounded in the lonely rhythm of his job. With a baseball cap pulled low over his brow, he bent to inspect a section of cracked asphalt, the wear and tear of heavy trucks and time revealing the fragile state of the road. 

Gerald knew this stretch of highway like the back of his hand. He had spent countless hours here, marking the pavement, directing traffic, and repairing the scars inflicted by nature and machinery alike. He found solace in the monotony of his routine, but lately, something had begun to gnaw at himâ€”a feeling that change was barreling down the road toward him, just like the heavy trucks that shook the ground when they passed. Stretching his back as the sun began to rise, he couldn't shake the feeling that today might be different.
