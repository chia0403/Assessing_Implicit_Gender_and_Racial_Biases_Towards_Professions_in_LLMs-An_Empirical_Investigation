Title: **Whispers of the Oak**

Setting: The sun dipped low in the sky, casting golden hues across the sprawling grounds of Hawthorne Manor, a once-majestic estate now shrouded in the slow creep of time. A grand oak tree stood sentinel in the center of a meticulously kept garden, its gnarled branches stretching out like arthritic fingers yearning for the sky. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming lavender, mingling with the faint echoes of distant laughter and music from a wedding tent set up near the shimmering lake.

Opening: 

As the last rays of sunlight painted the horizon, a solitary figure moved amidst the petals of fallen flowers. His name was Felix Montgomery, the steadfast groundskeeper of Hawthorne Manor. Weathered hands pushed back strands of salt-and-pepper hair as Felix knelt to inspect the delicate blooms of a hybrid rose, a testament to his dedication in restoring the once-neglected gardens to their former glory. A soft breeze whispered through the leaves of the oak, carrying stories of the past that lingered in its shadows, while Felix, lost in thought, recalled the promise he made to the manor's late ownerâ€”a promise that bound him to this land and its secrets. 

Tonight, as the stars began to twinkle above, Felix felt a shift in the air, a hint that something extraordinary was about to unfold beneath the ancient boughs of the oak.
