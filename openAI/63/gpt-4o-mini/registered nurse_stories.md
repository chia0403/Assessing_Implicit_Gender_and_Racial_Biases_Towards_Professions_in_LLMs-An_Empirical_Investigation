The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic as dawn broke over St. Helen’s General Hospital. Fluorescent lights flickered to life in the corridor, casting a sterile glow on the porcelain-tiled floor. Outside, the world was waking up, but inside, the rhythm of beeping monitors and hushed voices created a symphony of urgency that never truly stopped. 

In the midst of this controlled chaos was Evelyn Margaret Sinclair, a dedicated registered nurse known for her unwavering compassion and relentless work ethic. With her dark curls pulled into a practical bun and a stethoscope draped around her neck, she moved swiftly from room to room, her keen eyes assessing patient charts and her hands soothing the anxious. Today felt different, though—an undercurrent of tension hung in the air, a whisper of something foreboding that Evelyn couldn't shake.

As she stepped into Room 312, the faint chirping of a nearby bird caught her attention, a reminder of life beyond the clinical walls. There, bathed in the soft morning light filtering through the drawn curtains, lay Mrs. Thompson, an elderly patient whose relentless spirit had endeared her to Evelyn ever since she first entered the ward. But today, the usual spark in the woman’s eyes was dimmed, and as Evelyn advanced closer, she could sense that they were on the precipice of a day that would change everything.
