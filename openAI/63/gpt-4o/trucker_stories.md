On the outskirts of Larkspur, Colorado, where the horizon stretched wide and the air promised the scent of pine and distant rain, a lone truck rumbled down an empty highway. The sun was just nudging the peaks of the Rockies, painting the sky in hues of lavender and rose as the world awoke to another day. Gravel crunched under the semi's wheels as it eased into a rest stop, engine humming its deep, throaty song before settling into silence.

Behind the wheel sat Garrett "Red" Thompson, a man whose nickname stemmed as much from his fiery hair as his tenacity on the road. The cab of his truck was both his sanctuary and his battle station, littered with crumpled maps, a well-worn thermos, and a small collection of talismans from places he’d been — a seashell from the Florida coast, a miniature cactus from Arizona, a snow globe of New York City.

As he stepped out onto the tarmac, the cool morning breeze whispered around him, teasing the edges of his faded denim jacket. Garrett stretched, feeling the pull of muscles weary from hours of driving, and surveyed the scene with the practiced eye of a career trucker. A small diner sat just beyond the fuel pumps, its neon sign flickering inconsistently. He knew every diner and coffee shop along this route, a second network after the web of highways he knew by heart.

This was his world — vast and endlessly unraveling, bound by asphalt but limitless in possibility. Here, between the journeys and the solitude, he navigated not just the roads, but the stories that unfurled alongside them. As the sun climbed higher, scattering light across the worn surface of his truck, Garrett prepared to set out once more, the promise of the open road leading him onward.
