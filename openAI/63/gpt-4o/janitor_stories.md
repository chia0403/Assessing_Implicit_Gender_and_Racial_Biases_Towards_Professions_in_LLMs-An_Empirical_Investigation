In the heart of a sprawling metropolis, where towering skyscrapers pierced the undulating skyline and neon lights flickered insistently against the inky darkness, stood the venerable old office building of Kessler and Co. Insurance. Its façade spoke of bygone eras, with ornate stonework whispering tales of faded grandeur and history steeped into every corner. Inside, the halls echoed with the brisk footsteps of employees during the day and nestled into an eerie stillness at night.

Amidst this vast urban complexity, under the hum of flickering fluorescent lights and the distant wail of sirens, toiled Samuel Gerald Tannen, the janitor. To most, he was but a shadow slipping through the periphery of their busy lives, a figure in faded blue coveralls armed with a mop and a cart of supplies. Yet, to those who cared to look closer, Sam was the silent custodian of stories, the unseen force who restored order after each day's chaos. 

Each night, as the city descended into its nocturnal rhythm, Sam began his solitary ritual. The cacophony of typewriters and hushed conversations faded, leaving him to the symphony of solitude—his mop swishing across the marbled floors, the creak of elevator doors on desolate floors, the contented hum of quiet vacuum cleaners. He found solace in this solitude, a way to blend into the background while contemplating life's mysteries unbeknownst to those who walked those halls by day.

The floors told tales he had pieced together over years: snippets of conversations, forgotten memos stuffed into trash cans, remnants of hurried lunches. Sam knew almost as much about the workings of Kessler and Co. as any of its executives, but his knowledge was an unseen, unspoken river running beneath the surface of a day-to-day oblivion, until one night, when a secret stumbled inadvertently into his care.
