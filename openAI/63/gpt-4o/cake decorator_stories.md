Amelia Thornton stood in the quiet sanctuary of her bakery, Sweet Reverie, as the first light of dawn kissed the cobblestone streets of Aldermont. The sleepy little village, nestled between lush, rolling hills and the whispering banks of the Elmsworth River, was just beginning to stir. The golden glow of the rising sun filtered through the large bay window, casting a warm, buttery hue over the room. Shelves lined with neatly stacked bags of flour, jars of colorful sprinkles, and rows of pristine cake boxes created a sense of readiness, an anticipation of the magic soon to unfold.

Known throughout the town for her intricate designs and imaginative creations, Amelia had transformed cake decorating into an art form. Her cakes weren't just confections; they were stories told in sugar and frosting, beloved by everyone from brides on their wedding day to children celebrating their birthdays.

Today, the shop was filled with the heady scent of vanilla and almond, as Amelia prepared to craft her latest masterpiece—a towering wedding cake adorned with delicate sugar flowers and elaborate lacework piped with precision. It was for the upcoming wedding of the mayor’s daughter, a high-profile event that had the entire village buzzing with excitement.

As she organized her tools and ingredients, the familiar rhythm of her routine was interrupted by the chime of the shop's doorbell. Amelia looked up, surprised to see Vera Thompson, her dearest friend and the village's unofficial newscaster, bustling in with an expression of gleeful urgency.

"Amelia! Have you heard the news?" Vera exclaimed, her eyes wide with a secret yet to be shared.
