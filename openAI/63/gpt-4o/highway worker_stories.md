Title: The Whispering Pines

On the edge of sunrise, where the sky was a tapestry of peach and lavender, Preston Gallagher stood at mile marker 142, the cool morning air biting at his cheeks. The highway stretched ahead like a silent promise, a ribbon of asphalt bordered by a dense line of whispering pines. This stretch of Route 67 was his domain, a familiar friend he had tended for nearly a decade. As a highway maintenance worker, Preston had learned to respect the road’s quietude, understanding that every crack and crevice held a story, every gentle curve carried a history of passage.

The world here woke in a symphony of nature’s whispers, far removed from the hurried cacophony of city life. Pines swayed gently, their needles brushing against one another in soft, conspiratorial tones. Occasionally, a deer might amble through the underbrush, casting a curious glance at this solitary figure clad in orange safety gear. Preston liked to think of these early hours as the world’s reset button, a peaceful reprieve before the burst of buzzing engines broke the tranquility.

Preston's truck, a battle-worn blue vehicle marked with the county’s crest, sat parked at the shoulder. Its bed was laden with tools: a shovel, rake, and a stack of orange traffic cones catching the first light of dawn. Today’s task was to patch up a series of potholes that had been reported after the winter’s freeze and thaw. The rhythm of the job was like a dance to Preston, a blend of precision and effort where every step was a practiced motion.

But this morning, a subtle tension lingered in the air, pulling at Preston's senses like a thread. There was something different here today, perhaps in the way the light filtered through the branches, casting longer shadows that seemed to loom with unspoken words. Preston paused, listening beyond the rustle of the pine boughs, wondering if the road held secrets yet to reveal.
