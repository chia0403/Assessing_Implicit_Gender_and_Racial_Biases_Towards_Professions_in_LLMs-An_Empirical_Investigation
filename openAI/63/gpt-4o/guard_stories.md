In the pre-dawn hush, just as the sky began to hint at the coming sun, Elias Thorne stood at his post atop the stone walls of Thornfield Keep. The air was crisp and carried the scent of pine from the thick forest that bordered the fortress on three sides. Below, in the courtyard, the flickering lanterns cast long shadows, painting the cobblestones in a dance of light and darkness.

Elias, with his bearing as resolute as the walls he guarded, scanned the horizon with keen eyes. His speckled cloak, a deep green to blend with the surrounding forests, fluttered gently in the morning breeze. A seasoned guard, Elias had the look of one who knew the weight of the night's watch and the solace of dawn's arrival.

Thornfield Keep, nestled in a remote valley of the kingdom, was an ancient fortress veiled in whispers of forgotten secrets. Its towering walls spoke of once tumultuous times, though the present days were filled with a deceptive peace that still required vigilant eyes. The keep's lofty parapets offered a commanding view of the rolling hills beyond, their peaks just visible past the dense line of trees.

Elias took pride in his role at the keep, understanding that though the world beyond seemed tranquil enough, history was carved by moments unforeseen. With the first light peeking over the mountains, a soft golden hue spilled across the landscape, signaling another day of ceaseless watchfulness. Yet, the serene setting belied a stirring in the woods, the kind that often preceded the remembering of old storiesâ€”a reminder that some legends never truly remained buried.
