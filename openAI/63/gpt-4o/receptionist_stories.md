As the first shards of dawn painted the sleepy town of Willow Creek in hues of gold and rose, Evelyn Harper unlocked the glass door of the century-old Redwood Inn, where she served as the sole receptionist. The inn, a Victorian relic with gabled roofs and ivy-clad brickwork, stood like a resolute guardian at the town’s northern edge, quietly luring travelers with promises of warmth and respite. 

Evelyn inhaled deeply, savoring the crisp morning air that mingled with the subtle scent of lavender from the pots strategically placed by the entrance. It was the kind of morning that made her believe that even in a town as small as Willow Creek, with its one main street and a single traffic light, magic could still be found in the quiet corners of everyday life.

Inside, the inn exuded cozy charm with its vintage Persian rugs and the tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock marking time with reassuring precision. Mint-green walls lined with black-and-white photographs chronicled the town's history and its early settlers, local heroes whose whispering voices seemed to echo down the corridors. Evelyn loved this time of day—before guests trickled down for breakfast, demanding coffee and conversation.

After hanging her coat by the door, Evelyn settled behind the mahogany reception desk, its surface polished to a gleam. Neat stacks of brochures boasting local sights and delicacies sat by her left elbow, while a small vase of daisies brightened the space at her right. She pulled out the guest log and flipped it open, ready for the day—a curator of first impressions and an orchestrator of hospitality.
