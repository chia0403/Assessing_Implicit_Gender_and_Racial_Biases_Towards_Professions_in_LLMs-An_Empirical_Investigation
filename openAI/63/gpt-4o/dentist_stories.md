Dr. Evelyn Prescott always loved the quiet hours just before dawn. In those still moments, when the world was yet to rub the sleep from its eyes, she felt a certain kinship with the city outside her window. The muffled hum of early-morning traffic mixed with the distant cries of seabirds as they soared over the silvery line of the horizon. San Francisco, with its undulating hills and mist-laden air, was slowly awakening.

Evelyn's dental practice was nestled in the heart of Pacific Heights, a neighborhood known for its elegant, Victorian homes and sweeping views of the bay. Her office was located in one such stately old building, its high ceilings and intricate moldings reminiscent of a bygone era. The sunlit rooms had been refurbished with modern equipment, yet retained a comforting air of history. Patients often remarked on the sense of calmness they felt upon entering, as if stepping into a sanctuary amidst the swirling chaos of daily life.

This morning, as Evelyn sipped her coffee and gazed out over the rooftops, the Golden Gate Bridge peeking through the morning fog, she mentally prepared for the day's appointments. The routine was predictable yet oddly reassuring: cleanings, check-ups, the occasional filling or two. Her patients, though varied in age and background, had become like a second family over the years. They trusted her not just with their dental health, but with their stories, their worries, their quiet victories.

But today would be different. There was a note of excitement in the air, a whisper of impending change that she couldn't quite place. Dr. Evelyn Prescott finished her coffee and took a deep breath, ready to embrace whatever surprises this new day might bring.
