As the first rays of dawn filtered through the city’s ashen skyline, the Grand Marquette Hotel awoke with a gentle hum. Nestled among the aging brick facades and cobblestone streets of Old Town, its gold-trimmed awnings and polished marble plaques whispered of a bygone era. Inside, opulent chandeliers twinkled like suspended galaxies, illuminating the grand lobby where the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of lilies from the arrangements that adorned every corner.

At the heart of this luxurious sanctum stood Daniel Everett Walsh, the hotel’s esteemed bell hop. Though the elegant setting seemed almost at odds with his simple uniform—crisp gray vest, polished brass buttons, red cap perched ever so slightly askew—Daniel carried himself with an air of quiet dignity. For over a decade, he’d been the invisible thread weaving the stories of countless travelers into the rich tapestry of the Grand Marquette.

With the precision of a conductor orchestrating his symphony, Daniel moved gracefully through the lobby, his polished shoes making soft, reassuring clicks against the marble floor. He was well-versed in the language of travel—discreet nods, conversations wrapped in whispers, the rustle of an old leather suitcase being pushed across the floor. His pale blue eyes were ever observant, capturing fleeting moments of enchantment and melancholy alike.

It was in this majestic setting that Daniel began his day, unaware of the unfolding story that would soon disrupt the routine of polished banisters and elevator chimes—a story that would reveal secrets long buried beneath the hotel’s opulent facade.
