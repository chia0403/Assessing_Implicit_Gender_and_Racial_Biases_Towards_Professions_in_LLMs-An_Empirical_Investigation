In the heart of downtown Seattle, where the rain draped the city like a familiar cloak, Isaac Bennett navigated his way through the bustling crowd, each stride purposeful yet unhurried. A seasoned insurance agent with a penchant for precision, Isaac embodied the kind of steadfast reliability his clients trusted implicitly. The clang of the streetcar blended with the rhythmic patter of raindrops on his umbrella, a symphony he had grown fond of during his daily commutes through the city he'd called home for over a decade.

His destination loomed just ahead—a stoic, marble-clad building that stood as the proud headquarters of Evergreen Assurance, where Isaac had carved out a respectable career safeguarding the dreams and assets of his clients. The air inside was cool and dry, a stark contrast to the world he'd just stepped in from. As he moved through the atrium, its high ceilings and glass facades providing an open view of the relentless drizzle beyond, Isaac felt a familiar stir of determination.

Today, however, there was something more than the usual transactions and risk assessments awaiting him. Every instinct told him that today, beneath the veneer of routine, rested an opportunity or perhaps a challenge, just waiting to unfold. Isaac settled into his office, the scent of fresh coffee brewing nearby, papers meticulously organized on his polished mahogany desk, and stared out at the sky—brooding and grey, yet full of promise.
