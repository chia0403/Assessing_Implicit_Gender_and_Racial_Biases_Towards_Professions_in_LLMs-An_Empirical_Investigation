On the outskirts of the quiet, tucked-away town of Glenwood Falls, just beyond the reach of the highway's hum, the skyline was a silhouette of old houses scattered across rolling hills. Here, amidst the morning mist that clung persistently to the rooftops, Thomas "Tommy" McBride was already hard at work. The sun, yet to fully reveal itself, peeked sheepishly over the eastern horizon, painting the canvas of the sky in a watercolor blend of pinks and oranges.

Standing atop the slanted roof of a century-old farmhouse, Tommy felt a sense of solitude that was rare in his line of work. He relished these early hours, when the town was still asleep and he could hear the rhythmic cadence of his hammer echoing in the crisp morning air. 

Glenwood Falls was a place where everyone knew your name, your dog's name, and the name of the first girl you ever kissed—it was home. Nestled in a valley surrounded by emerald forests and clear, shimmering streams, it was a town that prided itself on its history and charm. The buildings, most of them dating back to the turn of the century, spoke of origins grounded in resilience and simplicity, much like Tommy himself.

Thomas McBride, better known as Tommy to friends and clients alike, was the preferred roofer for miles around—not just for his craftsmanship, but for the easy smile and genuine care he brought to every job. With hands toughened by years of grappling with heavy shingles and balancing on precarious beams, he had a knack for fixing more than just roofs; often, his visits extended to mending gutters, fences, and sometimes, if the situation demanded, the neighbor's mood.

Today, as he carefully replaced old shingles that had weathered one too many storms, Tommy glanced out over the valley, drawing a deep breath of the clean, dew-kissed air. Each day began like this, a blank slate waiting to be written on, and in the calm of the morning, standing tall amidst the eaves, Tommy McBride felt as if he had the world at his feet.
