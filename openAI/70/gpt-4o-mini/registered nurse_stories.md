The soft hum of fluorescent lights filled the air as the night shift at Crestwood General Hospital began to unfold. The sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of coffee wafting from the break room, where weary nurses huddled together, sharing snippets of their day. In Room 204, where the well-worn chairs seemed to sag under the weight of countless shifts, Nora Elizabeth Hayes stood by the bedside of her patient, gently adjusting the pillow to provide some comfort.

Nora had always felt a calling toward nursing; something about the way people relied on her during their most vulnerable moments resonated deep within her. With her chestnut hair tied back in a tidy bun and her scrubs adorned with cheerful floral patterns, she projected warmth while maintaining the professionalism required in such a demanding environment. As a registered nurse with over five years of experience at Crestwood, Nora was known for her exceptional empathy and unshakeable calm, traits that had earned her the respect of both colleagues and patients alike.

On this chilly autumn night, the hospital felt alive with whispered hopes and lingering fears, a tapestry woven from the lives of those who crossed its threshold. But it wasn’t just any night—tonight marked the full moon, casting an otherworldly glow through the windows, an omen in the eyes of the superstitious. Unbeknownst to Nora, this shift would carry with it more than just the usual challenges of patient care; it would veer into the extraordinary, testing not just her skills but the very limits of her compassion and resolve.
