**Story Opening:**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow across the sleepy town of Willow Creek. The air was thick with the scent of fresh-cut grass mingling with the faint aroma of cedar shingles, leaning against the weathered barn that had seen better days. In the midst of this picturesque scene, the rhythmic clinking of tools echoed, punctuated by the occasional laugh or shout from a nearby group of children playing tag. 

Up above, perched on the sloped roof of a modest two-story home, stood **Thomas Avery Bennett**, a seasoned roofer with a tangle of chestnut hair peeking out from beneath his faded baseball cap. At thirty-five, Thomas had spent nearly half his life scaling roofs, with the sun beating down on his back and the wind whipping through his work gloves. Today, however, was different. As he carefully laid the last few shingles in place, his mind wandered, pulled by memories of his childhood spent climbing trees, leaping from branch to branch with all the fearless abandon of youth. 

Now, as he looked out over Willow Creek—a town he knew like the back of his hand—he could see the sprawling fields and nearby woods where he’d often played as a boy. The shimmering river, glistening like diamonds, wound its way through the landscape, whispering tales of days long past. But while serenity danced around him, a storm brewed inside Thomas, a gnawing unease that something was about to change. The skies above were clear for now, but in the distance, he could hear the faint rumble of thunder, hinting at a tempest he'd yet to understand.
