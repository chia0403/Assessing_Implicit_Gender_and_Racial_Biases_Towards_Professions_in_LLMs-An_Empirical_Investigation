The rain fell steadily over the city of Ashford, forming glistening puddles on the slick pavement and washing away the remnants of a long, dreary winter. Streetlights flickered to life as dusk settled in, casting golden pools of light onto the sidewalk. Inside her modest yet warmly decorated office on the third floor of a red-brick building, Dr. Eleanor Mayfield adjusted her glasses as she arranged her notes for the evening session. 

The walls were adorned with framed prints of serene landscapes—a deliberate choice to create a calming atmosphere for her patients, who often entered the room carrying the weight of their unspoken burdens. A plush armchair, upholstered in soft brown fabric, faced her desk, inviting yet challenging as it beckoned her clients to open their hearts.

Dr. Mayfield, a clinical psychologist in her late thirties, had dedicated her life to understanding the complexities of the human mind. With a knack for empathy and an analytical approach, she forged deep connections with those who sought her help, guiding them through the mazes of their emotions and traumas. Yet beneath her professional demeanor, Eleanor often grappled with her own inner turmoil—traces of a past that lingered like shadows at the edges of her consciousness.

As she tapped her pen against her notepad, contemplating the case files in front of her, the soft chime of the clock on the wall signaled the arrival of her next patient. With a steadying breath, Eleanor prepared to welcome yet another soul seeking solace in a city that often felt far too cold and indifferent.
