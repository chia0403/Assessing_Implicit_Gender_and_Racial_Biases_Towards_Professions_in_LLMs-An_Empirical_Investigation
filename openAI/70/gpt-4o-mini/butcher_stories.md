In the small town of Eldersridge, where the cobblestone streets wound like the rivers that once carved the valley, the air was thick with the scents of salt and smoke. It was here, in a narrow alley bordered by ivy-clad brick buildings, that a weathered wooden sign creaked gently in the breeze, announcing the presence of “Thompson's Meats.” 

Inside, the old butcher shop was a world of its own—a montage of rich mahogany counters and gleaming stainless steel tools, illuminated by the soft glow of hanging lanterns. A large chalkboard behind the counter displayed the day’s offerings, surrounded by jars filled with colorful spices and house-made sausages hanging from hooks overhead, swaying ever so slightly as customers moved about.

At the center of this bustling little universe stood Percival Arthur Thompson, the town's beloved butcher. With a sturdy build and a face lined with the stories of decades, Percival had an air of quiet confidence about him. He moved with practiced grace through the shop, wielding his knives like an artist, each slice of meat a careful stroke on the canvas of his creations. Known for his generosity and knack for storytelling, Percival had a way of making pottage out of every customer’s inquiry or complaint, turning their mundane errands into joyful exchanges.

But beneath the surface of his jovial demeanor lay a collection of secrets—whispers of a past not easily forgotten. Each cut of meat he prepared had a story lurking behind it, and behind the faint sound of laughter that accompanied the regulars who came in for their weekly orders, shadowy hints of something amiss loomed just out of sight. As twilight settled over Eldersridge, casting long shadows through the windows, Percival felt the weight of unspoken truths tugging at him, marking the beginning of a tale far deeper than the simple life of a butcher.
