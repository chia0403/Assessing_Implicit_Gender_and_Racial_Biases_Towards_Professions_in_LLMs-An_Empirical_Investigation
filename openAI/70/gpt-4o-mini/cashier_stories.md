The fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead as Amelia Jane Carter glanced at the clock hanging crookedly on the wall of Skye’s Market. It was just past 3 PM, and the afternoon rush had begun to taper off, leaving her with a moment's reprieve behind the register. The air inside the small grocery store was a mix of pine-scented cleaner and the faint aroma of freshly baked bread from the bakery section. 

Amelia had been working as a cashier at the market for the last three years, her smile becoming familiar to the regulars who would stop by for their daily groceries. At twenty-four, she had already mastered the art of rapid scanning and bagging, all while engaging in small talk with customers that helped break the monotony of her shifts. Today, however, was different. 

As she scanned a bag of organic apples, her gaze drifted to the window, where gray clouds morphed into unusual silhouettes against the fading light. A chill swept through the entrance as the door swung open, and a gust of wind carried with it the scent of rain, now mingling with the sweetness of pastries. Amelia wrapped her fingers tighter around the edge of the register, already envisioning the storm outside, and something about it made her heart race with anticipation — an unshakeable feeling that today was not going to end like any other day.
