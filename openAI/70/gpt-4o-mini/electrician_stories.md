**Title: Sparks in the Shadows**

**Setting:**
The story begins in the quaint, coastal town of Eldridge Cove, known for its stunning bluffs and whispering winds that carry tales of the past. The town is a tapestry of charming Victorian homes, eclectic shops, and a quaint harbor that bustles with fishermen and artists alike. With the autumn leaves swirling around, the mist from the sea creates an ethereal atmosphere, hinting at secrets buried just beneath the surface.

**Story Opening:**
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting an amber glow over Eldridge Cove, the sharp scent of salt and wood filled the air. Beneath the flickering street lamps, Thomas Edgar Watts, an electrician by trade, knelt beside a vintage lamp post in Whittaker Park, his calloused hands deftly maneuvering through the tangled wires.

Thomas, known as Tommy to the locals, could often be found in the company of circuit boards and conduit pipes, but tonight felt different. The moon hung low, casting an otherworldly light that danced on the ground around him, and he sensed an electric charge that had nothing to do with the job at hand. With meticulous care, he twisted the last wire into place, feeling a mix of pride and purpose as he secured the final connection.

Yet, as he stood up and wiped the perspiration from his brow, Tommy couldn’t shake the feeling that the night held more than just repair work. The townsfolk whispered about a series of odd occurrences—the flickering lights, unexplained outages, and shadows moving in the corners of empty rooms. Skepticism was in Tommy’s nature, but the chill creeping down his spine urged him to reconsider, and as he packed his tools, a strange humming sound caught his attention. 

He turned towards the old lighthouse at the edge of the cove, its silhouette framed by the rising fog. The beacon had long since fallen silent, but tonight, the light flickered to life, illuminating the darkness in a way Tommy had never seen before. Curiosity piqued, and with his heart thrumming in sync with the rhythmic tide, he knew he had to investigate.
