In the quaint, timeless village of Elderridge, where ivy-clad stone cottages mingled with vibrant gardens, there stood an expansive estate known as Greywood Manor. This once-grand residence had seen better days, its imposing façade softened by years of neglect and the wild embrace of nature creeping closer each season. The air carried the sweet scent of blooming lilacs, mingling with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, inviting an aura of both nostalgia and mystery.

Beneath the sprawling branches of an ancient oak tree, a solitary figure worked diligently. Nathaniel Hargrove, the manor's devoted groundskeeper, knelt on the ground, his hands immersed in the soil as he dug around the roots of a gnarled rose bush. He was a man of modest stature, with a weathered face that told tales of countless seasons spent tending to the estate’s gardens. His once-black hair had succumbed to the silver threads of time, much like the manor itself—a relic that still held beauty beneath its overgrown exterior.

Nathaniel had worked at Greywood Manor for over two decades, choreographing a dance between man and nature as he battled the encroaching wilderness that sought to reclaim the land. Each morning, as dawn broke over the steep hills that surrounded the village, he donned his worn, earth-toned overalls and ventured into the gardens with a sense of purpose. But today felt different. A chill lingered in the air, and whispers of change rustled through the trees, as if the very grounds of Greywood Manor were awakening with secrets long buried beneath the ground.
