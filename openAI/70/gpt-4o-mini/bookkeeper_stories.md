The early morning sun filtered through the dusty blinds of Helen Marlowe’s modest office on the third floor of a nondescript brick building downtown, illuminating motes of dust that danced lazily in the warm light. The rhythmic ticking of an old clock echoed the orderly nature of her life, a life punctuated by ledgers and spreadsheets, where every number had its place and every dollar was accounted for. The faint scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the musty aroma of paper that had long ago yellowed at the edges, a comforting reminder of the countless hours she had spent balancing sheets.

Helen, a meticulous bookkeeper at Griffin & Co., had always found solace in numbers. They were like old friends, predictable and steadfast, in stark contrast to the chaotic details of her personal life. At forty-five, she wore her straight brown hair pulled back into a neat bun, a style that matched the crisp white blouse and charcoal slacks she selected each morning. Her round glasses framed her sharp hazel eyes, which were perpetually adorned with a hint of concern—never quite knowing what the day might bring beyond the columns of numerals before her.

As she settled into her comfortable chair, the sound of heels clicking on the linoleum floor drew her attention. The clock ticked on, but today felt different; an uneasy anticipation hung in the air, as if the universe was preparing to rewrite the routine of her days. Outside, the city buzzed with life, oblivious to her quiet reflections, but within the walls of her office, her world remained steadfastly unchanged—until now.
