The blustering wind whistled through the narrow alleyways of Crescent City, rattling the window panes of the grand but aging Silver Crest Hotel. Once a glamorous jewel of the downtown district, it now stood like a stoic sentinel, its faded façade hinting at the opulence of a bygone era. The brass bell above the entrance jingled softly as Samuel Theodore Greene, the hotel's dedicated bell hop, pushed through the heavy glass doors, ushering in a gust of damp autumn air. Clad in his crisp uniform—tailored, if a little frayed at the edges—Samuel's quick strides across the marbled lobby echoed with purpose.

Inside, the lobby was adorned with maroon carpets and elaborate chandeliers that flickered like dim stars. Samuel had spent nearly three years navigating the ups and downs of this historic establishment, his watchful eyes ever alert for the needs of guests. As he approached the reception desk, he caught sight of a group of tourists huddled over a map, their expressions a mix of excitement and confusion, a reminder of why he loved this job. Each day brought new stories, new faces, and the promise of adventure amid the monotony of room service and luggage.

But as the sun dipped behind the city skyline, casting long shadows, Samuel felt an unusual energy in the air—an electric sense that tonight, beneath the tired glamour of the Silver Crest, something extraordinary might unfold. Little did he know, the events about to be set in motion would change both the hotel and his life forever.
