The early morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets of Alderwood, the small town nestled between rolling hills and dense forests. Streetlamps flickered one by one as dawn approached, illuminating the quiet scene of narrow alleyways and Victorian-era buildings that seemed to hold secrets of their own. It was a place where everyone knew each other's names, where the air was thick with the scent of brewing coffee and fresh pastries from the corner bakery.

Officer Lydia Jane Harrington stood by her patrol car, the crisp uniform contrasting with the soft, gray fog swirling around her. At thirty-two, Lydia had lived in Alderwood all her life, her roots digging deep into the town’s history like the sturdy oaks that lined Main Street. She was known for her steadfast commitment to the community and her innate ability to connect with people, whether that meant calming a domestic dispute or sharing a laugh with the kids at the local park.

As she sipped her steaming cup of coffee, Lydia stared down the alleyway where the dim light barely reached. Something felt off this morning, a tension that pricked at the back of her mind like a dull ache. Alderwood had always been a peaceful place, but recently, whispers of unrest had begun to weave through the fabric of the town. She shook her head, brushing off the creeping sense of unease, and leaned against her police cruiser, scanning the streets for signs of life— unaware that the day ahead would shatter the tranquility she had always cherished.
