Title: **Beneath the Ledger**

Opening:

The rhythmic tapping of fingers against a keyboard echoed through the quiet office of Hawthorne & Co. The fluorescent lights cast a sterile glow across the rows of cubicles, illuminating stacks of invoices and balance sheets that sprawled like an unruly forest of financial chaos. It was early morning, just before the sun broke through the heavy clouds outside, and the warmth of dawn had yet to claim the chilly air.

In the far corner corner of the room, nestled between a potted fern and a precarious column of outdated tax returns, sat Eleanor Ruthling—an unassuming accountant with an eagle eye for detail. A petite woman in her thirties, Eleanor had a reputation for precision, her spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose as she scanned number after number with meticulous care. The faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the office, stirring her thoughts—and her resolve.

This day was unlike any other. While the walls of the office seemed to press in on her, the familiar confines were about to unravel in ways Eleanor could never have predicted. It was the day she uncovered the discrepancy; a small, seemingly innocuous error in the quarterly reports. An error that would lead her down a rabbit hole of secrets, whispers, and consequences that rippled far beyond the ledgers she so loved to balance.

Setting:

Hawthorne & Co. was a mid-sized accounting firm located in the heart of the city’s financial district. The building itself was a modern glass facade that reflected the towering skyscrapers surrounding it, creating a striking contrast against the damp, gray sky. Inside, the open-plan office buzzed with the low hum of activity; phones rang, printers whirred, and the soft rustle of paper filled the air. Each desk was a small universe of spreadsheets and projections, where the life of numbers collided with the daily grind of corporate deadlines.

Eleanor was well acquainted with her coworkers, their lives woven together in the tapestry of late nights and early mornings. She often found solace in the predictable rhythm of her work, thriving in the world of debits and credits. But today, there was a tension in the atmosphere—a palpable energy that tingled beneath the surface, hinting at something bigger than the usual flow of accounts. All the while, Eleanor remained blissfully unaware that her discovery would soon set in motion a series of events that would forever alter the course of her life.
