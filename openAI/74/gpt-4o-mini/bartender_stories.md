**Setting: The Rusty Anchor Tavern, a dimly-lit establishment nestled along the rocky coastline of Windward Cove. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater mingling with the rich aroma of aged whiskey. Antique ship wheels and weathered nautical maps adorn the walls, and a jukebox in the corner softly plays a selection of classic tunes, echoing through the clinking of glasses and quiet laughter. Outside, waves crash against the jagged cliffs, their rhythm a constant hum in the background.**

**Story Opening:**

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange glow across the tidal pools, Elena Mae Walker stood behind the bar of the Rusty Anchor Tavern, wiping down the polished mahogany counter with a well-worn rag. She had always loved this time of day, when the world outside started to bathe in twilight and the bar began to fill with familiar faces and weary travelers seeking refuge from the encroaching night. 

Elena's hands moved deftly, pouring a tall glass of amber ale for a regular, a burly fisherman named Hank who often shared tales of the sea over a pint. She caught his eye and offered a warm smile, her emerald-green eyes sparkling with mischief. The tavern was her domain, a place where secrets were shared and stories unfolded like the tides that ebbed and flowed just outside the door.

But tonight felt different. There was a charge in the air, a sense of anticipation that prickled at the back of her neck. Leaning against the bar, she glanced toward the frosted window, where the last light of day surrendered to the encroaching shadows. She could feel it—a shift in the atmosphere that whispered of change, as if the very walls of the Rusty Anchor were holding their breath, waiting for something—or someone—to arrive.

As if summoned by her thoughts, the door swung open with a creak, allowing a gust of cool ocean air to rush in. Elena turned to greet the newcomer, her smile faltering as she laid eyes on a figure she never expected to see again.
