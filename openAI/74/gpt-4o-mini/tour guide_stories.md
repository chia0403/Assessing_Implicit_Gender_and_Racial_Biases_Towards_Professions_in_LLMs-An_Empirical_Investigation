**Story Opening:**

The morning sun filtered through the mist that clung to the ancient cobblestones of Montpelier, casting a warm glow on the vibrant hustle of the marketplace. The lively chatter of vendors mingled with the distant sound of a street musician’s guitar, creating a symphony of life as the town awoke. It was in this picturesque setting that Evelyn Marigold Cormier prepared for another day of sharing her love for history with the eager travelers who sought to experience the charm of her hometown.

Evelyn stood at the edge of the square, adjusting the wide-brimmed hat that shielded her from the sun, her fingers brushing against the soft fabric of her colorful shawl. Her curly auburn hair danced lightly in the breeze as she scanned the crowd, her hazel eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. Today was special—she had planned a unique tour that would weave through the town’s hidden gems and stories long forgotten.

As the clock struck ten, she clasped the leather-bound notebook filled with notes, maps, and old photographs. With an infectious smile, she called out to the small group gathering before her, the excitement of anticipation flooding her chest. Each tour was not just a job for Evelyn; it was a chance to breathe life into the past and ignite a sense of wonder in those willing to listen. And today, she was ready to unveil the secrets of Montpelier.
