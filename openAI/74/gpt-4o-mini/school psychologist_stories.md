**Title: Echoes of Silence**

**Setting: Oakwood High School, a sprawling brick building nestled amidst a canopy of old oak trees in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The school buzzes with energy, filled with the chatter of students meandering through hallways adorned with colorful posters promoting the upcoming spring dance and various club activities. Sunlight filters through large windows, casting warm, dappled shadows across the worn wooden floors. The air is filled with the faint scent of chalk dust and freshly waxed floors, mingling with the laughter and occasional shouts echoing from the gymnasium.**

As the school day begins, Dr. Clara Bethany Finch enters her office, a small but inviting room decorated with soft pastel colors and filled with inviting furniture—a plush couch, a couple of mismatched armchairs, and a wall lined with books on child psychology and self-help. A few cheerful plants brighten the corners, while art created by students hangs proudly on the walls. Clara takes a moment to inhale deeply, allowing the familiar scent of lavender from the diffuser to calm her racing thoughts. 

Today feels different. She can sense the currents of anxiety swirling among her students as she reviews her schedule filled with appointments. Clara's keen instincts allow her to read the subtle signs, and she steels herself for the emotional challenges ahead. Ever since she began working at Oakwood High School, she has been determined to provide a safe space for troubled teens, and with each passing day, she becomes more attuned to the hidden struggles lurking beneath their smiles.

As she flips through her notes, Clara reflects on her approach—every child has a story, and it is her job to peel back the layers, to offer them a listening ear, and to guide them toward healing. Today, however, she feels a tug of apprehension, knowing there’s a storm brewing beneath the surface, one that may prove to be her greatest challenge yet.
