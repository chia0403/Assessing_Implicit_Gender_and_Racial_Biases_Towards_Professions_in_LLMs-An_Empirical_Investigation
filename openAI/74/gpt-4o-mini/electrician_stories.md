In the small, sleepy town of Maplewood, where the scent of pine lingered in the air and the streets were framed by charming, vintage houses, a legend whispered through the alleys and passed between neighbors. It was said that the old Miller mansion at the end of Oak Lane held secrets just as enigmatic as the flickering lights that adorned its shadowy halls. Many had tried to illuminate its mysteries, but all had left in frustration, their flashlights dimmed and hopes dashed.

As dusk settled over the town, painting the sky in hues of orange and lavender, the looming silhouette of the mansion grew more imposing. At that moment, Evan Gregory Hale, a local electrician with tousled dark hair and a grease-stained cap, was finishing up the last job of the day. His muscular build and steady hands had earned him a good reputation in Maplewood, but it was his stubborn curiosity that often led him to seek out the odd jobs, especially when they involved something otherworldly.

Just as he packed away his tools, a thought flared in his mind—he had heard whisperings at the deli about strange electrical issues inside the Miller mansion, unusual enough to catch his attention. The townsfolk spoke of flickering lights that danced like fireflies at dusk and a basement that never seemed to stay dark, no matter how many bulbs were changed. Intrigued and eager to chase the potential for a good story—or perhaps a paycheck—Evan wiped his brow and decided then and there to take on the challenge. 

He couldn’t shake the thrill that ran through him as he jogged toward the looming mansion. Little did he know that this job would not only test his skills as an electrician but also plunge him deeper into the heart of Maplewood’s most forgotten secrets.
