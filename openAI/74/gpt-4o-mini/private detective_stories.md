The rain drummed a steady rhythm against the cracked pavement of Willow Street, painting the world in shades of gray as twilight embraced the city.

The rain intensified outside, tapping a frantic tempo as a new mystery demanded his attention. The clock on the wall ticked slowly, urging him to unravel the enigma before time, much like the rain, washed everything away.
