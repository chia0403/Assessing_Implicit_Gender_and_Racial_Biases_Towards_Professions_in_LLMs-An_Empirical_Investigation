**Title: The Numbers Beneath**

**Setting:**

The small town of Brookhaven, known for its tree-lined streets and an air of nostalgia, buzzed softly as the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm orange glow against the quaint brick buildings. In the heart of Brookhaven stood a modest office, its sign swinging lightly in the evening breeze: **"Avery & Associates: Expert Tax Preparation."** Inside, the sounds of keyboard strokes and the faint rustle of paperwork created a familiar rhythm that harmonized with the gentle hum of the overhead lights.

**Story Opening:**

Ernestine Lavinia Avery had always found solace in numbers. An income tax preparer with over a decade of experience, she relished the scent of freshly printed forms and the satisfying click of her mechanical pencil gliding across a ledger. Every January, as the first snowflakes began to dust the ground, the small office transformed from a quiet workspace into a bustling hub of anxious taxpayers seeking help with their financial puzzles.

This year, however, reality loomed larger than ever. The usual knot of excitement in the pit of Ernestine’s stomach twirled with unease. With the tax deadline approaching, her desk—a chaotic landscape of W-2s, 1099s, and coffee-stained receipts—beckoned her attention. Yet, something felt different as she scribbled notes and reviewed figures, a gnawing sense that the numbers might hold secrets she hadn’t yet uncovered.

As the clock ticked its way toward closing, the door swung open with a jangle of bells, unsettling her thoughts. In walked a tall figure, silhouetted against the twilight. Ernestine glanced up, recognizing the familiar face of Tom Eckhart—a local businessman, known for his charm and, lately, his gray area dealings. He wore an expression that teased at either desperation or determination, perhaps both. 

"Ernestine," he began, his voice low but steady, "I need your help. There's something about my taxes this year that doesn't add up." 

With a sigh that settled in her chest like a heavy stone, Ernestine smiled tightly. For every return she prepared, every hidden deduction she unearthed, there were always stories lurking in the shadows of the figures. And as she motioned Tom to sit down, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this year, the stories would become more confounding than ever.
