The sun dipped low in the horizon, casting a golden hue over the stone walls of Eldermere Keep. A chill wind whispered through the ancient oaks that lined the grounds, rustling their leaves in a symphony of secrets only the night could comprehend. As twilight settled, the distant howl of wolves echoed through the air, a reminder of the wild world beyond the castle's fortified perimeter. 

Atop the battlements, a lone figure stood watch, silhouetted against the fading light. Sir Roland Thorne, the keep's steadfast guard, adjusted his weatherworn cloak and peered into the encroaching shadows. His keen eyes, accustomed to the dark, scanned the surrounding woodland, where the gnarled branches of trees loomed like sinister sentinels. For years, Sir Roland had dedicated his life to safeguarding Eldermere, a stark reminder of loyalty and honor in a realm often ravaged by discord.

As the last rays of sunlight vanished, Roland felt the weight of his duty settle more heavily upon his shoulders. The stories of a rising darkness beyond the borders of Eldermere—talk of creatures stalking the night and a tyrant intent on conquest—had reached even his vigilant ears. With each setting sun, tension clung to the air thicker than mist, and tonight, he could feel an unsettling premonition thrumming in his bones. 

He shifted his gaze to the distant mountains, their peaks shrouded in an ominous haze. He could not shake the feeling that something was coming. Perhaps it was merely the weight of his position as a guardian of this ancient keep, or perhaps it was a warning—one he must heed closely, for the world outside had never been more perilous.
