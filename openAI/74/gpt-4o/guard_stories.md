In the heart of the sprawling coastal city of Astral Bay, where the ocean's whispers mingled with the urban hum, stood the formidable structure of the Silver Crescent Prison. The prison loomed high above the docks, an austere building of cold, grey stone Iit held within its walls secrets and stories as tumultuous as the sea it overlooked. Seagulls hovered and swooped around its battlements, their cries mingling with the distant clatter of shipyards and the hushed rumors of the market square.

Alastor Quinn was the name etched into the brass nameplate of the third guard post, where he routinely began his night shift. Despite the encroaching darkness that wrapped the prison each evening, Alastor's clerical uniform seemed to absorb the wan light of the setting sun, casting a long, solitary shadow beside him. With shoulders squared and eyes sharp as flint, he navigated the familiar perimeter of the prison yard with unwavering dedication. His role was not merely that of a guard but a sentinel, caretaker of both the restless souls within and the uneasy tranquility without.

The air around Silver Crescent was thick with foreboding and the scent of saltwater, a constant reminder of the city's dual natureâ€”at once a place of opportunity and captivity. Alastor could feel it all, a living, breathing entity that he both belonged to and sought to keep at bay. Tonight, like countless others before it, the prison's secrets seemed to ripple beneath the mundane surface, waiting for the right moment to breach. With each step, Alastor Quinn remained vigilant, for in Astral Bay, beneath the sheen of its moonlit facade, the night belonged to those who dared to keep watch over its edge.
