In the heart of Port Reach, a small coastal town perpetually cloaked in mist and mystery, nestled between towering cliffs and the relentless Atlantic, lies St. Miriam's General Hospital. Its weathered stone façade, reminiscent of an era long past, stands stoic against the elements, both natural and human. Though the hospital bustles with the rhythm of life—steady, unwavering—it is here, in the quieter hours of the morning before dawn breaks through the shroud of fog, that Margo Ellsworth begins her day.

Margo, a dedicated phlebotomist with a meticulous eye and unwavering hands, navigates through the labyrinthine corridors with practiced ease. Her presence is a calming balm to those in the grip of unease; she is a lifeline, drawing blood with the precision of an artist and the empathy of a healer. The patients know her not just as a skilled practitioner, but as a confidante, their secrets safe within the vault of her professional and compassionate demeanor.

As she moves through the hospital, the rhythmic clinking of her rolling cart echoes softly, a herald of sorts, announcing her approach into the rooms where fear often lingers. Margo’s distinctive auburn hair, tied neatly into a braid, glows dimly under the flickering fluorescent lights, a beacon in the shadowed halls where sleep still clings to tired eyes.

Despite the early hour, St. Miriam’s never truly sleeps, much like the town it serves. The sea can be heard faintly through cracked windows, a constant yet distant companion, its push and pull mimicking the very lifeblood Margo gathers each day.
