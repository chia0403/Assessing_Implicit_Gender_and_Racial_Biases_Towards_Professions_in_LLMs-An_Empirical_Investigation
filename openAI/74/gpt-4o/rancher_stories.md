The sun had scarcely begun its ascent when Eli Thompson emerged from the modest, pine-clad farmhouse nestled in the heart of the sprawling Oxbow Ridge Ranch. With a gentle hand, he tugged the brim of his weathered Stetson lower against the early morning chill, the cool air sending tendrils of mist across the golden expanse of prairie that stretched endlessly towards the horizon.

Oxbow Ridge was situated where the flatness of the Great Plains met the undulating foothills of the Rockies—a place where the land rolled and stretched with the rhythm of ages gone by. Under the vast, pale blue sky, patches of wild sage and bluestem grass painted the ranch with their muted, natural hues.

Eli had inherited the ranch from his father, Amos Thompson, a grizzled old hand who had lost his battle with time months shy of his eightieth birthday. Generations of Thompsons had worked this land, imprinting their legacy in every weather-beaten post and sun-baked field. Eli took a moment to breathe in the crisp scent of dewy earth and saddle leather, feeling a deep-seated connection to the land's history.

Despite the early hour, the ranch was already alive with the soft sounds of dawn—the lowing of cattle, the rhythmic clanking of the windmill, and the distant call of a mourning dove. As Eli headed toward the corral, past the barns and silos that decided the skyline of his world, he felt the familiar mix of anticipation and responsibility that every morning brought.

Today, he would attend to the cattle in the far pasture, ensuring their safe passage to the western grazing fields before the summer sun rose high and relentless. With a glance towards the bruised purples and oranges threading through the eastern sky, Eli knew the day would be long and the work hard, but that was the life he'd chosen—the life he cherished.
