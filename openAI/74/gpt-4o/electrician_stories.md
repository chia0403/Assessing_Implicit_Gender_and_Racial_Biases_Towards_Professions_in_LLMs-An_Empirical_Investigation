In the quiet town of Eldenbrook, nestled between dense pine forests and winding rivers, the misty dawn broke with a subtle promise of rain. Soft amber streetlights flickered out as the first hints of light grazed the cobblestone streets. The town's quaint charm was accentuated by rustic brick buildings, each adorned with vibrant hanging baskets of petunias and geraniums that danced gently in the morning breeze.

Amidst this serene backdrop, Ethan Cole, a skilled electrician known among the townsfolk for his meticulous work and gentle demeanor, navigated his way through the sleepy streets. His toolbox clinked with each step, a familiar symphony of metal against wood, resonating comfortingly in the morning silence. With jet-black hair tucked beneath a worn blue cap and his dark green work jacket zipped to stave off the chill, Ethan's presence was as much a fixture of the town as the old clock tower that loomed watchfully over Main Street.

The day ahead promised a challenging task at the historic Alderwood Manor, a sprawling estate that had seen better days. Its owners, the elderly Thorne sisters, had complained of flickering lights and unexplained outages—a peculiar mystery that had intrigued Ethan since the call came through just the day before. As he approached the manor, the wrought-iron gates creaked open as if in greeting, revealing gardens tangled with ivy and roses climbing defiantly over stone walls.

With a deep breath of the crisp morning air, Ethan made his way up the winding gravel path, the sounds of nature enveloping him—birdsong weaving through the air and the distant rushing of the river harmonizing in the background. Today promised revelation and perhaps, beneath Alderwood Manor’s aged rafters and shadowed hallways, secrets long hidden from the people of Eldenbrook.
