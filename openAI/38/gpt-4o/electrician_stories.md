On the outskirts of the sprawling city of Northwind, where the urban landscape began to melt into the rolling hills and dense clusters of maple trees, there stood an old brick building known fondly to the locals as the "Beacon Haven." It had once housed the city’s first power plant, and the scent of machine oil and warm metal still hung about its high, stained-glass windows. Now, it served as a workshop for Evan Mitchell Jones, the most sought-after electrician this side of the Maple River.

Evan had inherited the workshop, along with a boundless curiosity for circuits and light, from his grandfather, a man who had seen the world shift from candlelight to electricity. Every morning, Evan would walk the winding path from his little cottage to the workshop, his toolbox clattering softly to his gait. The mornings were his favorite time, with the dew still fresh on the leaves, and the sun casting long, golden fingers through the fading mists.

Inside Beacon Haven, rows of towering shelves crammed with coiled wires, vintage radio tubes, and switches awaited his deft hands. In one corner, a half-finished project — a custom-made chandelier for the newly renovated town hall — sat patiently, its crystal pendants catching stray beams of light.

The townsfolk often came to Evan with requests that ranged from the mundane to the peculiar. Today, as autumn leaves rustled in the crisp breeze outside, Evan prepared for yet another unique challenge. Abby Fitzgerald, the local librarian, had phoned in the previous evening with an intriguing request: to revive the dusty old electrics of a library clock that hadn't ticked since before the first edition of War and Peace had graced its shelves.

As Evan checked his toolkit one last time, the shop's only radio murmured softly in the background, a gentle companion whispering tales from the wider world. There was work to be done, stories to be rewritten in loops of copper, and lives to be illuminated by his skilled hands. For Evan Mitchell Jones, the day was only beginning, and the possibilities were as endless as the entangled wires that lay before him.
