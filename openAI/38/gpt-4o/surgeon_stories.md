Dr. Evelyn Monroe stood at the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows of her apartment, gazing out at the waking city below. The sun, a muted orange disc, emerged from behind the skyscrapers, casting long shadows over the bustling streets of downtown Seattle. Her apartment, perched on the fifteenth floor, was a serene sanctuary amid the urban chaos—a place where sleek, minimalist design met the comforting scent of fresh coffee emanating from the kitchen.

The city was alive with the sounds of morning: the distant hum of traffic, the soft clatter of footsteps against the sidewalk, and the occasional trill of birds weaving between buildings. It was a stark contrast to the quiet, sterile world of the operating room where Evelyn spent most of her time. There, time seemed to pulse in its own rhythm, each second marked by the steady beep of the heart monitor and the precise, deliberate movements of those wielding scalpels.

Evelyn had chosen this life, embracing the demands and sacrifices it required, nurturing an ambition as profound as the disciplines she practiced. Her path to becoming a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon had been anything but easy, but standing here now, observing the city she had come to love dearly, she felt a profound sense of belonging—that she was exactly where she needed to be.

Today promised to be just as challenging as any other, with back-to-back surgeries that would test her skill and endurance. Yet, before she donned her scrubs and stepped into the hospital where time felt simultaneously endless and nonexistent, Evelyn savored these quiet moments of solitude and reflection, knowing they were as essential to her as the careful stitching of an artery.
