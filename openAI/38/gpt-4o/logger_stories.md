In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where towering evergreens knit a verdant canopy against the sky, Jonah "Bear" McAllister carved his days from the living wood. The sun, still wrestling its way over the jagged profile of the Cascades, spilled golden light across the forest floor, dappling the rugged terrain with patches of warmth. The air buzzed with the sharp tang of pine and the earthy undertone of wet cedar, a scent as familiar to Bear as the feel of his own axe handle, smooth from years of honest work.

Bear was a man who wore the forest like a second skin, his flannel shirt perpetually marked with sawdust, his boots ever caked with mud. His pocketknife was as indispensable as his compass, and the old Stihl chainsaw slung over his shoulder was a trusted friend, its comforting growl as integral to his daily rhythm as the rush of the nearby river. With each sunrise, Bear trekked deeper into the emerald embrace of the wilderness, working alongside the line of century-old Douglas firs and Western hemlocks that whispered their ancient stories in the wind.

Though the world beyond Edgewood Grove rumbled with progress and change, here the trees stood steadfast and timeless. This corner of the Earth, with its symphony of rustling leaves and distant birdsong, was more than just a workplace for Bear; it was a sanctuary, a testament to resilience and roots both literal and metaphorical. Here, Jonah McAllister was more than a loggerâ€”he was a steward of the forest, a storyteller in timber, listening to the land and leaving his own humble mark, one carefully chosen tree at a time.
