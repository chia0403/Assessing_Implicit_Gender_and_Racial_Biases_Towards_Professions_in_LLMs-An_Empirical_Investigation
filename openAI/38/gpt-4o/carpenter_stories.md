In the quiet town of Everwood, where the air always smelled faintly of pine and the streets were lined with charming old cottages, lived a carpenter named Samuel Reed. Nestled at the edge of the vast Orinoco Forest, Samuel’s workshop stood, a rustic haven of creativity and sawdust. Here, surrounded by towering trees that seemed to hum with secrets, he worked diligently, crafting pieces of art from the very timber that whispered his name.

Samuel was renowned in Everwood for his craftsmanship; his hands, steady and sure, could coax life into the most stubborn pieces of wood. His workshop was an extension of himself—a place where the beams of golden sunlight mingled with the symphony of hammer and chisel. Shelves were lined with wooden toys, elegant furniture, and intricate carvings, each piece more enchanting than the last.

The town itself was a tapestry of idyllic scenes: children racing through the cobblestone streets, shopkeepers exchanging stories over freshly brewed coffee, and the gentle murmur of the river weaving through the landscape like a silver ribbon. Life in Everwood moved at a pace that seemed almost rhythmic, in tune with the natural world that enveloped it.

But on this particular morning, as Samuel opened the creaking wooden door of his workshop, there was something different in the air. A cool breeze carried with it a whisper of change. The chimes hanging by his door tinkled softly, a tune he hadn’t heard before. As he stepped inside, his eyes alighted on a peculiar piece of driftwood that had mysteriously found its way onto his workbench.

This was how it began—Samuel Reed’s quiet life, framed by the simplicity of wood and the silence of the forest, was about to become entwined with a story that the winds had brought to Everwood.
