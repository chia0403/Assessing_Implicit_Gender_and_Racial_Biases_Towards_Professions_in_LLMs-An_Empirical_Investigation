**Title: The Wrench in Time**

**Setting: Pinewood Heights, a small town nestled between the Appalachian mountains and a sprawling forest of ancient oaks. The sky has just shifted to a dusky purple, the glow of streetlights flickering to life as the last vestiges of sunlight fade. The scent of fresh pine mingles with the lingering fumes from the nearby auto repair shop, “Smith & Co. Auto Repairs,” a modest yet well-loved establishment standing proudly at the corner of Maple Street and Route 11. Its weather-beaten sign sways gently in the evening breeze, revealing the hand-painted letters that have seen better days. Inside, the sounds of clinking tools and the occasional rev of an engine create a symphony of industriousness, while grease-stained posters of classic cars adorn the walls.**

**Main Character: Dalton Matthew Smith, a 35-year-old auto mechanic with a penchant for vintage engines and a penchant for trouble.** 

Dalton had spent most of his life beneath the hoods of cars, dedicating all his skills to a profession that felt both like a passion and a penance. With sun-kissed skin and hands that bore the scars of a thousand repairs, he was as much a fixture of Pinewood Heights as the trees surrounding it. Enough townsfolk knew him for his work, but few understood the depths of his dreams—or the shadows that lurked just beyond the shop. As he wiped his brow with a rag, he felt a familiar weight in his chest; the town may have been small, but its secrets often proved vast, and his latest project—a well-worn Chevrolet Nova—held a mystery that had begun to gnaw at him from the inside.
