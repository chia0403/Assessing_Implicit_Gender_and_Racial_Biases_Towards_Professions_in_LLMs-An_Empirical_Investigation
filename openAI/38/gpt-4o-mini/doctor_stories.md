Dr. Eleanor Grace Holloway stood in the dim light of the hospital’s old staff lounge, a mug of lukewarm coffee clutched between her hands. The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting erratic shadows against the faded walls adorned with peeling posters of long-forgotten health campaigns. Outside, the rain tapped a steady rhythm against the windows, creating a somber soundtrack to the evening shift.

St. Jude’s Medical Center was a relic of its time, a sprawling structure that had weathered decades of change, both in medicine and in the world outside its walls. Despite its outdated facilities, it was a sanctuary for Eleanor. Here, she felt a sense of purpose amid the chaos of sirens and the frantic rush of gurneys she navigated with practiced ease.

Tonight, Eleanor’s mind was particularly heavy. A week had passed since her encounter with a patient whose death weighed on her, and though she had poured her heart into a valiant fight to save him, she remained haunted by the thought that perhaps she could have done more. As she took a sip of the bitter coffee, she resolved not to allow doubt to cloud her judgement; instead, she would let it fuel her determination to push through the challenges ahead.

With a deep breath, Dr. Holloway straightened her white coat, brushed a strand of dark hair away from her face, and stepped out of the lounge into the bustling corridors of the hospital. The smell of antiseptic filled her nostrils, mingling with the faint scent of rain that wafted in through the doors as staff and patients drifted through the hallways like specters of hope and despair. She was ready to face whatever awaited her in the emergency ward, where each ticking second felt like a heartbeat—urgent, alive, and irrevocably pushing forward.
