Under the fluorescent lights of St. Jude’s Hospital, the antiseptic scent mingled with the faint notes of lavender from a handmade air freshener hung near the nurse's station. The sound of bustling footsteps echoed in the hallway, accompanied by the soft beeping of monitors keeping vigil over their patients. The waiting room, filled with tired children and anxious parents, flickered under the glow of the television playing a repetitive loop of daytime talk shows.

In the back corner of the lab, where the city’s noise faded into a dull hum, sat Evelyn Grace Harper—a dedicated phlebotomist known for her steady hand and gentle demeanor. With her hair pinned back in a loose bun and a crisp white lab coat draped over her shoulders, she maneuvered within her small domain, organizing her instruments with meticulous care. 

Evelyn stood at the blood draw station, her heart beating in sync with the rhythmic pulse of the hospital. Today was different. The sun breaking through the clouds was a rare occurrence in late November, casting a warm glow through the small window. Just two days ago, she had received a peculiar call—an urgent request for blood samples from an unknown research agency. What was it they were studying? The mystery tugged at her curiosity, even as she took a deep breath and prepared for her next patient. Little did she know that with every vial she filled, she was stepping into a web of secrets that could change everything she thought she knew about her work, her patients, and herself.
