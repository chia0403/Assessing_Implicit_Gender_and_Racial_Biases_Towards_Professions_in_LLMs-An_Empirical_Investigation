In the heart of Charleston, South Carolina, where the cobblestone streets whispered tales of the past and the air was perfumed with blooming jasmine, stood a quaint shop adorned with pastel shutters and hanging ferns. The sign above the door read “Embellishments by Edie,” an inviting promise of transformation and creativity. 

Evelyn Grace Hastings, known to her friends and clients simply as Edie, threaded her way through the vibrant marketplace. An interior decorator with an eye for the extraordinary, she thrived on the challenge of breathing life into forgotten spaces. Today, she was on her way to a new project—an old Victorian house that had seen better days but still held the beauty of its original craftsmanship beneath layers of dust and neglect.

As Edie stepped inside, the scent of musty wood and aged wallpaper greeted her like an old friend. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, casting playful shadows across the floorboards. Armed with a notepad, a trusty tape measure, and an overflowing bag of fabric swatches, she felt a familiar thrill racing through her veins. This house, with its crooked staircases and peeling paint, held secrets waiting to be unveiled. Edie’s mind bubbled with ideas, and she couldn’t wait to weave her magic, blending history and modern elegance into a tapestry of color and light.
