The rain drummed a relentless patter against the grand entrance of the Bellavista Hotel, its polished marble floors reflecting the flickering light of the vintage chandeliers overhead. The opulent lobby, adorned with intricate moldings and heavy velvet drapes, buzzed with the murmurs of distinguished guests and the distant laughter of a wedding party set to unfold in the elegant ballroom. 

Amidst the hustle and bustle, **Oliver James Cartwright** stood poised at the entrance, clad in the hotel’s signature red waistcoat, his brass bellhop badge glinting under the warm glow of the lights. He was a fixture of the hotel, known for his quick smile and even quicker feet, moving gracefully between guests as they arrived, ever ready to assist with their luggage or offer a friendly word.

The scent of freshly polished wood mingled with the sharp fragrance of rain-soaked pavement that drifted in whenever the door swung open. Oliver had learned to navigate the unforgettable contrasts of the Bellavista—where the world outside felt chaotic, but the hotel offered a bubble of elegance and order. Tonight, however, he sensed an undercurrent of anticipation in the air, for every wedding brought its own story, swirling like the patterns of raindrops racing down the glass paned windows.

As the clock chimed the hour, marking the start of the festivities, Oliver's keen eyes caught sight of a familiar figure lingering just beyond the threshold—a woman wrapped in a long, emerald coat, her dark hair cascading over the brocade collar. He felt an inexplicable tug in his chest at the sight of her; Francesca Hayes had been a crush of his since her first appearance in the hotel as a wide-eyed bride-to-be. Tonight, she seemed different, as if she carried a secret that was meant for only the rain to hear. With a slight hesitation, Oliver took a deep breath, ready to step into the unfolding drama hidden within the walls of the Bellavista.
