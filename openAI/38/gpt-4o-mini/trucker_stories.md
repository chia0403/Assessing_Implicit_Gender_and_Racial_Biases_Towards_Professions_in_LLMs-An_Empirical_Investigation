**Title: Miles to Go**

**Setting:** The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the open stretch of Interstate 40, where the flat expanse of desert gave way to rugged mountains in the distance. The hum of the highway blended with the distant sound of wind rustling through sagebrush. The air was tinged with the rich aroma of diesel and the promise of adventure, as a solitary eighteen-wheeler cut its way through the vastness, its headlights cutting a path into the encroaching twilight.

**Opening:** It was just past 6 PM when Jonathan "Johnny" Garrison flicked on his truck’s radio, settling into his favorite country station as the familiar tunes filled the cab of his rig. He adjusted his broad-brimmed hat, a relic from his father, and shifted in the worn leather seat, feeling the familiar vibrations of the engine beneath him. Johnny had been on the road for almost sixteen hours that day, the miles stretching before him like an endless ribbon of asphalt, but to him, that was just part of the job.

With a steaming cup of coffee in the cupholder beside him and the weight of the cargo secure in the trailer behind, he felt at home amidst the rhythmic swaying of the truck. For Johnny, the road was more than just a path to follow—it was a sanctuary. As a long-haul trucker, he'd learned to appreciate the solitude of the highway, the way it carved through the landscape, offering a window to a world that most only glimpsed through the windshield of their everyday lives.

He glanced down at the GPS, a flashing green line indicating his route to Albuquerque, where the bulk of his delivery awaited. Knowing he still had a few more hours of driving to go, his mind drifted back to the winding roads he had traveled, the countless towns he had passed through, and the stories that seemed to echo from every mile marker. Out here, alone in his rig, Johnny found comfort in the knowledge that the horizon held countless possibilities—for redemption, for new beginnings, or perhaps just the next cup of coffee at the next roadside diner. 

As the dusk deepened, stars flickered to life in the darkening sky, a reminder that no matter how long or lonely the journey felt, he was never truly alone.
