In the small coastal town of Havenbrook, where the salty breeze mingled with the sweet scent of blooming wisteria, Dr. Evelyn Grace Harmon had carved out a niche for herself—both as a healer and a community cornerstone. Her quaint chiropractic clinic, “Harmon Healing,” was nestled between a bustling café and a quaint bookstore, a place where the townsfolk would find relief from their ailments and a sense of belonging.

The clinic's interior was warm and inviting, adorned with soft, earthy tones and soothing artwork depicting tranquil ocean scenes. A collection of potted plants thrived in the sunlight that poured through the large windows, bringing life to the space. Dr. Harmon was known not just for her skillful adjustments but for her ability to listen, to empathize, and to understand the lives that shaped her patients' pain.

On a crisp early morning in late spring, the sun began to rise over the horizon, casting a golden light over Havenbrook. Evelyn adjusted the last of her seating arrangements in the waiting room, organizing magazines and fluffing pillows when she sensed that today would be different. As the doorbell jingled to announce the day's first visitor, she could feel an electric anticipation in the air—a feeling that would soon challenge everything she thought she knew about healing.
