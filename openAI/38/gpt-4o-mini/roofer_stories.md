Title: **Under the Shingles**

The sun had barely crested over the horizon, casting golden rays onto the sleepy town of Meadowridge. Beneath the vast, cloudless sky, the scent of fresh cedar and roofing tar mingled with the cool morning air. It was a typical autumn morning, where the leaves danced in shades of amber and rust, and the promise of a good day lay ahead, shimmering like the dew on the grassy lawns.

In the heart of this serene scene, perched atop a modest two-story house, was *Matthew Caleb Harrington*—a seasoned roofer known for his meticulous craftsmanship and easygoing demeanor. Clad in a faded flannel shirt and a well-worn baseball cap, Matt looked down at the world below, feeling at home among the shingles and rafters. His tanned hands moved deftly, securing the last few tiles on the roof while humming an old country tune. It was a music video set only in practical reality, the rhythm of working-man blues carried alongside the wake-up calls of birds.

He glanced out over the neighborhood, where early risers began their morning routines. Mrs. Abernathy from next door was watering her geraniums, while Mr. Thompson jogged past in his bright yellow track suit, looking far too energetic for the hour. Above it all, Matt marveled at how he could spend his days high above the mundane concerns of life, yet deeply connected to each of those lives down below. 

But today felt different. An unease pricked at the back of his mind, something he couldn’t quite shake as if the chill of the approaching winter whispered secrets from the eaves. Maybe it was just the weather—or perhaps it was the fraying edges of his own dreams intertwined with the sprawling tips of his job. With every nail he hammered in, he pressed closer to a decision that could change everything.
