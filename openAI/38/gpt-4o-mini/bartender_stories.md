**Title: Moonlit Whisky**

**Setting:** The Dusty Barrel, a hidden gem nestled in a cobblestone alley of New Orleans, where the faint glow of wrought iron lanterns casts warm shadows on the yellowing walls. Inside, the air is rich with the scent of aged oak, spiced rum, and the distant notes of jazz that waft through the room like a whispered secret. Stained glass windows filter the moonlight, creating a kaleidoscope of colors that dance across the polished mahogany bar.

**Opening:**

Evelyn Mae Carter wiped the counter with a well-worn cloth, the rhythmic sound of the fabric against the wood mixing with the low hum of conversation. The summer night was thick, the air electric with the promise of a storm that lingered just beyond the horizon. Outside, the streets were alive with the sounds of laughter and music, but inside The Dusty Barrel, it was the clink of glass and the hiss of pouring spirits that dominated the atmosphere.

Evelyn had learned the art of bartending from her father, a rugged man with a twinkle in his eye and a penchant for storytelling. Every night, as he mixed drinks, he spun tales of heartbreak and hope that wove through the very fabric of the bar. Now, in his absence, Evelyn stood behind the counter with a quiet confidence, pouring a generous measure of bourbon into a glass as if it contained all the bittersweet stories she had inherited.

With dark curls cascading down to her shoulders and a smudge of red lipstick that never seemed to fade—even after long shifts—Evelyn embodied the spirit of New Orleans. She served her patrons with a warm smile, her emerald green apron tied neatly around her waist, and an ever-present spark of mischief in her gaze. Yet behind that smile was a weight, a memory clawing at the edges of her heart like the summer humidity.

As the clock ticked toward midnight, the door creaked open, allowing a gust of wind to flutter through the bar, carrying the scent of rain and a sense of foreboding. Evelyn looked up, her fingers still deftly pouring, to see a figure silhouetted against the moonlight. Little did she know, this would be the night her world began to tilt on its axis—a night that would draw long-buried secrets out of the shadows and into the light.
