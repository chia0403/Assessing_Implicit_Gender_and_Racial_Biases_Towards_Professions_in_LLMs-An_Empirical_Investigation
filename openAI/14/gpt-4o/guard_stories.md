The cool morning mist clung to the ancient stones of Harrington Keep, a fortress perched defiantly on the cliffs overlooking the restless sea. Seagulls wheeled above, their harsh cries echoing off the weathered battlements. It was here, in the shadow of the towering turrets, that Eldric Stonefeld began his morning patrol. 

Eldric, a steadfast guard with salt-and-pepper hair and eyes as sharp as a hawk’s, had been devoted to his duty for over two decades. Standing tall in his dark tunic emblazoned with the royal emblem, he exuded an air of unyielding vigilance. Below him, the sea roared against the rocks, a reminder of the untamed nature just beyond the castle's walls. 

Harrington Keep, a place steeped in legend and history, was more than a mere fortress; it was a symbol of resilience. For centuries, it had stood as the final bastion against invading armies and treacherous storms. Its maze of corridors and hidden passageways held secrets long forgotten by all but the walls themselves.

As the first light of dawn painted the horizon with strokes of gold and rose, Eldric moved along the parapets, his footsteps steady and deliberate. He knew each stone, each shadow, as intimately as an old friend. The world around him was slowly waking, but Harrington Keep remained solemn and still in the morning light, its secrets safely guarded by Eldric’s watchful gaze.
