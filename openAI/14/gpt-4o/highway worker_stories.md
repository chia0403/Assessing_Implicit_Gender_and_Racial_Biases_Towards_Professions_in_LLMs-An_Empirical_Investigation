On the outskirts of the bustling city of Arden Heights, where the towering skyscrapers gradually gave way to open fields and dense patches of forest, the morning sun kissed the cool metal surface of the highway. The air was tinged with the earthy scent of freshly mown grass and distant fumes from a convoy of trucks as they rumbled along the endless stretch of pavement. On this particular autumn morning, with leaves painting the landscape in vibrant hues of red and gold, Ethan "EJ" Trenton stood clad in his high-visibility vest, surveying the road ahead. 

EJ, whose full name was Ethan James Trenton, was a seasoned highway worker with over fifteen years of hard-won experience logged beneath the vast, ever-changing sky. His work boots were scuffed and caked with the dust of countless hours spent in the field, and his hands bore the telltale marks of a life dedicated to maintaining the essential arteries of travel. 

The highway stretched before him like an unspooled ribbon, a testament to both progress and nature’s unstoppable force. This was EJ’s office, a place where time seemed to balance itself precariously between human order and the wild unpredictability of the elements. Though the solitude of the open highway was often his closest companion, today, the chirping of crickets in the grass provided a gentle soundtrack to the sound of distant traffic—a rhythmic cadence that kept him company as he set about his daily tasks. 

As EJ adjusted his hard hat and clipped his radio to his belt, the sun rose higher, casting long shadows behind him. He looked both ways out of habit, staring down the open road to the distant horizon where future challenges awaited—a vivid reminder of the endless journey and the vital work that lay ahead.
