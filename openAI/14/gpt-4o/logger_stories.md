In the heart of the sprawling Pacific Northwest, where the ancient cedar trees stood like silent sentinels under a sky perpetually cloaked in mist, there was a logging town named Timberline. The town, nestled in a valley carved by the relentless passage of time and water, was defined by its rhythm—the steady hum of chainsaws, the distant echo of falling giants, and the whisper of the wind through the evergreens.

James "Jim" Turlow, a seasoned logger with hands calloused by years of hard labor and a heart as steady as the towering trees he felled, had lived in Timberline all his life. The scent of pine sap and freshly cut wood was as familiar to him as the back of his own hand. Jim's day would begin before dawn, when the world was a tapestry of shadows and the forest held onto its mysteries beneath veils of fog.

He'd set out from his modest cabin at the edge of town, his boots crunching over the gravel path, his axe slung over his shoulder like a trusted old friend. The forest, ancient and unyielding, loomed ahead—a sea of green waves frozen in time. There, beneath the sullen skies and amidst the sprawling giants of Timberline, Jim Turlow would carve out his own place in the timeless dance of nature and man.
