On the outskirts of the bustling city of Riverton, where the skyline is dotted with skeletal skyscrapers in various stages of completion, Michael "Mick" Donovan began his day under the soft amber glow of the early morning sun. The air was crisp and smelled of wet earth mixed with the metallic tang of machinery, a scent he had grown both familiar and fond of over the years.

The construction site was a sprawling maze of steel beams and concrete slabs, buzzing with the symphony of drills and the rhythmic thud of hammers. Mick stood amidst it all, his silhouette framed against the towering crane that loomed in the background like a mechanical giant.

Mick had been a foreman at Donovan & Sons Construction for nearly a decade, a position that came with its own set of challenges and rewards. Today, as he surveyed the worksite, he couldn't shake a strange sense of anticipation, as if the day had decided to hold its breath, waiting for something significant to unfold.

Dressed in his usual attire — a high-visibility vest over a plaid flannel shirt, and a hard hat adorned with stickers of past projects — Mick exuded an air of authority and camaraderie, qualities that made him both respected and approachable among his crew. He was a man in his element, orchestrating the transformation of chaos into structure with a skill and dedication that was second nature.

Riverton was a city perpetually under construction, expanding and evolving like a living organism. And in this ever-changing landscape, Mick had carved out his own niche. To him, every building was a testament to human ambition, a physical manifestation of dreams cast in concrete and steel. As Mick walked the perimeter, ensuring everything was in order, he couldn't help but wonder what this new day on the job might bring.
