In the heart of the bustling metropolis of New Crestwood, where skyscrapers cast long shadows over crowded streets and the hum of the city seemed never to quiet, stood the stately yet aged Meridian Tower. This thirty-story monument of steel and glass was home to the city's most prestigious law offices, cutting-edge tech startups, and a vastly popular sky-high lounge that took on a different vibrancy after dark. Yet, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the denizens of the tower exited in waves, one figure remained steadfast amidst the ebb and flow of daily life.

Michael Hargrove was well-acquainted with Meridian Tower's hidden paths and forgotten corners. As the janitor, he wielded his keys with a precise familiarity, unlocking doors to rooms that held untold stories and secrets. Though his attire was simple—a navy jumpsuit with the telltale patch above his heart reading "Mike"—his presence was as vital to the building as the bricks and bolts that held it together. 

Every evening, he embarked on his rounds, pushing his trusty janitorial cart over polished tiles that reflected the myriad of soft glows from hidden lights above. To the occupants of the tower, he was often invisible, a quiet backdrop to their pivotal meetings and urgent phone calls. Yet to Michael, the building was alive with its own rhythm; the creak of the elevator cables, the soft hum of servers in tech suites, and the muted ticking of wall clocks counting down to the next bustling dawn. It was a place of magic and mystery—a silent cathedral of commerce and dreams. And within its confines, Michael Hargrove found his own sense of purpose and belonging, one night at a time.
