As the first rays of dawn yawned over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of soft pinks and oranges, Ava Sinclair stood at the gate of Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport, adjusting her navy-blue blazer and brushing an imaginary speck of dust from her sleeve. The morning was brisk, the air electric with the buzz of travelers scurrying about, eager to embark on adventures or return to the familiar embrace of home. 

Ava had always loved this part of the dayâ€”the symphony of rolling suitcase wheels, the harmonious blend of accents and languages, the collective anticipation of souls ready for takeoff. She was no stranger to this world between worlds, where a flight could mean new beginnings or bittersweet endings, and every passenger held a secret story she would never know.

A seasoned flight attendant with more than a decade of experience soaring above the clouds, Ava was known for her calm demeanor and warm smile, traits that had eased countless nervous flyers and endeared her to her colleagues. Today, however, as she checked her roster and greeted her fellow cabin crew, there was an unusual flutter of nervous excitement that danced in her chest. Flight 472 to Tokyo wasn't just another journey; it was the start of her new chapter.
