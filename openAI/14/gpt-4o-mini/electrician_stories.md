On the outskirts of the small town of Clearwater Ridge, where the pine trees whispered secrets to the wind and the river gurgled like a contented old man, a weathered blue truck rattled down a dirt road. Dust danced in the air behind it as the truck came to a halt beside an old wooden cabin, its paint peeling and its windows dusty from years of neglect. The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows that flickered over the garden, dotted with wildflowers and weeds alike.

As the engine’s hum faded, the door creaked open and out stepped Brock Timbers, a burly man in his late thirties with calloused hands and a thoughtful brow. His sun-kissed skin hinted at days spent in the open, and the tool belt slung around his waist clinked softly with the jingle of wrenches and wire cutters. Brock was no ordinary electrician; he was known in Clearwater Ridge for being able to coax life back into the most stubborn of circuits. For him, the work was more than just a job—it was a way to connect with the stories locked away in every building’s walls. 

Today’s job was a challenge he welcomed. The cabin had been abandoned for years, nestled between the tall pines. Rumor had it that it had once belonged to a recluse artist who infused her paintings with a strange magic, and as Brock adjusted his cap and surveyed the surroundings, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this place held remnants of that enchantment. Armed with his tools and an adventurous spirit, he stepped forward, ready to unlock whatever mysteries lay within.
