**Opening Scene:**

The sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, painting the upscale Cornelia Hotel in shades of gold and lavender. The grand entrance, a fusion of polished marble and lush greenery, buzzed with the vibrant energy of guests arriving and departing. In the midst of this orchestrated chaos, a soft chime rang as the bellhop’s cart rolled past the entrance, its brass bells jingling like laughter.

**Setting:**

Miles Adams stood at attention, his crisp uniform pressed sharply and a pristine cap perched atop his dark hair. He was tethered to the Cornelia Hotel like a string to a kite, navigating the world of guests, VIPs, and tourists who brought with them stories just as heavy as their luggage. The lobby's opulence was a sight to behold—glistening chandeliers casting intricate shadows on the marble floor, a fountain bubbling softly in the corner, and the scent of fresh orchids wafting through the air.

It was early evening; the hotel’s modern bar hummed with laughter and low jazz. Yet, even amidst the laughter, Miles felt the bite of anxiety tighten its grip around his chest. Tonight was the night of the annual fundraising gala, a whirlwind of diamonds, designer gowns, and the city's elite. As he adjusted his tie in the lobby mirror, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something monumental was about to unfold beneath the twinkling lights of the grand ballroom, something that would change the course of his life forever.
