In the shadow of the towering pine forests of northern California, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, mingling with the faint smell of diesel that lingered around the small truck stop on Highway 101. The early morning sun broke through the mist, casting a warm golden light over the cracked pavement, gleaming off the chrome of the big rigs parked haphazardly in the dusty lot. 

It was here, on a particularly brisk November morning, that Thomas Lee Weaver adjusted his cap, squinting as he stepped out of his 18-wheeler, “Big Green.” At six feet and broad-shouldered with a salt-and-pepper beard, Tom was a figure familiar to anyone who frequented this stretch of the highway. The battered truck, once bright green but now faded to a muted hue from years of wear, was a testament to his three decades on the road, a rolling sanctuary filled with the comforts of home—photographs tacked to the dashboard, a half-empty thermos of coffee resting in the cup holder, and a well-worn plaid blanket tucked away behind the passenger seat.

As he walked toward the diner, his boots crunching on the gravel, Tom’s thoughts drifted back to the fateful run he’d made last week—a long haul from San Diego to Seattle that had nearly turned the usually mundane rhythm of his life upside down. A mysterious encounter at a rest area had set his heart racing and his mind racing faster. Now, with another load to deliver to a warehouse in Oregon, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the road would bring surprises yet again. Little did he know, the next few days would test his resolve and push him into a world he never expected to encounter amidst the hum of engines and the solitude of endless highways.
