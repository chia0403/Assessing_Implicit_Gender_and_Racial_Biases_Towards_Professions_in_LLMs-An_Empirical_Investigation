**Title: Whispers in the Attic**

**Setting:**

The sun dipped low over the quaint New England town of Eldridge Hollow, painting the sky in hues of orange and violet. The town nestled between rolling hills was home to a collection of charming Victorian houses, each with its own stories etched in the weathered wood. One such house stood at the end of Maple Avenue, its faded blue shutters framing tall, arched windows like old eyes peering into the past. Ivy curled around the porch posts, and the creaking steps hinted at the history contained within. It was here that Clara Mae Wiggins began her day, her routine as familiar as the scent of old leather and dust that filled each sunbeam.

As she entered the grand foyer, Clara adjusted her fraying apron, the fabric a patchwork of years spent tending to this house's needs. The floors were polished to a shine, reflecting the remnants of the fine furniture that had seen better days. Clara had a knack for bringing warmth to the cold spaces, and though she didn’t own the house, she often felt like its heart. Young and spry at thirty-five, she had taken on the role of housekeeper for the Hartman family with a quiet determination that belied her humble beginnings.

**Opening:**

Clara Mae Wiggins paused at the bottom of the staircase, her worn shoes whispering against the polished wood. It was a Saturday afternoon, a time when the hustle of the weekdays lingered in the air like the dust motes dancing in the sunlight. The soft tick of the grandfather clock echoed, a reminder that time marched on in this old house, even as Clara often felt trapped in its patterns.

"Just a quick tidy-up before the weekend," she murmured to herself, eyeing the clutter that always seemed to accumulate in every corner. But even as she spoke those words, a curiosity tugged at her. She was drawn to the faint sound of rustling that seemed to drift from the attic above—a sound she had dismissed countless times as the scurry of unseen creatures. Today, however, felt different, almost urgent. It was as if the house itself was beckoning her, whispering secrets hidden in the shadows. 

Clara hesitated, her heart pulsing with a blend of fear and intrigue. Deep down, she held an inkling that the attic harbored not just old trunks and forgotten memories, but perhaps a piece of the very heart of the Hartman family—one that was long buried and desperately in need of discovery. Wiping her hands nervously on her apron, she took a deep breath and made her decision. Today, she would uncover the whispers of the attic.
