**Title: The Adjustment**

**Setting:** A quaint town nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, Clearwater Springs is known for its picturesque landscapes and a close-knit community. The town's main street is lined with charming brick buildings, each with its own story to tell. In the center of it all stands "Harmony Chiropractic," a cozy clinic with large windows adorned with cheerful potted plants and soft yellow curtains fluttering in the gentle breeze. The air is filled with the faint scent of lavender and eucalyptus, soothing scents that welcome patients the moment they step inside.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Lydia Carter adjusted the framed certificate on her office wall for the hundredth time, the corners stubbornly curling despite her efforts to keep them straightened. It was a small victory in her otherwise chaotic morning—a morning that had begun far too early with a symphony of chirping birds announcing the arrival of another crisp autumn day in Clearwater Springs. As she peered outside her window, she watched the sun rise behind the hills, bathing the town in shades of amber and gold, a stark contrast to the anxious energy swirling inside her.

Evelyn had always believed in the healing power of touch, in the art of alignment, not just of bones but of lives. The clinking of her coffee cup against the ceramic saucer snapped her back to reality, the warm drink cradled between her hands as she turned her attention to the day's first patient—a local artist named Marvin whose recent neck pain had begun to interfere with his vibrant brushstrokes.

With a practiced smile, she placed the cup down, ready to mend not only muscles and joints but the spirit of each individual who crossed her threshold. Little did she know, today would bring more than just physical adjustments; it would uncover hidden truths that would twist and turn like the very spine she sought to align.
