Underneath the sprawling boughs of ancient oaks, the crisp autumn air carried the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. The sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the expansive grounds of Ashwood Manor, a crumbling estate that had stood for over a century, its once-gleaming facade now tangled in ivy and secrets. As the vibrant hues of sunset painted the sky, the estate was slowly surrendering to nature’s embrace, and with it, the echoes of forgotten laughter and whispered promises.

In the heart of this fading grandeur worked Thomas Alistair Grey, the last of Ashwood Manor’s groundskeepers. A man of simple means and profound connection to the land, Thomas had spent nearly two decades tending to the sprawling gardens, meticulously manicuring the hedges, mowing the lawns, and coaxing blooms from the stubborn earth. With his calloused hands and sun-kissed skin, he appeared at one with the very soil he nurtured. He had inherited this position from his father, a man whose unwavering dedication to Ashwood's beauty had instilled in Thomas a fierce loyalty to the estate and its haunting history.

Tonight, as the twilight deepened, Thomas paused in his work, leaning on his weathered spade. His gaze wandered across the lawn to the decaying stone fountain at the center of the garden, where water no longer flowed and where shadows danced eerily in the dim light. While the residents of the nearby village whispered tales of the manor's ghosts and benevolent spirits, Thomas offered only silent gratitude to those who came before him, tending to the grounds on behalf of those who could no longer do so themselves. For him, Ashwood Manor was not merely a workplace; it was a memory, a legacy, and perhaps, a sanctuary for troubled souls—both living and departed.

As he resumed his task of gathering fallen leaves, a rustling sound from the thick underbrush broke his concentration. Thomas straightened up, the chill of the evening air prickling the back of his neck. He wasn't alone, and even in the serene setting of Ashwood, he felt the pulse of something mysterious stir beneath the surface of his tranquil existence.
