The sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm golden hue across the vast expanse of the Nevada desert. Dust danced in the gentle morning breeze, swirling around the skeletal remains of old roadside signs, their letters faded and peeling. A solitary stretch of highway, cracked and lined with sagebrush, unwound like a ribbon of promise, leading nowhere and everywhere at once. Here, in this desolate place, the hum of tireless machinery blended with the symphony of nature—a melody only a highway worker could appreciate.

As the day began, 35-year-old Thomas Edwin Hargrove tightened the straps on his reflective vest and adjusted the brim of his worn baseball cap. Thomas had spent the better part of a decade maintaining these highways, patching potholes, mowing the overgrown grass, and painting the lines that guided weary travelers through the land. His hands were calloused, his skin sun-kissed and weathered, evidence of countless hours spent under the relentless desert sun. 

Today, he was tasked with resurfacing the stretch of Route 66 that had fallen victim to years of neglect, its once-vibrant blacktop now a ghostly gray. As he surveyed the long, winding road ahead, Thomas felt a familiar mixture of pride and solitude. The open road was his canvas, and every mile he tended was a small part of a much larger story—a story of journeys, of families, of lives intersecting for brief moments. But despite the beauty of the morning, today felt different. An unsettling weight hung in the air, as if the desert itself held its breath, waiting for something to unfold.
