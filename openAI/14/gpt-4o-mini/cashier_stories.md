**Title: The Last Shift**

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights hummed softly overhead, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of Waverly Grocery Mart—a small, local supermarket nestled in the heart of a town where everyone knew each other's names. The floors were a faded linoleum, scuffed from years of shopping carts and hurried footsteps. Outside, a light rain drizzled down, tapping rhythmically against the large glass windows and sending a fresh, earthy scent wafting through the air.

**Story Opening:**

Colette Marie Thompson adjusted her name tag—“Colette” in bright, cheerful letters—before glancing at the clock above the checkout counter. It was 6:47 PM on a Friday evening, and the store was already starting to wind down for the weekend, with fewer customers filtering in. She sighed, her breath misting the air in front of her as she counted the last few minutes of her shift. 

As a cashier, Colette had learned to read people like a book; she could tell a lot about a customer from the way they approached the counter. The hurried ones who gripped their carts as if they might take flight at any moment, the cheerful lunchbox-toting moms, the elderly gentlemen who spent more time reminiscing about the “good old days” than actually checking out their groceries. That day, she had rung up the same customers she’d seen for years, each exchange becoming a thread woven into the tapestry of her everyday life.

But as the clock ticked ever closer to 7:00 PM, a puzzling feeling settled in the pit of Colette’s stomach. It was just a shift like any other, yet something felt different. She couldn't shake the notion that tonight would change everything.
