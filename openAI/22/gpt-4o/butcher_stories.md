On the outskirts of Elmbrook, where the cobblestone streets met the dense embrace of the ancient forest, stood a timeworn building: Whitlock's Butchery. The morning sun had just begun to pierce through the low-hanging fog, casting a soft glow on the frosted windows of the shop. It was here, amidst the earthy aroma of cedar and the distant murmur of the woodland, that Laurence "Larry" Whitlock began his day.

Inside the butchery, the air was cool, redolent with the mingling scents of fresh herbs and cured meats. The walls were lined with dark wood paneling, each scarred imperfection whispering tales of the generations that had stood there before. Gleaming steel hooks hung in neat rows, and the large oak counter, polished to a warm sheen by years of service, was ready to welcome the dayâ€™s patrons.

Larry, a man of sturdy build with hands calloused from years of labor, moved with practiced efficiency. His father, and his father before him, had worked the very same space, and now, at the age of forty-five, Larry wore the Whitlock legacy like the well-worn apron tied around his waist. There was a quiet pride in maintaining the traditions of his forebears, a lineage as unbroken as the swath of land behind the shop where the morning sun continued its quiet ascent.

As the village began to stir to life, Larry lit the old brass lantern in the window, signaling the start of the day and welcoming the first visitors. With a gentle smile, he adjusted his apron and prepared to greet Elmbrook with its daily provisions, each cut and preparation gifted with attention, like his father had taught him so many years ago.
