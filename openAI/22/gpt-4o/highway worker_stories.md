Title: Beneath Endless Skies

In the early light of dawn, the vast stretch of Route 17 glistened under a thin veil of morning dew. A cool breeze whispered through the open fields, carrying with it the earthy scent of freshly turned soil. The faint hum of distant traffic provided a gentle reminder of the world beyond the horizon, though out here, it seemed to belong to another universe altogether.

Thomas Ezekiel Barnes, known to most as Tom, tightened his grip around his steaming thermos cup, watching his breath dance in the crisp air. As the sun climbed slowly over the patchwork of golden cornfields and sleeping towns, its rays painted the asphalt in shades of saffron and rose, casting long shadows that flickered like ghosts across the empty highway.

For Tom, who had spent the past twenty years patching and painting miles of roadway, these quiet minutes before the shift began were a sacred ritual, a moment of peace before the world roared awake and the day descended into a chaos of heavy machinery and echoing voices.

He took a deep sip of his coffee, letting its warmth seep through him, before setting the thermos down on the hood of his dusty truck, a reliable companion that had carried him through countless days like this one. The familiar rumble of an approaching vehicle signaled the arrival of his team, who would soon join him in a synchronized dance of orange vests and reflective tape as they worked to mend the scars that life and weather had etched into the winding ribbon of road.

Here, amidst the rhythmic thud of jackhammers and the sharp smell of tar, Tom found his purpose. Beneath the endless sky, where the highway unfolded like a promise, he crafted a path for travelers whose names he would never know but whose journeys he cherished all the same.
