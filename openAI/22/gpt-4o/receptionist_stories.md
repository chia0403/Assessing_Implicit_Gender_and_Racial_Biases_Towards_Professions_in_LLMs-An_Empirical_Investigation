Title: **Whispers at Evergreen Lodge**

In the heart of Vermont, nestled amid a vast expanse of towering pines and sleepy, rolling hills, stood the Evergreen Lodge. The building, with its rustic wooden facade and large stone chimney, had long been a refuge for weary travelers seeking solace in natureâ€™s embrace. The scent of pine and fresh earth permeated the air, offering an immediate sense of tranquility to anyone who crossed its threshold.

At the front desk, a polished mahogany structure adorned with seasonal flowers, sat Lily Carver. With chestnut hair pulled back neatly into a bun and an ever-present, warm smile, Lily embodied the welcoming spirit of the lodge. Her cheerful demeanor was famous among guests, as was her uncanny ability to remember every detail of their past visits.

The soft glow of lamps cast a gentle light over the reception area, where she sat reviewing the reservations for the weekend. It was the beginning of autumn, and a kaleidoscope of crimson and gold leaves danced gracefully down the mountain, drawing an influx of leaf-peepers and hikers eager to explore the vibrant landscape.

Lily cherished these early morning hours, when the lodge was still and serene, save for the quiet crackling of the fireplace and the occasional breeze whispering secrets through the tall trees outside. Her mornings started with aligning the little details that would create memorable experiences for her guests. Yet, as she stacked guides to local trails beside the complimentary cider station, she had no inkling of the mysterious events ready to unfold that weekend at the Evergreen Lodge.
