On a brisk autumn morning, the sun struggled to pierce through the dense blanket of gray clouds that hovered above Cedar Grove. The air was crisp, tinged with the earthy scent of fallen leaves that carpeted the small town’s streets. The gentle hum of life was just stirring when Eric Mitchell stepped out of his modest two-story house, pausing briefly on the porch to admire the vivid tapestry of reds and golds that draped the big maple tree in his front yard.

Eric was the heart and soul of Mitchell’s Auto Repair, a small garage tucked away on the corner of Main Street, where the old railroad tracks used to run. The garage, a modest weather-beaten structure, wore its decades with dignity, its tin roof gleaming as the occasional burst of sunlight broke through the cloud cover. The sign above the door—hand-painted and repaired more times than Eric cared to remember—creaked softly in the breeze, adding to the gentle soundtrack of Cedar Grove morning.

As Eric walked past the pumpkin patch neighboring his yard, his gait was relaxed but purposeful, the walk of a man who found comfort in routine and solace in solving mechanical puzzles. His toolbox, a faithful steel companion, swung lightly in his hand as he made his way down the cobblestone path leading to the garage.

Inside the garage, the familiar scent of motor oil and gasoline enveloped him. The walls were lined with tools that held stories of their own, each one meticulously placed in its designated spot. A classic blue pick-up truck, battered but beloved, rested patiently in the center of the garage, awaiting Eric’s attention. Customers called it “Old Blue,” a name that suited the truck’s enduring charm.

As he rolled up his sleeves, Eric Mitchell became one with his surroundings—a mechanic whose craft thrived in the symphony of ratchets clinking, engines rumbling, and the occasional exhalation of compressed air. This was his domain, where every nut tightened, and every bolt fastened brought him closer to the sense of quiet satisfaction that only the hum of a finely tuned engine could offer.
