**Title: Miles to Go**

**Setting:** The sun hung low on the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the sprawling plains of Nebraska. The air was rich with the smell of fresh earth and wildflowers, mingling with the faint scent of diesel fumes. A long stretch of highway—Endless Highway 83—wound its way through the landscape, interrupted only by occasional clusters of tall, swaying grass and the distant silhouette of farmhouses. The sound of tires rolling over asphalt filled the air as the rhythmic hum of a diesel engine broke the tranquil stillness.

**Opening:**
Liam Alexander Hayes leaned back in the worn leather seat of his trusty Kenworth, the "Midnight Rider." The cabin’s sun-warmed dashboard was littered with an assortment of trucker paraphernalia: a faded map crammed into the glove compartment, a well-used CB radio crackling softly with chatter, and a half-eaten sandwich wrapped in crinkled paper resting precariously on the scramble of receipts that littered the passenger seat. 

At forty-two, Liam had spent more days on the road than he could count, a nomad of sorts, wandering from state to state in search of the next big haul. The freedom of the open road was his solace, but it was also laced with an ever-persistent loneliness. He often thought about life back home in Omaha—a home that felt more like a distant memory than a place of refuge.

As he took a swig from his thermos filled with lukewarm coffee, he watched the sun retreat behind the horizon, spilling vibrant shades of orange and pink across the sky. The glow was a reminder that another day was slipping away, yet for Liam, the night was just beginning. With an empty trailer behind him and a fresh load waiting for pickup in Colorado, the only thing that mattered was the road ahead.
