In the shadow of the towering radio antennas that pierced the autumn sky like skeletal fingers, the small town of Crestwood hummed with an anticipation that mirrored the crackling static in the air. It was here, beneath the ever-watchful gaze of the mountains that loomed beyond the horizon, that the life of Oliver James Caldwell unfolded in a symphony of frequencies and signals. 

Oliver was not just any radio technician; he was the heartbeat of the old station that had been passed down through generations, his hands skilled in the delicate dance of circuitry and wires. The station came alive each day as he adjusted dials, replaced tubes, and listened intently to the whispers of the ether. The air smelled of dust and metal, and the walls were lined with relics of a bygone era—wooden cabinets filled with vintage receivers and charts tracking the radio wave patterns that had once connected the town to the wider world.

As he bent over a collection of old equipment in the dim light of the workshop, Oliver felt the crunch of autumn leaves underfoot outside, signaling the arrival of Halloween eve. It was a night often filled with tales of mystery and ghostly apparitions in Crestwood, but for Oliver, the real magic lay in the unseen connections he forged with the world through sound. Little did he know, however, that this particular evening would unveil a signal unlike any he had encountered before—a call that would echo through the very fabric of his life and awaken secrets buried deep within the static.
