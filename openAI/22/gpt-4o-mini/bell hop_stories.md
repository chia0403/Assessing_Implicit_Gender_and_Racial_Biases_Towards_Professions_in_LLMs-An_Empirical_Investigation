The ornate lobby of the Grand Luminous Hotel gleamed under the chandeleers, where echoes of laughter and the soft strum of a distant harp filled the air. A cool breeze whispered through the open entrance, carrying with it the scent of the sea, mingling with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the adjoining café. The marble floors glistened, reflecting the vibrant colors of the plush velvet drapes that framed the large windows.

In the midst of this elegant chaos, Raynor James Mitchell adjusted his crisp, gold-trimmed uniform, his name tag gleaming like a badge of honor on his chest. At just twenty-three, Raynor was a bellhop with aspirations that reached much higher than simply wheeling luggage to and from guest rooms. With tousled chestnut hair that perpetually fell over his forehead, he made his way through the hotel, a practiced smile plastered on his face, ready to assist the never-ending stream of affluent guests.

As he navigated between the towering potted palms and upholstered seating arrangements, he overheard snippets of conversations—business deals, clandestine affairs, dreams of grandeur. To Raynor, the hotel was a living tapestry of lives intertwined, secrets held within its walls, and he, a silent steward of these stories. His heart beat in time with the pulse of the hotel, eager to uncover the mysteries that lingered just beyond the polished surface of luxury. Today, however, felt different. There was an electric charge in the air, as if it were a harbinger of the unexpected. And Raynor was determined to find out what it would bring.
