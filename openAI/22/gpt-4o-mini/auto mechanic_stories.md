In the small, sun-drenched town of Riverton, where the scent of blooming wildflowers mingled with the tang of motor oil, James "Jimmy" Caldwell wiped the sweat from his brow as he knelt beside a rusted pickup truck in his garage. Caldwell’s Auto Repair was a humble but well-loved establishment, a haven for both weary vehicles and the locals who depended on his skillful hands. 

The garage was a cacophony of clanging tools and the rhythmic whirr of overhead fans cooling the sweltering midday heat. Neon signs flickered with slogans like “We Fix What Your Ex Broke” and “Broke? Let’s Make It Roadworthy!” The walls were adorned with photographs of classic cars and trophies from local races, testament to Jimmy’s passion for mechanics and his unwavering dedication to his craft.

Though he wore a grease-stained white tank top, Jimmy carried an air of quiet confidence. His hands, calloused yet gentle, expertly maneuvered sockets and wrenches with the precision of a pianist at a grand piano. He had inherited the shop from his father, who had taught him not just the trade, but the importance of integrity and hard work. Now, as the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the floor, Jimmy was ready to tackle the latest challenge: transforming an ancient, sputtering rust bucket into a dependable companion for its owner.

Unbeknownst to him, the arrival of an unexpected customer was about to disrupt his routine and send his life skidding down a new, thrilling path.
