The rain drummed a steady rhythm against the grimy windowpanes of Cormac Elias Thorne's office, creating a melancholic symphony that mirrored the city outside. Neon lights flickered intermittently, their colors bleeding into the puddles forming in the alleyways below. It was a late October evening in New Avalon, a city where shadows had substance and secrets lay thick, like the fog that rolled in from the bay.

Cormac leaned back in his worn leather chair, its creaking a familiar companion to his thoughts. The faint aroma of stale coffee mingled with the scent of wet asphalt, a reminder of long nights spent sifting through the underbelly of society. He ran a hand through his tousled dark hair, the beginnings of worry lines etching themselves into his brow. Just three days ago, the phone had rung with a case that felt more dangerous than usual—a missing person, it had claimed, but with every word spoken, an undercurrent of dread pulled at his gut.

The luminous sign of Malachi's Bar across the street promised warmth and whiskey, and it beckoned to him like a siren’s call. But there would be no comfort tonight. A sense of urgency pressed against his chest, driving him to unravel the threads of a mystery that had already begun weaving shadows into his life. He could almost hear the whisper of the city as it begged him to delve deeper, to emerge into a world where danger lurked just out of sight and the truth was nothing more than a fleeting shadow.

With a sigh, Cormac rose from his chair and grabbed his soaked trench coat from the rack, pulling it on with a relaxed urgency. There was no rest for the weary in New Avalon, and his instincts told him that whatever lay ahead would demand every ounce of his wits—and perhaps even more than that.
