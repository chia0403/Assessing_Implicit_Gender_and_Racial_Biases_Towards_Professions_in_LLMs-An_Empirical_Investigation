Title: **The Last Sample**

Setting: The story unfolds in the bustling city of Silverwood, a place where old brick buildings stand proudly alongside sleek, modern architecture. The veins of the city pulse with life, mirroring the veins of its inhabitants. The local hospital, a sprawling facility known as St. Augustine’s Medical Center, buzzes with the sound of rolling gurneys and the chatter of doctors and nurses. Inside the dimly lit phlebotomy lab, fluorescent lights flicker above rows of neatly arranged supplies—hypodermic needles, vials, and sterile gauze. The sterile scent of antiseptic hangs heavily in the air, a reminder of the critical nature of the work conducted within these four walls.

Opening: 

On a particularly crisp autumn morning, the first golden rays of sun filtered through the high windows of the phlebotomy lab, casting a warm glow on the metallic instruments that lined the countertop. As she prepared for yet another day of drawing blood, Charissa Lynne Mercer tied her long, dark hair into a practical bun, her fingers deftly maneuvering the elastic band with a familiarity born of routine. Her steel-blue scrubs fit snugly, a badge of her commitment to her craft. Charissa was no stranger to the sights and sounds of the hospital; she had been a phlebotomist at St. Augustine’s for nearly three years, deriving a sense of purpose from her work.

Today, however, felt different. There was a tangible energy in the air, almost electric, and Charissa could sense it as she flipped on the machines. The faint hum of the centrifuge mingled with the crisp rustle of paperwork in the corner, where a new intern was fumbling nervously. Charissa’s eyes flickered towards the intern, her heart swelling with empathy; she remembered her own first day, the whirlwind of uncertainty and excitement. 

As she wiped down her workspace, Charissa couldn't shake the feeling that somewhere ahead, in the seemingly endless stream of patients, lay not just another routine blood draw, but a moment that could change everything. The day had barely begun, but deep within her intuition, a whisper cautioned: be ready for the unexpected.
