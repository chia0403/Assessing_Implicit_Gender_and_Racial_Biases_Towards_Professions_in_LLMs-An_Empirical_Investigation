**Setting:** The quaint coastal town of Seabrook, known for its picturesque cliffs and serene beaches. The air is filled with the salty scent of the ocean, and the streets are lined with charming boutiques, cozy cafes, and a handful of welcoming dental practices. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the town as the waves crash gently against the shore.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne adjusted her glasses and peered down the hallway of her dental practice, Seabrook Smiles. The walls were adorned with cheerful nautical-themed decorations—seashells and watercolor paintings of the vibrant seaside—intended to calm her little patients. It was a sunny Thursday, and the faint sound of ocean waves was a constant reminder of the life beyond her office. 

Evelyn loved this town and its quirky charm, but lately, the peaceful rhythm of her days had been overshadowed by an unsettling feeling. The townsfolk, those familiar faces she had come to know so well, were starting to gossip, their whispers carried on the breeze as they passed her window. They spoke of strange occurrences along the beach—items disappearing, shadows lurking at dusk, and an inexplicable chill that seemed to haunt the seaside.

Today, just as she was about to call in her next patient, a figure appeared at the door. It was a little girl, no older than seven, with wide, frightened eyes and a missing front tooth. She held a plush dolphin in her arms, its color faded from countless adventures. Evelyn smiled gently, knelt down, and asked, “What’s your name, sweetie?”

“Callie,” the girl replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “I need a check-up... but I’m scared.”

Evelyn’s heart ached as she noticed the tremor in Callie’s hands. “You’re in good hands, Callie. We’ll take it one step at a time, okay?” As she led the girl into the examination room, Evelyn couldn’t shake off the feeling that today would unveil more than just cavities; something deeper was brewing in the heart of Seabrook, and it seemed that Callie might hold the first clue.
