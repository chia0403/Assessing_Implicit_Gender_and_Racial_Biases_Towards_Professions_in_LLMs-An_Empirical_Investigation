**Title: Echoes of the Mind**

**Setting:**  
Nestled in a quiet corner of a bustling city, Dr. Eliza Mae Carter's office occupies the top floor of an old brick building, its large windows offering a panoramic view of the skyline, where the urban chaos meets the serenity of the setting sun. Inside, the walls are a warm, muted gray, adorned with calming artwork that reflects her passion for nature. A plush, sage-green couch occupies the center of the room, flanked by a small bookshelf loaded with well-thumbed volumes on psychology, philosophy, and poetry. The faint sound of city life drifts in, blending seamlessly with the soft instrumental music playing in the background, creating an atmosphere of tranquility—an oasis for those seeking solace from their inner turmoil.

**Opening:**  
Dr. Eliza Mae Carter glanced at the clock on the wall, its hands inching ever closer to the hour. She could hear the gentle hum of traffic outside, a reminder of the world that continued to whir on, even as her patients arrived one by one, each carrying the weight of their unspoken struggles. Today felt different, though. As she rearranged the cushions on her couch, her mind wandered to the case notes stacked neatly on her desk—a puzzling tapestry of minds intertwined with threads of trauma, depression, and fear. 

A soft knock at the door broke her reverie. She inhaled slowly, centering herself before calling out, "Come in." As the door creaked open, a young woman stepped inside, her expression a mixture of hope and apprehension. Eliza smiled warmly, motioning to the couch. "Welcome. I’m Dr. Carter. Why don’t we start by talking about what brought you here today?" 

Little did Eliza know, this session would unravel a mystery that reached far beyond the confines of her office, echoing haunting truths that demanded to be confronted—not just for her patient, but for herself as well.
