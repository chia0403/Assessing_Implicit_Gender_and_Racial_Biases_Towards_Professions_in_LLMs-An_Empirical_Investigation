The dawn broke softly over the small coastal village of Alderwood, casting a warm golden hue that glistened upon the quiet harbor. The sound of waves lapping gently against the docks was accompanied by the occasional cry of gulls soaring above, heralding the day's promise. Nestled among the quaint, weathered cottages, one house stood out—an old Victorian with lavender-painted shutters, its once-vibrant exterior now softened by time.

Inside, the fragrance of fresh lavender intertwined with the salty sea air, as Eleanor Mayfield, the housekeeper, stirred awake in her small attic room. With a sigh, she glanced out the window where the sky brushed with shades of peach and lavender mirrored the blooms thriving in the garden below. At fifty-eight, Eleanor had a lifetime of experience etched into her skin, mirrored in the genteel lines of her face. Her chestnut hair, streaked with silver, was usually pulled back into a simple bun, and her favorite apron—faded but meticulously kept—was already draped over her chair, ready for another day.

Eleanor was more than just a housekeeper; she was the quiet custodian of the memories contained within the Victorian’s walls. Each creak of the floorboards beneath her worn shoes whispered secrets of the past, and with every polished window, she restored a piece of the home's dignity. But today felt different. As the first rays of sun spilled over Alderwood, Eleanor sensed a stirring in her heart, an unshakable feeling that the day ahead would unravel a story she had been a part of—and perhaps a part of her own she had kept hidden for too long.
