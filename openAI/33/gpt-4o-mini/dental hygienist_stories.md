**Title: The Plaque Behind the Smile**

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Seabrook, known for its picturesque beaches and charming Victorian houses, bustled with the warm energy of summer. The salty breeze carried with it the laughter of children playing on the sand and the distant sound of seagulls invoking a sense of nostalgia. At the center of this quaint town stood Dr. Ethan Calloway’s Dental Practice, a cozy, whitewashed building adorned with turquoise shutters and a welcoming sign that read, “Keep Smiling!” 

**Opening:** 

As the sun rose over Seabrook, casting golden rays through the dental office windows, Clara Jean Thompson arrived early for her shift, her canvas tote bag slung over her shoulder. Clara was a dedicated dental hygienist, known for her unparalleled attention to detail and her passion for oral health. With her bustling red curls and freckles that danced across her cheeks, she had an infectious energy that lightened the mood in the office.

Clara stepped into the practice, the familiar scent of minty toothpaste and antiseptic greeting her like an old friend. The walls were adorned with cheerful children’s drawings, the most recent masterpiece—a crayon sketch of an oversized tooth with a superhero cape—hung proudly on the bulletin board. It perfectly encapsulated Clara's love for her job; she wanted every patient, especially the children, to feel happy and empowered about their dental health.

As she organized the sterilization area, her mind drifted to the beach plans she had with her friends later that afternoon. But as the day unfolded, what initially seemed like a typical workday would soon take an unexpected turn, leading her into a mystery that intertwined her passion with the secrets buried beneath Seabrook’s sandy shores. 

Little did Clara know, a hidden world lay beneath the smiles she so diligently cared for, one that would challenge everything she believed about her quaint town and her role within it.
