In the early hours of a chilly November morning, the small coastal town of Port Haven lay shrouded in a soft blanket of fog. The salty scent of the sea mingled with the crispness in the air, while the distant sound of waves crashing against rugged cliffs resonated through the stillness. The old lighthouse, its paint peeling and windows clouded, stood as a sentinel on the rocky shore, its beam casting a flickering light across the relentless sea.

In a modest workshop tucked away behind the quaint homes lining the waterfront, Edison James Calloway was already at work. A radio technician known for his uncanny ability to repair even the most damaged devices, Edison’s small space was a cluttered sanctuary filled with half-disassembled radios, wires coiled like serpents, and various knobs, dials, and antiquated gadgets. Pared-down shelves held stacks of manuals and sketches, all bearing the marks of his meticulous attention to detail. 

Edison, with his tousled chestnut hair and thick-rimmed glasses perched precariously on his nose, was hunched over a vintage radio, tools scattered around him like fallen leaves. He adjusted the knobs gently, listening intently for the faint crackle of a signal. For him, the morning felt charged with potential, a blank slate waiting for stories to share, voices of the distant world reaching his eager ears. Little did he know, this day would bring something entirely unexpected—an enigmatic frequency that would unravel mysteries he never dreamed existed.
