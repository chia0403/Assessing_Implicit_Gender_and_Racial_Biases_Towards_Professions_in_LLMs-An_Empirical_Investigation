In the heart of Eldermoor, where the ancient trees whispered secrets to each other and the mist danced lazily between the ancient stone walls of the forsaken castle, there stood a solitary figure framed against the dawn. The soft light of morning peeked over the jagged horizon, casting long shadows across the land, yet the guardsman remained vigilant, his eyes scanning the quiet surrounding forest.

This was the realm of Cedric Alaric Braxton, an earnest guard who had pledged his life to protect the remnants of a once-magnificent stronghold. Clad in weathered leather armor that had seen better days, Cedric's broad shoulders bore the weight of his duty with a definite air of resolve. The once-gilded insignia of the royal crest fashioning his chest was dulled by years of grime, yet it still shone with the remnants of honor that had been bestowed upon it.

The stone castle loomed over the village of Eldermoor like a slumbering giant, its towers piercing the low-hanging clouds. Cedric had often heard the stories spun by the villagers about the castle's past—the glory of its rulers, the grand feasts, and the love songs that had once echoed through its halls. Now, however, it was a lonely bastion of dust and decay, drawing whispers of ghosts wandering its corridors, yearning for the vibrant life that had long since ebbed away.

As the sun rose higher, the vibrant greens of the forest revealed themselves, but Cedric’s gaze remained unwavering, entranced by the silhouettes moving just beyond the tree line. The shadows of the past felt heavier today, as if they were beckoning him to unravel the mysteries held within both the castle’s walls and his own heart. Today was different; he could feel it in the air, thick with anticipation, as if the world was holding its breath for what he could not yet see.
