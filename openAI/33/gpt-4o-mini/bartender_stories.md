**Title: Spirits of the Past**

**Setting:** The dimly lit bar, "The Velvet Tap," sat on the edge of a crumbling cobblestone street in a small coastal town. With its weathered wooden beams and velvet-draped chandeliers, the bar exuded an air of nostalgia, echoing the stories hidden within its walls. The sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore blended with the soft murmurs of patrons seeking solace in their drinks. The fragrance of aged whiskey and fresh lemon mingled in the air, creating a comforting backdrop for the city’s weary souls and wayward wanderers.

**Opening:** Behind the polished mahogany bar stood a figure with an easy smile and a watchful eye—Josephine "Josie" Monroe, a bartender with a knack for mixing drinks and mending broken spirits. At thirty-two, she had arms tattooed with swirling patterns of vines and flowers, each inked petal a tribute to the people who had passed through her life. On this particular evening, the golden light from the sconces flickered across her face as she expertly crafted a cocktail—her hands fluid and precise, a dance she had perfected over years of late shifts and whispered confessions.

Josie surveyed the bar with a practiced gaze, her dark curls pulled back into a messy bun, a few rebellious strands escaping to frame her expressive hazel eyes. Behind her, shelves lined with an array of bottles gleamed like liquid treasures, and each one held a story waiting to be told. Tonight, as the rain began to patter softly against the windowpanes, she could feel the air crackle with anticipation; an old friend was set to walk through the door, and for better or worse, it would change everything she thought she knew about the life she had built.
