The sun dipped low over the horizon, casting a golden glow across the bustling Los Angeles International Airport. The late afternoon sky transformed into a canvas of vibrant oranges and soft pinks, hinting at the promise of a gentle evening. Among the throngs of travelers shuffling through the terminal, a figure moved with purpose, her navy blue uniform perfectly pressed and her hair elegantly pinned back. This was Amelia Grace Thompson, a seasoned flight attendant with over a decade of experience navigating the skies and the myriad of personalities that came with them. 

Amelia had just returned from a long-haul flight to Tokyo, her heart still racing from the thrill of travel and the stories she had collected from her passengers. She loved the hurried chaos of the airportâ€”the laughter of families reuniting, the quiet solitude of solo travelers lost in thought, the unspoken stories etched on the faces of those departing for places unknown. Today, however, as she strolled through the terminal, a nagging feeling stirred within her, a sense that something extraordinary was about to unfold. Little did she know that her simple existence in this vibrant setting was about to intersect with a mystery that would change her life forever.
