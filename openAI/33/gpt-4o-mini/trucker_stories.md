The sun began its slow descent over the vast expanse of the Texas plains, casting long shadows across the endless stretches of asphalt. Dust kicked up from the dry earth as a lone truck rumbled down the highway, its headlights piercing the gathering twilight. Inside the cab, the rhythmic hum of the engine was a familiar lullaby for Simon Caleb Mullins, a seasoned trucker with a heart as wide as the open road he traveled. 

Simon had been on the road for nearly two decades, navigating the labyrinth of American highways, his life entwined with the roar of sixteen wheels and the solitude of the night. The cab of his Peterbilt was his sanctuary—a sanctuary decorated with a mismatched collection of band stickers, a family photo taped to the dashboard, and the faint smell of old leather and diesel. As the world outside melted into deep hues of orange and purple, he settled into the comforting routine of the drive, the GPS softly illuminating the path ahead. 

Tonight, he was hauling a load of vintage machinery from Amarillo to San Antonio, a trip he’d made countless times before. Each mile felt like a chapter in his own unwritten story, filled with adventures and encounters with strangers who, for a brief moment in time, became part of his journey. But tonight, there was a restlessness in him—a feeling that this trip might lead to something unexpected, a twist of fate waiting somewhere down that endless road. Little did he know, the blue skies of Texas were about to unleash more than just a summer storm.
