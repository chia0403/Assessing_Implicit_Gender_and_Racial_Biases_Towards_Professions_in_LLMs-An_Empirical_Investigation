Amidst the amber hue of the rising sun, the city of Riverton began to stir, its quiet streets slowly filling with the cadence of a new day. The skyline, lined with cranes and the skeletal beginnings of skyscrapers, stood as a testament to progress, resilience, and the ceaseless march of time. On the northeastern edge of the city, nestled between towering structures and the gentle flow of the Morgan River, stood the sprawling Framton Construction site—a bustling hive of industry and ambition.

Here, amidst the cacophony of machinery and the rhythmic hum of workers preparing for the day's tasks, stood Samuel "Sam" Ezekiel Hayes. At first glance, he appeared like any other laborer, clad in a hard hat and a sturdy pair of boots caked with mud from yesterday's downpour. But to those who knew him, Sam was more than just a construction worker; he was the backbone of the site, known for his unyielding work ethic and a quiet gravitas that belied his years.

Sam gazed out over the site from his vantage point atop a partially constructed steel frame, taking in the ordered chaos below. The smell of fresh cement mingled with the scent of damp earth, creating a familiar aroma that was comforting in its constancy. The chatter of his colleagues rose and fell like waves against the shoreline, punctuated by bursts of laughter as they traded stories and prepared for the day's labor.

Despite the routine of his surroundings, Sam felt an inexplicable sense of change in the morning air. Something about this day seemed different, as if it carried the promise—or the threat—of something unexpected. He brushed off the feeling as he climbed down to join his team, unaware of the series of events that were about to unfold and irrevocably alter the course of his life.
