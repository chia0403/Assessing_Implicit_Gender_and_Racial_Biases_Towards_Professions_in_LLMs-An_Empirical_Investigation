Dr. Evelyn Hartmann stood at the threshold of her cozy office, inhaling the comforting scent of vanilla candles mingling with the faint earthy aroma of the potted ferns she tended with care. The room was painted in soothing shades of seafoam green, accented with soft cream furniture that invited her clients to sink in and share the weight of their burdens. Large windows framed the gentle dance of autumn leaves outside—a reminder of the world’s constant change and renewal. 

Evelyn's sanctuary was nestled within the heart of Aurora Heights, a quaint town hidden away in the rolling hills of New England. The town’s streets were lined with vintage shops and cafes, their warm lights creating a comforting mosaic as twilight approached. Here, everyone seemed to know everyone, and Dr. Evelyn Hartmann had become a trusted confidante for many, whispered about at community gatherings as the one who helped repair invisible wounds.

As she moved to light another candle, preparing for her first appointment of the day, Evelyn sensed the subtle energy shift that always preceded a new story ready to unfold. She glanced towards the door and felt a familiar rush of purpose and empathy, wondering about the story her next client would bring to the safety of her office—a puzzle to piece together with compassion and insight.
