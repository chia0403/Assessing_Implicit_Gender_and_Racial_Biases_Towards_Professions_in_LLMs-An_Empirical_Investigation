In the heart of the bustling, rain-drenched city of Sheffield, where cobblestone streets meandered through neighborhoods both old and new, there stood a modest brick building with a faded blue door. The sign above the door read "Piper Plumbing & Co," its paint peeling but still sturdy like its proprietor, Thomas "Tommy" Callahan. Known for his craft and his chatter, Tommy was the sort of plumber who could fix a leaking faucet with one hand while sharing a story or a joke with the other.

It was early autumn, and the morning air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of damp earth and wood smoke. Leaves, painted in hues of amber and rust, crunched underfoot as Tommy strode across the cobblestones toward his white van, its sides battered and decorated with stickers from places he’d visited on his rare adventures beyond the city limits.

Sheffield itself was a city of contrasts, where industrial relics stood side by side with sleek new constructions, a testament to its thriving reinvention. Immersed in this tapestry, Tommy was something of an urban folk hero. He was known not just for his expertise, but for the warmth he brought to every job, whether it was a simple washer replacement or rerouting an entire system to breathe new life into an aging Victorian manor.

That particular morning, as he prepared for a day promising clogged drains and boiler fixes, Tommy couldn’t shake a particular weariness. An unfamiliar sense of unease had woven itself into the fabric of his routine, drawing his attention to an unknown somewhere in the day ahead—a mystery yet to unfold in the vein-snaked pipes beneath the city's surface. But with a shrug and a determined smile, Tommy hopped into his van, ready to tackle whatever the day might bring, even if it was something more than he expected.
