In the small coastal town of Seaview, where the air was perpetually tinged with the scent of saltwater and pine, Jonah Fitzpatrick began his day as he had for the past decade. The morning fog, thick and draping, lingered stubbornly over the sleepy streets like a well-worn quilt. Jonah, a seasoned electrician known throughout Seaview for his meticulous work and unwavering reliability, pulled the hood of his weathered navy-blue hoodie over his head as he stepped out of his little workshop, nestled snugly between the bookstore café and the local bakery.

The streets, lined with century-old lampposts and colorful clapboard houses, echoed with the distant cries of gulls and the gentle lapping of waves against the aged pier. Jonah's boots crunched on the gravel path as he headed toward his trusty van, the golden letters on its side proudly spelling out “Fitzpatrick Electrical” below a bright lightning bolt.

Despite the early hour, the town was beginning to stir. Amalee, from the bakery, sent a warm wave and a fresh croissant his way, while old Mr. Delaney, already perched on his usual bench outside the café with a steaming mug, nodded in greeting. Jonah offered a quick smile in return, his mind already ticking through the day's tasks—rewiring the elaborate chandeliers in the Whitmore Estate and diagnosing the pesky flickering lights at the maritime museum.

He loved this town, for its quirks and its constancy. Seaview was a place of stories, buried in every corner and curve of the coastline, and Jonah Fitzpatrick was content creating his own, one circuit at a time.
