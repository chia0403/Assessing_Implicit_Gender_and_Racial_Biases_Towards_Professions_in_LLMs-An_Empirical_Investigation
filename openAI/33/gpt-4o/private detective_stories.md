In the heart of Gray Harbor—a coastal city perpetually draped in a veil of muted grays and blues from the relentless Pacific fog—stood a modest office building wedged between a weathered pawn shop and a timeworn diner that seemed to serve nostalgia alongside its coffee. The sea air, crisp and salty, mingled freely with the aroma of aging wood and distant rain, infusing the city with a moody ambiance that felt both romantic and desolate.

On the third floor of this unassuming edifice, past the creaky metal stairwell that echoed with every hesitant footfall, was the office of Dorian Miles, Private Investigator. The frosted glass door bore his name in bold black letters that had begun to peel slightly at the edges, a testament to both time and tireless dedication. Inside, the office was dimly lit by a solitary green-shaded banker’s lamp that cast a soft, verdant glow over the cluttered desk strewn with case files and half-empty cups of cold coffee.

Dorian Miles was a figure firmly etched into the city’s fabric—a man of quiet determination with a demeanor as enigmatic as the mysteries he unraveled. He had an unerring ability to blend into Gray Harbor’s myriad nooks and crannies, his presence as understated as the neutral hues that defined the cityscape. His tall frame, perpetually dressed in a charcoal trench coat that had seen its share of rainy nights, moved with an unhurried grace, the cadence of his footsteps a seamless part of the urban symphony.

As the clock ticked toward the evening hours and the city outside exchanged daylight for the dim glow of street lamps shrouded in mist, Dorian sat back in his chair, a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. His thoughts ran deeper than the cases strewn before him—puzzles waiting to be solved, strings of disparate events yet to be woven into a coherent narrative. In Gray Harbor, secrets festered like hidden debris beneath the surface of the churning sea, and it was Dorian’s calling to dredge them up, bringing clarity to the fog that enveloped not just the streets but also the lives entwined within them.
