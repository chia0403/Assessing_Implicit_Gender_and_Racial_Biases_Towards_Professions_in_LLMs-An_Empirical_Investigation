In the heart of the bustling city of New Orleans, where the jazz notes floated through the air like whispers from another era, stood an opulent testament to the old-world charm—the Hotel Royale. Its grand facade, adorned with intricate ironwork and faded brick, watched over the vibrant streets below, echoing tales of yesteryears. Within its storied walls, guests from around the world converged, seeking refuge, adventure, or simply a slice of the Crescent City's magic.

Elias Montgomery, a bell hop with a perpetual twinkle in his hazel eyes, navigated the opulent lobby with the grace of a seasoned performer on a well-trodden stage. With each step on the marbled floors, his polished shoes whispered the stories of travelers past. Elias, with his crisp maroon uniform and neatly combed chestnut hair, seemed an intrinsic part of the hotel’s history—an observer of its endless parade of humanity.

His mornings began with the sunrise casting a warm glow on the Mississippi River, visible from the rooftop garden—a quiet retreat he favored before the day’s hustle ensued. Today, like many others, Elias awaited the influx of guests with an eager anticipation, ready to lend an ear to their tales or help weave new ones within the city’s vibrant tapestry. Unbeknownst to him, this day would unfurl an unexpected chapter of his own story, as the echoes of jazz serenaded the beginning of a mystery that would leave its imprint on the Hotel Royale forever.
