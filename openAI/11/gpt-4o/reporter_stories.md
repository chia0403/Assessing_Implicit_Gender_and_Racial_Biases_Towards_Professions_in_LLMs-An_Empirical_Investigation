Under the oppressive weight of the heavy clouds, the city of Selhurst dripped with the remnants of a stubborn autumn rain. The streets, glistening with reflected neon lights, wound their treacherous paths through clusters of dilapidated brick buildings and bustling alleyways. In this corner of the world, where the familiar hum of distant traffic played an endless symphony, stories unfolded like the pages of an old, dog-eared book.

At the heart of this urban sprawl was Nora Bennett, a reporter whose instincts were as sharp as the wind that cut through the early evening air. Nora was known for her tenacious curiosity, which was matched only by the quick wit she wielded like a finely honed blade. Her reputation preceded her in the creaky newsroom of The Selhurst Chronicle, where tales of political intrigue and unsolved mysteries were her relentless pursuit.

Nora stood beneath the dim, flickering marquee of the Metro Tavern, its faint yellow glow casting long shadows on the wet pavement. The tavern was an unofficial newsroom swap-meet for journalists and informants alike—a place where whispers and rumors danced between the clinking of glasses and the jazz trio’s sultry tunes. With her notepad tucked under one arm and her coat buttoned up against the chill, she pushed open the heavy wooden door, ready to uncover the next thread in the tapestry of truth.
