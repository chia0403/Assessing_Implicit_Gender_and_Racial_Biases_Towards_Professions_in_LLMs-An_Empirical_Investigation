In the quiet pre-dawn hours, the vast expanse of Interstate 90 stretched out like a ribbon across the rugged plains of Montana, dotted occasionally by the distant glow of isolated ranch houses. The sky was a rich tapestry of indigo hues, promising a spectacular sunrise, but at this hour, only a few bright stars held their luminous vigil. 

Inside the cab of a weathered, deep blue Peterbilt 389, an engine purred steadily, sending vibrations through the worn leather seat. Behind the wheel sat Eleanor "Ellie" Hartwell, whose hands danced deftly over the steering wheel and she shifted gears with the practiced ease of someone who had traversed these roads more times than she could count. At 37, Ellie had spent nearly half her life on America’s highways, carving out an unconventional but deeply fulfilling livelihood beneath endless skies.

The cozy interior of her truck was a reflection of her nomadic spirit—photos of loved ones tacked to the sun visor, a small potted cactus wedged into a cup holder, and an eclectic array of roadside souvenirs threaded along a piece of twine above the dashboard. As "Amarillo by Morning" softly crooned from the speakers, Ellie took a swig of her lukewarm coffee and gazed out across the dawn-touched landscape, feeling the familiar pull of wanderlust and freedom.

Today promised a long haul through some of her favorite landscapes, a patchwork of rolling hills and stark buttes that painted a picture of serene isolation and gritty resilience. Ellie relished these solitary drives; they offered her a space for introspection away from the bustling world, and a chance to listen to the stories that the wind whispered through the open window. As the first light broke over the horizon, bathing the world in a soft, rose-gold glow, Ellie smiled to herself. Somewhere down this long stretch of road lay adventure and stories yet untold, and she was eager to find them.
