The morning sun cast golden hues over the quiet streets of Millfield, a small town nestled between rolling hills and dense forests. It was a place where every face had a name, and every name carried a story. This was especially true at the heart of Millfield’s bustling market square, where Carter Hollis, the town’s well-loved butcher, began his day.

Carter’s Butchery was a cornerstone of the square, its brick facade standing proudly amidst the quaint shops and colorful stalls. Through the large, gleaming windows, passersby could see Carter busily preparing his counter, his movements precise and practiced. The shop was filled with the rich aroma of fresh cuts and seasoned meats, mingling with the scent of herbs and the faint sweetness of aged wood.

Inside, the walls were adorned with rustic wooden shelves, showcasing an array of spices and sauces, artisanal knives, and gleaming meat cleavers that glinted under the well-placed lights. Behind the counter, an old photograph of Carter’s grandfather hung, watching over the shop with a kind-eyed gaze—a reminder of the generations of tradition and skill passed down through the family.

Carter’s hands worked deftly, slicing through the early morning silence as he prepared the choice cuts for the day. His mind, however, wandered just beyond those shop walls, through the cobblestone paths and winding alleys of Millfield, to the curious news that had trickled through town—a newcomer, someone from the city, had moved into the long-abandoned cottage by the woods.

It wasn’t often that strangers found their way to Millfield, and curiosity buzzed among the villagers like bees in a field of clover. Carter himself couldn’t deny a tug of interest, perhaps mingled with a touch of apprehension. He wondered what kind of person would choose to make a home among their close-knit community, and what stories they might bring with them.

As the clock chimed eight, the first customers began to trickle in, and Carter greeted each with a warm smile, his curiosity temporarily set aside. There would be time enough to meet the newcomer, he figured, but for now, the familiar rhythm of the day awaited him.
