In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where ancient trees towered like sentinels and the air was rich with the scent of pine and damp earth, the small logging town of Evergreen Hollow lay nestled in a cradle of mountains. Mist clung to the towering firs, weaving through the dense underbrush as dawn broke, casting a silvery glow on the dew-laden leaves. This was a land of rugged beauty, where the roar of chainsaws punctuated the symphony of nature, and the rhythm of the seasons dictated the lives of its inhabitants.

At the edge of town, nestled against the imposing backdrop of the Cascade Range, stood the weather-beaten cabin of Morgan Thomas Hargrove. A seasoned logger with hands calloused from years of toil, Morgan had spent more than half his life immersed in the forest’s embrace. At thirty-eight, his tousled chestnut hair was flecked with strands of gray, a testament to the long hours spent under the turbulent sky, while his deep-set hazel eyes reflected a soul tethered to the woods. He had a deep respect for the land, understanding its cycles and temperaments, yet he often wrestled with the choices that came with his trade.

As he stood on the porch of his cabin, sipping black coffee from a chipped mug, he gazed out toward the shimmering expanse of timber. A sense of foreboding hung in the air, a whisper carried by the wind that warned of change. Today was supposed to be just another day in the forest, but a gnawing instinct told Morgan that something was different—a storm brewing on the horizon, not just of weather, but of fate itself. Little did he know, the woods held secrets intertwined with the whispers of the trees, secrets that would soon unravel, forever altering the path laid out before him.
