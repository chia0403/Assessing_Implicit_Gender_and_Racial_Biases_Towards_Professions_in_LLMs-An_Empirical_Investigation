**Title: The Long Haul**

**Setting:** The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden glow over the rolling hills of the Midwest. Dusty farmland stretched out on either side of the highway, dotted with silos and weathered barns that stood as silent witnesses to the passage of time. The hum of tires against asphalt created a soothing rhythm, broken only by the occasional call of a distant hawk. It was late afternoon, and the air was thick with the scent of fresh earth and hay, promising another hot summer evening. 

**Opening:**

As the last rays of sunlight bathed the landscape in hues of orange and crimson, *Henry Jameson*, a seasoned trucker with over a decade of experience on the open road, was navigating his rig down Route 66. He adjusted the brim of his weather-beaten cap, pushing it up just enough to catch a glimpse of the fading sun, as his mind drifted back to the small diner he often stopped at along this route. 

Inside the cab of his sixteen-wheeler, the space felt like a second home—weathered, yet full of history. A faded photograph of his teenage daughter clung to the dashboard, serving as a constant reminder of what awaited him at the end of each haul. With the radio gently crackling classic rock tunes, Henry expertly maneuvered the vehicle, his weathered hands gripping the steering wheel with a familiarity only years of practice could provide.

But as he drove, a sense of unease gnawed at the edges of his mind. There had been whispers on the airwaves of growing tensions in the trucker community—rumors of a growing movement determined to fight for better wages and working conditions. The thought lingered as he shifted gears, a familiar weight settling in his chest. Ohio was several hours away, but by the time he arrived, he knew the world might look a little different, and it made him wonder what changes awaited him beyond the horizon.
