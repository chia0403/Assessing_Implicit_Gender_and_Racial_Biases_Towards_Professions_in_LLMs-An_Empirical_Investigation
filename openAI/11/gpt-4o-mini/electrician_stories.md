The early morning sun cast a warm glow over the quaint town of Maplewood, where the scent of pine mixed with the aroma of fresh coffee wafting from the local café. Nestled among the charming brick buildings and blooming flower boxes was a modest workshop, its windows adorned with tools and spare parts. Inside, the steady hum of fluorescent lights flickered, battling against the new day—a fitting soundtrack for the town’s sole electrician, Benjamin Carter.

Benjamin, known to the townsfolk as “Ben,” was a man of simple pleasures. In his mid-thirties, he wore his dark, tousled hair under a well-worn baseball cap, and his hands bore the marks of a life spent amid wires and circuit boards. He took pride in his craft, viewing every torn-out outlet and flickering bulb as a puzzle waiting to be solved. Today, however, he felt a twinge of restlessness stirring within him, lifting his gaze from the tangled mess of electrical parts scattered across his workbench.

Beyond the shop door, the streets were alive with the hum of daily life. Children rode their bikes down the leafy lanes, while the local bakery beckoned with the promise of flaky pastries and warm bread. Yet, Ben's world felt confined to the buzzing fluorescent lights and the tinkering of his tools—a symphony of familiarity that began to feel too small for his ambitions.

With a sigh, he wiped his hands on his tool belt and stepped outside, his boots crunching on the gravel path that led to the now-familiar sounds of Maplewood. Little did he know that today would shift the course of his uneventful routine, igniting a series of events that would lead him far beyond the boundaries of his workshop and into the heart of an unexpected adventure.
