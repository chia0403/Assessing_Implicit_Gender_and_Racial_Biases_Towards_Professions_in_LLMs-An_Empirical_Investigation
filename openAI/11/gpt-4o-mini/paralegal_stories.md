The rain fell in heavy sheets, drumming against the windows of Kendall Hartman's small office nestled within the towering glass façade of Parker & Lennon LLP. The office was dimly lit, the flickering fluorescent lights reflecting the tension that hung in the air. Desks littered with case files and legal briefs flanked Kendall's workspace, where the scent of lukewarm coffee mingled with the musty smell of old paper. On the wall, a corkboard was adorned with photographs of sun-soaked beaches, a stark contrast to the dreary view outside, where the streets glistened under the relentless downpour.

Kendall, a thirty-two-year-old paralegal with a penchant for detail-oriented work, had built a reputation as the firm’s unshakeable backbone. With her short, tousled auburn hair and oversized glasses that slipped down her nose when she leaned too far into her work, she habitually wore a collection of colorful cardigans that added a cheerfulness to the otherwise sterile atmosphere of the office. As she reviewed the details of her latest case—a high-profile embezzlement trial—Kendall couldn't shake the feeling that the stakes were about to get much higher.

Outside, the city buzzed with energy, yet here within the firm, time seemed to crawl. The clock on the wall ticked steadily, reminding her of the pressing deadlines she lived and breathed daily. With a determined sigh, Kendall adjusted her glasses, her mind racing as she prepared for the tumultuous day ahead. Little did she know, the rain would not be the only thing to disrupt her routine; an unexpected phone call was about to challenge everything she thought she knew about justice, loyalty, and the law.
