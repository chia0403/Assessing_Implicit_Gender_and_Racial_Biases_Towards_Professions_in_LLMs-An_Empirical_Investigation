In the small, unassuming town of Elderswood, the air was tinged with the rich, savory aroma of spices and freshly butchered meat. The early morning sun filtered through the grimy windows of “Benson’s Butcher Shop,” casting dappled light on the floor, which was a mosaic of wood and bloodstains, each telling a hidden story of its own. 

Behind the counter stood Harold Thaddeus Benson, a robust man in his late forties with a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and calloused hands that spoke of countless hours spent honing his craft. With a white apron splattered with deep red splashes draped over his broad waist, he meticulously arranged cuts of meat on the display, a symphony of hues and textures beckoning to hungry patrons.

But it wasn’t the artistry of his butchery that set Harold apart; it was the mystique that surrounded him. Whispers of strange happenings lingered like the smell of curing ham in the air. Some claimed Harold had a secret recipe for sausage that had been handed down through generations, while others speculated that he had a deeper connection with the animals he slaughtered—a bond that perhaps crossed the thin line between life and death.

As the bell over the door jingled, heralding the arrival of a regular customer, the sun continued to rise, unveiling the small town and its hidden shadows, and it seemed that Harold's day would unravel in ways he could never have anticipated. Today, the line between butcher and guardian would blur, and the secrets of Elderswood would begin to emerge from their long-held concealments.
