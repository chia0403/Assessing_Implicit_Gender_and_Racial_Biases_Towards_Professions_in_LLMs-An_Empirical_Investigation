The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Eldervale. The town’s ancient stone walls, weathered and cracked, loomed like sentinels, their watchful gaze fixed upon the people bustling about their evening routines. Lanterns flickered to life, their warm glow chasing away the encroaching darkness. The air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke and baked bread, mingling in a comforting embrace as twilight settled over the town.

At the edge of the bustling marketplace stood a solitary figure, arms crossed and posture rigid. This was Darius Thorne, the senior guard of Eldervale, a man whose reputation as a steadfast protector had earned him both respect and a touch of wariness from the townsfolk. With tousled brown hair that fell haphazardly over his forehead and piercing green eyes that missed nothing, Darius seemed, at first glance, an unyielding bastion of authority. Yet those who knew him well would say there was a warmth beneath his gruff exterior, a sense of loyalty that ran deeper than the very stone walls he patrolled.

Tonight, as he surveyed the gathering crowd, laughter resonated through the air alongside muffled conversations. Families were relishing the final hours of daylight, but Darius felt an undercurrent of unease, a prickle at the back of his neck. It was the kind of night that had a way of attracting trouble—the kind that found its way into the heart of Eldervale when one least expected it. And as the last rays of sun dipped below the horizon, a chill breeze whispered secrets through the archways, reminding Darius that beneath the facade of normalcy, shadows often lurked just out of sight.
