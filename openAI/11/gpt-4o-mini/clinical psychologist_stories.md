Dr. Eliza Harper stood in her small, sunlit office, the walls lined with shelves of worn psychology textbooks and soft, abstract paintings designed to soothe. Framed certificates hung next to photographs of her smiling family, creating a warm yet professional ambiance that welcomed her clients. The rich aroma of fresh coffee wafted in from a nearby café, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from the diffuser she kept on her desk.

It was a crisp autumn morning in Willowbrook, a quaint town nestled between golden fields and the whispering woods of the Appalachian foothills. Eliza gazed out the window, her thoughts momentarily drifting to the rustling leaves outside, vibrant orange and red against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. She loved this time of year—the way it brought out a certain vulnerability in people, a yearning for reflection and connection as the days grew shorter.

Today, she was scheduled to meet with Alex, a troubled young artist struggling with anxiety and the haunting shadow of past trauma. Eliza had spent years honing her skills to help others navigate their inner turmoil, and she felt a mix of anticipation and concern as she prepared her notes. With her warm demeanor and an unwavering commitment to understanding her clients, Eliza had built a reputation as a compassionate listener in a community where vulnerability was often masked by the facade of normalcy. Little did she know, the day's session would unearth not only Alex's struggles but also a secret that would change the course of her life forever.
