In the heart of the bustling city of Riverton, where the streets hummed with the rhythm of daily life, stood a small pharmacy nestled between a vintage bookstore and a flower shop bursting with color. The fragrant aroma of freshly cut blooms danced through the air, mingling with the crisp scent of antiseptic that wafted from the pharmacy's open door. The sun cast a warm glow on the shop's weathered sign: “Megan L. Thornton, R.Ph. - Your Neighborhood Pharmacist.”

Inside, the shelves were lined with colorful bottles and neatly organized boxes of medicine, each a quiet promise of healing. Behind the counter, Megan L. Thornton meticulously counted out pills and packaged prescriptions, her mind cycling through the day’s tasks while soft music played in the background. With her short, auburn hair tied neatly back and a pair of rectangular glasses perched on her nose, she embodied the image of calm professionalism, but her hazel eyes reflected the weight of unspoken worries.

Megan had returned to Riverton after years in a larger city, seeking solace from the chaos that had nearly swallowed her whole. She had thought the move would grant her peace. Instead, it had thrust her into the heart of small-town dramas. Today marked the anniversary of her father’s passing, a memory that loomed heavy in her heart, yet the vibrant community outside continued with its daily routines, unaware of her internal struggle.

As the bell above the door chimed, signaling the arrival of a customer, Megan took a deep breath, adjusting her smile before greeting the newcomer. The world outside seemed to fade, but inside the pharmacy, life was always just beginning.
