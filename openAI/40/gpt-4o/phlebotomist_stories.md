Lydia Morales scanned the early morning horizon, her gaze lingering on the mist that clung stubbornly to the banks of the River Stowe. It was the kind of small-town morning she had grown accustomed to in Cedar Hollow, where time seemed to stretch and dissolve like the fog surrounding her. The quaint New England town was still waking up, and the air was filled with the gentle aroma of dew on grass and the distant scent of brewing coffee from Millie's Café down the street.

Lydia wrapped her woolen shawl tighter around her shoulders as she approached St. Augustine's Community Health Center, the familiar sound of her boots crunching against the gravel path heralding another day's work. As the clinic's only phlebotomist, Lydia had become a fixture not only within its walls but also within the fabric of the community itself. People knew her by name, trusted her gentle touch, and confided in her as they gave what seemed like just a vial of blood but felt much more significant.

Sunlight began to filter through the lace curtains of the clinic’s windows as she entered, painting the waiting room in hues of gold and honey. The smell of antiseptic was soothing in its predictability, and she took a moment to appreciate the sanctuary-like calm before the day's patients trickled in. This was the world Lydia knew intimately, where veins whispered secrets and every blood sample told a story.
