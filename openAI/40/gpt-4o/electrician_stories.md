In the heart of the bustling city of Obsidian Heights, where the skyline pierced the heavens and the streets buzzed with life, a symphony of lights bled into the night, giving an almost ethereal glow to the shadows. It was here, in this urban sprawl where ambition and dreams collided amidst the chaos, that Ethan Vance carved out his existence. As an electrician, Ethan knew the city’s veins better than most, every flicker and hum telling him stories of the labyrinthine network of energy that pulsed beneath its surface.

On a crisp autumn evening, when the air had the inexplicable sweetness of fallen leaves and distant woodsmoke, Ethan found himself on a rooftop overlooking the cityscape. The building was an old theatre, the Rosewood Lyric, known for its glorious art deco façade and history of hosting some of the greatest performers of yesteryear. It had once been the crown jewel of Broadway Street, but now it stood defiant against time’s relentless march, precariously perched between the nostalgia of the past and the encroaching modernity.

Ethan surveyed the sprawling neon vista, listening to the distant roars of buses and the muted clinking of glasses from nearby rooftop bars. His tool belt felt reassuringly familiar against his hip, and the coil of wires over his shoulder was as much a part of him now as the city itself. Beneath his practical exterior lay the soul of an artist, each wire he connected and each conduit he repaired lay testament to his craft — a craft that brought light to the desolate corners of the world.

With deft hands and an instinct honed by years of experience, Ethan began his work, the quiet hum of electricity his only companion. As he set about reviving the theatre’s ancient chandelier, the first tendrils of the evening fog began to wrap themselves around the rooftops, bathing everything in a sepia-tinged glow that whispered secrets of another time. Unbeknownst to him, this night would herald a mystery that would draw him deeper into the city’s underbelly than he’d ever envisioned. Yet for now, it was just Ethan and the glow of his work against the slowly encroaching night.
