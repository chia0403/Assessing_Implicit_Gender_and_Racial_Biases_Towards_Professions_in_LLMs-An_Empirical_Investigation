In the heart of bustling Manhattan, nestled between towering skyscrapers and the cacophony of city life, stood the illustrious Regency Meridian Hotel. Its grandiose facade, adorned with elaborate carvings and a canopy of twinkling lights, promised elegance and comfort to all who crossed its gilded threshold. Inside, the lobby was a swirling sea of opulence, where polished marble floors gleamed beneath the glow of crystal chandeliers, and hushed conversations in a medley of languages floated through the air like musical notes.

In this world of perpetual motion and high expectations, Benjamin "Benji" Whitaker thrived. A bell hop with a penchant for precision, Benji had become an integral part of the hotel's orchestration. With a sharp uniform that clung to his slender frame and a cap perfectly perched atop his dark curls, he navigated the lobby with the grace of a seasoned dancer.

His role was as varied as the guests who passed through; one moment he'd be whisking a stack of expensive luggage away to a penthouse suite, the next he'd be charming a group of tourists with tales of the hotel’s storied past. Known for his easy smile and uncanny ability to anticipate a guest's needs before they were even voiced, Benji had gradually woven himself into the fabric of the Regency Meridian, earning respect and trust from colleagues and clientele alike.

Today, however, felt different. An unseasonably cool breeze swept through the city, rustling the crisp autumn leaves that painted the streets in shades of amber and russet. A sense of anticipation hung in the air, as though the city itself held its collective breath, waiting for something unseen. Benji could feel it too—a subtle shift beneath the surface of the hotel's polished veneer, a whisper of mystery that promised change.
