Title: **Beneath the Amber Sky**

In the heart of the vast Midwest, where the highway stretches like an unspooled ribbon across the flatlands, the early morning air carried a hint of burnt amber as the sun began its ascent. The world was caught in a delicate balance between night and day, shadow and light. The familiar clattering hum of insects had just begun to stir, weaving a subtle melody into the morning stillness.

Alongside Route 34, where miles of asphalt drew a line between fields of golden corn and whispering wheat, a solitary figure worked diligently under the expansive sky. Thomas "Tommy" Rayner, a seasoned highway maintenance worker, was already at his task—the serenity of dawn his only companion. At age forty-two, Tommy had spent more of his life on these stretches of road than in any single room or house. The highway, with its endless cadence of tire hum and wind song, had become an inseparable part of him; its rhythm beating in tandem with his heart.

Tommy's sturdy hands, calloused from years of labor, held a battered sign that commanded the attention of oncoming traffic: "ROAD WORK AHEAD." He had known this stretch intimately, every crack and crevice, each bend that marked the journey of countless souls—some seeking new horizons, others merely returning to familiar grounds.

The sun caressed the horizon with its gentle, golden light, casting long shadows that danced with the swaying cornfields adjacent to the highway. A soft breeze rustled the leaves, whispering secrets through the rows as if nature itself engaged in hushed conversations with the man who tended its pathways. Today, as with every other, Tommy found a peculiar kind of solace in the monotony; a moment of peace in the simple face of evolving landscapes and passing travelers.

This morning, however, there was something different in the air, a quiet expectancy that clung to the atmosphere like the morning mist. Tommy felt it—an unexplained impulse, perhaps, or merely the workings of a seasoned intuition, honed from years of waking with the dawn. And as he put away the sign, preparing to attend the cracks weaving across the tarmac, a thought crossed his mind, elusive and fleeting like the birds that circled overhead: today was bound to be different.
