The rain had begun to fall in earnest, painting a mottled sheen on the city sidewalks that mirrored the sky aboveâ€”dark, brooding, and filled with unspoken threats. In the heart of Millhaven, a city that clung stubbornly to its past while feigning an embrace of the present, Robert "Bobby" Lennox stepped out of the shadows and into the neon glow of Freeman Street. The old detective's coat flapped slightly in the breeze, and his hat was pulled low enough to obscure his eyes, but not the weathered determination etched across his face.

The city sang its usual symphony of distant sirens and the hum of late-night pedestrians, each note a reminder of the secrets concealed within its grasp. Rising above it all, the Beacon Building stood like a sentinel, observing the city's sordid tales with an icy indifference. It was there, on the sixth floor, behind a frosted glass door that read "Robert Lennox, Private Investigations," that Bobby's sanctuary from the chaos existed.

Bobby had been a private detective for more years than he cared to count. Millhaven had been both his battleground and his refuge, a place where he simultaneously made a name for himself and got lost in the inky tapestry of its underbelly. Tonight, as the rain fell and the vapor from his breath mingled with the chill in the air, Bobby Lennox knew another chapter of his story was about to unfold.
