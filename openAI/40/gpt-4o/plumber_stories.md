In the heart of a town that clung to the edge of somewhere and nowhere, beneath skies that alternated moods with the seasons, there resided a plumber by the name of Samuel “Sam” J. Whitaker. Dewhurst was a place defined by its cobblestone streets, where the enduring smell of coffee mingled with the crisp, lingering scent of nearby pine forests. The town's crumbling Victorian facades stood watch over a patchwork of shops that had seen more prosperous days. 

Sam was accustomed to the early morning ritual, descending his narrow staircase as the first light of dawn crept through battered blinds. His small workshop, located behind a bright teal door, was nestled between an old bookshop and a bustling bakery. The air was redolent with fresh baked bread, a comforting contrast to the industrial scents of solder and metal that awaited him.

A man of steady hands and quiet heart, Sam's world was interwoven with pipes and fixtures, whispers of water moving beneath the surface of everyday life. His reputation stretched beyond Dewhurst, known for being the person who could fix what every other plumber deemed impossible. It was said that if Sam couldn't repair it, it wasn't broken; it was gone. Though work was constant, he moved with the languid grace of someone at peace with his place in the world—a fixer of things hidden and seen.

The day would be spent navigating people's peculiar requests, the peculiarities inside older homes, or attending to the newer, modern nightmares that preferred binding instead of joining. Yet unbeknownst to Sam, this day, in its own quiet way, would unravel into something extraordinary—one misplaced pipe revealing a secret that would change his life. As the sleepy town stirred to life, Sam prepared himself for another ordinary day, wholly unaware of the twist waiting behind the next turn of a wrench.
