In the heart of the bustling city of Maplewood, nestled between towering skyscrapers and quaint coffee shops, stood the charming little office of Dr. Alden & Associates, DDS. The front of the building was adorned with pots of colorful geraniums, offering a splash of warmth against the sleek glass exterior. A steady stream of patients flowed through its doors, seeking both routine cleanings and remedy for more complex dental woes.

Amidst the gentle hum of dental equipment and the soothing scent of mint, Georgia Lynn Saunders, a dedicated dental hygienist, began her day with practiced ease. Known for her calming presence and deft hands, Georgia had become a comforting figure to many patients over her six years at the practice. At thirty-two, she exuded an air of quiet confidence, her kind hazel eyes peeking out over the top of her surgical mask, instantly putting even the most anxious visitors at ease.

Georgia’s work station, while professional, bore gentle reminders of her personality—framed photos of her cat, Whiskers, nestled among neatly organized dental tools, and a tiny cactus perched on the windowsill, a gift from a grateful patient. The office windows offered a panoramic view of Central Park, its paths threaded through vibrant stretches of green that provided a momentary escape from the urban clamor.

As Georgia prepared for her first patient, she looked out the window, momentarily losing herself in the sight of early joggers weaving along the park’s winding trails. She drew a deep breath, the familiar ritual centering her. Today was going to be a good day, she decided, full of shared smiles and small victories, where each patient left her chair a little more at ease than when they arrived.
