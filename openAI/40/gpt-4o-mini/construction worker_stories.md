Title: **Iron Shadows**

Setting: The skyline of Riverton, a bustling city defined by its mix of aging brick buildings and shining glass skyscrapers, extends over the horizon as the sun dips low. Construction sites punctuate the urban landscape, a cacophony of metal clashing against metal and the hum of machinery breaking through the city’s usual rhythm. A soft breeze carries the scent of freshly poured concrete, mingled with the distant aroma of street vendors selling hot pretzels and roasted chestnuts.

Opening: 

As the last golden rays of sunlight spilled over the steely framework of Blakemore Tower, Samuel Jude Carter squinted against the blinding light, beads of sweat trickling down his sun-kissed brow. He measured the beams he had just secured, ensuring they were perfectly aligned for the next stage of the build. The world around him was a symphony of progress, the buzz of drills and the thud of heavy machinery echoing in a familiar dance. Yet, amidst this chaotic beauty, Sam felt an unsettling chill creep into his bones—a feeling that today was different.

The city thrummed with life, but for Sam, a twenty-six-year-old construction worker raised in the shadow of steel and concrete, it felt all too familiar. Each day on the site was a new chapter in his life, etched in the grit and grime that clung to his work boots. He took a moment to wipe his hands on his faded denim overalls, pondering the world he was building piece by piece. His tattoos—symbols of strength and perseverance—peeked from under his sleeves, inked stories of struggle that intertwined with the very foundations he reinforced.

As he glanced down at the bustling street below, a sudden shout broke through the air. Sam's heart raced at the sound—a warning, a call for help? He tore his eyes away from the horizon, instincts kicking in. Little did he know, that sound would lead him down an unexpected path, challenging everything he believed about the work he did, and the destiny he had yet to forge.
