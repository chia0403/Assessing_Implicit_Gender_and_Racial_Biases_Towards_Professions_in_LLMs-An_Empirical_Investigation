**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Seabrook, where the ocean crashes against rocky cliffs, and fog hangs low in the early morning light. The weathered buildings of the town, painted in sun-bleached hues, stand against the elements, their stories etched into the wood. Just beyond the lively harbor filled with fishing boats, a modest white-washed clinic sits at the edge of a grassy knoll, its doors welcoming the familiar scent of salt and sea.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Claire Mitchell stood at the window of her clinic, gazing out at the horizon where the ocean kissed the sky. With each wave that swept ashore, a whisper of the past lapped at her consciousness, mingling with the salty breeze that ruffled her chestnut hair. Five years had passed since she had traded the cacophony of city life for the serene, if sometimes tempestuous, rhythms of Seabrook. It wasnâ€™t that she had found healing in the stony enclave; rather, she had buried herself in her work, seeking redemption in her patients, their stories entwining with the quiet thrum of the town.

Today, however, felt different. The air was thick with an unspoken tension, a storm brewing just out of sight. As she watched the ominous clouds gather above the cliffs, a knock echoed through the clinic, pulling her from her thoughts. She turned, her practiced smile slipping into place as she opened the door, ready to face whatever the day might bring, unaware that a life-altering secret rested on the other side.
