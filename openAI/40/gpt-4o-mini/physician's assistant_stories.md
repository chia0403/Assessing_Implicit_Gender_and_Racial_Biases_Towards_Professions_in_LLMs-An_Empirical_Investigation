**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting**: The small coastal town of Havenport is shrouded in an early morning mist, the salty scent of the sea mingling with the earthy aroma of damp earth. The lighthouse stands vigil on the cliffs, a sentinel against the rugged coastline, its beam piercing through the fog. The gentle lapping of waves against the rocky shore is broken only by the occasional call of a seagull, gliding over the water. The streets are narrow and winding, lined with clapboard houses painted in faded pastels, their gardens bursting with wildflowers. At the town's center, the Havenport Community Health Clinic occupies a charming brick building adorned with a weathered sign.

**Opening**: As dawn crept into Havenport, the air was thick with anticipation. Beneath the soft hum of the clinic's fluorescent lights, **Molly Elizabeth Anderson**, a dedicated physician's assistant, took a deep breath, steeling herself for the day ahead. She tucked a loose strand of chestnut hair behind her ear, her green scrubs a refreshing contrast to the pale surroundings. The comforting sounds of the clinic filling with life—distant laughter, the rustle of paper, the sharp click of heels on the tile floor—ground her amid lingering thoughts of the night before, where a patient’s hushed whispers hinted at shadows deep beneath their surface.

Molly had always been drawn to the complexities of the human condition. With her compassionate demeanor and innate curiosity, those she encountered often felt like more than mere cases to her; they were stories waiting to be told. Today, however, as she stood by the triage desk ready to begin her shift, a sense of unease settled in her chest. Something told her that one of those stories would change everything.
