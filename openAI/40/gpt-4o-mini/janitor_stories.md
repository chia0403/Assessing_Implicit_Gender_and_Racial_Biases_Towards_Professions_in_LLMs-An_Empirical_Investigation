Title: *The Keeper of Echoes*

In the heart of Eldridge City, where the hum of life thrummed against the backdrop of towering glass and steel, the Eldridge Municipal Library stood resolutely. Its marble facade sparkled under the afternoon sun, a timeless guardian of stories and secrets. Inside, silence reigned, punctuated only by the soft rustle of pages turning and the gentle creak of old wooden shelves that had cradled countless tales.

Beneath the polished floors and vaulted ceilings, however, another world thrived in the shadows—one known only to those who swept away the remnants of the day’s visitors. Here, a humble janitor named Tobias James Hargrove tread softly, his sturdy, worn work boots echoing only lightly in the cavernous silence. Tobias, with his salt-and-pepper hair and wise eyes that seemed to hold the weight of decades, moved with a purpose that belied his simple station. Every sweep of the mop and every swipe of the cloth across dusty surfaces felt like a ritual, a way to honor the stories held within these walls.

Though many patrons saw only a man in a blue uniform whose job was to keep the library tidy, Tobias was a keeper of echoes—a guardian of the whispers of the past. He often marveled at the array of lives that passed through the library’s doors, each person a chapter, each visit a fleeting moment in an ever-turning page. Little did they know that, once the lights dimmed and the last patron left, the library transformed into a realm where the written word danced among the shelves, and the echoes of imaginary worlds filled the air.

As twilight began to cast long shadows across the marble floor, Tobias prepared to embark on his nightly routine, unaware that tonight, echoes of an unexpected kind would seek him out.
