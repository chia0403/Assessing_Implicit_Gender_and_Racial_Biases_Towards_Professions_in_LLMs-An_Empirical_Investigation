**Title: The Last Curtain Call**

**Setting:**
Beneath the shimmering lights of the historic Brighton Theatre, echoes of laughter and applause still linger in the air, wrapping around the velvet-draped walls like an invisible embrace. The grand chandelier above glistens with a warm glow, its crystals refracting light into a dazzling array of colors that dance across the faded gold leaf details of the ceiling. Dust motes swirl lazily in the beams, remnants of countless performances, while the worn wooden stage creaks with the weight of unspoken memories. The scent of aged pine and freshly painted backdrops fills the space, a blend of nostalgia and artistic ambition that invites creativity to flourish.

Yet, this season feels different. The air is thick with anticipation, carrying whispers of change as the theatre prepares for a production that could either revive its legacy or seal its fate.

**Character:**
In the dim backstage area, surrounded by costumes and props, stands Miranda Eloise Warwick—an ambitious theatrical director known for her unyielding passion and eccentric vision. With her unruly chestnut curls pulled back in an artful bun, and paint-splattered overalls, she resembles a whirlwind of creativity just waiting to explode. Despite the chaos around her, there’s a fierce determination in her stormy grey eyes, revealing her unwavering commitment to breathe life into the stories she tells.

As Miranda runs her fingers over the well-worn script of a forgotten classic, she can’t shake off the feeling that this production could be her last chance to redefine both her career and the theatre she has called home. The specter of past failures and the unresolved tension with her estranged father, the theatre's former managing director, loom over her like an omniscient director, pushing her to confront the ghosts of both the stage and her family as she prepares for opening night.
