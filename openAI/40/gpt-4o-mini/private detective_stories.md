The rain drummed a steady rhythm on the cobblestone streets of Old Bexley, a neighborhood steeped in history and shadowed by secrets. Gas lamps flickered to life as evening gave way to night, casting an amber glow that struggled against the encroaching darkness. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and lingering pipe smoke, wrapping the streets in a nostalgic embrace.

At the corner of Ashwood and Thistle, nestled between a shuttered bookstore and a quaint tea shop, stood a modest office with a tarnished brass nameplate: “Edgar Hawthorne, Private Detective.” Inside, the walls were lined with mismatched clues from cases past—faded photographs, newspaper clippings, and a collection of peculiar trinkets that hinted at the bizarre adventures of the detective who inhabited this space.

Edgar Basil Hawthorne, a man in his late thirties with a shock of unruly dark hair and sharp green eyes, sat at his cluttered desk, absently polishing a magnifying glass. He wore a well-worn trench coat, the collar turned up against a bitter breeze that crept through the cracked window. The soft glow of a desk lamp illuminated his weary face, marked by a hint of stubble and an expression that spoke of untold stories.

Outside, the rain blurred the world into a hazy impressionist painting, but inside his office, the flickering flame of a single candle carved shadows across the room, giving it a sense of intimacy. Edgar was contemplating his next move, a stack of unsolved cases piled high beside him, when the bell above the door chimed, signaling the arrival of a visitor. Little did he know, this would be the case that could pull him further into the web of mystery than any he’d encountered before.
