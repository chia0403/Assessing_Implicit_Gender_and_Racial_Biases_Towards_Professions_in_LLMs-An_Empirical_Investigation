The chill of dawn blanketed the kingdom of Eldoria, where the first light of day spilled golden hues over the jagged peaks of the Northern Mountains. As the sun rose, it cast long shadows through the ancient stone arches of Castle Draegen, where the wind howled like a mournful spirit between the battlements. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and the faint scent of smoke from the previous night’s fires.

Within the castle walls, the fortified courtyard was already bustling with activity. The clang of metal echoed as blacksmiths prepared their tools and supply wagons rumbled through the gates, laden with goods from distant villages. Amongst the clatter and commotion stood a lone figure, clad in the gleaming armor of the King’s guard—the insignia of a dragon emblazoned on his chest. 

This was Captain Emory Valenhart, a steadfast sentinel with a reputation for unwavering loyalty and unmatched courage. At thirty-five, Emory had seen his fair share of battles, his striking blue eyes holding the weight of countless decisions made in the heat of conflict. He had fought for Eldoria’s freedom, faced treachery from within its own walls, and now stood sentinel at the threshold of an uncertain peace.

As he paced the castle ramparts, the chill wind tugged at his cloak, and he held tightly to his sword’s hilt, pondering the ominous news that had arrived in the night—a message sealed with black wax and the mark of the Shadow Court. Whispers of treason and old rivalries echoed in his mind as the sounds of the waking castle faded into an uneasy silence, the weight of responsibility settling heavily on his shoulders. In a realm where shadows lurked and allies could quickly turn to enemies, Emory knew that the real battle lay ahead, one that would test not just his mettle but the very fabric of loyalty itself.
