Beneath the flickering fluorescent lights of a dilapidated warehouse on the outskirts of a once-thriving industrial town, Ethan James Renault unscrewed the final connection from an outdated circuit board. Dust danced in the beams of late afternoon sunlight filtering through cracked windows, illuminating the dim space cluttered with rusted machinery and forgotten tools. 

Ethan had always felt at home among the wires and circuits, the hum of electricity filling his ears like a familiar tune. With rough-hewn hands, calloused from years of work, he navigated the maze of cables hanging from the rafters, each twist and turn a puzzle waiting to be solved. But today, as he worked to restore power to this ghostly place, an unsettling sensation crept over him — a whisper of something deeper in the shadows, waiting to be uncovered.

The warehouse had stood silent for years, its past consumed by the growth of weeds and the encroaching grip of urban decay. Local legends spoke of light flickering in the windows at odd hours, whispers of ghostly figures roaming the aisles. Most dismissed the tales as mere trickery of the mind, but Ethan’s curiosity drew him closer, like a moth to a flame. He had come to restore the power, yes, but also to discover what lay beneath the rust and ruin — something more than just wires and walls, something that had lingered long after the last factory whistle blew. Little did he know, today would not just change the way he saw his craft, but unravel a mystery that connected him to the history of the town itself.
