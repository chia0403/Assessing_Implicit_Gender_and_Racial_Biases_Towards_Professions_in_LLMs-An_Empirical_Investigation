**Story Opening**

In the hushed corridors of Maplewood High, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows that danced across the walls, echoing the soft whispers of secrets held within. The school, a weathered brick structure with ivy creeping up its sides, stood resilient against the chill of autumn, with leaves swirling like forgotten dreams on the pavement outside. Inside, the echo of lockers slamming and the laughter of students signaled the end of another day, yet an air of tension lingered beneath the surface.

Dr. Eliza Mayfield leaned against the doorframe of her cozy office, a small sanctuary adorned with colorful fidget toys and motivational posters. A kaleidoscope of students flitted in and out, each seeking a moment of solace or guidance from the woman who had become a steadfast pillar of support in their turbulent lives. With warm hazel eyes and a cascade of chestnut hair pinned back in a loose bun, she projected a calmness that belied the weight of her daily encounters: high-stakes emotions, unspoken fears, and the unrelenting pressure of adolescent life.

As she prepared for the final appointment of the day, a soft knock interrupted her thoughts. She straightened up, the lingering fragrance of chamomile tea — her favorite antidote for chaotic afternoons — wafting into the hallway. Knowing that every knock held a unique story, Eliza exhaled slowly and opened the door, ready to guide yet another student through the labyrinth of their mind. Little did she know, today’s session would unravel threads that connected her own past to the very heart of Maplewood High — threads she thought had long been buried.
