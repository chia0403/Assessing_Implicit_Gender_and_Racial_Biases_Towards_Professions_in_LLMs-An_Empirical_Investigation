**Story Opening:**

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden glow over the small coastal town of Crestview. Waves gently lapped against the pebbled shore, where families wrapped in colorful blankets gathered for evening picnics. The salt-laden breeze carried the sounds of laughter and distant gulls, creating a serene backdrop that seemed to wrap the town in a cozy embrace. 

At the edge of the beach, nestled between a quaint bookstore and a bustling café, stood a modest brick building with cheerful blue shutters. The sign above the door read “Crestview Rehabilitation Center.” Inside, the air was filled with a sense of purpose and determination. 

As the clock ticked towards six, the last of the patients were wrapping up their sessions. Dr. Evelyn Claire Morrison, a dedicated physical therapist in her early thirties, packed up her therapy bands and exercise mats with practiced efficiency. With chestnut hair pulled back into a loose bun and a warm smile that could brighten the gloomiest of days, she embodied an energy of compassion and resilience. For Evelyn, every small victory—whether a patient taking their first step after an injury or a child regaining strength after an accident—was a reminder of why she had dedicated her life to healing bodies and nurturing spirits.

Little did she know that tonight would change everything as she prepared to close the center for the weekend, a mysterious letter slipped beneath the door, waiting patiently to be discovered.
