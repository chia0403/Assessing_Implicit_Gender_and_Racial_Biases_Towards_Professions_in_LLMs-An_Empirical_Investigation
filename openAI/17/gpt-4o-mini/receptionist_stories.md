In the small town of Maplewood, nestled between rolling hills and an ancient forest, stood the once-grand Redwood Hotel. Its faded red awnings and ivy-clad brick fa√ßade whispered of long-forgotten elegance. The lobby, with its creaking wooden floors and a chandelier that had seen better days, pulsed with a sense of nostalgia. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the tall windows, while the faint scent of polished wood and old leather lingered in the air.

At the front desk, a small brass bell sat waiting to be rung, its shine dulled by years of wear. This is where 27-year-old Clara Evangeline Brooks spent her days. With a warm smile always at the ready, Clara was a familiar face to the handful of regular guests who trickled in like clockwork. She wore her dark hair pulled back in a tidy bun and favored crisp blouses paired with tailored skirts, projecting an air of professionalism that belied her youthful disposition.

Though her job as the receptionist was often a monotonous cycle of answering calls and checking in guests, Clara cherished the stories that unfolded around her. Each day, she scanned the horizon for the unexpected, an adventure hiding among the mundane tasks. Little did Clara know that this seemingly ordinary day would soon unravel a mystery that would forever change her life and the fate of the Redwood Hotel.
