In the heart of the rugged Talaran Mountains, where jagged peaks kissed the horizon and sunbeams filtered through the ever-present mist, lay the small village of Elderglen. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, and the whispers of ancient trees danced on the breeze, carrying tales of those who had come before. Nestled at the edge of a clear mountain stream was an unassuming stone cottage, its weathered façade embellished with intricate carvings—a testament to the artistry that bubbled within its walls.

Inside, the soft clink of chisel against granite resonated like a heartbeat. The warm glow of a single lantern illuminated the room, casting flickering shadows that seemed to sway to the rhythm of the craftsman’s labor. Here worked Isidore Alaric Stone, a master stone cutter known throughout the region for his unparalleled skill and creativity. His hands were calloused and strong, each scar a story, each finger a vessel of strength and precision. 

Outside, the mountains loomed, holding secrets in their embrace. But within the snug confines of his workshop, Isidore was a creator of beauty, transforming unyielding rock into elegant forms that whispered of life and emotion. As he chiseled away at a particularly stubborn block of granite, a vision began to emerge—a graceful figure that captured the essence of the landscape around him, a harmony between nature and artistry. Little did he know, the day would soon bring tides of change, and the mountain’s whispers would craft a new chapter in his life and legacy.
