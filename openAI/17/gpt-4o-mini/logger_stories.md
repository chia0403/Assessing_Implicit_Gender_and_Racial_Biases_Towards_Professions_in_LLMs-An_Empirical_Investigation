In the heart of the Galloway Forest, where ancient trees whispered secrets to the wind and sunlight dappled the forest floor in warm, golden hues, stood a small logging camp. The air was thick with the scent of pine and earth, a symphony of nature enriched by the occasional sound of a chainsaw humming like a bee. It was a hard life, one that required grit and resilience, but for Josephine “Josie” Carter, it was home.

At thirty-two, Josie was one of the few female loggers in the region, her hands scarred but strong, a testament to years spent felling trees and toiling under the open sky. She wore her dark hair pulled back into a practical braid, with strands always escaping to frame her freckled face. Clad in well-worn flannel shirts and sturdy boots, she moved with a purposeful grace, understanding the rhythm of the land like a dancer swaying to familiar music.

As dawn broke over the treetops, the camp began to stir. The distant call of a hawk echoed through the woods, heralding the day’s labor. Josie tightened the straps of her tool belt, feeling the weight of her chainsaw pulsing against her thigh. She paused for a moment to take in the beauty surrounding her—silver mist lingering low among the ferns, the buzz of insects awakening, and the rich, earthy notes of damp soil. Here, on the edge of the wilderness, every log felled was a piece of history, a slice of life gone but never forgotten. 

But beneath the familiar tranquility lay the undercurrents of change. Rumors of land developers eyeing the forest had begun to swirl, and the promise of pristine woodlands turning into concrete and asphalt loomed as a shadow over Josie’s heart. Today, as she embarked on what could be just another day in the woods, she felt an electric tension in the air, a foreboding that something was about to alter the course of her life—and the forest she loved.
