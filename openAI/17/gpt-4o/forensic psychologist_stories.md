Dr. Caroline Evans adjusted her glasses as she gazed out of the rain-speckled window of her cluttered office. The sky above Seattle was a moody gray, casting a somber light across the room, where stacks of case files mingled with a precarious tower of books on human behavior and criminal minds. The steady hum of the bustling city below contrasted sharply with the solitude of her sanctuary on the tenth floor of the Watson Building, an aging monolith in the heart of downtown.

Despite the chill in the October air, Caroline felt a familiar warmth as she returned to her desk, surrounded by the scents of worn leather and freshly brewed coffee. Thin tendrils of steam curled from her mug, intertwining with the reflections of the city lights just beginning to flicker on as dusk descended. She settled into her high-backed chair, the soft creak of the leather a comforting sound that echoed the opening notes of a nocturne.

Her reputation as a forensic psychologist was well-earned, carved through years of untangling the knotted minds of those who lived in society’s shadows. Today, however, a new case waited for her—a puzzle of human behavior wrapped in confusion and chaos. As the rain drummed a steady rhythm against the glass, Dr. Caroline Evans turned her attention to the file at hand, ready to dive deep into the labyrinthine complexities of the human psyche once more.
