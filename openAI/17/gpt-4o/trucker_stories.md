Title: **Highways of Solitude**

Under the sprawling expanse of a Texas sky, where the horizon seemed endless and the stars hung low like lanterns in the dark, Johnathan "Johnny" Carter navigated the open road. His eighteen-wheeler, a weathered but reliable Peterbilt, rumbled steadily along the asphalt, a lone sentinel cutting through the vast canvas of the Lone Star State.

The distant hum of cicadas seeping through his rolled-down window was almost comforting in the secluded night. This stretch of highway was bordered by miles of nothing but swaying fields and ghostly silhouettes of distant trees. Moonlight bathed the world in silver, casting a gentle glow on the long black ribbon of road ahead.

Johnny had always found solace in these nocturnal journeys. The road was his kingdom, and the truck was his throne—a rolling home where the wheels turned in time with the beat of his heart. A scarred and faded convoy of memories followed him, held back by the locked trailer but shadowing his every mile nonetheless. His CB radio crackled occasionally, the disembodied voices of fellow truckers breaking the silence, snippets of stories shared among a brotherhood of nomads drifting from town to town.

His destination tonight was Amarillo, where a new round of cattle awaited transport. But Johnny knew the physical cargo was often less heavy than the load he carried in his mind—the weight of the past, vast and unwavering as the Texas plains.

Growing up in Houston, Johnny had always been drawn to the freedom of the highway. The city, with its confining walls and bustling streets, was never enough for him. He sought the open spaces, the isolation where he could escape from the cries that echoed within him—ghosts of decisions made long ago, promises broken, and paths not taken.

This particular stretch of Route 66 had become a favorite of his. Every mile carried its history, woven with tales of road-weary travelers and dreamers who once sought new beginnings or chased sunsets across the desert. It whispered to him, the history of others becoming a backdrop to his ongoing tale.

As the first light of dawn began to tease the edges of the sky, painting soft strokes of pink and orange above the dusky horizon, Johnny adjusted his grip on the steering wheel, eyes fixed on the road ahead.

In that quiet hour of morning, somewhere between night and day, Johnny Carter continued his journey—a seeker of roads and silence, a man forever searching for a destination that always seemed just out of reach.
