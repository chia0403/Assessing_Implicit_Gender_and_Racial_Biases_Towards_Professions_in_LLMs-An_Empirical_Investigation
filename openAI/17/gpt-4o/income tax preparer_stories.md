Amid the muted hum of an office tucked away on the third floor of an aging brick building, the air was tinged with the distinct aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the faint rustling of papers. The sign outside read "Allan Witherspoon Tax Services," a modest title befitting the man who sat diligently at his desk, immersed in a world of numbers and forms.

Allan Witherspoon, the man behind the shingle, was known throughout the quaint town of Millfield for his meticulous work and unwavering dedication. In the corner of his office, a potted fern—his sole concession to decor—leaned thirstily toward the sunlight streaming through the dusty blinds. Allan’s domain was an orderly chaos of stacked folders, a well-thumbed tax code manual, and a computer that had seen better days.

It was early March, the heart of tax season, and the office had come alive with the urgency of looming deadlines. Outside, the remnants of a late winter held their ground, painting the streets with a patchwork of slush and grit. Yet inside, Allan was a steady presence, a calm harbor against the stormy seas of finance that brought the townspeople to his door. As the clock ticked towards yet another appointment, Allan adjusted his glasses, straightened his tie, and prepared to untangle the latest monetary mystery that awaited him. Little did he know, this day would bring a client quite unlike any other, and with them, a secret tied to the very core of Millfield itself.
