In the heart of the English countryside, where the morning mist lingered like a veil over the rolling hills, lay the sprawling estate of Everwood Manor. The manor, an architectural marvel from the Victorian era, stood regal and untouched by the clutches of time. Its grandeur was complemented by lush gardens that seemed to bloom eternally, bursting with colors and scents that danced through the air with every whisper of the wind.

As dawn broke over Everwood, casting a golden hue upon the dew-kissed earth, Edward Thorne began his day. He was a man of solitude and diligence, revered for his unwavering commitment to the estate's verdant expanses. Edward, the head groundskeeper of Everwood Manor, had spent nearly half a century tending to every blade of grass, every towering oak, and every blooming rose that graced the estate.

With a weathered countenance that mirrored the timeworn beauty of the manor itself, Edward moved with a quiet grace, his movements deliberate and practiced. His hands, calloused from years of labor, cradled the earth as if it were a fragile relic. To him, each plant was a living, breathing entity deserving of care and reverence.

The gardens were his sanctuary, a place where the world fell away, leaving only the symphony of nature's melodies to fill the void. In the secluded corners of Everwood's vast grounds, Edward found solace amidst the rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of the pond's water, where water lilies floated like delicate dancers upon its surface.

As the sun ascended, casting playful shadows across the manicured lawns, Edward Thorne paused, leaning against the ancient yew that stood sentinel over the southern gardens. A soft smile crept upon his lips, for this day was special. Today, he would meet the mysterious new owner of Everwood Manor, a presence that could alter the harmony of the grounds he so lovingly cherished.
