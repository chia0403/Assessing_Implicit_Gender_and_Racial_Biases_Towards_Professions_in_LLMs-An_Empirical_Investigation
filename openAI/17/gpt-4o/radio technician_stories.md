In the heart of the bustling city of New Haven, where the cacophony of honking cars and distant chatter mingled with the crisp autumn air, stood a nondescript brick building with ivy creeping up its tired facade. The building housed the headquarters of Titan Wave Broadcasting, a place that seemed to hum with invisible energy. It was here, nestled amidst the coils of cables and towering rows of transmitter equipment, that Hazel Montgomery thrived.

As a seasoned radio technician, Hazel had an innate understanding of the complex world of frequencies and signals that formed the backbone of the city's communications. Her workspace, neatly organized yet buzzing with purpose, offered a birds-eye view of the labyrinthine transit system far below and the glinting spires that pierced the sky. Her station, replete with an array of oscilloscopes, signal analyzers, and well-loved tools, was where Hazel felt most at home.

Today, golden threads of late afternoon sunlight spilled through the narrow windows, casting warm spots of light over the workbench where Hazel prepared for her next challenge. She adjusted her glasses and brushed a strand of coppery hair from her eyes, her gaze fixed on a particularly stubborn transmitter that had been acting up and threatening the clarity of the city's beloved evening jazz hour. As she delved into her work, the rhythmic hum of the machinery around her seemed to echo her own heartbeat, a comforting reminder of the vital role she played in the city's intricate soundscape.
