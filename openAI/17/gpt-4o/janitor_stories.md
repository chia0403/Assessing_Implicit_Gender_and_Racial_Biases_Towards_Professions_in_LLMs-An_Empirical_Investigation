In the heart of downtown Boston, where the hum of the city never truly ceased, stood the towering, timeworn structure of the Anderson Building. Built a century ago with cold gray stone and intricate ironwork, it loomed majestically at the corner of Elm and Washington, casting long shadows that melded into the bustling streets below.

Inside the building, amidst the rhythmic clatter of keyboards and the soft whirring of air conditioners, the fragrance of fresh polish and clean linen quietly greeted everyone who entered. It was here, in the whispering corridors and echoing stairwells, that Kenneth "Kenny" Evers found his solace and his purpose. Known best for his unrelenting dedication to his work, Kenny was not just a janitor; he was the silent guardian of this edifice.

Each morning before dawn, he arrived with his weathered leather satchel slung over one shoulder, moving through the building as if it were a sacred ritual. At 48, with graying hair and kind, faded blue eyes, Kenny had long given up the dreams of youth, but he found contentment in the measure of his days. His world consisted of routine and rhythmâ€”the comforting predictability of sweeping, mopping, and tidying, while outside, the world often surged with chaos.

Every darkened hallway held its mysteries and every office told a story through forgotten papers and errant coffee cups. Yet, it was the rooftop that Kenny favored most. Here, amid the wheeling flocks of city pigeons and the distant honking of cars, he often took his breaks, gazing out over a sea of twinkling lights that ran off into the horizon, leaving his imagination free to roam. Little did he know, this very morning would bring a change so profound that not even the whispers within these walls could have foretold it.
