As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, casting a golden hue across the sprawling estate, Eulalia Thornton stood at the edge of the grand garden, clutching a cup of steaming tea. The morning air was crisp and invigorating, carrying with it the faint fragrance of the late-blooming jasmine that twined across the iron gates. Eulalia, known to the staff as Mrs. Thornton, took a deep breath, savoring the sense of tranquility that only these early hours could provide.

The manor, a towering relic of the 19th century with ivy-clad walls and ornate stonework, was nestled on the outskirts of the sleepy village of Hawthorne Glen. Its many rooms held secrets of generations past, whispered stories embedded in every creaking floorboard and flickering shadow. To Eulalia, this was more than just a place of work; it was a living, breathing entity, demanding care and respect.

Inside, the house waited—silent and still, its grand halls echoing with memories of laughter and music, though now only the gentle hum of modern utilities provided a soundtrack to the day. Eulalia had worked here for over two decades, her presence as much a part of the manor as the antique furniture and faded tapestries. Her days were filled with the rhythmic routine of dusting, polishing, and ensuring that everything remained in impeccable order. To outsiders, it might seem a monotonous life, but to her, it was a vocation, a testament to her dedication and attention to detail.

As the first glimmers of sunlight spilled through the leaded windows, Mrs. Thornton turned from the garden and headed back inside, her steps steady and purposeful. Today, she thought, would be like any other—or so she hoped. But in a house as old as Hawthorne Manor, even the most ordinary days could hold the promise of surprise.
