On a blustery autumn morning, the ivy-clad walls of Cumberland University stood sentinel against the brisk winds sweeping across the campus. Inside the hallowed halls of the Humanities Building, past rows of ancient oak bookshelves teeming with leather-bound tomes and rare first editions, Professor Eliza Carrington busied herself in her cluttered office. The scent of aged paper mingled with the earthy aroma of roasting chestnuts wafting through the open window, which overlooked the sprawling quad below.

Professor Carrington, a venerable scholar in medieval literature, had long ago surrendered any pretense of orderliness in favor of a creative chaos that fueled her intellect. Her office was a labyrinth of manuscripts, each teetering perilously on top of the next, with peculiar artifacts peeking out from between the stacks—a tarnished goblet, a twisted piece of ironwork, a broken lute string, all whispering stories of their own.

That morning, as Eliza sifted through the papers on her desk, searching for a misplaced article on Chaucerian allegory, a sense of anticipation tingled in the crisp air. Her students, a curious mix of eager undergraduates and dedicated graduate aspirants, would soon fill the lecture hall for her popular seminar on myths and legends. Today, she intended to unravel the layers of the King Arthur narrative, prying open the myths to expose the roots of human aspiration and folly intertwined within.

But it was not the impending class that filled Professor Carrington’s heart with restlessness. It was a long-sealed letter she had received the previous night, its edges frayed and its ink slightly smudged, inviting her to unravel a mystery that had lingered beneath the surface of her life for decades. As the clock ticked toward ten, she tucked the letter into her leather satchel and stepped out into the drafty corridor, ready, though unknowingly, to commence not only her lecture but a journey far beyond the confines of academia.
