In the early glow of dawn, a thin veil of mist clung to the quiet stretches of Highway 61, casting an ethereal shroud over the landscape. The road unfurled through vast swathes of cornfields, their rows standing like attentive soldiers awaiting orders. Distant silhouettes of century-old oaks punctuated the horizon, their gnarled branches reaching skyward, burdened with the weight of untold stories. The air was crisp, tinged with the earthy aroma of wet soil and distant rain.

Marlon Hayes, a seasoned trucker with lines of the road etched permanently onto his weathered face, sat behind the wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, a massive blue Freightliner that gleamed like a sapphire in the suffused morning light. Known for his calm demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of America's highways, Marlon was a staple in the trucking community—a solitary figure traversing the tapestry of the nation’s backroads and expressways.

The rhythmic hum of the engine was both reassuring and isolating, blending harmoniously with the subtle cadence of tires on asphalt. Marlon sipped his coffee, its warmth seeping into his bones as he mentally checked off the miles to his next destination, a grain depot nestled in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. The route was familiar, yet the journey always held the promise of something unexpected, a silent invitation to the stories that lingered just beyond the horizon.

As the truck roared past a faded sign for the once-booming town of Mayfield, remnants of another life flitted across Marlon's mind—a life before highways were endless and home was a place, not just a feeling. For now, though, the road stretched ahead like a faithful companion, and Marlon knew it would lead him, for better or worse, to whatever awaited beyond the edges of his map.
