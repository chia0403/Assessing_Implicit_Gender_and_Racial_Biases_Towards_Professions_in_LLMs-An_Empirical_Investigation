Title: **The Echoes Beneath**

In the sleepy town of Eldergrove, where mist clings to the edges of the cobbled streets like memories reluctant to leave, the dawn chorus was rarely more than a murmur. It was a place where the past whispered through the town's ancient oaks and the river hummed tales of yore as it snaked its way under ancient stone bridges. Here, nestled between the timeless hills and the sprawling meadows, lived Edward “Eddie” Thompson—a man as practical as the calloused hands he worked with daily, and as essential to the town as the water that flowed through its veins.

Eddie was Eldergrove’s only plumber, a title passed down through four generations. His grandfather once boasted that Thompson blood ran through the town's pipes as surely as water did. Eddie wouldn’t have gone that far, but he knew a thing or two about leaks and blockages—both in plumbing and the chained tapestry of human lives.

On this particular morning, the sky threatened rain in a lazy, noncommittal way, and Eddie had just swung his legs out of bed, hearing the familiar creak of floorboards that seemed to echo a greeting. He stretched, feeling the satisfying pop of stiff joints, before heading downstairs. The scent of fresh coffee mingled with the aroma of last night’s stew—a comfort only interrupted by the sharp ring of the phone.

Amidst the rhythmic ticking of the wall clock, he grabbed the receiver, a relic from some bygone era, expecting Mrs. Patterson’s usual call about the leaky faucet in her bathroom. Instead, the voice on the other end was unfamiliar and cautious, wrapped in layers of urgency and secrecy. 

“Is this Edward Thompson, the plumber?” the voice queried, each word carefully measured.

“Yes, that’s me. How can I help you?” Eddie replied, curiosity pricking at his mind like static before a storm.

But before the stranger could respond, the line crackled, splitting the morning’s quiet with its static, leaving Eddie with only the echo of unanswered questions and the distant rumble of approaching rain.
