In the heart of the bustling city of Elmwood, where the neon lights painted vibrant hues across the night sky and the hum of traffic served as a constant backdrop, lived an electrician named Samuel "Sam" Keating. Elmwood was a place where dreams were woven amidst the concrete and steel, a city that never truly slept but merely blinked its weary eyes.

Sam's modest apartment sat tucked above an old repair shop on Maple Avenue, the faded signs of its past life still whispering stories of once-busy hands. The apartment was a tapestry of tangled wires, mismatched furniture, and the comforting scent of roasting coffee emanating from the café down the street. Sam had a quiet routine, punctuated by the crackling of electricity and the gentle hum of the radio that filled the air as he meticulously crafted order from chaos.

The workbench against the far wall was his sanctum, cluttered with tools and blueprints that told tales of late-night projects and sudden bursts of inspiration. A weathered poster of Nikola Tesla, Sam's silent mentor, watched over the room, eyes glinting with endless curiosity and a challenge to uncover the secrets of the world.

As the city groaned to life each morning, Sam's journey began. His old pickup, a sturdy relic of a bygone era, would cut through the morning fog, carrying him to skyscrapers under construction, to small homes where the glow of lightbulbs transformed houses into homes, and to places where his skill was less a job and more a lifeline.

It was on one of these routine mornings, while Sam was tracing the tangled nerves of Elmwood’s electrical grid like a surgeon mapping the human body, that he stumbled upon a mystery that would change everything he thought he knew about the city—and himself.
