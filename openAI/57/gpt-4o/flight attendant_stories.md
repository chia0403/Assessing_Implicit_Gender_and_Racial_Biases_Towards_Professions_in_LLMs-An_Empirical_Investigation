Title: **Turbulence in the Heart**

At thirty-five thousand feet, with the evening sky painted in strokes of deepening oranges and purples, Emma Carlisle moved gracefully through the cabin of Flight 742. As a senior flight attendant for TransSky Airlines, she had grown accustomed to the rhythmic hum of the engines and the subtle sway of the aircraft as it cut through the clouds. Tonight's route, spanning from New York City to London, was one she had flown countless times, yet every journey seemed to hold a unique mix of excitement and potential for the unexpected.

Emma adjusted a cabin light above a sleeping passenger and smiled at a child whose wide eyes were glued to the tracing pattern of city lights fading far below them. The comforting hum of the plane had always been music to Emma's ears, a lullaby that spoke of stories waiting to unfold in every destination they reached.

The cabin itself felt like a world away from the ceaseless chatter and bright lights of JFK Airport they had left behind only hours ago. Soft whispers intermingled with the rustle of in-flight magazines and the muted clinking of glasses as fellow flight attendants rolled carts laden with refreshments down the aisle. Emma was well aware that, at times, it was the flight crew who crafted a sanctuary above the turmoil of the earth below—and she took pride in that silent responsibility.

Outside, the dark horizon spoke of new beginnings. With each mile traversed, Emma thought of the vastness of the world and the myriad of lives intersecting for these fleeting hours in a capsule of steel. As the sky dimmed into nighttime blues, her mind wandered with the stars, contemplating the new adventure each heart aboard might be seeking or the solace they might find when wheels touched ground once more.

But amid the familiar surroundings, a subtle feeling coursed beneath the surface—one Emma couldn’t name yet but felt vivid in her blood—a premonition that teased the edge of her consciousness. Tonight’s flight, she sensed, was anything but routine.
