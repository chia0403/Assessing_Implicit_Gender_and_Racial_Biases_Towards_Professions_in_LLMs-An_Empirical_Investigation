In the heart of a sprawling metropolis where shadows draped over neon-lit streets like a threadbare cloak, the city never slept but rather stayed alert, pulsing with the hum of life after dark. Rain, a relentless companion in this concrete jungle, fell in steady sheets, turning the streets into rivers that reflected the glimmering signs of all-night diners and 24-hour theaters. Through this urban tapestry ran a figure who thrived when the world seemed intent on slumber—the private detective Geraldine "Gerry" Ashton.

Gerry's office, nestled on the fourth floor of an aging art deco building on the edge of downtown, was a sanctuary of sorts for secrets waiting to be unearthed. The building itself stood defiantly against the encroaching modern skyscrapers, whispering tales of lost eras amidst its tarnished bronze fixtures and faded elegance. Inside, her office was a medley of organized chaos: case files piled precariously on a vintage oak desk, walls lined with corkboards brimming with notes and photographs, and a single, dim lamp casting a sepia glow over it all.

Tonight, however, her focus was neither on the chaotic exterior of the room nor the storm outside, but on the rhythmic knocking of rain against her window. It was a sound she found soothing—a backdrop for contemplation as she sat with a mug of strong, black coffee cradled in her hands, peering through the curtains of half-formed plans and suspicions that danced in her mind.

An unexpected knock at the door brought her back to the present. With a glance at the clock on the wall—a ticking guardian of Time's constant march—she rose from her chair, curiosity piqued. Few people ventured into her world at this hour without dire need, and it was this need that often propelled cases of intrigue into her lap. As she crossed the room, the city outside seemed to hold its breath, waiting on the cusp of a tale yet to be told.
