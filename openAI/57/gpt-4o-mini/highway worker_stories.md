The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden glow over the winding asphalt of Route 77, a lifeline threading through the undulating hills of Oakwood County. Dust motes danced in the light, caught in the gentle breeze that swept across the roadside. It was early autumn, and the vibrant reds and oranges of the leaves were just beginning to emerge, promising a picturesque scene over the next few weeks.

At the edge of a work zone, a faded red pickup truck was parked, its bed filled with tools and signage declaring the area a construction zone. Standing beside it, with a hard hat perched atop his head and reflective gear that gleamed in the dwindling sunlight, was Harold Timothy Jennings. A seasoned highway worker in his mid-forties, Harold was a man of few words but immense expertise, having spent nearly two decades patching potholes and repairing guardrails along the county's roads. He breathed in the crisp autumn air, filled with the earthy scent of falling leaves and distant bonfires, a welcome reprieve from the concrete and tar that usually surrounded him.

Today, he was tasked with replacing a series of faded lane markings that had grown obscured over the summer. As he unrolled a bright yellow line from the spool, Harold's thoughts drifted to the lives intertwined with this highwayâ€”the commuters who would rush past, the families embarking on road trips, and the solitary travelers weaving their stories into the fabric of these roads. With each stroke of paint, he felt a sense of connection, a fleeting but profound impact on the world that passed by his work, even if most people took it for granted. Little did Harold know, this quiet stretch of highway would soon become the backdrop to a twist of fate that would alter the course of his life forever.
