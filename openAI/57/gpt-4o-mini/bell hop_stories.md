In the heart of bustling Manhattan, the bright lights of the city cast long shadows on the cobblestone streets below the ornate façade of The Grand Arkadia Hotel. The air was thick with the scent of roasted chestnuts from a nearby vendor, mingling with the faint, fragrant hints of lavender from the flower shop across the street. 

Inside the lobby, polished marble gleamed under the dazzling chandelier, its crystals refracting light into a kaleidoscope of colors. Though the space was filled with the chatter of guests and the clanking of glasses from the bar, a quiet rhythm pulsed beneath the surface—a rhythm that belonged to the unsung heroes of the hotel: the bellhops.

Amid the graceful hustle, twenty-five-year-old Cornelius "Cory" Treadwell stood poised near the ornate brass elevator doors. His crisp uniform, complete with gold epaulets and a name tag pinned just so, marked him as a fixture of The Grand Arkadia. With hazel eyes that sparkled with curiosity and dark hair neatly slicked back, Cory was much more than just a bellhop; he was a dreamer caught in the web of others' stories. Each guest that strode through the lobby with their designer luggage and whispered secrets sparked an ember of adventure within him, and he found himself yearning for more than the routine of delivering bags and escorting patrons to their rooms.

Today, however, was different. As Cory leaned against the polished wooden counter, he caught sight of a woman entering the lobby—a striking figure cloaked in an emerald-green trench coat, her raven-black hair cascading in waves around her shoulders. There was something enigmatic about her presence, something that made his heart skip a beat. Little did Cory know, this moment marked the beginning of a journey that would unravel the threads of his life, leading him far beyond the walls of The Grand Arkadia and into a world he had always dreamed of but never dared to explore.
