In the heart of Riverview, a quaint town nestled between rolling hills and shimmering streams, the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm hue over the brick-lined streets. The air was thick with the scent of fresh-cut grass and blooming wildflowers, but beneath this picturesque facade lay a labyrinth of pipes and dreams, a world known only to those who ventured beneath the surface.

At the edge of town, just across from the bustling marketplace, stood Tanner L. Wexford's modest plumbing shop, "Wexford's Waterways." The wooden sign creaked gently in the evening breeze, its faded letters telling tales of years spent fixing leaks and clearing drains. Tanner, a broad-shouldered man in his mid-thirties with a tousled mop of chestnut hair and a perpetual smudge of grease on his cheek, thrived in his element. With hands calloused from years of work and a toolbelt perpetually slung low on his hips, he was known throughout Riverview not just for his plumbing skills but for his hearty laugh and warm smile that could ease any homeowner's worries.

As Tanner knelt beside an ancient copper pipe in a dusty crawlspace, the light from his headlamp flickered, illuminating the cobwebs that danced in the corners. The job had started as a routine fix—just a small leak beneath the old Peterson house—but he quickly realized it was far more complex. The pipes were like the town itself, a history buried beneath layers of years and repairs, each bend and turn a story waiting to be uncovered. Little did Tanner know, however, that tonight’s job would lead him not just into the depths of plumbing, but into the heart of a mystery that had long plagued Riverview, calling him to unravel secrets that lay beneath its very foundations.
