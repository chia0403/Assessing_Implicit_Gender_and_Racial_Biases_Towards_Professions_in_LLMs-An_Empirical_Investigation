Title: Whispers in the Attic

Setting: The story unfolds in Elderwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian estate perched on the outskirts of the small town of Willow Creek. The mansion, with its intricately carved wooden gables, faded turrets, and a garden long overgrown with wildflowers and creeping ivy, tells tales of a bygone era. Dust motes dance in the slants of afternoon sunlight filtering through the tall, arched windows, illuminating the faded wallpaper adorned with floral patterns that have begun to peel away. The air is filled with the mysterious scents of old books and polished wood, mingling with the faintest hint of lavender.

Opening: 

Morning sunlight streamed through the tall windows of Elderwood Manor, casting elongated shadows that clung to the floor like secrets waiting to be uncovered. In the heart of this grand but neglected home,  Clara Mae Hendricks, the housekeeper, hummed an old folk tune as she carefully dusted the elaborate mantelpiece in the parlor. Clara, in her mid-forties, with chestnut hair pulled back in a neat bun and a pair of keen green eyes that missed little, moved about her daily chores with a mixture of reverence and routine. 

Having spent the better part of a decade in this crumbling estate, she had come to know its creaks and sighs as intimately as she knew her own heart. The sprawling halls, with their dim lighting and myriad of rooms, felt like a universe unto themselves, each corner holding stories of the family she served—the Allens—and the echoes of laughter that once filled its empty spaces.

But today was different. An unsettling chill seemed to linger in the air, making the hair on Clara's neck stand at attention. As she polished the antique silverware, her mind wandered to the attic—a place she seldom visited. It had been years since she’d climbed the narrow, spiraling staircase to that dusty realm. Whispers of the past beckoned her, and for reasons she couldn't quite explain, she felt drawn toward the secrets waiting to be unearthed in the shadows above. 

Little did Clara know that today would unravel the threads of her carefully arranged life, leading her into a mystery that had lain dormant within the walls of Elderwood Manor for far too long.
