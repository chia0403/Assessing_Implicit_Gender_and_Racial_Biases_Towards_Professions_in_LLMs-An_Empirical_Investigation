The sun spilled its golden light over the quaint village of Alderwood, where the scent of pine permeated the air. Nestled between rolling hills and the whispering brook that wound its way through the heart of town, weathered cottages lined the cobblestone streets, their rustic charm a testament to generations long past. In a modest workshop at the edge of the village, Anton Elias Thorne worked diligently, his hands skillfully shaping raw timber into rustic furniture that seemed to pulse with life.

The workshop was a sanctuary of sorts—tools hung from the walls, each with its own tale of craftsmanship and patience; shavings littered the floor like fallen leaves in autumn. A gentle hum of a nearby saw harmonized with the rhythmic tapping of Anton’s hammer, blending into a melody of diligence that characterized his days. As a master carpenter, Anton poured his soul into every piece he created, believing that each structure held not just wood but the essence of the stories waiting to be told by those who would one day use them. 

Today, however, felt different. An unfamiliar tension loomed in the air, like the quiet before a storm. Anton paused, wiping his brow with the back of his hand, the faint sound of footsteps approaching outside drawing his attention. He peered through the dusty window, squinting at the figure crossing the threshold of his workshop. It was a stranger—clad in cloaks that fluttered against the wind, their face obscured by shadows. 

Whatever business had brought them here to Alderwood, Anton sensed it would change more than just the wood he worked with; it threatened to carve a new path in his life, one that he could never have anticipated.
