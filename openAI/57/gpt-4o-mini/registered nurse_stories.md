In the heart of Crescent Valley, a small town surrounded by rolling hills and whispering forests, stood Willow Creek Hospital. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of blooming wildflowers from the nearby gardens. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed softly, casting a sterile glow on the bustling corridors filled with the sounds of hurried footsteps and the distant beep of medical equipment.

At the center of this whirlwind was Kristina Marie Bennett, a dedicated registered nurse known for her calm demeanor and unyielding compassion. With her dark hair pulled back into a practical bun and a stethoscope draped around her neck, Kristina moved effortlessly through the emergency department, her keen green eyes scanning the faces of both patients and colleagues. She had always felt a calling to care for others, a calling that kept her anchored in a world brimming with chaos and uncertainty. 

Today, however, was different. As she prepared for her shift, a sense of dread hung in the air, heavier than the usual morning rush. An unexpected storm was brewing on the horizon, and whispers of a deadly outbreak were beginning to ripple through the community. Kristina could feel the tension rising among her fellow nurses as they gathered in the break room, exchanging anxious glances and hushed conversations. Little did they know that this day would change their lives—and the fabric of Crescent Valley—forever.
