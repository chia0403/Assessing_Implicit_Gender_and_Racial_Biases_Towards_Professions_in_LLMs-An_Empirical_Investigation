In the quaint village of Eldergrove, where cobblestone streets wound like ribbons through meadows of wildflowers, the morning sun cast a warm golden hue over the rooftops. The air was rich with the scent of fresh bread baking at the corner bakery and the distant murmur of the nearby stream, which wound like a silver thread through the landscape. 

At the heart of this idyllic scene stood a humble butcher shop, its weathered sign creaking gently in the breeze. "Carter’s Cuts" was painted in cheerful red letters above the door, inviting passersby to step inside. The shop was a riot of colors, with strings of sausages dangling from the ceiling and sides of beef hanging in a cool, shadowed walk-in.

The butcher himself, **Alistair James Carter**, was a sturdy man in his early forties, with calloused hands and a thoughtful brow. His dark hair was flecked with silver, and his emerald green apron was splattered with the traces of a day’s work. Alistair was not just a tradesman; he was a storyteller, a confidant, and a keeper of the village’s secrets. People came to him not only for the highest quality meats but also for the warmth he exuded — the kind of warmth that made them feel at home amidst the clamor of life.

As the sun reached its zenith and birds chirped merrily outside, Alistair sharpened his knives with a practiced hand, readying himself for another bustling day. Little did he know, today would bring more than just customers; it would unravel a mystery as old as the village itself, draped in the very cuts of meat he so lovingly prepared.
