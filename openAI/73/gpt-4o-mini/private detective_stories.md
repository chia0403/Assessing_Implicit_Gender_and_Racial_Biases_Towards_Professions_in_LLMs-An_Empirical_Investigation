The rain fell in a steady, rhythmic patter against the grimy windows of Lark & Co. Investigations, a small, cluttered office nestled between a thrift shop and a tattoo parlor in the heart of downtown New Haven. The flurries of fog rolled in with the evening chill, casting an ethereal glow from the streetlamps that fought to penetrate the thickening mist. Inside, the air was heavy with the scent of stale coffee and old books, an aroma that had become the persistent backdrop of the life of Veronica Elise Thorne, private detective.

Veronica leaned back in her creaking chair, her fingers tapping a bluesy rhythm against a pile of case files. With chestnut hair pulled into a loose bun and a well-worn trench coat draped over her slender frame, she cut an enigmatic figure, a mix of intellect and grit. The walls of her office, adorned with newspaper clippings and shadowy photographs of past cases, whispered tales of intrigue and danger to anyone who cared to listen. On her desk, a flickering neon “Open” sign buzzed gently, a constant reminder that the city had many secrets waiting to be uncovered.

It was one of those evenings when the heaviness of the world seemed to settle in thick fogs—just as her thoughts lurked in shadows, obscuring clarity with questions that had no easy answers. A well-pressed note sat in her in-tray, the only sign of life for the day. It was an anonymous tip, scrawled in erratic handwriting, hinting at a scandal involving one of New Haven’s most influential families. Veronica Thorne felt the adrenaline surge within her as she contemplated the mystery ahead; it might just be the case that would shake the very foundations of the city.
