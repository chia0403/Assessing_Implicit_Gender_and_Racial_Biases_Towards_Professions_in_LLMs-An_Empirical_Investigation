**Title: Ember's Edge**

**Setting:**

The sleepy town of Clearwater, nestled at the foot of the Evergreen Mountains, wakes each morning to the sound of birds chirping and the gentle rustle of leaves in the summer breeze. The horizon is painted with hues of orange and pink as dawn breaks, and the small community revels in the warmth of another day. At the heart of Clearwater stands the old fire station, its brick façade adorned with the scratches and patches of time. The gleaming red fire engine sits proudly out front, ready to race into action at a moment’s notice.

But this summer, an unrelenting drought has gripped the area, and the residents of Clearwater carry an air of tension as the threat of wildfires looms ominously. The scars of last year’s fires linger in the minds of the townsfolk, a haunting reminder of nature’s fury. The scent of ash still clings to the earth, reminding everyone that danger is never too far away.

**Opening:**

As the sun crested the mountains, shining down through the large bay doors of the fire station, Firefighter Charlotte "Charlie" McAllister stood at attention, her posture as firm as the steel beams surrounding her. At twenty-eight years old, Charlie was no stranger to emergencies, having spent nearly a decade battling flames that licked the edges of the vast forests her small town called home. Her short, dark hair glistened with sweat as she fastened her helmet, the light glinting off the brass badge pinned to her chest—The Clearwater Fire Department.

Today felt different. A heavy atmosphere hung in the air, filled with apprehension, as the radio buzzed with updates from the nearby mountain ranges. "Smoke reported in Timber Hollow," crackled the voice, urgency layered within the static. Charlie exchanged glances with her partner, Tim, whose brows were knit tight with concern. They understood the stakes; lives and lands depended on the efforts of every firefighter in the crew.

As she slid into the driver's seat of the engine, her heart raced. She thought of the families in Timber Hollow, of the children playing in their backyards as the fire threatened to consume everything they held dear. With a deep breath, Charlie gripped the steering wheel, ready to lead her team into the uncertain maelstrom. Today, they wouldn’t just be fighting flames; they would be fighting for their community, for hope, and for the chance to reclaim the peace that had been so cruelly disrupted.
