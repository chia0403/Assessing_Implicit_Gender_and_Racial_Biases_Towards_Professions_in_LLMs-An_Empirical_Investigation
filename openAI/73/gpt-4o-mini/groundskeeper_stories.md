The winds of early autumn whispered through the ancient oaks that lined the sprawling grounds of Graystone Manor, their gnarled branches casting eerie shadows on the stone pathways below. Thick tendrils of mist curled around the edges of the meticulously cared-for lawns, the damp air heavy with the scent of freshly turned earth and wet leaves. At the heart of this estate, nestled in a secluded valley, stood the manor itself: an imposing structure of weathered gray stone, its tall windows reflecting the somber hues of the overcast sky.

Beneath the vast expanse of this estate, Samuel Gresham knelt among the fallen leaves, the satisfying crunch of their decay underfoot a backdrop to his solitary routine. Samuel, a sturdy man in his forties with thick arms and a scruffy beard, had dedicated two decades of his life to tending these grounds, nurturing the beauty of nature amidst the weight of history that hung in the air. The estate had once been a vibrant hub of activity, but now it lay silent, as its owners, long gone, remained merely echoes in the walls.

It was a place where secrets lingered like the morning fog, and Samuel had come to know every inch of it, from the rose garden that had bloomed in riotous colors each spring to the hidden glades where time itself seemed to pause. As he raked the leaves into neat piles, there was an uneasy sense that the past was stirring again, an unseen force lurking just out of sight in the thick of the underbrush. Samuel paused, glancing toward the manor, the chill of the breeze making him shiver despite the work at hand. Something was different today, although he couldn’t quite put his finger on it—a sense that the stillness of Graystone Manor was about to be disturbed.
