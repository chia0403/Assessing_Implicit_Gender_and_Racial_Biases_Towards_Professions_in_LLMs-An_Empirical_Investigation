Title: **Echoes of Yesterday**

Setting: The small coastal town of Windmere, where the salty scent of the ocean mingles with the pungent aroma of aged books in the local high school, Windmere High. The school, a crumbling red-brick structure with ivy creeping up its walls, sits perched on a cliff overlooking the turbulent sea. This late September afternoon, the sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows over the campus, hinting at the approaching autumn.

Opening:

As the final bell rang, signaling the end of another day, Mr. Benjamin Carter gathered his notes from the old wooden desk at the front of his classroom. With a weary sigh, he glanced around the room—the creaky chairs, the faded maps on the walls, and the sprawling oak tree that stood sentinel outside the window. It was a place he had called home for the past ten years, yet today, the classroom felt unusually heavy, filled with echoes of untold stories lurking just beyond the reach of his chalk-covered fingers.

Benjamin stood, brushing crumbs of chalk dust from his navy-blue blazer, and opened the window to let in the crisp ocean breeze. The sound of waves crashing against the cliffs mingled with the distant laughter of students roaming the schoolyard, a bittersweet reminder of the fleeting nature of youth. He had always loved teaching literature, sharing the worlds woven within the pages of dusty classics and modern tales. But recently, a shadow had crept into his heart, a quiet ache that reminded him of his own unfinished chapters.

As he pushed the window wide open, a slip of paper—a handwritten note—fluttered in on the wind, landing softly at his feet. He picked it up, unfolding it with curiosity. The neatly penned lines read, "Mr. Carter, I need your help. Meet me by the old lighthouse after school.” Just as his heart skipped a beat, a cloud drifted across the sun, casting the room into shadow. The weight of unspoken secrets hovered in the air, and Benjamin knew that this note would lead him into a story far deeper than he ever anticipated.
