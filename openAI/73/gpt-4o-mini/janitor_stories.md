In the heart of Hillgrove, a town where the fog rolled in thick every evening, the old Haverstock High School sat like a forgotten monument to a bygone era. Its ivy-covered walls whispered with memories of laughter and heartbreak, but by the time the sun dipped below the horizon, the laughter faded to silence. This was when Evan Theodore Marchant entered. 

Evan had spent the last twenty years mopping the same floors, polishing the same brass fixtures, and sorting through the remnants of students’ lives that littered the hallways—lost notebooks, crumpled notes, and the occasional abandoned lunch. With his faded blue jumpsuit and well-worn sneakers, he moved like a ghost through the building, unseen and unnoticed, yet integral to its very existence. 

On this particularly damp Tuesday evening, Evan had only the gentle hum of the fluorescent lights for company as he pushed his cart of cleaning supplies down the corridor. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust—an aroma both comforting and melancholic, reminding him of the stories that lived within these walls. It was a place where he had become part of the fabric, yet remained perpetually in the shadows. In his solitude, he found a peculiar solace, one that allowed him to ponder the mysteries of human connection, of the dreams that echoed long after the bell had rung. 

But tonight, as he began to scrub at the stubborn stains on the linoleum floor of the chemistry lab, a shiver crawled up his spine. There was something different about this evening; the silence felt charged, as if the very air crackled with an unspoken promise. Little did Evan know, this would be the night that turned the ordinary into the extraordinary, and the ghosts of the past would come rushing back to make themselves known.
