In the heart of Seattle, where the rain drizzled down like a soft, melancholic symphony, the office of Dr. Eleanor Grace Stanton stood as a refuge amid the bustling city. The scent of cedar and lavender wafted gently through the air, a deliberate choice to bring calmness to those who walked through her door. Sunlight, struggling against the clouds, filtered through the large windows, casting a warm glow on the plush, inviting chairs that lined her cozy therapy room. 

Dr. Stanton, a woman in her early forties with wavy chestnut hair and deep-set hazel eyes, was known not just for her academic prowess but for her uncanny ability to connect with her clients on a human level. Each day, she donned her favorite navy cardigan, a comforting staple that wrapped around her like a warm embrace, preparing her for the emotional journeys she would guide her clients through.

But this particular rainy Tuesday brought with it an unusual stillness in the air, as if the city itself was holding its breath. Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, both for herself and for the individuals who sought her counsel. She stared out at the droplets racing down the glass, pondering the questions that would soon fill her office, unaware of the unexpected revelations the day had in store for herâ€”and for a lost soul named Lucas.
