**Title: Shadows of Providence**

**Setting:**
In the bustling city of Lincroft, where the skyline is a jagged silhouette against the setting sun, the air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked asphalt and the promise of impending change. The streets pulse with life, filled with pedestrians hurrying to their destinations, unaware of the drama that lurks just beneath the surface. In the heart of Lincroft lies the Dominion Insurance Agency—a polished glass-and-steel building that stands tall, embodying stability yet hiding a world of secrets. Inside, fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a stark glow on the rows of cubicles filled with ringing telephones and the quiet chatter of agents at work. 

**Opening:**
As the clock struck five, the last rays of daylight filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Dominion Insurance Agency, bathing the polished conference room in a warm golden light. Amid the fading echo of keyboard clicks, Megan Elise Stratton collected her scattered notes, the final remnants of the day’s frantic activity. With a sigh, she closed her laptop, her heart a mix of relief and anxiety. On the surface, Megan was your typical insurance agent: poised, articulate, and adept at navigating the lingo of policies and premiums. But beneath her composed exterior lay a woman driven by an unquenchable thirst for truth—a truth that often eluded her in a world built on numbers and assumptions.

Even as she prepared to head home, the murky details of her latest client case lingered in her mind. The mysterious disappearance of a policyholder just days before a massive payout had ignited a spark of curiosity in her, one she couldn't shake off. As she gathered her things, the flickering fluorescent lights overhead harmonized with an unsettling feeling that something more sinister was at play. With a steadying breath, Megan pushed her chair back and stepped into the corridor, unaware that she was about to dive into a labyrinth of deception, where the stakes were higher than anything she had encountered in her years as an insurance agent.
