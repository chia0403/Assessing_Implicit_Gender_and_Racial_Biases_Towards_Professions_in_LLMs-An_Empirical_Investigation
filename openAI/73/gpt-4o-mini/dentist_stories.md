Dr. Felicity Jane Thornton stood by the large bay window of her dental practice, Thornton Family Dentistry, gazing out at the sun-drenched streets of Maplewood. The quaint town, with its brick-paved roads and rows of blooming cherry blossom trees, was a snapshot of an idyllic life—one that she had envisioned while studying late into the night in dental school. 

Inside, the waiting room was filled with the soothing scent of vanilla, a comforting touch she had added to make her patients feel at ease. Children flipped through colorful magazines while their parents chatted about the upcoming Maplewood Spring Festival. The walls were adorned with smiling faces of grateful patients, a testament to the community she had served for over a decade.

Despite the gentle hum of the overhead lights and the soft murmur of voices, a knot of anxiety twisted in Felicity's stomach. Today was different. Today marked the anniversary of her father's passing—a man whose laughter could light up a room and whose hands had taught her the delicate skills she used each day. He had been not only a dentist but also a mentor and a friend, instilling in her the importance of kindness in every interaction.

As she turned from the window, her gaze fell on the gleaming dental chair, the instruments meticulously organized on the counter, and the framed photos of her family lining the walls. Each corner of her practice held echoes of her father's wisdom, a reminder of the legacy she honored with every smile she helped create. But beneath that veneer was a deeper truth, one she had kept buried for too long. Today might be the day to finally confront it.
