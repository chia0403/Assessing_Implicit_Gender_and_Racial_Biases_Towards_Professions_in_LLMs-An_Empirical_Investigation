In the small coastal town of Willow Bay, where the salty breeze mingled with the scent of blooming wildflowers, the charming clinic of Dr. Harold Whitmore stood at the corner of Pine Street. Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, casting a warm glow over the neatly arranged dental tools and the vibrant artwork of local artists adorning the walls. The rhythmic sound of the ocean waves served as a soothing backdrop as patients—a mix of townsfolk and tourists—sat in the waiting area, flipping through magazines or sharing stories of summer adventures.

At the heart of this bustling practice was Eliza May Carter, a dedicated dental hygienist known for her gentle touch and infectious smile. With her teal scrubs and a splash of lavender in her hair, Eliza brought a sense of calm to the often-timid patients who shuffled into the clinic. Her passion for oral health was matched only by her love for the town’s shoreline, where she often spent weekends collecting seashells or painting the picturesque sunsets that ignited the sky in hues of orange and pink.

But as the summer came to a close, change was in the air. Strange occurrences began to unfold in Willow Bay, sparking a sense of unease among the townsfolk. Eliza, with her keen eye for detail and unwavering compassion, quickly found herself at the center of the mystery, uncovering secrets that stretched far beyond the realm of molars and floss. What started as a typical Tuesday with a line of patients soon spiraled into an adventure that would challenge her skills both as a hygienist and as a member of the tight-knit community she loved.
