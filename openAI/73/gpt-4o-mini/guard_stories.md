In the dim glow of the morning sun filtering through the ancient iron bars of Morgrave Keep, the air was thick with the scent of damp stone and the distant echo of clanging metal. The fortress, perched on a rugged cliff overlooking the tumultuous sea, had stood watch for centuries, its walls steeped in tales of valor and betrayal. Today, however, the atmosphere seemed heavier than usual, as if the very stones whispered secrets best left buried.

At the heart of this imposing structure, standing resolute at his post, was guard Elias Thorne. Clad in a somewhat battered suit of armor that glinted dully with age, Elias embodied the steadfastness of the keep itself. His dark hair was cropped short, revealing a few stubborn flecks of gray, and his piercing green eyes scanned the perimeter, always vigilant. A scar traced a jagged line across his left cheek, a remnant of a skirmish long past, lending him an air of formidable presence.

Elias's thoughts drifted momentarily as he squinted at the horizon; there was something unusual about the way the clouds gathered ominously above the waves. Whispers among the guards hinted at a strange ship spotted off the coastâ€”its sails tattered and its purpose unclear. As the wind picked up and the salty spray kissed his face, he steeled himself; today was shaping up to be anything but ordinary within the storied walls of Morgrave Keep.
