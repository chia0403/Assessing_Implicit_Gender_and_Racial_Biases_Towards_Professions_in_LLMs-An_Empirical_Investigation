The neon sign flickered, casting a kaleidoscope of colors against the rain-slicked pavement outside "The Drowned Mermaid," a dimly lit bar nestled in the heart of Willow Creek's old town. Inside, the scent of old wood mingled with the faintest hint of sea salt, a reminder of the nearby coast, though it had been days since the last storm had churned the waves. 

Oliver Jameson stood behind the curved mahogany bar, polishing a whiskey tumbler in a slow, methodical rhythm, as if the motion alone could ward off the lingering heaviness of the evening. His dark hair was tousled, and the thoughtful lines etched on his forehead betrayed a man who had seen more than his fair share of midnight tales and whispered secrets. It was a quiet night, the kind that felt pregnant with anticipation, and his sharp green eyes flicked toward the door every few seconds, waiting for the familiar chime that signaled another patron's arrival.

Tonight, the bar was unusually empty, save for a lone figure seated in the corner — a shadowy silhouette nursing a drink that had long since lost its chill. The muted sounds of a vintage jazz record played softly in the background, intertwining with the sing-song of raindrops tapping rhythmically against the window. Each drop seemed to echo Oliver's curiosity, urging him to uncover the stories lurking in the depths of his patrons, a call he often felt too compelled to ignore.

As the clock crept closer to midnight, Oliver couldn't shake the feeling that this night would be different. Maybe it was the storm clouds rolling in, or perhaps it was just the promise of secrets ready to unfold. He sensed that beneath the surface of his mundane routine, something lurked, a ripple on the still waters of his life — and he was ready to dive in.
