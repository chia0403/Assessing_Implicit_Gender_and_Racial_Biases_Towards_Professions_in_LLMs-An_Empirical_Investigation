In the quiet town of Willowbrook, nestled between the rolling hills and whispering woods, a gentle mist always seemed to linger in the early hours. It hung low over the sprawling estates of Crestwood Manor, where the dew-kissed lawns gleamed like a sea of emeralds. Here, at the break of dawn, was where Samuel "Sam" Hollis found peace in his daily ritual as the manor’s devoted groundskeeper.

Sam, a man of few words with eyes that mirrored the tranquil forest hues, had tended to these gardens for nearly three decades. His hands, calloused yet tender, knew every inch of the grounds, from the century-old oaks to the vibrant beds of roses that lined the cobblestone paths. There was a stillness to his work, a kind of deep-seated rhythm that connected him to the earth and sky around him—elements unchanged by time, unlike the world beyond the manor gates.

As the first light of dawn pierced through the canopy, casting warm golden hues onto the landscaped terraces, Sam wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, savoring the symphony of birdsong and the earthy scent of freshly turned soil. The mornings were his to claim, a brief window of tranquility before the town fully awoke. As he inspected the hydrangeas along the weeping willow-bordered pond, Sam couldn’t shake the feeling that this day held something different, something that whispered secrets only the earth beneath his feet could understand.
