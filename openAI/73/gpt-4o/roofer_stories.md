In the small coastal town of Seacliff, where the salt-laden breeze tangled in the pines and painted everything with a fine, white dust, the mornings arrived softly. Just as the orange sun pierced the mist hanging over the rocky cliffs, Jonas Caldwell climbed into his well-worn truck, the creaking suspension echoing like an old ship on a turbulent sea. At thirty-four, his hands were calloused with the stories of countless rooftops, each tile he laid a testament to the solid reliability he brought to his work.

Jonas lived in a modest, cedar-shingled home of his own construction, an ode to his craftsmanship perched at the edge of the dense woods that hemmed in the town. His yard sloped gently down to the shimmering ocean, where boats bobbed in the harbor like toys forgotten in a bathtub. Every morning, he shared his breakfast with the view, the scent of coffee mingling with the briny air, before setting off to weave his patchwork of shelter across the town.

As the day broke, he steered his way through streets lined with pastel-toned homes, their quaint fa√ßades fading under the relentless salt and sun. Seacliff was a place where everyone knew everyone, and as the town's most dependable roofer, Jonas was greeted warmly by those he passed. His reputation was built not just on his skill but on the steady dedication he lent to every beam and shingle, protecting the homes and histories of those he cherished.

This morning, Jonas's destination was the stately Holloway Manor, an old Victorian perched precariously above the restless sea. Its steep gables and ornate trim were weather-beaten, holding stories and secrets within their warped walls. As he pulled into the gravel driveway, the manor loomed like a grand sentinel over the cliff's edge, its windows reflecting the dawn. A challenge, certainly, but Jonas viewed it as another tale waiting to be woven into the fabric of Seacliff, where the land met the sea, and the past embraced the present.
