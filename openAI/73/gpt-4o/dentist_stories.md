Dr. Marianne Larkspur awoke to the gentle hum of the nearby river that meandered through the heart of Elk Valley. As dawn's first light caressed the frost-laden windows of her quaint, timber-framed cottage, she prepared for another day in the close-knit community that had come to embrace her as both a neighbor and a healer. 

Nestled in the picturesque expanse of Oregon's lush countryside, Elk Valley was a village where time seemed to stretch and bend, echoing the rhythms of the wild landscape. Pine forests clung to the rugged hillsides, and pastures rolled into distant horizons. The air was crisp, punctuated by the occasional call of a hawk soaring above.

Dr. Larkspur’s dental practice sat at the village's edge, where Main Street began its upward climb towards the forest's embrace. The clinic was housed in a charming, ivy-covered building that once served as the town’s post office. Inside, warmth and light flowed through tall windows, illuminating shelves lined with books spanning dentistry, natural healing, and the odd mystery novel — a testament to Marianne's love for puzzles both literal and metaphorical.

As she brewed her coffee, Marianne gazed out through the mist hovering over the river, her thoughts as swirling as the steam rising from her cup. Her mornings offered a tranquility often absent during the day, when patients and their stories filled her world with chatter and laughter. But this quiet moment, just before everything, was her own—a time to breathe and prepare for whatever the day would unveil.
