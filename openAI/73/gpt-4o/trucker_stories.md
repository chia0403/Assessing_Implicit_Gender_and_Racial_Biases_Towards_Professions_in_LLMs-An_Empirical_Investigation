In the pale light of dawn, the roar of a diesel engine punctuated the stillness that lay over the vast, empty stretch of Interstate 40. The sky was a mosaic of soft pinks and deep oranges as the sun inched its way over the horizon, promising another sweltering day in the high desert of New Mexico. This was the world that Caleb Jenkins had come to know intimately — a realm where the sky seemed to stretch forever and the road unwound like a piece of endless ribbon, guiding him from one horizon to the next.

Caleb, a seasoned trucker of nearly two decades, gripped the wheel of his long-nosed Peterbilt with the kind of casual assurance born from years of navigating America’s highways. Every mile marker he passed felt like a silent witness to countless stories etched into the blacktop. His truck, affectionately named "Old Faithful," was more than just a machine; it was his partner and sanctuary on wheels.

Nestled in the cabin that smelled faintly of diesel, coffee, and worn leather, Caleb could feel the hum of the road vibrating through his bones, a comfort and lullaby wrapped into one. The dashboard was a chaotic collage of familiarity - a photo of his daughter, six months into a proud college career, a faded postcard from a beach in Florida, and a lucky rabbit's foot dangling from the rearview mirror, its fur long since worn away by time and thumb passes.

As Albuquerque approached on the horizon, Caleb embraced the solitude and freedom that trucking offered, a world where his schedule was painted by the hues of passing landscapes and the rhythm of his own thoughts. But today, there was something different in the air—an unshakable sense that this journey was leading him toward something unexpected, something that would challenge the worn rut of routine he had carved for himself on these endless roads.
