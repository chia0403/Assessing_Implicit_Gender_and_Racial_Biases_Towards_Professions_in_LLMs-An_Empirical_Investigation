The first light of dawn crept over the horizon, painting the sky in a gradient of soft pinks and oranges. Alongside the lonely stretch of Highway 47, the world was just beginning to stir. Dew glistened on the tall grass lining the roadside, and the air was crisp, carrying with it the earthy scent of damp soil.

At the edge of town, where the highway wound through fields of golden wheat, James "Jimmy" Corcoran pulled his bright orange safety vest over his heavy flannel shirt, its layers a defense against the lingering morning chill. The rhythmic hum of cicadas echoed in the distance, a reminder that summer was yet to release its grip despite the cool dawn.

Jimmy, a tall man with sun-bleached hair and a face weathered by years under the sun, looked out over the expansive stretch of asphalt that would be his responsibility once again today. As a highway worker, he found a certain solace in the routine of maintaining this vital artery, ensuring its smooth continuity ran undisturbed by nature's incessant attempts to reclaim it.

His truck, an old but reliable companion painted in stark white with the town's emblem on its door, was parked by the roadside, loaded with an assortment of tools and supplies. It stood as a solitary sentinel against the quietude of the morning, its engine ticking as it cooled from the journey here.

As Jimmy reviewed the day's work orders—a few potholes to fill, some debris to clear from recent storms—he allowed himself a fleeting moment to appreciate the serenity of the early hour. He knew that once the sun climbed higher, the highway would become a bustling conduit of commerce and travelers, but for now, it was just him, the road, and the awakening world around them.
