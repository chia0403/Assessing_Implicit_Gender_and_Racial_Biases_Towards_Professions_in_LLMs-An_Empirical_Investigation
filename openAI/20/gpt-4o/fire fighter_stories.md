In the sleepy town of Maplewood, where the mornings smelled faintly of dew and freshly brewed coffee, the air hung heavy with the expectation of routine. The streets were lined with trees that, depending on the season, painted the town in blushes of russet and gold or lush shades of verdant green. Nestled at the corner of Elm Street and Alder Avenue stood Engine House No. 7, a steadfast brick building that had seen decades of service.

Inside, the steady hum of early morning activity mingled with the occasional crackling of the radio. Here, amongst the eager chatter of fellow firefighters and the scent of polished leather and smoke perpetually lingering in the air, was where Lieutenant Isabella "Izzy" Merrick felt most at home. Her father, and his father before him, had worn the badge with pride, and to her, it was more than a job—it was a legacy.

As the sun tiptoed over the horizon, casting long shadows through the firehouse windows, Izzy found herself pouring over the daily assignments, her fingers tracing familiar patterns on the well-worn map of their district. Her auburn hair was tied back in a practical ponytail, and her uniform bore the telltale marks of a career spent battling both the relentless flames and the equally challenging bureaucracy that came with the territory.

For Izzy, each day began the same—a ritualized dance of routine preparation—but it never felt mundane. Because in Maplewood, where the ordinary lived side by side with the unexpected, she knew that tranquility could give way to urgency in the blink of an eye. And in those moments, it was her duty to run towards the chaos, to protect her community from fire's merciless grasp.
