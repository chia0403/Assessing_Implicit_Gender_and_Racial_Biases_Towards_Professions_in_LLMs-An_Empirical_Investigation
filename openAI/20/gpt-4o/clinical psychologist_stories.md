Dr. Eleanor Maxwell glanced up from the worn pages of her notebook, her eyes settling on the light that filtered through the tall, arched windows of her office. It was a modest space in downtown Hoboken, its walls adorned with framed diplomas and artwork that evoked a sense of calm—impressionist paintings of serene waters and open fields. Her clients often commented on the atmosphere, its ability to make them feel at ease despite the turbulence that might have brought them to her door.

The room was infused with the earthy scent of sandalwood, courtesy of a small diffuser that sat unobtrusively on a shelf alongside well-thumbed volumes of Jung and Adler. Eleanor had found that simple comforts could provide a sense of anchorage, a small reprieve from the chaotic world outside.

As she prepared for her first session of the day, the city beyond the windows slowly came to life. The street below, Castle Point Terrace, was hushed but beginning to stir with its usual rhythm—cars rolling lazily by, pedestrians starting their morning commutes braced against the crisp autumn air, and the distant hum of the Hudson River, a constant companion just out of sight.

Eleanor took a deep breath, centering herself, as she often instructed her patients to do. Today promised challenges, as every day did, but it also offered the potential for breakthroughs—moments when the clouds part and clarity shines through, however briefly. And for those moments, Eleanor knew, every effort was worthwhile.
