In the pale light of dawn, the world was a tapestry of muted grays and blues, transitioning slowly into warmer hues as the sun fought its way over the horizon. The air was crisp with the promise of a new day, infused with the earthy aroma of dew-kissed asphalt and wildflowers that stubbornly dotted the roadside. Along a stretch of twisting highway carving its way through the Appalachian Mountains, Miles Thompson stood, his silhouette a lone sentinel against the sprawling landscape.

Miles, a seasoned highway worker, had long been accustomed to starting his days before the rest of the world awoke. The orange of his high-visibility vest was the brightest thing for miles around, a beacon of safety and purpose. He took a moment to savor the serenity—his ritual before the rumble of machinery and the call of duty broke the stillness.

The highway was his domain, a living thing constantly in need of attention and care. Each crack and pothole in the road was a familiar story etched into the pavement, speaking of harsh winters and relentless rains. Miles had spent the better part of two decades tending to these roads, a caretaker of the paths that connected lives and destinations. This particular stretch, bordered by dense forests and glimpses of distant peaks, had always felt like a second home to him.

As the first trickle of traffic began to flow, headlights piercing through the mist like curious eyes, Miles set to work. Today, he was part of a small crew tasked with repaving a particularly treacherous bend. With the rhythm of the job came a sense of fulfillment, the kind that only those who build and mend understand.

Little did Miles know, this day would be unlike any other—a day that would unravel secrets long buried beneath layers of asphalt and stone, setting in motion events that would test the very essence of who he was and what he believed in. But for now, as the sun cast its golden glow upon the mountains, all that stood between him and the day's work was the reassuring hum of engines and the miles of road stretching out before him.
