**Title:** Healing by the Harbor

**Opening:**

The smell of salt and the distant call of seagulls melded into the fabric of each day in the small coastal town of Harbor Point. This idyllic enclave, with its craggy cliffs and weathered, pastel-painted cottages, seemed perpetually at ease, resting comfortably between the expansive sky and the restless ocean. Cobbled streets wound cozily through the town, leading to its lively promenade, where the cadence of life slowed to match the ebb and flow of the tide.

Amidst this picturesque charm was the tranquil solitude of Cedar Lane, a narrow street, partially obscured by sprawling oaks draped in Spanish moss. Nestled at the end, beneath the protective canopy of trees, stood a modest, blue-shuttered building with a simple wooden sign swaying gently in the salty breeze: "Harbor Healing Therapy."

Inside, Ella Thompson, the town's only physical therapist, prepared her practice for the day ahead. Her presence was as grounding and soothing as the gentle waves lapping the shore. With her dark curls neatly tied back and her sleeves rolled to the elbow, Ella moved with quiet efficiency, arranging the therapy bands, adjusting exercise equipment, and ensuring the treatment room's wide windows offered an unobstructed view of the sunlit bay beyond.

To Ella, healing was an art as much as it was a science, and she treated each patient with the meticulous care of an artist sculpting clay, aware that each gesture, each nudge toward movement, was part of a larger journey to wholeness. As the first light of morning spilled across the hardwood floors, the humble therapy space transformed into a sanctuary of hope and transformation for all who entered.

Today, she was readying herself for a particularly busy morning, the first appointment being someone new to the town who had mentioned in their emails the struggles following a difficult recovery. The anticipation of meeting each new patient always filled Ella with a kind of excited trepidation, wrapped in a promise to aid as best as she could; it reminded her of why she returned here, to this haven by the sea.
