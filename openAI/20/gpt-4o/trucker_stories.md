The horizon was a smeared watercolor of oranges and purples as the sun dipped low behind the Appalachian Mountains. A solitary figure sat behind the wheel of a weathered eighteen-wheeler, its once-bright blue paint now faded and speckled with rust from years of long hauls and harsh weather. The rig, affectionately named “Old Faithful” by its owner, rumbled steadily along the winding highway that cut through the dense forest, its roar a comforting hum that broke the evening’s quiet. 

Inside the cab, the air was filled with the faint scent of coffee and diesel—a familiar blend to Merle Andrews, a trucker whose seasoned hands gripped the steering wheel with an ease that came only through decades of hard work. At 57, with crow's feet etched into the corners of his eyes from squinting at the sunlit roads, Merle was a man molded by the landscapes he traversed and the miles he’d left in his rearview mirror.

As Merle glanced out at the forest passing by, the lush canopy above glowing with the remnants of the day’s light, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of belonging here, on these remote roads far from the chaos of city life. It was the space between places that Merle called home—the borders of towns, the quiet rest stops, and the late-night diners with their neon signs flickering through the dark. It was here, amidst the rolling hills and shadowy groves, that he found solace.

This evening, his destination was a small town nestled deep within the mountains, a place where the night air was crisp, and strangers often greeted you with a nod rather than a word. As he approached, the first signs of civilization appeared—a wooden sign dangling from a solitary post, worn and almost lost to the winding road, reading “Welcome to Sagewood Hollow.”
