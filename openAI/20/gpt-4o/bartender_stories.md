Windswept clouds skittered across the evening sky, casting shivering shadows over the cobblestone streets of Port Haven, a sleepy coastal town where time seemed to idle by like the gentle waves lapping against its weathered piers. Nestled between a row of salt-beaten shops was The Sea Glass Tavern, an unassuming sanctuary for weary travelers and local folklore keepers alike.

Inside, the tavern hummed with the low murmur of conversation and the soft clinking of glasses. Lanterns suspended from rustic wooden beams bathed the room in a warm amber glow, complementing the earthy scent of aged oak and sea brine that lingered in the air. It was a place where tales were spun as freely as the drinks were poured, and the echoes of laughter danced in the corners like carefree spirits.

Behind the bar, meticulously wiping a glass, stood Harper Niles, a figure as integral to the tavern's charm as its creaky floorboards. With salt-and-pepper hair that whispered stories of its own and eyes like the deep blue of the ocean, Harper had made the tavern his life, a refuge where every stranger was a friend waiting to be found. A gentle demeanor paired with an uncanny knack for listening made him not just a bartender, but the guardian of the town's secrets and dreams.

As Harper polished the last glass, he cast a thoughtful gaze over the tavern's patrons, familiar faces interspersed with curious visitors seeking solace from the dayâ€™s burdens. Each arrival was greeted with a nod and a knowing smile, an unspoken agreement that, within these walls, worries could be momentarily suspended, carried out to sea with the receding tide.
