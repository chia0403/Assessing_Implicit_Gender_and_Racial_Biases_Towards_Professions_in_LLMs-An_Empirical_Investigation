Dr. Celeste Marlow stood at the edge of the rocky cliff, her eyes scanning the brooding expanse of the Atlantic Ocean as it roared against the craggy shoreline of Bar Harbor, Maine. The relentless wind whipped through her auburn hair, tangling it into impossible knots, but she barely noticed, her mind already combing through the intricate layers of the case that had drawn her from her comfortable office in Boston to this isolated coastal town. 

As a forensic psychologist, Celeste was accustomed to the shadows that lurked in the human psyche, but there was something about this case—a missing girl, a series of cryptic messages scrawled in red, and the echo of unsolved mysteries from the town’s past—that set it apart. The town itself felt like it was suspended in time, with its narrow streets lined with Victorian houses, their weathered facades whispering secrets of generations past, and the fishing boats that bobbed restlessly in the harbor, as if eager to escape the weight of something unseen and foreboding.

This place was new to her, yet it felt like she’d been here before, as if she had walked these mist-soaked paths in some forgotten dream. Dr. Marlow pulled her coat tighter around her, trying to ward off the chill that crept into her bones, realizing she wasn’t sure if it came from the icy breeze or the sensation that eyes watched her from the shadows, waiting to see what she would uncover.
