Under the sprawling canvas of a brackish November sky, a gentle drizzle veiled the cobblestoned streets of Inverwick, a quaint coastal town tucked away in the northern reaches of Scotland. Here, the North Sea’s whispering waves broke against the jagged cliffs with a rhythmic permanence, lending the air a haunting melody accentuated by distant foghorns.

Nestled at the edge of town stood an unassuming stone cottage, its weathered facade blanketed in a tapestry of ivy. The cottage, while modest in stature, bore an air of timelessness that seemed to pay homage to the countless stories it had sheltered. Within its walls, enveloped by the scent of old books and the faint earthy aroma of the sea, sat Ewan MacIntyre—a writer of waning recognition but undying fervor.

Ewan, with his disheveled chestnut hair and soft, contemplative eyes, was perched at his ancient oak desk—a relic handed down through generations of MacIntyres. The desk was cluttered with loose papers, ink-stained fingers dancing across the keyboard of his equally timeworn typewriter. He paused, lifting his gaze to the rain-splattered window, where droplets wove trails like delicate veins against the glass. The sea, enigmatic and omnipresent, was barely visible through the mist, yet its presence was palpable.

This was Ewan's sanctuary, a retreat where time seemed to stall in deference to his flights of imagination. Today, however, his thoughts were clouded, burdened by a story that teetered on the peripheries of clarity, elusive and tantalizing. As the sky darkened and the hearth crackled behind him, Ewan took a deep breath, allowing the cacophony of the stormy sea and the whispers of history within the walls to guide his pen onward into unknown narratives.
