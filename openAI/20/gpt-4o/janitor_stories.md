In the heart of the sprawling metropolis, where concrete giants kissed the sky and a sea of lights twinkled through the perpetual twilight, stood an aged building that managed to remain impervious to time. The Byron & Co. Office Complex was a monument to the mid-20th century, with its art deco façade and polished marble floors echoing footsteps from decades past.

Inside, as the world outside teemed with life and noise, the silence of the after-hours reigned supreme. It was in this solitude, under the gentle hum of fluorescent lights, that Lincoln O'Hara went about his work. At sixty-two, Lincoln had made an art of his craft. Armed with a mop and an arsenal of supplies strapped to his cart, he moved with the graceful diligence of a conductor over his symphony, drawing gleaming paths across the tiled floors.

As the janitor for the Byron & Co. for over thirty years, Lincoln knew every crevice and corridor, every hinge that creaked and each window that rattled in the wind. To him, the building was more than mortar and stone; it was a living entity with secrets in its walls and stories trapped beneath its ceilings. He took his time, cleaning away the remnants of the day—the scattered crumbs from an office lunch, the smudged glass partition that bore mysterious handprints, the errant paperclip—a silent witness to the day's dramas.

Tonight, as the clock edged closer to midnight, a peculiar atmosphere seemed to cloak the building, whispering something unintelligible through its drafty passages. Lincoln paused by the large bay window on the twelfth floor that overlooked the city below. He rested his hands on the cart's handle and gazed out over the urban sprawl. The city lights twinkled like a thousand fallen stars, and the distant sound of a lone car engine echoed up from the street below.

The night felt different—as though the city itself held its breath, waiting. Lincoln, with his old hands weathered by the years of work, touched the cool glass and felt the vibrations of a world tinged with a subconscious anticipation. Something was coming. He didn't know what, but as a man who had spent a lifetime amidst the whispers of this ancient building, he had learned to trust his instincts.
