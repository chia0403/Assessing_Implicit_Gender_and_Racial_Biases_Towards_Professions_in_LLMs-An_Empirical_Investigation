**Title: The Last Sunset on Highway 37**

**Setting:**
The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt of Highway 37, a two-lane expanse cutting through the rugged terrain of the Sierra Nevada foothills. On either side of the road, tall pines stood sentinel, their needles whispering secrets to the fading light. As dusk approached, the distant echo of a lone engine reverberated against the mountain slopes, breaking the serene solitude of the afternoon. The scent of pine mixed with the lingering aroma of tar and asphalt, a smell that had become second nature to the men and women working tirelessly to maintain this often-traveled route.

**Story Opening:**
Marcus Ellison wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, squinting at the rays of sunlight that filtered through the trees. For the past fifteen years, he was a fixture on Highway 37, a steadfast highway worker devoted to ensuring the safety of countless travelers. With his weathered hands gripping a shovel, he surveyed the project ahead—a deep pothole that threatened to swallow tires whole. Marcus was known around these parts for his unwavering dedication and a knack for fixing the state's most troublesome roads.

But today felt different; there was an odd tension in the air, as though the very earth were holding its breath. He could hear the faint hum of cicadas preparing for their nightly chorus, a melody that usually lulled him into a sense of peace. Instead, he felt a restlessness in his chest, as if the universe had something urgent to reveal. With the sun sinking closer to the horizon, Marcus turned his gaze toward the shimmering orange sky, unaware that this would be the last sunset he'd ever witness from the pavement of Highway 37. 

As he knelt down to resume his work, a flicker of movement caught his eye at the edge of the trees. In that moment, Marcus couldn’t shake the foreboding feeling building within him, a prelude to something that would forever change the course of his life as a highway worker.
