In the heart of Charleston, South Carolina, beneath the wrought-iron balconies thick with blooming jasmine, sat "The Copper Lantern," a beloved bistro known for its rich Southern cuisine and warm, inviting atmosphere. The clattering of dishes and the hum of cheerful conversations filled the air, as the sun dipped low, casting a golden glow through the wooden windows. This bustling establishment was alive with the scent of garlic and fried green tomatoes, a familiar embrace that wrapped around its patrons like an old friend's hug.

Amidst the lively chaos stood Eleanor "Ellie" Waverly, a twenty-six-year-old server with wild curls that seemed to dance about her face and a smile that could light up even the gloomiest of days. Wearing a crisp black apron over a vintage floral dress, she moved through the maze of tables with the grace of a dancer, balancing trays full of steaming dishes and frosty sweet tea. Her keen eye scanned the room, effortlessly picking out customers who needed refills or a friendly word.

Ellie had always loved this place, from the antique lanterns flickering softly overhead to the mismatched chairs that held stories of first dates, reunions, and quiet moments. This was her refuge, her stage, and tonight, as the sky transformed into hues of orange and purple, it felt particularly magical. Little did she know that on this ordinary evening, the arrival of an unexpected guest would send ripples through her carefully curated routine, forever changing the course of her life.
