**Title: Healing Hands**

**Opening and Setting:**

The late afternoon sun filtered through the tall windows of Cedar Grove Rehabilitation Center, casting a warm, golden hue on the polished wooden floors. The faint sound of a piano echoed softly from the activity room, where a group of residents gathered for their weekly music therapy session. The air was ripe with the scent of lavender, a calming aroma that had become a hallmark of the facility, infused as it was from the little sachets that filled the corners of the common areas.

In one of the therapy rooms, nestled between cheerful illustrations of mobility exercises and brightly colored motivational quotes, stood Sarah Elizabeth Caldwell. At thirty-four years old, she had quickly become known for her radiant smile and an almost supernatural ability to connect with her patients. With her sandy blond hair pulled back in a no-nonsense bun, and a well-worn therapist's jacket draped over her shoulders, Sarah was a constant presence in the lives of those she worked with every day. Today, she was preparing for a therapy session with Mr. Thompson, an elderly man who had been a painter before a stroke had stolen his ability to express himself on canvas.

Outside, the leaves rustled gently in the spring breeze, their vibrant greens a stark contrast to the muted pastels of the center. Sarah took a deep breath, the calming scent of eucalyptus filling her lungs, and stepped into the room where Mr. Thompson sat, staring blankly at a mix of brushes and partially completed canvases scattered across the table. Unbeknownst to him, today would mark the beginning of a new chapter in their journey together—one where creativity and healing would intertwine in ways neither could have anticipated. Little did they know, their meeting would not just revive Mr. Thompson’s passion but lead Sarah to discover a part of herself she had long buried beneath the weight of her profession.
