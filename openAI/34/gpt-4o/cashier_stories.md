Under the flickering fluorescent lights of Harold's Supermarket, the steady hum of shopping carts and the soft beeps of the register formed a familiar symphony. In the midst of this everyday chorus stood Eliza Montgomery, a figure both unassuming and constant, her fingers dancing across the keys of the cash register with practiced ease.

Eliza had been a cashier at Harold's for over five years. The customers knew her well, recognizing her unrushed smile and the kind way she inquired about their day as she handled their purchases. The supermarket itself was an aging relic nestled between a row of new retail stores, its bricks weathered and its awning slightly faded. It had a comforting air of nostalgia, a place where the past and present intertwined in the creaky wooden floors and the hand-painted signs announcing the weekly specials.

Eliza enjoyed the rhythm of her days here, one flowing seamlessly into the next. She liked the little moments, shared over conveyor belts with regular patrons or the brief exchanges with newcomers passing through town. Outside, the town of Oak Ridge moved at its own pace, a sleepy place surrounded by gentle hills that turned golden with the setting sun.

On this particular afternoon, with spring just finding its footing, Eliza felt a different sort of energy in the air. As she looked out through the streaked front windows, she noticed the usual rush of early evening trafficâ€”an anticipation simmering beneath the surface, as if something unseen were ready to unfold. Little did Eliza know, this shift in the quiet hum of Oak Ridge would soon draw her into a story that was anything but ordinary.
