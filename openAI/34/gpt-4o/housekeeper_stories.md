In the quaint coastal town of Seabury, where the salty breeze whispered tales from the sea and the cobblestone streets echoed with the laughter of children, lived Marjorie Whitlock. Though known to most as simply, "Marge," her full name was always spoken with a sense of reverence among those who knew her well. Marjorie was the town's beloved housekeeper, whose meticulous care transformed even the dustiest of homes into polished sanctuaries.

The town itself was a picture of charm, with its classic Victorian houses draped in vibrant wisteria and its market square bustling with merchants selling fresh seafood and handmade crafts. Marjorie's own modest cottage sat at the edge of Seabury, embraced by a garden that danced with daisies and forget-me-nots. She had inherited the home from her grandmother, along with a talent for nurturing not just homes but also the spirits of those who resided within them.

On a crisp autumn morning, as the amber-hued leaves crunched beneath her well-worn boots, Marjorie made her way to the Blythewood Manor, a grand estate perched solemnly atop a hill overlooking the restless ocean. The Manor was famed for its opulent architecture and rumors of hidden corridors, yet to Marjorie, it was just another place she breathed life into. As she unlocked the towering mahogany doors and stepped inside, a faint mustiness greeted her, a reminder of the stories held within its walls.

Today, however, felt differentâ€”a quiet thrill lingered in the air, as if the Manor held a secret, just waiting to be discovered.
