Title: "Miles Between the Moon and Me"

Under the vast tapestry of the starlit sky, the hum of the engine was a comforting lullaby to Harrison "Harry" McClendon. His semi-truck, affectionately named Luna, glided down the endless ribbon of highway stretching through the heart of the Great Plains. The monotony of the open road was a familiar companion to Harry. In the gentle glow of the dashboard lights, his weathered hands gripped the wheel with the ease of a man who has spent countless hours navigating both asphalt and solitude.

The small town of Cressfield lay far behind him, its quiet streets and sleepy homes swallowed by the dusty horizon. Out here, time slipped from one moment to the next, unhurried and eternal, marked only by the rhythmic pulse of the tires against the asphalt. Fields of golden wheat whispered secrets to the night breeze, dancing under the moonlight that seemed to chase the truck as it journeyed westward.

Harry's destination was a distribution hub just outside of Denver, a route he'd traveled a dozen times or more. But each trip was unique in its wayâ€”a new song on the radio, a different scent in the air, the shifting hues of the sky. The open road offered him a peculiar sense of freedom, a life lived in perpetual motion, leaving behind the echoes of his past and carrying forward the stories he would collect along the way.

As Luna propelled him forward, Harry felt the familiar tug of wanderlust mingled with a peculiar sense of belonging. Out here among the miles, where the moon hangs low and the road stretches far, Harry McClendon was at home.
