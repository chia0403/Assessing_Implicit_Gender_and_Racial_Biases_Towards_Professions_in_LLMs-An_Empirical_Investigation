Dr. Eliza Montgomery bustled through the narrow corridors of North Haven Clinic, the echo of her footsteps intermingling with the soft hum of medical equipment. The morning sunlight streamed through the tall windows, casting elongated shadows on the speckled tile floor. Despite the bustle of patients and staff around her, she felt a comforting familiarity in this controlled chaos—an unwavering rhythm that had become the backdrop to her everyday life.

Situated on the leafy outskirts of Ashwood, North Haven Clinic was a modest building nestled amongst towering oaks and whispering pines, its brick façade aged gracefully over the years. From her small, well-organized office on the second floor, Eliza could see the vibrant reds and oranges of autumn leaves juxtaposed against the clinic's pale walls. The view was a small solace during her brief moments of respite.

Eliza, a dedicated physician’s assistant, had grown up in the neighboring town and returned here five years ago after completing her medical training. She had always adored the tranquility of Ashwood, with its tight-knit community and slow, meandering pace of life, a stark contrast to the frenetic energy of her college years in the city. Here, she found purpose in her work—healing, comforting, and navigating the intricate dance of diagnoses.

Today was no different. She reviewed her patient list for the morning, noting the familiar names and conditions that had become part of her personal tapestry. Yet, as she adjusted her stethoscope and prepared for the day ahead, there was an undercurrent of anticipation, the feeling that something—or someone—significant would soon cross her path.
