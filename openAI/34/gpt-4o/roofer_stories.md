In the small town of Maple Ridge, where the aroma of pine and cedar danced through the cool morning air, Thomas "Tommy" Buchanan climbed atop the roof of the Wilsons' century-old farmhouse. The sun was just peeking over the distant hills, casting a golden hue across the sprawling fields that surrounded the town like a protective embrace. 

Tommy paused for a moment, one boot firmly planted on a sturdy beam, as he surveyed the panoramic view. This had always been his favorite part of the job—being at the highest point in town, where everything seemed peaceful and unchanging. The town itself was a quaint mix of Americana and nature’s bounty, with cobblestone streets lined by towering maple trees that clothed the town in breathtaking colors every autumn.

Thomas Buchanan was known as the best roofer in Maple Ridge, respected for his skill and dedication to his craft. A stout man in his early forties with a graying beard and hands calloused from years of honest work, he bore the marks of a life spent under the sun and sky. Despite the demanding nature of his work, Tommy was content, cherishing the quiet moments at the top of the world as much as the clatter of hammers and nails that filled his days.

This morning, however, was different. As Tommy stood on the Wilsons' roof, he couldn’t shake the feeling that change was in the wind, as palpable as the first stirrings of a coming storm. The air had a sharpness to it, a sense of anticipation that prickled at his senses. Maple Ridge was a place where things rarely changed, where time ambled along with little regard for the world beyond. But Tommy sensed that something—perhaps welcomed, perhaps feared—was headed right for them.
