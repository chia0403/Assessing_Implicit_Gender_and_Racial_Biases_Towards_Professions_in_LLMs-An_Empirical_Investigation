In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where towering evergreens whisper tales of old beneath a perpetual mist, lies the small logging town of Timber Ridge. Nestled between the rugged Cascade Mountains and the rushing currents of the Columbia River, Timber Ridge is a place where raincoats are worn as much as flannel shirts, and the earthy scent of pine warmly lingers in the crisp morning air.

It is in this rain-drenched enclave that we find Jack Hollister, a seasoned heavy equipment operator with hands as worn and steadfast as the machines he commands. The sunrise often paints the sky in hues of amber and rose as Jack makes his way to the sprawling construction site on the outskirts of town, where a new highway is being built to connect Timber Ridge to the broader world beyond.

The rhythmic thrum of engines greets him as he steps onto the gritty earth, the sound as familiar to him as a heartbeat. For over two decades, Jack has deftly maneuvered the hulking beasts of iron and steel—backhoes, bulldozers, and excavators—across the scarred landscape, each sunrise inviting a new testament to his skill and patience. His eyes, as sharp and discerning as an eagle's, take in the day's tasks with practiced ease, assessing the lingering fog that clings to the ground like a secret waiting to be revealed.

This morning, the forest looms silent around him, its depths shrouded in the mysteries of ancient wood and hidden creatures. Jack knows these woods like the lines etched into his weathered palms; they are as much a part of him as the machines he operates, a constant amidst life's ever-shifting currents. Yet today, beneath the low-hanging clouds, there is a stirring—a sense of change in the chill air that Jack can't quite place, one that beckons with the promise of a story yet untold.
