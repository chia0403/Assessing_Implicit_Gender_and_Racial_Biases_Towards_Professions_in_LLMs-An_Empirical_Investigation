On the misty shores of Loch Ard in the Scottish Highlands, where the whispering pines meet the tranquil waters, stood the picturesque village of Kilmore. It was here, in this realm of ancient legends and timeless beauty, that Fiona Wallace began her day. As the first rays of the morning sun cast a golden hue over the glistening loch, she tightened the woolen scarf around her neck, her breath visible in the crisp autumn air. 

Fiona—a seasoned tour guide, known for her warmth and wit—made her way to the small, ivy-clad Visitor’s Centre that sat at the heart of the village. Her auburn hair was tucked beneath a tweed cap, a nod to both the traditions of the land and the practical needs of her daily excursions through unpredictable weather. Today marked the start of the Highlands Heritage Festival, and the village was abuzz with visitors eager to uncover the secrets of Scotland's storied past.

Kilmore was a place where history hummed beneath every stone and story was woven into the very fabric of the land. For Fiona, guiding those who came to this storied corner of the world was not just a job—it was a calling. She loved nothing more than to see the awe in people’s eyes as they discovered the standing stones that dotted the hillsides, or lost themselves in the tales of clan battles and fairy folk that lived in the heathered hills beyond.

As Fiona unlocked the door to the centre, she inhaled deeply, letting the rich scent of peat and pine fill her lungs. Today, she thought, would be a good day for a story—a day to watch the loch reveal its mysteries and the hills echo with tales of yore.
