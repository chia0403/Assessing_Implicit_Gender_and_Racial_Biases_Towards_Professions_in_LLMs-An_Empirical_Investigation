In the heart of the sleepy, coastal town of Everbrook, where the scent of salt mingled with the sweet aroma of wild honeysuckle, stood a charming little dental clinic known as Everbrook Smiles. The clinic, with its sea-foam green facade and large, sunlit windows, was where the town's residents entrusted their oral health, and where Jacqueline "Jackie" Bennett began each of her workdays.

Jackie’s day usually started just as the first rays of sunlight crept over the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow across the quiet streets. Her mornings were a serene ritual: a brisk walk to the bakery on the corner for a fresh blueberry muffin and a steaming cup of coffee, before making her way to the clinic.

With her auburn hair tucked neatly beneath a patterned bandana and a cheerful demeanor that could brighten even the gloomiest day, Jackie was as much a fixture in the town as the lighthouse on Driftwood Point. Her love for her work went beyond just cleaning teeth; it was in the way she remembered each patient’s story, the way she could coax a smile from even the most nervous child, or how she spent a few extra minutes chatting with elderly Mrs. Griffith about her beloved garden.

Today was one of those rare, misty mornings when Everbrook seemed to be wrapped in a gentle shroud of fog. As Jackie walked through the fog-laden streets, she couldn’t shake the feeling that today was no ordinary day. Though she couldn’t quite place why, there was a certain electricity in the air, as if the town itself was holding its breath in anticipation. Little did she know, this day would bring changes as unexpected as the shifting tides that cradled the town’s sandy shores.
