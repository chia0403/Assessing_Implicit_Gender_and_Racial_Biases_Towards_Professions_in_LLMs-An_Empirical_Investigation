On the outskirts of the small, sleepy town of Willow Creek, where the first light of dawn kissed the rooftops of modest red-brick houses, Harold "Harry" Bennett set out for another day of work. The scent of wet earth lingered in the air from the previous night's rain, and a gentle mist wove itself through the early morning calm, whispering secrets to the rustling leaves.

Harry was a plumber, and the best there was in all of Willow Creek—not that the peaceful little town had much competition for the title. His weathered toolbag rattled slightly against his side as he walked, the metal clinking in time with each step. Down the winding paths that braided through clusters of towering oaks, his boots left impressions in the damp soil, a testament to his well-traveled route.

The town, nestled in a gentle valley surrounded by a ring of evergreen peaks, still slumbered as Harry passed through. Roofs dripped quietly into the tangled maze of wild gardens and patched fences that spoke of a simpler, slower life. He glanced up at the sky, watching the whispers of pink and gold unfurl across it, stretching into the endless blue. Harry loved these tranquil hours before the hustle of the day began, when the town felt like a painting just about to awaken.

Harry's first call of the day would take him to Mrs. Thompson's house, a stately but well-loved home at the end of Maple Avenue. Her pipes had been rattling like chains in a ghost story, and if there was one thing Harry couldn't stand, it was a plumbing mystery left unsolved. As he approached Mrs. Thompson's garden gate, he paused for a moment to listen to the chorus of morning birdsong—a symphony just for him, at this serene hour when even the town's heartbeats seemed to echo gently.
