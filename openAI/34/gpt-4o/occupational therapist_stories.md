In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where the air is rich with the scent of cedar and the distant murmur of the ocean whispers through the evergreens, there stood the quaint town of Inverleigh. Nestled between the rugged coastline and the mist-covered mountains, this secluded hamlet seemed almost untouched by time. Its cobblestone streets wound through rows of rustic cottages, their eaves covered in moss, while strings of fairy lights draped between lampposts, casting a warm glow even on the cloudiest of days.

Inverleigh had a way of capturing the soul's quieter moments, a place where nature framed life with gentle reminders to breathe deep and cherish each day. It was here, in this serene enclave, that Amelia Sutton made her life’s work. As an occupational therapist at the local rehabilitation center, she had dedicated her days to guiding her patients toward rediscovering the freedom in movement, much like the wind sweeping through the trees.

Amelia Sutton was the kind of person who saw potential and possibility where others saw obstacles. With her sandy hair often swept into a no-nonsense ponytail and her eyes sharp yet kind, she was a beacon of hope for the residents she attended to. Her therapy sessions were filled with laughter and lighthearted banter, her voice a blend of gentle encouragement and firm resolve.

Each morning, Amelia would make her way from her tiny, eclectic apartment above the town’s only bookstore, weaving through the familiar paths lined with rhododendrons and lavender. As she approached the rehabilitation center, a welcoming building tucked into the edge of the forest, the air around her felt charged with the promise of the day’s tasks. It was here, against the backdrop of birdsong and the hushed symphony of rustling leaves, that Amelia’s story unfolded.
