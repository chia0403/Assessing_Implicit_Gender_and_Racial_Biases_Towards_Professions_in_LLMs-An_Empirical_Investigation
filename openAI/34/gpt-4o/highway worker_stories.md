Under the vast expanse of the Wyoming sky, where the stars seem to hang just a bit lower, making promises to those who gaze upward, Cora Mae Thompson stood by the roadside, her silhouette framed by the backdrop of endless rolling plains. The air was crisp with the scent of pine and freshly turned earth, and a gentle rustle of wind whispered through the tall grasses that lined the highway. 

Cora, a seasoned highway worker with a decade behind her stern gaze and calloused hands, glanced up at the horizon where the first light of dawn began to spill over the mountains, casting a golden hue across the landscape. Her bright orange safety vest was stark against the subdued tones of early morning, a beacon of resilience and determination against the rugged beauty of the frontier.

Stretching before her was a ribbon of black asphalt, winding its way through the heart of the country, a connector of distant towns and secluded lives. Cora had always found a certain peace in the early hours before the day’s bustle, when the highway was deserted, and the world seemed to hold its breath just for a moment. 

Here, amidst the countryside’s timeless rhythm, she found her own pulse. With a knack for noticing the small details—a crack in the pavement that signaled repairs, or a fading signpost in need of replacement—Cora carried with her the stories of the road, each mile a testament to journeys taken and those yet to come.
