**Title: Shadows of the Mind**

**Setting:**
A crisp autumn morning blankets the small town of Eldridge, where the leaves have turned shades of gold and crimson. The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke, hinting at the change of seasons. Nestled between rolling hills, Eldridge is dotted with quaint Victorian houses, small cafes, and an old library that stands as a quiet witness to the passage of time. At the center of town, the soft hum of life buzzes around the bustling square, where townsfolk chat and share laughter.

On the edge of the square, in a charming brick building adorned with ivy, is Dr. Eleanor Maeve Gibbs’ private practice. Inside, the waiting room is filled with warm hues of beige and soft green, evoking a sense of calm. Shelves lined with books on psychology, art, and philosophy create an inviting atmosphere. A small fountain gently trickles in the corner, blending with the comforting scent of lavender.

**Opening:**
Dr. Eleanor Maeve Gibbs sat at her worn, oak desk, the morning sun filtering through the sheer curtains of her office. In front of her lay a stack of patient files, their contents spilling secrets and sorrows that often kept her awake at night. As a clinical psychologist, Eleanor had dedicated her life to unraveling the complexities of the human mind, but today felt different. An uneasy weight settled atop her chest, a premonition whispering that something beyond the ordinary was about to unfold.

She gazed out the window, watching a few leaves pirouette to the ground, dancing in the wind. It was on days like this—days when the world seemed to crack open just a little, revealing the extraordinary hiding beneath the surface—that she felt her work was both a blessing and a burden. Today was one of those days. Today, a new patient would arrive, and with them, the shadows of their past—an echo of unseen struggles that might just alter the course of her own life.
