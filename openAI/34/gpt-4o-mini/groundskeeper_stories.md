The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden hue over Hawthorne Estate, a sprawling estate nestled in the heart of an ancient forest. Wisps of wildflowers danced in the gentle breeze along the manicured paths, their vibrant colors a sharp contrast to the deep greens of the towering oaks that lined the property. The air was thick with the scent of earth and loam, mingling with the faint fragrance of blooming lilacs.

In the shadow of the estate's grand Victorian architecture, a solitary figure moved quietly among the overgrown hedges and flower beds. Elliott Thorne, the estate’s dedicated groundskeeper, knelt down to inspect a patch of struggling roses. His worn denim overalls and weathered sun hat spoke of long hours spent cultivating the land, and his hands, calloused yet gentle, were a testament to years of nurturing the gardens that rarely received the appreciation they deserved.

Elliott had grown up with the estate; its tall windows and ivy-clad walls were as familiar to him as the cadence of his own breath. His fingers brushed against the leaves, tracing the pathways of memories—long afternoons spent among the blooms, small adventures beneath the sprawling branches, the whisper of secrets exchanged with the wind. 

But today felt different. There was an uncharacteristic stillness in the air, a brooding feeling that seemed to reach out from the depths of the woods behind the estate. As he stood up and wiped his brow, Elliott couldn’t shake the sense that the past was stirring in the corners of the garden, urging him to remember what he had long tried to forget.
