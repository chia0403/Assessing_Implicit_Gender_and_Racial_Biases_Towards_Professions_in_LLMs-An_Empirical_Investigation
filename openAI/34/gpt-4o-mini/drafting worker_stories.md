In the bustling city of Riverton, where towering skyscrapers kissed the clouds and the hum of urban life resonated through the streets, the old brick building of Selwyn Engineering nestled between a modern glass façade and a colorful façade of murals. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of coffee and the hum of machines, occasionally punctuated by the sound of flipping pages and the clicking of keyboards reverberating in the well-lit drafting studio.

At the heart of this hive of creativity and precision was Eleanor “Ellie” Thompson, a dedicated drafting worker known for her meticulous attention to detail and boundless passion for architectural design. With her chestnut hair pulled back into a neat bun and a pair of cat-eye glasses perched on her nose, Ellie had the aura of someone who could both envision breathtaking structures and bring them to life with her skilled hands. Her desk, strewn with blueprints and color swatches, bore the marks of late nights and early mornings, a testament to her unwavering commitment to her craft.

On this particular morning, sunlight streamed through the tall windows, casting geometric shadows across the drafting tables. The sound of her colleagues discussing the latest project drifted in the background as Ellie unrolled a large sheet of parchment, her heart racing with anticipation. Today was the deadline for submitting her design for a new community center that aimed to revitalize the long-forgotten neighborhood of Greystone, a place she had grown up in and watched struggle over the years. 

But as the deadline approached, Ellie felt a storm brewing—not just of nerves, but of something more profound. Little did she know, her design would ignite more than just conversation; it would unveil secrets long buried within the community, testing her resilience and sparking a journey that would change her forever.
