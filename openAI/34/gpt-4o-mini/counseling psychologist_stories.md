**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Driftwood Bay, where the ocean meets rugged cliffs and the scent of saltwater fills the air. Nestled between the town's quaint shops and rolling hills is a cozy, weathered cottage, painted a soft shade of seafoam green. Inside, the walls are lined with bookshelves overflowing with psychology texts and self-help novels, interspersed with photographs of smiling clients and abstract artwork. A large window offers a panoramic view of the roaring waves, providing a soothing backdrop for the sessions held within.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eliana Mae Carter sat in her favorite armchair, the one adorned with a blanket knitted by her grandmother, and inhaled deeply, allowing the fresh ocean air to mingle with the comforting scent of her jasmine tea. As a counseling psychologist in the tight-knit community of Driftwood Bay, she had learned that these small moments of tranquility were fleeting. Today, however, her tranquil space felt unusually heavy, as if the very walls were saturated with unspoken secrets.

Her office, normally a sanctuary of healing, was filled with the muted sound of the ocean crashing against the cliffs just beyond the window. Eliana had always found solace in the rhythm of the waves, a constant reminder that even the stormiest waters eventually calmed. But as she glanced at the clock, her heart quickened; a new client was scheduled to arrive any moment now, and with them, the weight of their burdens. 

Eliana wiped her palms on her tailored trousers, a small ritual to ground herself in the present. “Every story has layers,” she reminded herself, recalling the endless complexities shared by the individuals who sought her guidance. Yet, deep within her, she felt a strange tug, an intuition whispering that today’s session would unravel something unexpected.

With a soft chime, the door to her office swung open, and a chill swept through the room as the late autumn wind gusted inside. Eliana rose to greet her new client, determined to uncover the truth that lay waiting beneath the surface, both for them and for herself.
