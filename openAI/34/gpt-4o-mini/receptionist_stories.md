In the heart of downtown Portland, where the streets buzzed with the rhythm of footsteps and distant coffee shop chatter, stood the glass-paneled skyscraper of Trent & Associates. Inside, the modern lobby was adorned with sleek marble floors and a sprawling green wall that seemed to breathe life into the corporate environment. 

At the reception desk, nestled in the corner behind a polished oak counter, sat Aveline Mae Thompson, a diligent receptionist with a penchant for organization and an eye for detail. Her short, chestnut-brown hair was meticulously tucked behind one ear, while the other curled softly around her face, framing her attentively observant hazel eyes. Aveline wore a crisp white blouse paired with navy slacks, her outfit as sharp as her acute sense of professionalism.

The air was tinged with the aroma of fresh coffee wafting from the caf√© on the ground floor, mingling with the scent of polished wood and citrus-scented air fresheners. Aveline had always felt a sense of calm in the bustling energy of the lobby, where she greeted clients and welcomed employees with a radiant smile. 

Yet, beneath the surface of her cheerful demeanor lay a restlessness, an unexplainable feeling that something was about to shift in her orderly world. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue through the glass walls, the dull chirping of the office became quieter, and Aveline found herself pondering the unexpected adventures that awaited just beyond the pivoting doors of her daily routine. Little did she know, this evening would be the catalyst for everything to change.
