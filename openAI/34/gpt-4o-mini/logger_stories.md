In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where ancient Douglas firs soared like green towers into the low-hanging clouds, the village of Cedar Hollow lay nestled between the rugged mountains and the ever-flowing River Ashwood. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance that mingled with the faint musk of wildflowers that punctuated the forest floor. 

As dawn broke, painting the sky in hues of violet and gold, a lone figure emerged from a weathered shack on the outskirts of town. This was Ethan Rowan Holloway, a logger known not just for his brawny physique and skillful hands, but also for the quiet strength that accompanied him like a shadow. Each morning, he donned his faded flannel shirt and heavy-duty work boots, their scuffed surface embodying years of toil amid towering giants. Today, however, felt different. A stirring in the wind brought whispers of change, and Ethan sensed that the woods concealing secrets had more to reveal than the rhythm of saws and the scent of cut timber.

Ethan’s axe dangled from his side, glinting in the soft morning light, ready to part the age-old trees that had stood sentinel over generations. As he stepped into the embrace of the forest, a shiver of anticipation ran down his spine. Although he had spent countless hours among these trees, today they felt alive, as if anticipating his arrival. A hint of rustle in the underbrush drew his attention, igniting not just his curiosity, but something deeper within—an unshakeable feeling that this day would carve a new path in his life, forever entwining his fate with that of the ancient woods.
