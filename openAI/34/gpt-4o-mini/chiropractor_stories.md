In the quaint coastal town of Meridian Cove, where the salty breeze mingled with the aroma of fresh coffee from the corner caf√©, stood a modest brick building known as Harmony Chiropractic. Inside, the walls were painted a calming shade of seafoam green, adorned with framed photographs of serene landscapes and motivational quotes that inspired wellness and positivity. 

Dr. Evelyn Claire Thompson, a dedicated chiropractor with a passion for holistic healing, was preparing for the day ahead. As she arranged the essential oils along her wooden treatment table, the soft sound of waves crashing against the shore filled the air, providing a soothing backdrop to her thoughts. Evelyn, in her early thirties, had always felt a deep connection to this coastal retreat. It was here that she had found her calling, merging her love for anatomy and her desire to help others.

Just as she pinned her hair back in a loose bun, the bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her first patient. Evelyn smiled, ready to lend her hands and expertise to those seeking relief, unaware that today would unravel secrets that had long stayed hidden beneath the surface of her idyllic town.
