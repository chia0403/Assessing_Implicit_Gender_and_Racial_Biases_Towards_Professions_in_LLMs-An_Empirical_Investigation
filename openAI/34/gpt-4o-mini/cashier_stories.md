The soft jingle of the bell above the door signaled the arrival of another customer, but Clara Mae Turner hardly noticed as she diligently scanned the barcodes of assorted groceries. Rows of fluorescent lights cast a harsh glare over the aisles of Maplewood Market, illuminating the colorful packaging of snacks and produce that formed the backdrop for her daily grind. 

It was a chilly autumn afternoon, and outside, a kaleidoscope of golden leaves danced in the brisk wind, offering a vibrant contrast to the dull hum of the checkout line. Clara, with her chestnut hair pulled back in a neat ponytail, wore her navy-blue apron like a badge of honor, its pockets stuffed with crumpled receipts and a half-eaten granola bar. The monotony of ringing up customers often made time crawl, but today felt different—a strange undercurrent hung in the air, as if the world outside was whispering secrets meant only for her. 

As she greeted each shopper with a bright, practiced smile, Clara's mind wandered to dreams of a life beyond the relentless beep of the register. Little did she know, the universe had plans for her, starting with the stranger who had just stepped through the door, their shadow casting a long silhouette against the tile floor. Jessie didn't know it yet, but their presence would soon disrupt the delicate rhythm of Clara Mae Turner’s ordinary life.
