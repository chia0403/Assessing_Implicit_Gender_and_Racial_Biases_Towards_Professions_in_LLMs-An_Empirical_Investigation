**Title: The Destination Within**

As the late afternoon sun spilled its golden rays over the bustling streets of Portland, Oregon, Amelia Jane Hartwell sat at her tidy desk in the corner of the quaint travel agency she had run for five years. The walls of “Wanderlust Travel Co.” were adorned with vibrant posters of far-off places: the lavender fields of Provence, the bustling markets of Marrakech, and the serene beaches of Bali. Each image whispered promises of adventure and escape, but today, Amelia found herself yearning for a different kind of journey—one that ventured within.

The sound of chimes above the door interrupted her musings as a young couple entered, eyes wide with excitement. With a warm smile, she set aside her notebook, where sketches of her own dreams danced alongside client itineraries, and greeted them. The familiar rush of adrenaline surged as she listened to their vacation plans, already imagining the places that would spark joy in their hearts.

Little did they know, as Amelia poured over brochures and travel guides, that her heart was not in the exotic destinations they were discussing. It was locked in stories of her own—a story she had almost forgotten, buried beneath the workload of her clients and the day-to-day grind of life. Perhaps it was time for her own adventure, one that would take her beyond the travel brochures and into the landscapes of her past, unraveling the threads of family secrets she had always been too afraid to pull.
