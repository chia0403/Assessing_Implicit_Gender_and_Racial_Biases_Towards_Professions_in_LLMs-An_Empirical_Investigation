In the dim light of dawn, the ancient walls of Eldergrove Citadel loomed high above the mist-laden valley, their weathered stones a testament to centuries of watchful vigilance. The air was cool, tinged with the earthy scent of damp moss and the distant whisper of the river winding its way through the nearby forest. As the world stirred awake, birds began their soft symphony, heralding a new day, while the shadows of the night retreated into the farthest corners of the citadel.

Atop one of the lower battlements, a solitary figure stood sentinel, his eyes scanning the horizon. This was Grayson Alaric Stroud, a burly guard whose reputation for loyalty and strength was known throughout the kingdom. With a mane of dark hair framing a face etched with determination, Grayson wore a suit of armor that gleamed dully in the morning light, its surface marked with the scratches and scars of countless battles fought in defense of the realm.

As the sun began to crest the hills, casting golden rays upon the citadel’s stone façade, Grayson tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword. He shifted his stance, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on his shoulders. Today was not just another day of duty; it was the day the king would arrive for a crucial meeting that could alter the course of their kingdom forever. Whispers of treachery had already reached his ears, and as a guard, it was his solemn oath to protect not just the citadel but the very heart of their realm. He peered into the mist, a shiver running down his spine as he wondered what shadows might be lurking beyond the gate.
