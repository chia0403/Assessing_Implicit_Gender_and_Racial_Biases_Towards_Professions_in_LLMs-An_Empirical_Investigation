In the small town of Maplewood, where the air always carried the scent of fresh pine and the soft hum of cicadas filled the summer evenings, a modest yet busy garage stood at the corner of Elm and Main. Its faded blue paint peeled in the sun, and a neon sign flickered cheerfully, proclaiming, “Roger “Rusty” Collins Auto Repair.” Inside, the sounds of clinking tools and the occasional revving engine mixed with old rock music playing softly on a radio perched atop a dusty shelf.

Roger Nathaniel Collins, known affectionately to locals as “Rusty,” was a man of sturdy build with calloused hands that spoke of years spent immersed in grease and metal. His dark brown hair was streaked with silver, a testament to both age and the countless hours spent under the hoods of cars. The walls of his garage were adorned with faded photos of classic cars and their proud owners—one of which was his late father, who had taught him everything he knew about fixing engines and rebuilding dreams. 

As Rusty wiped the sweat from his brow, he tightened the last bolt on a cherry-red Mustang that had been brought in for repairs. He could hear the laughter of children playing outside and the distant sound of a train whistle, reminders of the world moving on outside his little haven. Little did Rusty know, this day would hold a mystery that would shift his life’s trajectory forever, starting with the arrival of a battered old pickup truck with a stranger at the wheel.
