**Title: The Butcher's Promise**

In the heart of Silverwood, a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and dense pine forests, there stood a robust stone building with a weathered sign that read “Griffin’s Meats.” The scent of curing sausage and smoked bacon wafted through the narrow streets, drawing in both locals and travelers alike. Inside, the air was thick with the savory aroma of spices and the faint metallic tang of fresh cuts. It was here that Benjamin Elwood, the village butcher, orchestrated his daily symphony of cleavers and knives, each slice a testament to his craft.

Benjamin, a burly man with a well-groomed beard speckled with gray, had inherited the shop from his father, who had run it for decades before him. The dimly lit interior was adorned with rustic wooden displays showcasing hanging hams and neatly arranged cuts of meat, while an ornate scale sat proudly on the countertop—a relic of a bygone era. Benjamin was known for his remarkable skill and dedication to quality, but he was also a man burdened by secrets that lay as deep as the roots of the ancient oaks surrounding Silverwood.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows against the stone walls, Benjamin prepared for the evening’s final customers. He wiped his hands on his blood-stained apron, glancing out the window at the village square, where flickering lanterns began to illuminate the cobblestone streets. Tonight, the Harvest Festival would commence, a celebration of bounty and community, yet he felt a weight upon his chest that was at odds with the joyful atmosphere.

In the back of his mind, he recalled the whispered warnings of villagers about the woods—tales of creatures that roamed after dark, hungering for more than just the fresh cuts he provided. But as the laughter and music drew nearer, Benjamin Elwood steeled himself. He had made a promise to his father, one he swore to uphold no matter the cost. The festivity would carry on as usual, but in the depths of his heart, he knew that the night held secrets of its own, secrets that would soon come knocking at his door.
