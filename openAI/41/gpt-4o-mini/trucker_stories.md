The sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange glow across the endless expanse of Interstate 10 as the towering mesas of New Mexico rose like ancient sentinels against the twilight sky. A dusty wind whipped through the cab of a blue Kenworth T680, rattling the old cassette tapes strewn across the dashboard. Behind the wheel, Lucas James Albright adjusted his ball cap and squinted against the fading light, his weathered hands gripping the steering wheel with the familiarity of a man who had spent countless nights on the open road.

Lucas, a veteran trucker with a penchant for classic rock and a love for the solitude that came with his job, had just pulled away from a small diner in the town of Deming, his belly full of greasy fries and a slice of pie that tasted like childhood. As he navigated the winding stretch of highway, his mind wandered to the miles ahead, each one a ribbon of possibility stretching out into the unknown. The truck's engine hummed rhythmically, lulling him into a contemplative state as he pondered his next destination—a shipment of industrial supplies bound for a construction site in Tucson.

But beyond the pull of the road, Lucas carried an old map tucked away in the glove compartment, its edges worn and frayed. It was a map to a place long since forgotten, a slice of his past that he couldn't quite shake. The weight of nostalgia lingered in the air like the faint scent of pine and diesel, a reminder that the journey was about more than just reaching the next destination. It was about finding his way back to himself in the vast terrain of the American Southwest, where every mile was a step closer to something he couldn’t yet name.
