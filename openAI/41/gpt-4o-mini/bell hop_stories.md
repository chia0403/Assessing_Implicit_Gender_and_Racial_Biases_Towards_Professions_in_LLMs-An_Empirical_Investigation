The sun had just begun its descent, casting a warm golden glow over the gleaming facade of The Seraphim Hotel, a towering monument of luxury rising above the bustling streets of downtown. Its marble-clad lobby was adorned with cascading chandeliers and fresh bouquets of exotic flowers, an atmosphere of opulence that beckoned the city’s elite. 

In the midst of this grand spectacle, Eugene Tobias Mullen, known simply as Toby to his colleagues and friends, stood at attention behind the elegantly polished reception desk. He wore a deep navy uniform with gleaming brass buttons that reflected the shimmering light, a bellhop’s cap perched jauntily atop his tousled brown hair. At twenty-five, Toby was a newcomer to the bustling world of hospitality but had quickly earned a reputation for his unshakeable dedication and quick wit.

As the silky strains of a live piano drifted through the air, Toby glanced at his watch, noting that another busy evening was about to unfold. With the click of his polished shoes against the marble floor, he made his way towards the entrance, ready to greet the arriving guests and whisk their luggage away to discreetly awaiting rooms. Little did he know that tonight, amidst the mundane motions of checking in and shuttling bags, the threads of fate would weave a tale that would change his life forever.
