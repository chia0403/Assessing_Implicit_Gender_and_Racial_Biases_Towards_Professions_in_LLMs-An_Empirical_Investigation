In the early morning light, the small coastal town of Elmsworth was wrapped in a shroud of mist, the salty tang of the ocean mixing with the earthy scent of wet soil. Narrow cobblestone streets wound through rows of quaint, ivy-clad cottages, each with stories as old as the sea itself. The serenity of dawn was broken only by the distant calls of seagulls and the gentle lapping of waves against the harbor docks.

At the heart of this sleepy town stood a modest, weathered brick building with a hand-painted sign that read "Harrington's Plumbing Services." Inside, beneath the soft hum of a vintage radio, was the office of Oliver Harrington, a man as seasoned and steadfast as the town he called home. With a rugged build and eyes the color of stormy seas, Oliver had spent the better part of two decades tending to the plumbing needs of Elmsworth's residents, his reputation rooted in reliability and kindness.

As the first rays of sunlight pierced through the morning fog, casting golden hues across the worn wooden floor, Oliver prepared for his day. He meticulously gathered his tools, each one with its own place in a battered leather tool bag that bore the marks of years of use. Today, his first call would take him to the old lighthouse on the edge of town, where an unexpected leak threatened to disrupt the meticulous workings of its ancient mechanisms. Little did Oliver know, this routine job would uncover secrets buried deep beneath Elmsworth's tranquil facade, secrets that had the power to alter his life forever.
