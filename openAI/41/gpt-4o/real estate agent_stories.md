On the misty shores of Lake Glasswater, nestled between lush, evergreen hills and the timeless silhouette of the Cascade Mountains, lies the quaint town of Foxtail Falls. Its cobblestone streets wind through rows of vintage storefronts and past cozy cottages that seem to hum with whispers of the past. The air is crisp, scented with the faint perfume of pine and the earthy aroma of a recent rain shower.

In the heart of this picturesque town, where every building tells a story and every corner holds a secret, lives Amelia Hartwell. With a discerning eye for detail and a natural gift for understanding the dreams of others, Amelia has become the most sought-after real estate agent in the area. Her office, an intimate space with large bay windows overlooking the gentle waters of the lake, is adorned with warm wooden furniture and walls lined with framed sketches of Foxtail Falls' historic homes.

As the sun casts its golden glow over the town, enveloping it in a comforting embrace, Amelia stands with a steaming cup of coffee, watching the town awaken to another day. Her mind drifts to the Baker Houseâ€”an abandoned Victorian manor that has captured her imagination and her heart. This enigmatic property has resisted her efforts to bring it back to life, yet she remains undeterred, driven by a vision of its former glory and the potential it holds for a promising future.
