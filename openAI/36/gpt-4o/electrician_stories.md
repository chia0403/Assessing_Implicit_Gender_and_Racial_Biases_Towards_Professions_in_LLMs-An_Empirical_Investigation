In the quiet, coastal town of Cedar Bay, where the air was infused with the scent of saltwater and pine, the morning sun cast a golden glow on the rows of modest, clapboard houses that lined the narrow streets. Seagulls cried overhead, their calls mingling with the distant sound of waves crashing against the rocky shoreline. Among those early risers of Cedar Bay was Ethan Caldwell, a skilled electrician known not just for his steady hand with a fuse box, but for his unwavering integrity and infectious humor.

Ethan’s day would typically begin before dawn, as was the case this crisp autumn morning. He emerged from his small, cozy bungalow nestled at the end of Maple Street, humming a tune that only he knew. His toolbox, a weathered companion from years of service, was slung over his shoulder, clinking softly with the metallic promise of a job well done. Today, like most days, was booked solid, filled with appointments scattered across the town—a fuse to fix on Birch Avenue, a new lighting system to install in a quaint bookshop on Main, and a breaker issue at the bustling harbor café.

As Ethan made his way down the cobblestone path, the town slowly came to life around him. Mrs. O'Malley from next door waved cheerfully as she tended to her flowerbeds, and old Mr. Thompson nodded in greeting, his porch already adorned with newspaper and steaming coffee. Life in Cedar Bay moved at its own unhurried pace, and Ethan loved every part of it, finding a certain solace in the predictability and simple joys of his work and community.

This particular morning promised a smooth day, or so Ethan thought. Little did he know that the events to unfold would not only test his expertise but would also spark a mystery as tangled as the wires he so deftly handled.
