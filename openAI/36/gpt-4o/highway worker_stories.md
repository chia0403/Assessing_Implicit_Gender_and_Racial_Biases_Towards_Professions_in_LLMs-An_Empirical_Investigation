As the first light of dawn stretched its golden fingers across the horizon, the world was still a hushed secret, wrapped in the gentle embrace of the morning fog. The highway stretched on like a silver river through the mist, empty and serene, waiting patiently for the day's inevitable cacophony of engines and wheels. 

Here, amidst the quiet solitude of this early hour, stood David Marcus Albright, wrapped in the fluorescent armor of his safety vest. He was a highway worker, a guardian of these asphalt veins that flowed through the landscape, keeping them safe and smooth for the endless parade of travelers. 

The air was crisp with the chill of a lingering night, and David could see his breath swirling in front of him like whispers of forgotten dreams. The rhythmic hum of crickets had quieted, replaced by the distant call of a rooster from a nearby farm, signaling the start of another day. 

David looked out across the stretch of highway he had come to know intimately over the years. Each crack, each seam in the pavement, was like an old friend. The rising sun cast a warm glow on the fields that flanked the road, turning the dewdrops on the grass into a field of diamonds. In this moment, with the world awakening around him, David felt both infinitely small and undeniably connected to something much larger than himself. 

Today would be like many days before itâ€”a litany of tasks and routines. But beneath the surface of this predictability lay an untold story, waiting patiently in the shadows, perched on the edge of unfolding.
