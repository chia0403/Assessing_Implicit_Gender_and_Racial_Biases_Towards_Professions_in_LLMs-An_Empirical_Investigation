As the first light of dawn crept over the jagged silhouette of the Appalachian Mountains, a lone eighteen-wheeler rumbled down the snaking highway, its headlights slicing through the dissipating mist. The humming rhythm of its powerful engine blended with the distant calls of waking birds and the rustling leaves swaying gently in the morning breeze.

Behind the wheel, Jackson "Jax" Monroe squinted against the rising sun. His calloused hands gripped the steering wheel with the ease of long familiarity, guiding his rig—a massive cobalt blue Peterbilt 389—through the winding roads that threaded the heart of West Virginia. Years on the road had given Jax a weathered demeanor; a person wouldn't have guessed that behind his rugged, stubbled face was a man with an encyclopedic knowledge of America's backroads and a penchant for obscure jazz records.

The cab of Jax's truck was almost a second home, cluttered with maps marked with greasy fingerprints, a mug that read "World's Okayest Trucker," and an old cassette player ready to spring into music when the longing for a tune struck. A faded photograph taped to the dashboard caught the morning light—a sepia-toned picture of a smiling young boy beside a more youthful and carefree Jax, a snapshot from a life that felt as though it belonged to someone else. 

The open road before him was a familiar ally and sometimes adversary, and as the odometer ticked up, Jax felt a rare sense of peace. He had a delivery to make in Lexington by sundown, but the journey offered a kind of freedom he'd come to cherish—a place where thoughts could drift like the rolling hills outside his window, untethered, unhindered, and chasing the horizon.
