In the heart of New Haven, where towering oaks whispered secrets to the persistent morning mist, stood Braxton Holloway with a rake in hand. The sprawling estate of Windermere Manor, built from weathered stone and accented with ivy-covered turrets, loomed behind him like a sleeping giant.

Braxton, the estate's diligent groundskeeper, began his day as he always did—before the sun had fully committed to waking. The horizon was painted with hues of lavender and soft gold, casting a serene glow over the dew-laden grass. Braxton, a tall man with a rugged yet calm demeanor, moved with a practiced grace acquired over decades of tending to the land. His olive-green cap shaded piercing blue eyes that seemed to notice every detail the landscape had to offer.

To his left, the rose garden awaited his care, its velvet petals craving attention after a brisk summer storm had passed through the night before. To his right, a labyrinth of hedges that Windermere was famous for stretched out like a verdant puzzle, eagerly anticipating its manicured perfection. Despite the grandeur of the estate, where marble statues watched over elegantly manicured lawns, it was the simple rhythm of his days that Braxton treasured.

Today, however, there was an unfamiliar rustle in the air—a change that Braxton sensed more than saw. It might have been the persistent breeze flipping the pages of The New Haven Gazette left carelessly on a cast iron bench, or perhaps the low, mournful call of a distant foghorn that set an unusual undercurrent. Whatever it was, Braxton paused in his work, his senses prickling with the hint of a story unfolding, a story that began beneath the canopy of Windermere's ancient oaks.
