Title: The Echo of Truth

The sun dipped low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the small town of Eldridge. Nestled between the sprawling green hills and a winding river, the community thrived on its tight-knit atmosphere. The streets, lined with quaint brick houses and vibrant flower beds, bustled with the end-of-day hum of families returning home. 

In this peaceful setting, Dr. Elise Hawthorne, a counseling psychologist known for her insightful approach to mental health, prepared for another evening session at her cozy practice. The office was adorned with soft pastel colors, plush furnishings, and shelves of meticulously organized books on psychology and self-help. A gentle fragrance of lavender wafted through the air, mingling with the faint sound of wind chimes from the open window.

Elise had dedicated her life to helping others navigate their inner struggles. With her short, chestnut hair framing her face and a pair of round glasses perched on her nose, she exuded a warm, approachable demeanor. But beneath her calm exterior lay a storm of her own; an unanswered question that had lingered in her heart since her childhood in Eldridge—what really happened the day her younger brother vanished?

As she prepared for her first client of the evening, the flickering candles cast dancing shadows on the walls, mirroring the flickers of unease within her. Today, as she sat poised with a notepad and a pen, she felt an unusual tension in the air, as if the universe had conspired to reveal a truth that had long remained buried. She wasn’t just a counselor tonight; she was on the precipice of confronting the ghosts of her past.
