Title: "The Last Cut"

Setting: In the quaint, fog-drenched village of Eldermoor, nestled between rolling hills and thick, shadowy woods, lies a small butcher shop named "Winston's Cuts." The shop is a charming establishment, its old wooden sign creaking softly in the wind, boasting a faded hand-painted logo of a cleaver and a pig. Inside, the air hangs thick with the rich, savory aroma of herbs and smoked meats, while the walls are adorned with photographs of the butcher’s proudest achievements—a collection of artisan sausages, artisan hams, and the occasional trophy from the annual county fair.

Main Character: Meet Albert Gideon Winston, the village butcher. At fifty-two, he is a robust man with a salt-and-pepper beard that seemed to have been sculpted for both flavor and warmth. His hands are calloused and strong, each finger holding stories of the countless cuts he’s made and the lives he's touched through his work. Albert is not just a tradesman; he is a craftsman who believes that every piece of meat holds a story, each cut revealing a deeper connection to the land that nurtured it.

As dawn breaks over Eldermoor, a tender light spills into the butcher shop through the dusty windows. Albert wipes down the polished wooden counter with a cloth, humming an old tune that he learned from his father, who had stood in this very spot before him. He glances over at the shelves, stocked with his best creations: hand-rolled sausages layered with spices, rich cuts of beef marbled with flavor, and glistening strings of cured meat hanging in neat rows. Yet, beneath the surface of this charming facade, there is an unsettling tension, whispering through the streets of Eldermoor—rumors of livestock disappearing from local farms and shadows creeping too close to the edges of the village.

Today feels different, though. The air is electric with anticipation, as if the village itself is holding its breath. Albert hands a piece of fresh pork to a customer—old Mrs. Hargrove, her eyes crinkled with age and kindness. She leans in closer, conspiratorial. “You’ve heard the whispers, haven’t you, Mr. Winston? They say the woods are hiding secrets...” 

As Albert glances out at the thick woods beyond Eldermoor, the canopy of trees swaying in the morning breeze, he can’t help but feel that the stories of old are once again about to unfold—stories that may well involve him and the art of his craft.
