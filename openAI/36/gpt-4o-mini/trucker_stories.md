The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the endless stretch of highway that snaked its way through the heart of Texas. The rhythmic hum of tires against asphalt was a familiar lullaby to Thomas "T. J." Mercer as he piloted his rusted blue Freightliner down Route 281, a well-worn path he’d traveled more times than he could count. The air was thick with a warm breeze, mingling the scent of creosote and desert sage, while the last embers of daylight painted the sky in hues of orange and purple.

T. J., a rugged figure with a weathered face and salt-and-pepper hair peeking from beneath his well-loved cap, had spent the last two decades of his life behind the wheel, navigating a world that felt perpetually on the move. His hands, calloused yet steady, gripped the wheel as he glanced at the clock on the dashboard—another long haul lay ahead, but he relished the solitude and freedom of the road. The cabin of his truck, a blend of old leather and occasional fast food wrappers, was his sanctuary away from the chaos of everyday life.

Tonight, he was bound for El Paso, carrying a load of goods essential for the small towns that dotted the Texas landscape. With a sunset behind him and the stars beginning to wake, T. J. turned up the country music on the radio, letting the familiar twang wash over him, a reminder of home as he ventured into the unknown stretches of the night ahead. Little did he know, this trip would lead him into an unexpected adventure that would change his life forever.
