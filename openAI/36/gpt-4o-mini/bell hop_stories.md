**Title: The Last Bellhop**

**Setting: Crescent Bay Hotel, a luxurious seaside resort nestled along the rugged cliffs of the Pacific Coast. The hotel, adorned with art deco architecture and lush gardens, boasts stunning ocean views and a vibrant history. It’s a rainy Tuesday afternoon, with storm clouds swirling ominously overhead, casting a moody ambiance over the bustling lobby, where the scent of wet marble mingles with freshly brewed coffee.**

**Story Opening:**

As the heavy wooden doors of the Crescent Bay Hotel swung open, a gust of wind swept through the lobby, momentarily chilling the air. Guests bustled about, their laughter and chatter barely audible over the pattering rain. Among them was Wesley Ferdinand Hayes, a bellhop whose polished brass name tag gleamed like a beacon of service against his crisp, navy blue uniform. He stood just to the side of the reception desk, the faintest hint of apprehension hidden behind his practiced smile. 

Wesley was more than just a bellhop; he was a keeper of secrets, a silent witness to the tales woven by the hotel’s eclectic visitors. With his dark curls slicked back and dark eyes observant to the smallest detail, he moved through the lobby with the grace of a dancer. Today, however, a sense of foreboding settled around him like the encroaching storm. The atmosphere crackled with unspoken tension, drawing his attention to a peculiar family that had just checked in, their bright luggage contrasting sharply with the dreary weather. 

As he approached, the thunder rumbled outside, and for a fleeting moment, time seemed to hold its breath. He could sense something extraordinary was on the horizon—something that would change the course of his ordinary existence at the Crescent Bay Hotel forever.
