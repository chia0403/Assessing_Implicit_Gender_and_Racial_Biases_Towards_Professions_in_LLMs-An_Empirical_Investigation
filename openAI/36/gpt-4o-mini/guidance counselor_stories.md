Title: "Whispers of Change"

Setting: The old brick building of Maplewood High School loomed under a grey November sky, its weathered facade adorned with climbing vines that seemed to cling to the past. Inside, the hallways buzzed with the typical chaos of adolescent life—shouted greetings, the shuffling of sneakers on linoleum floors, and the unmistakable sound of lockers slamming shut. In the heart of this bustling institution, the guidance counseling office was a sanctuary of calm, awash in soft peach hues and filled with the faint scent of lavender from a small diffuser on the windowsill, providing a warm contrast to the chill outside.

Opening: As the first bell rang, signaling the start of yet another school day, Caroline Mae Dawson, the seasoned guidance counselor, settled into her well-worn office chair. Piles of paperwork threatened to overflow from her desk, each folder representing a student with dreams, anxieties, and potential yet to be realized. Caroline, with her gentle smile and keen intuition, peeled back the layers of her own tumultuous past—days spent navigating the tricky waters of adolescence as an awkward teenager herself. She remembered the whispers of doubt and the guiding hands that had once pointed her towards a brighter future. 

Today, she had a full schedule, but the weight of a sinking feeling settled in her chest. There was something in the air, a palpable tension that seemed to echo long before the students even stepped through the door. "Change is coming," she murmured to herself, fingers brushing the edges of a student’s application. Little did she know, beneath the surface of Maplewood High, a storm was brewing that would test her resolve and the bonds she had forged with the young souls that sought her guidance.
