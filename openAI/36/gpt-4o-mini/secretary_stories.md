In the heart of the bustling metropolis of Riveport, where glass skyscrapers pierced the clouds and the hum of city life echoed on every street corner, stood the unassuming building of Waverly & Co., a mid-sized law firm known more for its tenacity than its stature. Inside, elegant mahogany desks lined the expansive office floor, and the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the crisp scent of paper and ink. It was here, amidst the clattering of keyboards and the soft rustle of legal documents, that Annabelle Claire Thornton meticulously orchestrated the daily rhythm of the firm.

At twenty-eight, Annabelle was the kind of secretary who had perfected the art of juggling priorities, ensuring that every appointment was logged with precision, every client felt valued, and every partner’s needs were met—often before they even had to ask. With her chestnut hair neatly pinned up and her slate-gray pencil skirt impeccably pressed, she exuded an air of professionalism that masked an inner world pulsing with dreams of becoming a successful writer. 

As the clock ticked toward noon, the sunlight filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a warm glow over her organized chaos—a sea of colorful sticky notes, open legal books, and a small succulent desperate for attention. Today felt different, though, like the quiet before a storm. She had just received an unexpected email that hinted at a mysterious case—a case that could unravel not only the firm’s reputation but also herald a new chapter in her own life. The subject line simply read: “Confidential: Urgent Matter.” Annabelle took a breath, steeling herself for whatever secrets lay ahead.
