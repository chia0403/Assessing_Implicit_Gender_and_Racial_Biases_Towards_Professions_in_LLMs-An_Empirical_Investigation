The sun was just beginning to rise over the sleepy town of Eldermere, casting warm golden hues across the weathered rooftops and cobblestone streets. A light mist lingered in the air, giving the early morning an ethereal quality as the world stirs to life. In the heart of the town, nestled between an aged bakery and a quaint bookshop, stood a small workshop with a sign that read "Thorne & Timber." The scent of freshly cut wood wafted from the entrance, mingling with the aroma of baked goods.

Inside the workshop, the rhythmic sound of a hammer striking nails echoed softly, blending with the gentle creaks and groans of the old building. Here, amidst the shavings and sawdust, worked Augustus Thorne, a skilled carpenter with an eye for detail and a heart that resonated with the natural world. At thirty-eight, Augustus possessed a rugged charm, with tousled chestnut hair, a scruffy beard, and hands marked by years of labor.

Augustus was known throughout Eldermere not just for the exquisite furniture and intricate cabinetry he crafted, but for his ability to infuse each piece with a narrative of its own. From rustic dining tables that echoed laughter to delicate rocking chairs that cradled whispered dreams, his work transformed wood into cherished memories.

As he stood before a hulking slab of cherry wood, lost in thought, he couldn’t shake the feeling that today would bring more than just the usual orders from his loyal customers. Little did he know, a peculiar set of circumstances was about to unfold—one that would test his craftsmanship not only in wood but also in navigating the hidden depths of his own heart.
