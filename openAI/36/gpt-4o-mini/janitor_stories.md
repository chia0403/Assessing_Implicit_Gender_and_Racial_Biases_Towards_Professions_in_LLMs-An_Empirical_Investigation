In the quiet, dimly lit corridors of Wilkins High School, the faint hum of fluorescent lights echoed like whispers in a forgotten chapel. The paint on the walls, once a bright cheery yellow, had faded to a dull mustard hue, revealing years of neglect and wear. Lockers stood like sentinels, their metal doors scratched and rusted, holding onto memories of laughter and tears, of friendships formed and dreams shattered.

Every evening, as the last of the students filed out with backpacks full of the day’s burdens, one person remained behind—the janitor. Leonard Percival Thompson, a man of fifty, with salt-and-pepper hair that spoke of a lifetime of hard work, moved through the hallways with a mop in one hand and a bucket in the other. He wore the same faded blue coveralls day after day, their pockets filled with the detritus of his trade: old candy wrappers, broken pencils, and the occasional lost library book.

For Leonard, this school was more than just a place of employment; it was a chronicle of his life. He had started his custodial career here right after graduating high school, never imagining he would still be sweeping the floors thirty years later. But there was comfort in the routine, in knowing the creaks of the floorboards and the secrets hidden in every room. 

As the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting long shadows through the smudged windows, Leonard prepared for his nightly tasks. He paused at the entrance of the science lab, where he could still taste the remnants of triumph and disappointment from the students’ latest projects. That room held stories waiting to be uncovered, a world intertwined with his own, waiting for a curious soul to unlock the mysteries inside. Little did Leonard know, tonight would be unlike any other, and the ghosts of the past were about to come alive in unexpected ways.
