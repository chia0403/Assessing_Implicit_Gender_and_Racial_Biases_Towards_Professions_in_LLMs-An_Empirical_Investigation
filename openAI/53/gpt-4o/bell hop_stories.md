On a crisp autumn morning, the sun peeked over the jagged peaks of the Colorado Rockies, casting a golden glow that danced across the town of Aspen like nature's spotlight. Within this picturesque setting stood the Grand Summit Hotel, a century-old establishment that wore its age like a badge of honor. The hotel, with its stone façade and tall, elegant windows, exuded an air of timeless grandeur amidst the vibrant tapestry of fall foliage.

Inside the lobby, polished mahogany and gleaming brass invited guests into a world where the past met the present with seamless grace. The fireplace crackled softly, its warmth mingling with the fragrance of pine and cedar, creating an atmosphere that was both welcoming and luxurious.

Amidst the bustle of porters and tourists stood Henry Dalton, the hotel’s dedicated bellhop. At twenty-seven, Henry had mastered the art of invisibility—quietly attentive, present yet unobtrusive. With his neatly pressed uniform and cap set just so, he was the trusted custodian of guests' precious cargo and creators of their first impression of the Grand Summit.

Henry had a knack for recalling guests' names and preferences, a skill that endeared him to the regulars and impressed newcomers. His sharp eyes missed nothing, and his quick smile seemed to hold a secret only the hotel itself could share. As he maneuvered through the lobby, he paused briefly to help a swamped family with their luggage, deftly navigating them through the intricacies of check-in.

The morning sun filtered through the grand entrance, casting long shadows across the marble floor. Henry loved this time of day—the promise of new arrivals, each guest carrying stories and mysteries of their own, all temporarily converging in this mountain sanctuary. As he held open the heavy oak door to welcome a new day of travelers, Henry couldn't shake the feeling that his own story was quietly, but steadily, unfurling within the walls of the Grand Summit.
