In the heart of the quaint town of Everwood, nestled between the whispering pines and the babbling brook that threaded its way through the landscape, stood an old stone building known simply as The Haven. Built decades ago, with ivy creeping gently along its walls, The Haven served multiple purposes, though its primary function was its quaint bookstore and café—a beloved gathering place for townspeople and travelers alike.

Inside, amid the comforting scent of fresh paper mingling with the rich aroma of brewed coffee, sat Evangeline Grace Kensington. She was a meticulous bookkeeper whose love for numbers was rivaled only by her affection for the written word. Her station was a sturdy wooden desk by the window, where the sunlight streamed in during the day, casting glowing patterns across her ledger and illuminating the wavy auburn locks that framed her thoughtful face.

Evangeline had lived in Everwood her entire life, and although her fingers had danced over countless columns of numbers throughout the years, there was something inherently comforting about the predictability of her work. She was a stalwart fixture in The Haven, her ledger as indispensable as the books that lined the shelves. But little did she know, on this particular autumn morning, as the leaves turned to vibrant shades of gold and crimson, that her life was about to take a surprising turn—a mystery, hidden within the pages she so carefully tallied, awaited discovery.
