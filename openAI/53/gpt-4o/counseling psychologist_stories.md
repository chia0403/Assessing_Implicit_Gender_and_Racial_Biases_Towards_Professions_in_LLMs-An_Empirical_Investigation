Dr. Eleanor “Ellie” Marcum stood at the edge of Lake Seraphim, the morning mist curling like wisps of smoke above the placid water. The town of Harborside, nestled in the heart of New England, was just beginning to wake, its narrow cobblestone streets and historic clapboard houses still enveloped in the quiet embrace of dawn. The air was crisp with the scent of pine and the distant echo of the ocean, not far beyond the rolling hills that framed the lakeside view.

Ellie tightened her grip on the steaming cup of coffee cradled in her hands, savoring the warmth that seeped into her chilled fingers. This was her sanctuary, a place far removed from the complexities and emotions that filled her days at the Harborside Wellness Center, where she helped guide her patients through the labyrinths of their minds. The center, a converted Victorian mansion overlooking the town square, was a stark contrast to this tranquil lakeside spot.

Here, by the water, Ellie found a sense of peace and clarity, her own thoughts swirling with the same currents of introspection she so often encouraged in others. Her morning ritual was solitary, a brief pause before stepping into the roles of listener, healer, and confidante. The gentle lapping of the lake’s waves provided a rhythm to her thoughts, a cadence that would accompany her into the challenges and triumphs of the day’s work.
