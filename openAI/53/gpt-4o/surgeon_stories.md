Dr. Lillian Carter gazed out of her office window, watching the sun clamber slowly over the horizon. The golden light spilled across the sprawling city of Seattle, illuminating the early morning mist that clung to the Space Needle like a forgotten dream. Inside the hospital, the air buzzed with the quiet hum of fluorescent lights and the distant rhythm of the city waking up. It was the kind of morning that promised a mixture of hope and uncertainty, the kind Dr. Carter had grown accustomed to since the beginning of her surgical career.

The walls of her office were adorned with framed degrees and commendations, reminders of her relentless journey through the rigorous demands of medical school and residency. But among those honors, one photo stood out: a snapshot of her and her younger sister, Sophie, from a time when life seemed so much simpler. Lillian pressed her hand softly against the cool glass frame, her eyes resting briefly on her own smiling face before turning back to the view outside.

The Bishop Memorial Hospital, where she had spent countless hours saving lives and piecing together the broken fragments of human bodies, was a fortress of hope in the midst of lifeâ€™s chaos. Lillian knew she would walk into another day filled with challenges and triumphs, uncertainties and miracles. Adjusting her lab coat, she took a deep breath, ready to face whatever story unfolded in the operating room today.
