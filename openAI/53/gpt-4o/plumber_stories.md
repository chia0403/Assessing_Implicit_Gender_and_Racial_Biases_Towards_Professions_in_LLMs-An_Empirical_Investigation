In the heart of the quaint and sleepy village of Mapleford, where cobblestone streets wound like ribbons between centuries-old cottages, Albert Gideon was known as more than just the resident plumber. His truck, emblazoned with “Gideon Plumbing Services” in bold blue letters, was as much a fixture in the town as the ancient clock tower that stood sentinel over the village square. On the crisp autumn morning that marked the beginning of this tale, a gentle fog clung to the ground, and the smell of damp leaves permeated the air, signaling the change of seasons.

Albert, with his signature flat cap perched jauntily atop his head, was already hard at work. His fingers, rough but nimble, danced over an array of gleaming brass pipes laid out by the side of the village green. Known for his meticulous craftsmanship and a heart as warm as the grey wool coat he wore, Albert was the person everyone called upon not just for plumbing woes, but for a friendly chat and sage advice.

This particular morning, as he prepared to tackle another day of leaky faucets and rattling radiators, an unexpected discovery in the worn leather satchel that carried his tools set the course for an adventure unlike any he had known. As the villagers bustled around him, unaware of the mystery afoot, little did Albert Gideon know that he was about to unravel secrets buried deep beneath the cobblestones of Mapleford.
