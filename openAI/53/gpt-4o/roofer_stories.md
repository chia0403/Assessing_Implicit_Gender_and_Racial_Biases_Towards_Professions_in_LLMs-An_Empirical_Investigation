On the outskirts of the sleepy town of Maplewood, where the streets were lined with amber leaves and the crisp autumn air hinted at the winter soon to come, Jonathan "Jack" Montgomery stood atop the Ferguson family's residence. His well-worn tool belt hung snugly around his waist, filled with an assortment of hammers, nails, and a measure tape that had seen better days. The morning sun spilled a golden hue across the rooftops, painting a comforting canvas over the small suburban houses that dotted the landscape.

Jack had been a roofer for nearly a decade in this quaint New England town, a place where every home seemed to have a story that whispered through the creaks and groans of its beams. Known for his meticulous craft and honest nature, Jack had become a cherished figure in Maplewood, often sharing a hearty laugh or a piece of sage advice with his neighbors as he worked. Today, as he crouched to inspect the shingles for winter readiness, a hint of nostalgia stirred within him, mingling with the ever-present scent of pine.

His contemplative mood was soon interrupted by the familiar creak of the ladder as Rob Ferguson appeared at the edge of the roof. "Morning, Jack," Rob called, his breath visible in the chill. "Hope you’re ready for another cold one."

With a nod and a slight smile, Jack replied, "Always, Rob. Roofs won’t fix themselves." As he returned to his task, Jack couldn’t shake the feeling that this autumn might bring more than just the changing leaves.
