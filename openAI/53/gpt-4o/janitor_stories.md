In the heart of downtown Newbridge, where the city pulsed with an unyielding energy, stood the towering structure of the Sterling Towers, a skyscraper that grazed the clouds with its shimmering steel and glass facade. By day, it was a bustling hub of corporate activity, with polished professionals moving briskly through marbled corridors and plush offices. But when the day surrendered to twilight and the city’s skyline blushed with the hues of a setting sun, Sterling Towers revealed a quieter, more intimate rhythm.

It was in these hushed hours that Clarence Whitaker, the building's devoted janitor, began his nightly ritual. Clarence was a man of quiet dignity in his late fifties, his silver-speckled hair and gentle demeanor often belying the remarkable resilience and wisdom etched in the lines of his face. Having worked at Sterling Towers for nearly two decades, the building was as much a part of him as the stories he carried from years gone by.

Clarence moved methodically through the dimly lit hallways, the familiar creak of his wheeled cleaning cart echoing softly in his wake. His hands, calloused yet gentle, were accustomed to the rhythm of sweeping and dusting—a cadence that often served as a backdrop to his silent reflections. As he made his rounds, he would occasionally pause to gaze out of the vast windows, where the city lay spread out like a glittering tapestry beneath a canopy of stars.

In this world of after-hours solitude, Clarence was more than just a custodian of the building’s physical spaces; he was a guardian of its secrets, a silent witness to the lives that unfurled within its walls. On this particular evening, as a subtle autumn chill slipped in through the revolving doors, Clarence sensed that something was about to change—a whisper in the air, a shift in the shadows. And with the ease of intuition born from years of observation, he knew that the peaceful predictability of his nights at Sterling Towers was about to be disrupted in ways he could never have foreseen.
