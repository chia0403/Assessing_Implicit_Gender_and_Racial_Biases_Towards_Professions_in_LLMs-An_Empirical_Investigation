Dr. Nathaniel James Cartwright stood at the edge of the hospital’s rooftop garden, the cool breeze teasing the edges of his crisp white coat. Below him, the sprawling city buzzed with the typical mid-afternoon chaos—honking taxis, hurried pedestrians, and the distant wail of an ambulance piercing the air. The scent of blooming jasmine and freshly cut grass wafted around him, a rare oasis amidst the frenetic energy of Maplewood General Hospital.

At thirty-five, Nathaniel had already carved a name for himself as one of the finest cardiac surgeons in the region. His meticulous hands and keen intuition had saved countless lives, yet in the quiet moments like this, when he was alone with his thoughts, he often pondered the cost of his success. The canvas of his life felt increasingly defined by surgical precision, while the strokes of personal connection faded into the background.

As he contemplated the weight of his scalpel and the trust placed in him by patients and families alike, his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket. He slipped it out, glancing at the screen, but the name that flashed back at him was unexpected—his estranged younger brother, Ethan. It had been years since they had spoken, and Nathaniel’s heart raced with a mix of confusion and apprehension. With a deep breath, he swiped the screen, and the city below felt momentarily forgotten.
