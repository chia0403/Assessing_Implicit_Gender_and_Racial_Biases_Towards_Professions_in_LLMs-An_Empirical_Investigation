In the heart of downtown Deloria stood the illustrious Montgomery Hotel, a grand structure of classic architecture that gleamed with opulence and history. Velvet curtains framed the expansive lobby, where chandeliers twinkled like stars suspended from the high ceiling. The scent of polished wood mixed with the faint aroma of fresh lilies that adorned the marble reception desk, captivating the guests arriving from all corners of the world.

Among the crowd, meandering gracefully between suitcases and smiles, was Benjamin Harold Finch, the hotel’s most dedicated bellhop. Clad in a neatly pressed uniform, complete with a crimson waistcoat and gold-embroidered insignia, Benjamin expertly balanced his duties with a pleasant demeanor. He was the type of person whose charm could brighten even the cloudiest day, his dark curls bouncing slightly with each step he took across the polished marble floor.

It was a crisp autumn afternoon, the kind of day that hinted at the festive season approaching. As Benjamin opened the heavy glass door for a family, the cool breeze swirled in, carrying the scent of falling leaves. He watched, as children giggled and dashed towards the indoor fountain, their laughter echoing through the grand atrium. But it was not the joyous sounds of the guests that consumed his thoughts; it was the fragile envelope tucked in his pocket—an invitation addressed to him, the words scrawled in an elegant hand. It promised a surprise that could alter the course of his mundane life. Little did he know that the secrets of the illustrious Montgomery Hotel were about to unfold before him, and his journey as a bellhop held more significance than anyone could imagine.
