**Title: The Midnight Keys**

**Setting:** The opulent and labyrinthine Grand Ashford Hotel, a historic landmark nestled in the heart of a bustling metropolis. With its gilded chandeliers, marbled floors, and echoing ballrooms, the hotel stands as a relic of a bygone era, yet it is alive with the modern pulse of travelers from around the world. Each hallway bears witness to whispered secrets, and every ornate room holds its own story, waiting to be unfurled.

**Opening:**

As the clock struck midnight, the soft hum of voices and clinking glasses faded into an uneasy silence that blanketed the Grand Ashford Hotel's lobby. Shadows danced among the towering pillars, and the occasional flicker of candlelight cast an air of intrigue around the reception desk where Maximilian Edgar Thorne perched with an astute gaze. The title of concierge had come with its own set of keys—both literal and metaphorical—that Max had learned to wield with a deftness acquired over nearly a decade of service.

Known for his impeccable manners and an uncanny knack for reading guests, Max could decipher their desires faster than they could express them. However, tonight felt different. A peculiar tension lingered in the air, like static before a storm. While the city buzzed alive outside, the hotel remained a fortress of old-world charm, its walls built to safeguard years of stories, mysteries, and heartbeats that echoed within.

As the grand double doors swung open, a gust of chilly autumn wind swept in, carrying with it a new arrival—a woman cloaked in a long, deep green coat, her eyes shimmering with the secrets of the night. Max felt the subtle shift in the atmosphere, compelling him to rise from behind the desk, his heart quickening at the thought of what awaited him in the shadows of his beloved hotel. With a polite nod, he steeled himself for the first encounter of what would become a most unforgettable evening.
