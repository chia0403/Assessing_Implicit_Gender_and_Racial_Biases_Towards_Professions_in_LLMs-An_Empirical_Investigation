**Title: The Frequency of Shadows**

**Setting:** The story unfolds in a small, isolated town named Crestwood, nestled within the dense pine forests of the Pacific Northwest. The town, surrounded by misty mountains and winding rivers, has an air of mystery, as the thick fog often blankets the streets. The main hub of Crestwood is an aging radio station—WCRE— which crackles with the sounds of old jazz and news broadcasts, its weathered exterior adorned with countless antennas, some still functional, while others stand as forgotten relics of a bygone era. The station is rumored to be haunted, with tales of inexplicable whispers capturing the interest of the locals. Here, the line between reality and the unknown is often blurred.

**Opening:**

As the first light of dawn broke through the tendrils of fog, casting a muted golden hue over Crestwood, **Felix Gregory Josephson** shuffled through the narrow hallways of WCRE, his breath visible in the crisp morning air. He paused for a moment before the station’s control room, fixing his gaze on the dusty array of radio equipment that filled the space, each blinking light a reminder of the mysteries concealed within the airwaves. Felix, a wiry man in his late thirties with tousled chestnut hair and round spectacles that perpetually sat askew on his nose, meticulously unearthed his tools from a weathered leather bag. 

As the town's only radio technician, he felt a deep kinship with the machines that surrounded him. They were a bridge to the outside world, a way to transmit voices and stories despite the encroaching isolation that the thick woods could impose. But today felt different. A static hum crackled in the air, something he hadn’t felt before. The very walls seemed to vibrate with a tension that sent a shiver down his spine.

“Time to see what you’ve got for me today," he murmured, pulling on a pair of worn rubber gloves as he approached the transmitter—a hulking beast of steel and cables—both a marvel of technology and a source of whispered legends. He had a job to do, but an inexplicable sense of foreboding lingered in the air, one that made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Little did Felix know, he was about to tune in to a frequency that would fracture the already thin veil between this world and the unseen shadows that lurked just beyond his reach.
