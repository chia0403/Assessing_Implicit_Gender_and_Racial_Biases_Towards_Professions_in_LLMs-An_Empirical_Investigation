**Title: The Ghost Light**

**Setting:** 

In the heart of a crumbling Victorian theater, with peeling burgundy walls and a grand chandelier that flickers like a firefly caught in a net, the air is thick with the scent of dust and mothballs. The main stage, once a vibrant canvas of creative expression, is now cloaked in shadows, illuminated only by the haunting glow of a solitary ghost light that stands sentinel at center stage. The stage is littered with remnants of past productions: discarded costumes, cracked makeup mirrors, and aging wooden props that whisper forgotten stories of audiences long gone. The theater sits on the edge of a bustling city, an oasis of artistry amid the encroaching noise of modern life, but its glory days seem to be fading into whispers.

**Opening:**

As the late afternoon sun dipped behind the city skyline, casting long shadows across the stage, Madeline Vivienne Carter stood at the edge, her brow furrowed in thought. A renowned theatrical director known for her uncanny ability to breathe life into even the most outdated scripts, Madeline was both captivated and intimidated by the theater's looming presence. Today marked the first rehearsal of her most ambitious project yet: a revival of a long-forgotten play rumored to have been cursed. 

A vibrant tapestry of emotions swirled within her as she gazed into the darkened house, envisioning the seats filled with eager faces. She could already hear the echoes of applause, but beneath that excitement lay a gnawing unease. “Cursed plays,” she muttered to herself, pacing the creaky wooden floorboards. “Just another myth to keep the boring actors entertained.” 

But as she adjusted the collar of her long, black coat, a chill danced up her spine, igniting a spark of doubt. The air crackled as if the spirits of the theater were listening, waiting, and urging her to tread carefully. Today, she would challenge the shadows of the past and summon new voices from the depths of her own creativity—if only she could silence the whispers that begged for release.
