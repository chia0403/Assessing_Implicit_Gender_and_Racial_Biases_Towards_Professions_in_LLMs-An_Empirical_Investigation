The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden hue over the sprawling expanse of Ashwood Estate. Nestled amid a tapestry of ancient oaks and meticulously trimmed hedges, the estate had been in the Holloway family for generations, its grandeur fading yet still whispering echoes of a bygone era. The soft chirping of crickets blended with the distant sound of rustling leaves, creating a serene atmosphere that belied the secrets buried beneath its surface.

At the heart of this tranquil scene was Barnaby Thomas Weldon, the estate’s groundskeeper. Tall and sturdy, with earth-stained hands and a perpetually sun-kissed complexion, Barnaby had spent the better part of his life caring for the estate’s vast gardens and lavish lawns. His trusty garden tools slung over his shoulder, he moved with a quiet determination, each step deliberate as he navigated the sun-dappled paths snaking through vibrant flower beds. The scent of freshly turned soil and blooming lilacs wafted through the air, a sharp reminder of the life he nurtured daily.

As the last rays of sunlight melted into twilight, casting long shadows that danced across the emerald grass, Barnaby paused to wipe the sweat from his brow. The estate had its charms, but tonight felt different. There was a subtle tension in the air, a whisper of something amiss that set his instincts aflame. He turned his gaze toward the sprawling manor, its windows aglow with flickering candlelight, and wondered what secrets it would reveal as night fell over Ashwood Estate.
