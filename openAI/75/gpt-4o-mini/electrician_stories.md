Title: **Wires and Whispers**

**Setting:** The sleepy town of Eldridge Hollow, nestled between the rolling hills of New England, is a place where centuries-old stone buildings stand beside charming clapboard houses. The air is tinged with the scent of pine and hints of autumn leaves. As dusk descends, the glow of streetlamps casts flickering shadows, and the soft sound of crickets hums in the background. On the outskirts of town, the skeleton of an old, uninhabited factory looms, its windows shattered and its walls overgrown with ivy—a relic of a forgotten era.

**Opening:**

As the sun dipped behind the hills, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt of Eldridge Hollow, Orion T. Campbell adjusted his tool belt with practiced ease. The worn leather had seen better days, just like the electric box he was about to face. Orion, a third-generation electrician, often mused that he was more comfortable navigating the tangled web of wires and circuits than he was traversing the complexities of human relationships. 

He shifted his gaze to the derelict factory looming nearby, its darkened windows resembling hollow eyes watching his every move. The town had spoken in hushed tones about the strange occurrences that took place there, but to Orion, the supernatural was simply another layer of mystery to unravel. He chuckled to himself, lowering his cap as he walked toward the low hum of energy emanating from the building. As he flicked open his flashlight, a soft crackle of static greeted him, as if the very air were alive with whispers from the past, urging him forward into the darkness.

Little did Orion know, tonight would be more than just a routine repair; it would untangle long-buried secrets that would challenge everything he thought he understood about the world—and himself.
