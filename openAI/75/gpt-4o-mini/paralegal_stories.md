**Story Opening:**

The persistent drizzle painted the streets of downtown Salem in hues of gray, blurring the edges of the city’s imposing high-rises. Beads of water clung to the windows of the double-decker bus as it rumbled along, muffling the conversations of hurried commuters. Inside, surrounded by the scent of wet asphalt and the faint, lingering aroma of brewing coffee, Paige Elizabeth Connors tapped her fingers nervously against the cold metal of her laptop case. It was just another Wednesday morning for the paralegal at Hartman & Lewis, but today felt different. Today, the way the clouds loomed overhead seemed to echo the weight of her thoughts. 

As the bus lurched to a stop, Paige took a deep breath, steeling herself for another round of battles in the courtroom and the office. She had worked almost two years alongside the sharp-suited attorneys, soaking in legal jargon and courtroom strategies, but one line had been forever etched in her mind: *“If you’re not prepared to fight for your truth, then you might as well hang up your boots.”* Today, she was determined to stand her ground, not only as an assistant but as a pivotal figure in a case that felt deeply personal.

Stepping off the bus, the city buzzed with life around her, completely oblivious to the quiet storm brewing within. A reminder on her phone buzzed, pulling her from her reverie. 9:30 AM — the meeting with the senior partners. Gritting her teeth, Paige adjusted her glasses and squared her shoulders, the rain-soaked city setting the stage for a day that would challenge everything she believed in.
