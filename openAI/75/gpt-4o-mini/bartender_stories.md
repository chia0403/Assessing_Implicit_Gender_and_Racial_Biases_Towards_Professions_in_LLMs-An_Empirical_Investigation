The rain poured down in rhythmic sheets, tapping against the large bay windows of The Silver Oak, a quaint bar nestled on the corner of East and Main in the heart of Old Town. The low hum of chatter blended with the soft jazz wafting from a vintage record player in the corner, creating a warm ambiance that wrapped around patrons like a well-worn blanket. Inside, the rich scent of aged wood and earthy herbs mingled with the citrusy tang of freshly squeezed cocktails.

Behind the polished oak bar stood River Morgan, a sharp-eyed bartender known for her uncanny ability to remember every regular's drink order, along with the details of their lives. At twenty-nine, River was a master of her craft, her hands moving fluidly as she mixed and muddled, her dark hair tied back in a loose bun, strands escaping to frame her expressive face. She loved this space—the stories that unfolded at the bar, the laughter shared over clinking glasses, and the way even the loneliest souls found a moment of connection amid the clamor.

As the clock struck seven, the door creaked open, and a gust of wind brought in a swirl of damp air. River turned her attention to the newcomer, her keen gaze assessing the mystery wrapped in a soaked, gray trench coat and a wide-brimmed hat. Something in the way the figure hesitated at the entrance hinted at a story waiting to be told—a twist of fate that could change the course of an ordinary night at The Silver Oak.
