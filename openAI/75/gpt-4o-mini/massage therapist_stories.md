**Title: The Scent of Healing**

**Setting:** Tucked away on a quiet street in the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, a small, serene massage therapy studio named “Elysium Touch” breathes life into the bustling artistic community around it. The air is imbued with soothing lavender and eucalyptus scents, and soft instrumental music flows through the space, mingling with the distant sounds of nature. The walls are adorned with calming, pastel green hues, and each treatment room is furnished with plush massage tables draped in crisp, white linens. Outside, a small garden blooms with wildflowers, their colors vibrant against the deep green foliage, creating a peaceful oasis for clients seeking solace from their hectic lives.

**Opening:** 

Calliope Aurora Carter stood at the entrance of Elysium Touch, taking a deep breath of the fragrant air that wrapped around her like a warm embrace. She loved this part of the day—when the world felt hushed, and the morning sun cast a golden glow through the glass windows, promising healing and renewal. With her chestnut curls cascading loosely around her shoulders, she tied them back in a simple bun, revealing the small silver hoop earrings that glinted subtly in the light. A gentle smile played on her lips as she mentally prepared for another day of connecting with her clients, helping them release their worries and find solace in her skilled touch.

Yet, as she opened the door, a flicker of unease danced in her heart. A sense she couldn’t quite place nagged at her. It was more than just the jitters of anticipation; it felt almost like a whisper of fate weaving its threads into the tapestry of her day. Pulling her cardigan closer, Calliope brushed aside the feeling, determined to focus on her purpose—a sacred calling that had led her here, to this tranquil sanctuary she had built brick by brick.

Little did she know, today would unveil secrets entwined with her own journey, where the boundaries between healing and mystery would blur, leading her down a path she never expected to traverse.
