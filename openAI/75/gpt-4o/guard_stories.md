As the first light of dawn crept over the rugged peaks of the Aylwick Mountains, the quiet village of Eldridge lay nestled in the valley below, shrouded in a mantle of mist. The cobblestone streets, slick with dew, wound their way like ancient veins through the rows of stone cottages, each one crowned with a roof of thatch or slate. At the village's northeastern edge stood the formidable silhouette of the Northgate Tower, a sentinel that had loomed over Eldridge for centuries, watching tirelessly as generations passed below.

A crisp autumn breeze whispered through the surrounding pines, carrying with it the faint scent of woodsmoke from early morning fires. It was here, upon the battlements of the Northgate Tower, that Henry Alistair Worthing began his day, as he had every morning for the past fifteen years. Clad in the dark blue uniform of the Eldridge Guard, with a weathered sword at his side and a sturdy crossbow slung across his back, Henry cast a vigilant eye over the awakening village and the distant paths that led to the world beyond.

Despite his years of service, Henry's posture remained unyieldingly upright, his gaze sharp with unwavering determination. His brown hair, streaked with the first whispers of gray, and the crow's feet at the corners of his eyes spoke of long nights and the weight of responsibility. Yet, there was a quiet strength about him, a steadfastness that reassured those under his watch. As the sun slowly dispelled the morning's chill, Henry inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the crisp air, and prepared himself for whatever this day might bring.
