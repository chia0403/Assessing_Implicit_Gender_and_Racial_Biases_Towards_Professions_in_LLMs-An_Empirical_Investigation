In the small, riverside town of Millhaven, where the air was perpetually tinged with the scent of pine and cedar, Joe Carter stood in his cluttered workshop, surrounded by the symphony of sawdust and the soft hum of an early morning buzz saw. Sunlight streamed through the single dusty window, casting elongated beams onto the cluttered workbench where various tools lay scattered like pieces of an artisan's puzzle. The shop, nestled between a quaint bookstore and an old bakery, was a sanctuary for Joe—a place where the outside world's chaos paused, and the raw, honest work of his hands held sway.

Joe Carter, a man in his late thirties with a rugged complexion softened by an earnest smile, was as much a part of this town as the ancient river that wound lazily through its heart. Known for his meticulous craftsmanship and an eye for detail that seemed almost preternatural, Joe had become something of a legend among Millhaven's residents. His handiwork graced everything from the elegant spindles of the grand manor’s staircase to the rustic charm of the town's modest cottages.

It was the kind of morning where the sky was a flawless canvas of blue, the promise of an eventful day hidden beneath the veneer of silence. Joe ran a hand through his dark, slightly graying hair, contemplating the pieces of walnut wood before him, each destined to become part of the grand grandfather clock that the mayor's wife had commissioned. As his fingers traced the grain, he could almost hear the slow, reassuring tick-tock of the clock it would become—a sound that had the power to echo through time itself.
