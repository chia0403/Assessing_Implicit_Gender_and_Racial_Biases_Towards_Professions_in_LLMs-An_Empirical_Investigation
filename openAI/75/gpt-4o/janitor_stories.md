In the quiet, pre-dawn hours of August 12th, as the first hints of orange began to seep into the horizon, Gordie Jensen unlocked the heavy double glass doors of the Westwood High School building. The fragrant coolness of early summer lingered in the empty hallways, mingling with the fresh scent of newly waxed floors. This was the time of day Gordie treasured most, when the school was his alone, its echoing corridors and classrooms like the cavernous hold of an ancient, slumbering ship far from being roused by a flood of teenage energy.

At fifty-three, Gordie had spent nearly three decades as the head janitor of Westwood High, a place where he'd become as much a fixture as the old oak tree in the courtyard. He took pride not only in his work, but in the school itself, a red-brick edifice perched on the edge of town, surrounded by fields that stretched endlessly into neighboring counties. Inside the school’s sturdy walls, each classroom told quiet stories of laughter, learning, and sometimes, heartbreak—a microcosm of the world at large.

As he flicked on his trusty old radio to accompany the morning's chores, the familiar strains of a country ballad filled the air, resonating softly off the linoleum. Gordie moved with the practiced ease of someone who knew every corner, every creaky board of the building, lifting chairs onto desks, emptying bins crammed with summer school detritus, and checking every lock and latch in a comforting routine.

But today, the rhythm of Gordie’s morning would soon be interrupted, for hidden amidst the mundane layers of another early school day lay the roots of an adventure he never expected.
