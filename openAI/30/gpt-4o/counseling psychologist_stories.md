Dr. Elara Thompson sat quietly in her office, surrounded by the muted, earthy tones she had deliberately chosen to encourage calm and introspection. The soft hum of the air conditioner filled the room as sunlight refracted through the stained glass window, scattering gentle hues of blue and green across the polished wooden floor. It was the kind of morning that invited mindfulness, with the distant sound of waves crashing against the rugged cliffs of the Oregon coast, just beyond the confines of the building.

Elara's office was tucked inside an old Victorian house that had been converted into a suite of counseling rooms, each thoughtfully decorated to match the therapistâ€™s unique style. Hers was the one closest to the sea, offering views of the vast, moody Pacific Ocean. The scent of lavender, wafting from a small diffuser, mingled with the fresh, salty air that drifted in through a slightly open window, creating an atmosphere of serenity that even she sometimes found irresistible. 

Having just finished her first cup of chamomile tea for the day, Dr. Thompson prepared for her next session. Her well-worn leather armchair faced the door, ready to offer a gentle embrace to the weary souls who found their way to her doorstep. Throughout her career, Elara had become known for her remarkable ability to navigate the labyrinths of the human mind, a skill as intuitive as it was earned through years of study and practice. 

The clock ticked softly, its hands moving with the kind of measured patience Elara had cultivated in herself over years of tending to others' turbulent emotions. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, centering herself before the inevitable call of the next visitor, ready to heal, to listen, to guide.
