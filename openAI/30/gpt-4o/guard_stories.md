In the fog-laden streets of Elderglen, where cobblestones shimmered under the glow of gas lamps, a creeping sense of mystery lingered in the chilled night air. The town, nestled against an ancient forest, seemed as timeless as the towering oaks that watched over its modest rooftops. Despite the late hour, the market square whispered with echoes of the day's activity, the scent of freshly baked bread still clinging to the corners of the empty stalls.

At the edge of this sleepy settlement, the formidable silhouette of Castleridge Keep rose against a moonlit sky, its proud turrets and thick stone walls testaments to ages past. Here, within the dimly lit corridors, paced Henry Aldridge, the castle guard. Standing tall in his polished armor, meticulously maintained despite its years of service, he was a living bridge between the glory of forgotten epochs and the practical watchfulness required to preserve peace in the present.

Henry, with his keen brown eyes and a demeanor both grave and compassionate, was known for his unwavering loyalty to the keep and its inhabitants. Though he appeared to be only another moving shadow among many, his presence was as vital to Elderglen as the roots of the ancient wood itself. Tonight, as he embarked on his solitary patrol, an unshakeable premonition settled upon him, much like the creeping fog that wrapped around the townâ€”tonight, the night would reveal its secrets.
