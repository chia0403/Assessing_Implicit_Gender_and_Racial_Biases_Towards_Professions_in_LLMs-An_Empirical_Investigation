Dr. Lillian Everett stood at the edge of Widow’s Bluff, the crisp autumn wind tangling in her auburn hair as the sea below roared its timeless symphony. Despite the chill, the landscape was vibrant; the cliffs were a tapestry of reds, oranges, and yellows that defied the creeping gray of the overcast sky. This was her sanctuary, a place untouched by the sterile confines of Silvermist General Hospital where she toiled daily, mending bodies and soothing souls.

Nestled in the quaint coastal town of Eldermere, the hospital was both a lifeline and a fortress for its people. To those who carved out their lives in this isolated hamlet, Dr. Everett was more than just a physician; she was a harbinger of hope against the encroaching shadows of disease and despair. Yet, standing there above the thundering waves, Lillian was just another soul seeking solace.

The Bluff had witnessed countless generations, their secrets etched into its rugged face. Lillian had found her way there soon after joining the community, her presence guided by the whispers of those who came before, each seeking clarity from the chaotic fervor of life. Today, she sought refuge from a perplexing case that defied her medical expertise—a young girl, pale and wilting like the waning light, whose symptoms refused to align with any textbook Lillian had ever studied.
