In the tranquil heart of Somerset, nestled amidst rolling hills and endless fields of wildflowers, lay the historic Ashford Manor. Spanning several centuries, the manor stood as a guardian of tales untold, with ivy clinging to its ancient stone walls like whispers of times past. Towering trees framed the expansive estate, their leaves rustling a gentle symphony in the wind. The manor's gardens, a masterpiece of cultivation, boasted meticulously pruned hedges, vibrant blooms, and labyrinthine paths that seemed to promise secret discoveries at every turn.

Tending to this verdant sanctuary was Oliver Bennett, the manor's dedicated groundskeeper. With his straw hat perched at a jaunty angle, Oliver moved with quiet purpose and practiced ease, his sun-hardened hands tracing the familiar contours of the landscape he knew so well. For nearly three decades, Oliver had been the invisible artist behind the manor's picturesque grandeur, his love for the land mirrored in every blade of grass and meticulously cared for rose.

The early morning sun cast a golden glow over the dew-laden lawns as Oliver began his daily rounds, a steaming mug of Earl Grey nestled in his grip. As he meandered through the gardens, his keen eyes noted the subtle harmony of growth and the promise of the day's work ahead. Just beyond the fountain—a centerpiece of stone artistry that glittered in the fresh sunlight—lay the orchard, its boughs heavy with the first blush of autumn apples. It was here, amidst the tranquil embrace of nature's bounty, that Oliver felt most alive, most attuned to the silent pulse of the earth beneath his feet.

He paused for a moment, breathing in the crisp morning air, and reflected upon the curious letter he had received the day before. Sealed with crimson wax and bearing the crest of the Ashford family, it whispered of an unexpected visitor soon to arrive at the manor—a visitor whose coming was sure to stir the serene waters of his carefully ordered world. With one last sip of his tea, Oliver set the cup down on the edge of the fountain, his gaze distant, as the sun climbed a little higher above the treetops.
