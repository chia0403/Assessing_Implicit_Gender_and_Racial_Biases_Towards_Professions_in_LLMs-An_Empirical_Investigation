In the heart of a bustling coastal town, where the air was thick with the salty scent of the sea and the distant sound of gulls echoed against the backdrop of crashing waves, stood an old brick building that had seen better days. Its windows were fogged with the warmth of the kitchen inside, and the front door creaked open to reveal a world of culinary delights waiting to be discovered. The sign above the door swung gently in the ocean breeze, painted in vibrant hues of blue and yellow: “The Seaside Bistro.”

Within those four comforting walls, at a worn wooden counter cluttered with spices, fresh vegetables, and a myriad of cooking utensils, worked Althea Mae Hawthorne. Althea, known to the locals simply as "Ally," was a cook with a flair for the extraordinary. Her hands bore the telltale marks of her trade—small burns and callouses entwined with the grace of someone who had spent years whipping up culinary masterpieces. With hair tied back in a messy bun and flour dust clinging to her apron, she hummed an old tune as she deftly chopped herbs, infusing the air with the fragrant promise of her next dish.

Ally had inherited the bistro from her grandmother, a bastion of tradition and warmth that had cradled countless memories—family secrets tucked into recipes and laughter shared over steaming plates. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden light through the large windows, the bistro burst to life, filling with the chatter of eager patrons and the clinking of silverware.

But tonight felt different. Ally noticed a flicker of unease bouncing among the regulars seated at the bar, whispering hushed tones and casting furtive glances toward the door. Little did she know, the world outside was about to change—and so would the course of her life and the legacy of the bistro she cherished so deeply.
