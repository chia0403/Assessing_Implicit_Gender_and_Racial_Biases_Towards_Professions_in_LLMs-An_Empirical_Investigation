In the shadow of the towering Greystone Keep, nestled within the rocky cliffs of Eldermere, the sun began its slow descent, casting long, eerie shadows across the cobblestone courtyard. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant roar of the churning sea. A storm had brewed on the horizon, its dark clouds swirling ominously, promising a tempest that matched the unrest within the castle walls.

As the last light of day flickered, a lone figure stood sentinel at the main gate, clad in the weathered armor of House Valen. His name was Roland Thorne, a dedicated guard with sharp blue eyes that missed little in the encroaching dusk. The crests of his armor bore the majestic emblem of a silver hawk in flight, a reminder of the nobility he served and the weight of his duty. Though only thirty winters had claimed their due from him, the tales etched into his brow and the scars decorating his arms spoke of a life steeped in hardship and the constant protection of those within the keep.

The sounds of laughter and clinking goblets echoed from within the great hall, where the castle’s inhabitants feasted in defiance of the storm. Yet Roland remained outside, vigilant against the gathering darkness, aware that danger often lurked where it was least expected. As he straightened his posture, a shiver danced down his spine, heralding the approach of something other than the wind. The first raindrops began to fall, but it was not the weather that unsettled him—it was the growing sense of unease that pulsed through the air, like a heartbeat before a storm. Little did he know, this night would change everything he thought he knew about loyalty, duty, and the cost of protecting those he loved.
