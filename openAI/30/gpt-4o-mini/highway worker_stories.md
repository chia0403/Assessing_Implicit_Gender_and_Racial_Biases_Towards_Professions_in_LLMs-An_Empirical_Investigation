**Setting:** The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows along the cracked asphalt of Route 45, a two-lane highway that stretched like an unrelenting ribbon through the heart of the desolate plains. Sagebrush swayed gently in the warm breeze, and the distant hum of a semi-truck punctuated the otherwise calm afternoon. A faded orange construction sign leaned precariously beside the road, its letters faded by years of exposure to the elements—“Road Work Ahead.” 

**Story Opening:** Harold "Hal" Jensen wiped the sweat from his brow, his work shirt clinging to his back like a second skin. At fifty-seven, he felt every bit of the weight that came with being a highway worker, his hands callused and dirt-streaked from endless hours spent mending the miles of asphalt that crisscrossed his state. He had made a life on this desolate stretch of road, his routine as unwavering as the path under his boots. 

As he crouched to inspect a patch of cracked pavement, the distant rumble of engines and the dust kicked up from passing cars reminded him of the world beyond the work zone—a world that seemed both tantalizingly close and far away. But today was different; today, as he adjusted his hardhat and reached for his tools, an unsettling feeling tugged at him, whispering that something was about to change on this familiar stretch of highway.
