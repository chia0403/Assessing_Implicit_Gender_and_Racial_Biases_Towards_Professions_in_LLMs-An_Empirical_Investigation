The clock struck eight sharp as the first hints of dawn pierced through the smudged windows of Larkin International, a mid-sized corporate office nestled between towering glass skyscrapers in downtown Chicago. The fluorescent lights flickered to life, casting a sterile glow over the pristine lobby, where the polished marble floor reflected the intricate patterns of its ceiling. 

Evelyn Mae Harper, the diligent receptionist with tousled chestnut hair and a penchant for vibrant scarves, was the first to arrive. Her heels clicked rhythmically against the floor as she shuffled through the glass doors, a steaming coffee cup cradled in her hands. The early morning chill lingered outside, but inside was a different world—one of anticipation and the promise of new beginnings.

Evelyn tucked a stray curl behind her ear as she approached her desk, her pulse quickening with excitement. Each day brought a fresh set of challenges and stories to unfold, and today felt particularly charged. She arranged the neatly stacked brochures about the company’s latest projects and smoothed out the wrinkles on the visitor’s chair, unaware that today would lead her down an unexpected path, one that would intertwine her fate with that of a mysterious client who would soon step through those revolving glass doors. 

Little did she know, the mundane routine of answering phones and greeting visitors was on the brink of a profound transformation, waiting just beneath the surface of her everyday world.
