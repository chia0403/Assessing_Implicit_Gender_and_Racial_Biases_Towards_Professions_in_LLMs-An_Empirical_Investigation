The early morning light filtered through the tall, grimy windows of Evermore High School, casting long shadows across the deserted hallways. Dust motes danced lazily in the beams, and the faint aroma of old books lingered in the air. Rows of empty lockers lined the walls, their painted doors chipped and worn from years of use, whispering stories of students long gone.

In the heart of this echoing silence, Finnian James Malone quietly pushed his mop across the tiled floor, swishing it back and forth like an artist's brush, coaxing life back into the faded colors beneath. Finn, as he preferred to be called, was a man of routine, his life a neatly organized schedule of early mornings and late evenings spent cleaning the very classrooms that once molded the dreams of future leaders, artists, and thinkers. At fifty-two, he wore his gray hair like a badge, each strand a testament to the years he spent watching the world change from the sidelines.

Today, however, the air felt different. There was a sparking energy swirling around the corners of the empty halls, a tension that made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Finn paused, leaning on his mop and gazing out the stained glass windows at the sprawling grounds. The sun began to rise fully, painting the sky in strokes of orange and pink, and he could almost hear the vibrant laughter of students in his mind, echoing through the corridors, with their hopes and dreams alive once more.

Finn picked up the mop again, a slight frown creasing his brow, unaware that today would become more than a simple day of cleaning - it would be the day when the lines between the past and the present began to blur, revealing secrets long buried beneath the schoolâ€™s polished floors.
