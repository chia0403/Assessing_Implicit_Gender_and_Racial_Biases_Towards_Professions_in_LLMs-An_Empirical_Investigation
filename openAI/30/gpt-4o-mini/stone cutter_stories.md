The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows over the weathered quarry on the outskirts of Eldridge Hollow. Dust danced in the golden light, swirling around the towering, jagged rock faces that loomed like ancient sentinels. Here, the air was thick with the earthy scent of stone and the rhythmic clang of chisel against granite echoed like a heartbeat, steady and resolute.

At the center of the quarry stood Samuel Thorne, a seasoned stone cutter whose hands told tales of time. His palms were calloused and rough, marked by years of shaping the very foundation of the world around him. Dressed in a simple linen shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, he wielded his hammer with a deft precision that could only come from years spent in this unforgiving but beautiful landscape.

Beneath the looming cliffs, Samuel carved shapes from the mountain face, transforming raw rock into art, each chip flying off the stone like a whisper of laughter in the wind. As he worked, he couldn’t help but feel a deep connection to the earth that surrounded him—a bond that was both sacred and daunting. Tools in hand, he was a sculptor and a dreamer, finding purpose in every stroke he made upon the unyielding surface of the granite.

But today, as the sun dipped lower on the horizon, Samuel sensed a shift in the air, a subtle tremor that seemed to resonate from deep within the earth itself. It was a feeling that reverberated through his core, unsettling yet impossible to ignore. He paused, resting his hammer against the rock, and looked out towards the expanse of the quarry, the world beneath him waiting quietly for what was to come.
