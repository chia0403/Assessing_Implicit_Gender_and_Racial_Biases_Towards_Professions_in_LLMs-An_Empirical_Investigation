Title: **The Last Shift**

Setting: The fluorescent lights flickered softly overhead, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of Maple Grove Grocery.

Suddenly, the humdrum of scanning and bagging faded away, replaced by the throbbing silence of unprocessed memories. She couldn’t help but wonder if this unexpected encounter would change everything...
