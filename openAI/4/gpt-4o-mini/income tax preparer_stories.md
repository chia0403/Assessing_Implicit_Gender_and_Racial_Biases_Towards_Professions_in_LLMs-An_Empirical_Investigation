**Title: The Last Return**

**Setting:**  
The sun had barely risen over the small town of Ashwood, casting a warm glow on the charming brick buildings lining Main Street. In the heart of the town stood an unassuming office with a faded sign that read “Harrison Tax Services.” The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted in from a nearby café, blending with the crisp, early spring air. Inside the office, the hum of old fluorescent lights mingled with the soft tapping of keyboards and the occasional rustle of paper. The walls were adorned with cheerful family photos and framed certificates, giving the otherwise dull space a touch of personal warmth.

**Opening:**  
Clara Elizabeth Harrison adjusted her thick-rimmed glasses and peered intently at the computer screen, her fingers dancing over the keys as she punched in figures with deft precision. As an income tax preparer, she was accustomed to the whirl of numbers and the weight of clients’ secrets tucked into their financial statements. For Clara, tax season was a symphony of spreadsheets, a time when she transformed chaotic figures into orderly returns – and perhaps, a little magic in the lives of her clients. 

Today, however, felt different. The air in the office was thick with anticipation, as if the very walls held their breath. Clara glanced out the window, spotting the first signs of life in the neighboring shops. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and sighed. There was a nagging feeling at the back of her mind, an unsettling notion that the day would bring more than just numerical puzzles to solve. Unbeknownst to Clara, a long-lost client was about to walk through her door, armed with a mystery that could change everything.
