Beneath a sweeping canopy of ancient oak trees, the estate of Eldermere lay draped in hues of gold and green, a sprawling tapestry of manicured lawns and wildflower meadows. The gentle rhythm of the nearby river provided a constant lullaby, its waters weaving through the landscape like a silken thread. As dawn broke, the soft mist clung to the earth, wrapping the grounds in a ghostly embrace, hinting at the mysteries that lingered within the estate’s shadowy corners.

In the heart of this picturesque setting, Elwood Francis Barnes tended to his domain with quiet dedication. Clad in rugged work boots and a worn plaid shirt, he moved with a practiced ease, his weathered hands cradling a pair of pruning shears. Elwood had spent over two decades nurturing the gardens of Eldermere, a place steeped in history that carried whispers of long-forgotten tales. With each snip of the shears, he felt a connection to the land—a bond forged through seasons of planting, pruning, and watching fragile sprouts emerge triumphant against the passing storms.

Yet today, as the first rays of sunlight broke through the trees, an unsettling feeling settled upon him. He paused, surveying the grounds with an intensity that belied his calm demeanor. Something was different; a subtle shift in the air that spoke of change, as if the very earth was preparing to reveal its secrets. Little did Elwood know, this day would mark the beginning of an unexpected journey that would intertwine his life with the hidden history of Eldermere, calling forth memories buried deep within the soil.
