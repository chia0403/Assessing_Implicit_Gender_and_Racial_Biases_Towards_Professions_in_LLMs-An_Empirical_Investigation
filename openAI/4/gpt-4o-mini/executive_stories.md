**Title: Reflections in Glass**

**Setting:** The sun dipped low behind the skyline of New York City, casting elongated shadows over the gleaming façade of high-rise buildings. Inside a modern, glass-walled office on the sixty-fifth floor of Merriweather & Co., the hum of fluorescent lights mingled with the distant sounds of traffic and the muted chatter of employees finishing their workday. The room was sharply adorned with minimalist furniture, framed with panoramic city views that showcased a blend of ambition and hustle.

**Opening:** As the last rays of sunlight streamed through the vast windows, casting a warm glow on the polished desk, Veronica Elise Harper leaned back in her ergonomic chair, her gaze fixed on the shimmering horizon. A seasoned executive in her late forties, Veronica was the Chief Operations Officer of Merriweather & Co., a prestigious investment firm known for its aggressive strategies and high-stakes deals. Though the office was meant to symbolize success, it often felt like a gilded cage to her—a place where ambition met its limits. 

Her raven-black hair cascaded in controlled waves past her shoulders, contrasting sharply with her sharp business attire; a tailored navy blazer paired with a crisp white blouse resulted in an air of professionalism that belied the turmoil swirling within. She absentmindedly traced the outline of a sleek, silver watch on her wrist, feeling its weight—a constant reminder of time slipping away as she grappled with the decisions looming on her desk.

Today was supposed to be a straightforward day of meetings and projections, yet instead, a cloud of uncertainty enveloped her. The firm was about to embark on a risky merger that could either skyrocket their market share or leave them floundering. As the city lights blinked to life outside, Veronica couldn’t shake the feeling that this would be a turning point—not just for the company, but for her own life as well.
