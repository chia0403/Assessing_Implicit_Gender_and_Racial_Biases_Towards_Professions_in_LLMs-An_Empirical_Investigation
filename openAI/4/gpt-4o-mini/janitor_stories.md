Title: Shadows in the Silence

Opening:

The clock struck midnight, its chime resonating through the empty halls of Lawson High School. A cold breeze slipped through the cracked windows, ruffled the pages of forgotten textbooks, and sent shivers slithering down the tiled corridors. It was at this late hour that the school transformed from a bustling hub of youthful energy into a ghostly relic of past cheer. 

In the dim light, punctuated by the flickering fluorescents overhead, a lone figure moved with practiced precision. Jacob Alistair Thompson, the janitor, pushed his weathered cart loaded with cleaning supplies: a mop whose bristles were worn but resilient, a bucket with the faded label of “Industrial Strength,” and a selection of cloths that had seen better days. He navigated the echoing halls with a rhythm almost musical, his footsteps a soft patter against the tiles.

Jacob had worked at Lawson High for over a decade, far longer than most employees. To the students, he was merely "the janitor," a background character in the play of their teenage lives. But to him, the school was a second home, each classroom a chapter steeped in memories, each locker a vault of whispered secrets. As a boy who had struggled through school himself, he had watched generations come and go, finding scrappiness and resolve in his sweeping of dust rather than in the lessons of textbooks. 

Tonight, however, there was an eerie silence that wrapped around Jacob like a shroud. The school felt different, as though it held its breath, waiting for something unseen to unfold. As he reached the end of the hallway, an unusual draft caught his attention, wrapping around him like a serpent. He paused, feeling a chill run deep within him that had less to do with the night air and more with the unsettling presence that seemed to lurk just beyond the edges of his vision. 

He was just about to shake off the feeling and continue with his work when he heard it—a sound, faint but insistent, echoing from the science lab.
