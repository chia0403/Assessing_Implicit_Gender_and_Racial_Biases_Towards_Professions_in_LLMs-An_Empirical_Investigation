In the quaint village of Elders Hollow, where cobblestone streets wound through a tapestry of blooming gardens and ivy-clad cottages, stood Mortimer Thorne's butcher shop. Nestled between an old apothecary and a cozy bakery, the shop exuded a warm, inviting aroma, a savory blend of spices and smoked meats that wafted through the air, drawing in locals and travelers alike. Mortimer, a stout man in his mid-fifties with a jovial face framed by a shaggy beard flecked with gray, often donned his well-worn apron, its pockets brimming with tools of the trade.

The morning sun streamed through the shop’s frosted windows, casting a golden glow on the polished wooden counters, where cuts of meat hung alluringly, each piece a testament to Mortimer’s craft. Every day began the same for him, with a gentle wave to the baker next door and a hearty chuckle for the regulars who shared their stories of the village over the counter. But today felt different.

As he sharpens his butcher's knife, Mortimer notices a flicker of movement from the corner of his eye—a figure cloaked in a deep, hooded garment that contrasted sharply with the vibrant surroundings. The stranger stands just outside the door, hesitating as if caught between worlds. Unbeknownst to Mortimer, this encounter would soon unravel a string of events, bringing secrets from his past to the surface and threatening the tranquil life he had built in Elders Hollow.
