In the shadow of the ancient fortress city of Eldrath, where cobbled streets coiled like serpents around towering stone walls, a thick mist hung low over the early morning. The distant echo of a tolling bell signified the first light of dawn, casting a pale glow that slowly edged its way through the fog. Torches flickered uncertainly along the battlements, their flames dancing like restless spirits hungry for warmth.

At the southern gate, a solitary figure stood vigilant, his silhouette framed against the burgeoning light. This was Alaric Thorne, a guard of the Eldrath Watch, whose broad shoulders bore the weight of responsibility as heavily as the intricately forged breastplate he wore. The chill of the morning seeped through the gaps in his armor, but Alaric had grown accustomed to such discomfort; it was a small price to pay for the safety of the city he had sworn to protect.

As he glanced down the winding path leading away from the gate, Alaric's sharp eyes caught the silhouette of a rider approaching through the mist. The rhythmic sound of hooves echoed against the cobblestones, growing louder, fusing with the low murmur of the waking town. Alaric’s heart raced with the anticipation of what news the rider might bring—Eldrath had been on edge for weeks, whispers of unrest stirring among the townsfolk, and shadows of something darker loomed just beyond the ancient walls.

With a steadying breath, Alaric tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, readying himself for whatever lay ahead. The stories would call him a hero or a villain before the day was through, but first, he would fulfill his duty as the watchman of Eldrath.
