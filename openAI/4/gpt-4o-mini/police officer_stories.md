In the heart of the bustling city of Eldridge, where the neon lights flickered like restless spirits in the night, Officer Melissa Jane Carter navigated the rain-slicked streets in her patrol car. The rhythmic patter of precipitation drummed against the roof, a soothing counterpoint to the urban symphony of distant sirens and honking horns. Her eyes, sharp and alert behind the windshield, scanned the shadows of alleys and storefronts, ever watchful for the flicker of trouble that could ignite without warning.

It was an ordinary Thursday night in late October, but something in the chilly air hinted at the unusual. The annual Harvest Festival, meant to celebrate the city's autumnal bounty, was just a few blocks away in Central Plaza, drawing families and laughter like moths to a flame. As she parked near the entrance to the festival, she could hear the distant sound of laughter mixing with the tantalizing hint of caramel apples and roasted corn.

Melissa had only been on the force for four years, but tonight she felt the weight of experience pulling her down. The streets were typically safe, but recent reports of petty thefts had spiraled into a tension in the air that she couldn’t quite shake. With her hair pulled back into a tight braid and her uniform crisp and pressed, she stepped out into the coolness of the night, ready to keep the peace—but she couldn’t shake the feeling that this night might challenge everything she thought she knew about her city and her calling.

As the vibrant lights of the festival beckoned, drawing people into a world of joy and celebration, Officer Melissa Jane Carter steeled herself for whatever lay ahead. Little did she know, the shadows in the corners of Eldridge had plans of their own—and she was about to step right into them.
