In the heart of downtown Chicago, where the city's historic charm meets bustling modernity, stood the Grand Astoria Hotel—an architectural relic whose façade whispered secrets of the Roaring Twenties. Its opulent marble floors and gilded chandeliers spoke of a bygone era of glamour and sophistication. Tourists marveled at the vintage art deco stylings as they passed through its revolving glass doors, stepping into a world suspended between past and present.

Jack Reynolds was intimately familiar with the rhythm of this storied establishment. As the hotel's senior bell hop, his uniform crisp and gleaming with brass buttons, he navigated the lobby with ease. Jack had spent years weaving through the throng of guests who sought refuge in the Grand Astoria's enduring elegance. Despite the bustle, he moved like a shadow, quietly observing the comings and goings of famous guests, weary travelers, and enigmatic figures who left behind little more than a soft echo in the grand hall.

This afternoon, with a sky bruised by approaching twilight, Jack took his place at the entrance, his eyes scanning the street for new arrivals. Horse-drawn carriages had long given way to sleek limousines and gleaming taxis, but the unassuming charm of the hotel's liveried staff remained unchanged. Jack adjusted his cap and straightened his posture, preparing for the wave of incoming guests that accompanied the beginning of Chicago's vibrant evening scene. Little did he know, today would mark the start of a mystery that would draw Jack far deeper into the heart of the Grand Astoria than he had ever ventured before.
