On a misty dawn, where the horizon yawned over the sprawl of indigo hills, Victor Morales stood by the edge of Highway 83, the world still cocooned in the muted hues of early morning. The sun had yet to crest the distant ridges, and the air was crisp with the scent of dew-kissed asphalt. Dappled fog clung to the roadside, weaving through the scattered pines like ethereal fingers.

Victor’s silhouette was a sturdy outline against the pastel sky, his orange safety vest reflecting the sparse headlights of the rare early commuter passing by. He adjusted his hard hat, its surface worn and scuffed from long hours laboring under open skies. His boots crunched gravel beneath their heavy tread as he approached the day’s work, the rhythmic hum of the highway a familiar, comforting backdrop.

Here, in the rolling expanse of the Montana countryside, the land felt timeless, and yet, for Victor, each day on the job offered something unexpected. As the lead foreman for the state transportation department, he was responsible for ensuring miles of ribboning road remained safe and sound, a task both mundane and monumental. Today promised the usual challenges—the laying of fresh tar, the repair of weather-beaten signage—but there was a serenity in the routine, a sense of purpose in the endless maintenance dance between nature and infrastructure.

With the first tendrils of sunlight breaking through, Victor paused to appreciate the quietude. It was moments like these, nestled between dreamlike silence and the awakening chaos of the day, that defined his world. A world vast in its simplicity, where earth met sky, and the road stretched onward, a path through the wilderness, ever leading yet never quite revealing its end.
