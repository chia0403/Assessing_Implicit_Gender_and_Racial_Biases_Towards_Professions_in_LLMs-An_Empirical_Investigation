On the outskirts of the picturesque village of Alderbrook, where the rolling hills kissed the sky and the whispers of the ancient oaks filled the air, Harper Willoway stood surveying his latest project. The morning sun painted the landscape in hues of gold and green, casting long shadows that danced across the dew-kissed grass. Harper, with his well-worn gloves tucked into his back pocket and a trowel in hand, was ready to transform the sprawling grounds of the old Whitmore estate into a blossoming paradise.

The estate itself was a relic from another era, with ivy clinging to its stone walls like memories refusing to fade. Harper had always had a deep appreciation for history and the secrets woven into the land. It was this passion that led him to become one of the most sought-after landscapers in the region, known for his ability to breathe new life into forgotten spaces while respecting their storied pasts.

Birds chirped in the hedgerows as Harper began envisioning the garden's design, imagining the bursts of color that would soon erupt from carefully placed blooms. There was magic in these beginnings, in the way bare earth and roots could tell a story, and Harper Willoway was a master storyteller in his own right.
