In the heart of the little town of Eldridge, where whispers of the past entwined with the breath of present day, stood a small brick building on the corner of Oak Street. It was here, underneath a perpetually flickering street lamp, that Evelyn Harper practiced her craft. A phlebotomist by trade, Evelyn spent her days beneath the soft, sterile glow of fluorescent lights in the Eldridge Community Clinic, drawing strands of life from the townsfolk with a delicate hand and a calming smile.

Eldridge was a place where secrets nestled snugly in the bricks of old buildings and the rustling leaves of ancient trees. It was a town alive with the ghostly remnants of its founding, when time felt as malleable as the twists and turns of its cobblestone alleyways. In the morning hours, mist clung to the earth like a soft, gauzy veil, creating an almost ethereal backdrop to Evelyn’s daily routine.

The clinic itself was a small, unassuming structure, nestled between an antiquarian bookstore and a bakery renowned for its buttery croissants. Inside, the scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of freshly baked bread, a peculiar blend that was oddly comforting to the patients who frequented its consulting rooms. Evelyn was known throughout Eldridge not only for her gentle technique but also for her uncanny ability to soothe even the most nervous patient with her serene presence.

As morning light filtered through the maple trees lining the street, casting playful patterns on the sidewalk, Evelyn prepared her station with meticulous care. Instruments gleamed as they caught the stray beams of sunlight, and the soft hum of the centrifuge provided a comforting soundtrack to the beginning of her day. Today, the air felt charged with something unspoken, an undercurrent of anticipation that seemed to ripple through the sleepy town. Evelyn, sensing this subtle shift, couldn’t help but wonder what stories the blood of Eldridge might tell today.
