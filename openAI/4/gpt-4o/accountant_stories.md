In the heart of bustling New York City, within the towering steel and glass monoliths that painted the skyline, nestled a quaint historical building that seemed almost nostalgic amidst the modern giants. It was here, in the third-floor corner office of Whitman and Co. Accounting, that Garrett Jameson began his day. The office, awash with the soft yellow glow of antique lamps, stood as a relic of bygone elegance, filled with mahogany furniture and leather-bound ledgers. The subtle scent of old paper mingled with freshly brewed coffee, a comforting reminder of countless early mornings spent navigating numbers and making sense of the seemingly mundane chaos of finances.

Garrett, an astute accountant known for his meticulous attention to detail, adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses and peered through the rain-speckled window that offered a view of the city streets below. He was a man in his late thirties, with a penchant for neatness reflected not only in his precise attire—pressed shirts, always paired with a tasteful tie—but in his organized mind that could dissect balance sheets with the precision of a surgeon. Today, however, the pattern of his routine was disrupted by an enigmatic message that had appeared on his desk—an elegant ivory envelope without a return address, standing out against the usual clutter of invoices and reports.
