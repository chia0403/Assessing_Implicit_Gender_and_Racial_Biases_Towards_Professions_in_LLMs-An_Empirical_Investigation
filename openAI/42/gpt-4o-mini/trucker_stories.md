In the heart of the sprawling Midwest, where the horizon stretched endlessly beneath a canvas of cobalt sky, the hum of distant engines echoed through the small town of Oakridge. Nestled between fields of golden corn and a patchwork of dairy farms, the town had seen better days. But for Grant McAllister, the open road was both a refuge and a calling.

The sun dipped low in the sky, casting a warm glow over his weathered semi-truck, named “Big Bertha,” emblazoned with proud decals of the mountains he’d traversed and the states he’d conquered. Standing a little over six feet tall, Grant wore a well-loved baseball cap tilted backward and a flannel shirt that bore the marks of countless miles. His hands, rough and calloused from years of gripping the steering wheel, were a testament to the life he had chosen—one that thrived in the solitude of asphalt and diesel.

Tonight, he was parked at a diner on the outskirts of town, the flickering neon sign casting a soft pink hue upon the chrome surfaces of the classic diners. The aroma of sizzling burgers and fresh coffee wafted through the air, pulling him in like a moth to light. Inside, the diner buzzed with the chatter of locals winding down after a long day, but Grant preferred the quiet corner by the window, where he could watch the world outside while plotting his next journey. 

As he slid into a booth, the waitress—an older woman with kind eyes and a quick smile—poured him a steaming cup of coffee. "Long haul tonight, Grant?" she asked, her familiarity warming the air around him. 

He nodded, his gaze drifting to the road stretching endlessly beyond the glass. "Yeah, heading up to Fargo. They need those parts delivered by morning."

The waitress raised an eyebrow, looking concerned. "Watch yourself on those back roads. The weather’s turning."

Grant chuckled softly, stirring in a splash of cream. “Weather doesn’t scare me as much as the miles do.”

As he sipped his coffee, the weight of the journey settled upon him. In a world that often felt too small, he found his freedom in those miles—a sense of purpose that echoed through the wind as it whipped past his cab. But tonight was different; there was an unsettling feeling gnawing at him, a whisper of something uncharted beyond the familiar roads he traveled. Unbeknownst to him, as he prepared to hit the highway once more, an adventure awaited that would challenge everything he thought he knew about the open road and his life beyond the wheel.
