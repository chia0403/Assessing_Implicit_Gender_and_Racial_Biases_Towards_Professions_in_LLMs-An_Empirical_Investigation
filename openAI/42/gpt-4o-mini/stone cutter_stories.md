In the rugged mountains of Tarathal, where the air was crisp and the scent of pine mingled with the earthy aroma of stone, a solitary figure moved deftly through the early morning mist. Dorian Arkwright, a seasoned stone cutter renowned for his artistry and precision, had set up his small workshop beneath an ancient pine tree. The tree's gnarled roots twisted over a rocky knoll, a silent guardian to Dorian's labor as he transformed raw stone into delicate sculptures and sturdy architecture.

The sun began to rise, casting golden beams that danced across the rough-hewn stones that surrounded him. Tools lay scattered across his workbench, each one lovingly worn from years of craftsmanship—chisels, hammers, and sanding blocks, all essential companions in his pursuit of perfection. Dorian, with his sun-kissed skin, a beard flecked with gray, and hands calloused from labor, embodied the spirit of the mountain itself: strong, patient, and weathered by time.

As he worked, the distant sound of a waterfall echoed through the valley, mingling with the rhythmic tap of Dorian’s hammer striking stone. Each strike was a prayer, a conversation between the artist and the material, coaxing forth the beauty hidden within the rock. Little did he know, the day ahead would challenge not only his skills but the very heart of his craft, as whispers of the ancient legends of Tarathal began to weave their way into the fabric of his everyday life.
