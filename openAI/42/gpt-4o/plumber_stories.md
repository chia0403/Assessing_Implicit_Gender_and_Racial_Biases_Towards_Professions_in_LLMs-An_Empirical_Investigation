In the heart of the bustling city of Alderwood, nestled between a quaint bakery with the aroma of freshly baked bread wafting through its open door and a modest flower shop bursting with vibrant blooms, stood a small, unassuming plumbing storefront. The sign above its door, slightly weathered by years of rain and sun, read "Watershed Plumbing Services."

Inside, amidst stacks of pipes, fittings, and the low hum of a well-oiled ceiling fan, worked Thomas "Tom" Aldridge, a master plumber renowned not just for his skill but for his unwavering dedication to his craft. Though he stood on the threshold of forty, with flecks of gray beginning to lace through his auburn hair, Tom's energy and enthusiasm for his work mirrored that of a young apprentice just starting out.

Tom's workshop was neat and orderly—each tool gleaming and in its rightful place, reflecting his meticulous nature. But beyond the meticulous workbench, the real heart of the shop was Tom himself. Known for his warm smile and the twinkle in his eye, he was the kind of person whose mere presence seemed to alleviate even the most severe of plumbing emergencies.

This Tuesday morning was like most others. The city outside buzzed with activity, but inside Tom's shop, there was a comfortable stillness, broken only by the occasional rustle of paper as Tom reviewed his day's service appointments. The first entry on his list was the old Ebberley estate, a grand yet archaically plumbed manor on the outskirts of Alderwood—a place where whimsy and history entwined as thickly as the ivy around its towering spires.

As Tom slipped into his navy blue coveralls, a sense of anticipation thrummed in his veins. Though he'd spent years fixing, repairing, and building, each new call felt like opening a book with a story yet untold. Today, he knew, would be no different.
