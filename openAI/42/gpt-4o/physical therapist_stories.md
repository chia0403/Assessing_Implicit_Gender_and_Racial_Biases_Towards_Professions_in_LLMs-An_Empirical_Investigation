Title: *Where Healing Begins*

As dawn painted the sky in hues of rose and gold, the gentle hum of Seattle waking up filled the air. The distant cry of seagulls and the rhythmic lapping of waves against the piers created a symphony of morning. Clara Bennett stood at the window of her modest apartment overlooking Elliott Bay, clutching a steaming mug of chamomile tea. From here, she could see the ferries beginning their journeys across the Sound, each one a tiny speck pushing through the vast expanse of glistening blue. This view had always brought her a sense of calm, a priceless companion at the start of a busy day. 

Clara was a physical therapist, renowned among her colleagues at Evergreen Rehabilitation Center for her dedication and empathetic approach to treatment. The center, a quaint brick building nestled just a few blocks away from the buzz of Pike Place Market, was Clara’s own sanctuary of sorts—a place where resilience blossomed against all odds. With its sunlit therapy rooms and the faint scent of lavender escaping from diffusers in every corner, the center exuded warmth and hope. Every morning, Clara crossed its threshold with a promise to herself: to mend not just bodies, but also spirits.

Today, Clara knew, would be different. An envelope perched on her kitchen counter caught her eye as she set her mug down. Marked with the distinctive logo of the Pacific Northwest Pain Institute, it held the outcome of the most prestigious fellowship she had applied for. But for now, the envelope remained sealed. There were patients to attend to, and stories waiting to be uncovered, each bearing the weight of injuries, surgeries, and the unyielding will to heal. 

Clara took a final deep breath, savoring the moment before the city fully awakened. The weight of the envelope would have to wait until evening. For now, the day belonged to the smiles of progress and the shared triumphs of those she aided on their path to recovery.
