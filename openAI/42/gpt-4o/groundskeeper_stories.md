In the quiet town of Alderwood, where whispering pines bordered sprawling fields, mornings broke with a misty embrace that seemed to linger just a moment longer out of sheer love for the land. It was here that Samuel Bennett, the venerable groundskeeper of the antiquated Hillcrest Estate, began his day with the ceremonious thud of his boots against the dew-kissed earth. The estate, a grand relic of a bygone era, perched atop Windcliffe Hill, offering an unbroken view of the valley below where sunlight danced over the swaying grasses like a golden tide.

Samuel, known affectionately as "Sam" by those few who ventured beyond the town's main street, had tended to the estate's lavish gardens for over three decades. His hands bore the calluses of an artist, each roughened line a testament to years of sculpting hedges and breathing life into the wild, unruly flora that threatened to reclaim the manicured paths.

On this particular morning, an ethereal fog clung to the hills, and the air was sweetened by the earthy promise of autumn. As Samuel made his way through the gardens, he carried with him the gentle authority of someone who knew every flower by name, every tree by lineage. The estate, with its ivy-draped stones and arboreal sentinels, seemed to pulse with secrets only someone like Samuel could understand.

It was said that Hillcrest held stories woven into its very soil, whispers of an age long past. And while Samuel was not one for idle chatter, he welcomed the company of these quiet secrets, the mysteries wrapped in the rustle of leaves, the tales carried by the wind.

Today, however, there was something new in the airâ€”or perhaps someone. As Samuel approached the edge of the rose garden, a peculiar unease pricked at the back of his mind. He paused, listening intently, the familiar symphony of chirping birds and rustling branches giving way to an unfamiliar silence that felt heavier, laden with anticipation.
