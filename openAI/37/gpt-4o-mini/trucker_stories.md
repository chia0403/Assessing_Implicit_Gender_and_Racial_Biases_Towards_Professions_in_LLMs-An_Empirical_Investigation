**Story Opening:**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting fiery orange streaks across the expansive Texas sky. Just outside the small town of Pecos, the rhythmic rumble of tires against asphalt echoed through the desolate highway. Behind the wheel of an eighteen-wheeler, Thomas "Tommy" L. Hargrove adjusted his worn cap as he squinted against the fading light. 

Tommy had spent nearly two decades crisscrossing the southern states, the hum of the engine and the gentle sway of the cab feeling more like home than any brick-and-mortar structure ever could. His truck, a weathered Peterbilt, bore the scars of countless miles—dents, scratches, and a faded paint job etched with memories of long-haul dreams and lonely nights.

Tonight, he was ferrying a load of fresh produce from the farms of California to the markets of Dallas, a task he’d done a hundred times before. But something felt different. The air crackled with a lingering tension as if the monotony of the road was about to be disrupted by something unexpected—a feeling Tommy had learned to heed over the years.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the twilight deepened, and the silhouettes of distant mountains bathed in shadows. He flicked on the headlights, illuminating the stretch of asphalt ahead and casting the shadows of the past behind him. Tommy took a deep breath, the salty scent of the evening breeze mingling with the earthy aroma of the open road. Little did he know, this night would bring more than just another drive; it would lead him into the heart of a mystery that would challenge everything he thought he knew about the world beyond his windshield.
