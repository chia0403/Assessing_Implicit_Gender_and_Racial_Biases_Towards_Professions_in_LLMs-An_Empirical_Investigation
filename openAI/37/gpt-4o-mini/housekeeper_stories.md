In the small, windswept town of Eldridge Hollow, nestled between rolling hills and shadowy forests, the air was thick with the promise of a tumultuous winter. The late afternoon sun struggled to pierce the heavy clouds that loomed overhead, casting an eerie twilight over everything. The cobblestone streets, slick from an earlier rain, shimmered with the remnants of the day while gusts of wind whispered secrets through the bare branches of the gnarled oaks lining the town square.

In a weathered yet opulent Victorian mansion at the end of Willow Lane, the aroma of freshly baked bread mingled with the scent of pine from the crackling fire in the hearth. Here, Amelia Beauregard, a diligent housekeeper with a heart as warm as the hearth's glow, meticulously went about her work. At fifty-three, with streaks of silver threading through her chestnut hair, Amelia took pride in every corner she polished and every window she dusted—her thoughtful attention to detail transforming the cold, grandiose rooms into a cozy refuge.

Yet beyond the elegant exterior, secrets lurked within the mansion’s walls, and on this particular day, the atmosphere was thick with an unsettling energy. As Amelia set down a freshly laundered set of sheets in the master bedroom, her fingers grazed the fabric—a reminder of the unspoken burden that weighed on her heart. Little did she know, the arrival of elusive guests, along with their hidden motives, would soon disrupt the fragile peace she had cultivated within the mansion.
