The neon sign of “Nail Nirvana” flickered softly against the dusky twilight of Willow Street, casting a rosy glow that invited passersby into its cozy confines. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and the gentle hum of chatter, punctuated by the soft clinking of tools and the rhythmic buzz of nail drills. The shop was a sanctuary for self-care, where laughter mingled with the occasional gossip, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie amid its plush velvet chairs and pastel decor.

As the clock ticked towards closing time, the light from a small lamp illuminated a carefully arranged array of polishes, each shade a testament to the creativity of its inhabitants. In the far corner, Clive Alexandre Resnick, a thirty-two-year-old manicurist with a talent for transforming nails into miniature canvases, was bent over a client’s fingertips. His deep chestnut hair, artfully tousled, framed a warm smile as he guided his brush with precision, painting delicate cherry blossoms atop a soft pink base. Clive was known not just for his skill but for his attentive ear, often taking on the role of confidant while perfecting his clients’ manicures. 

Little did he know, the evening would soon unveil secrets that extended far beyond the realm of nail art, pushing him into a world he never imagined existed, a world filled with intrigue and perhaps a touch of danger.
