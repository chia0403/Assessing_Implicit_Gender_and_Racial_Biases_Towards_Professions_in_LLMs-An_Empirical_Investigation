Title: Shadows in the Ivy

Setting: A dimly lit office on the third floor of a crumbling brick building in downtown Boston. The walls are adorned with yellowed newspaper clippings, each telling a story of a crime long buried but not forgotten. A battered oak desk sits in the center, cluttered with files, a half-empty whiskey bottle, and a flickering desk lamp that casts an eerie glow over the room. Outside, rain patters against the window, adding a rhythmic backdrop to the solitude within.

Opening: 

The scent of damp paper and faded ink lingered in the air as Evelyn Mae Harrington sat back in her creaking chair, her hazel eyes fixed on the rain-streaked window. It was one of those nights where sorrows rained down as heavily as the grey clouds overhead, and a storm was brewing—not just outside but within the tangled web of cases that lay strewn across her desk. Evelyn was no ordinary private detective; she was a woman who specialized in finding the lost—be they people, promises, or pieces of a broken past.

Tonight, she was nursing the latest in a series of letters that had arrived in plain envelopes, typed in crisp letters that held secrets yet to be unveiled. They spoke of a missing heirloom, a family torn apart by greed, and a shadowy figure lurking just beyond the edges of memory. But what caught her attention wasn’t the sum of the mystery but something more personal—the name in the return address: Charles Fenton, her childhood friend turned estranged ally.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room, and in that brief moment, the weight of uncertainty settled heavily on her chest. With a sigh, Evelyn reached for her whiskey, its amber glow offering little warmth against the chill crawling through her bones. She knew she had to unravel this case, but first, she needed to confront the ghost of her past and the choices that had drawn a line between who she was and who she had become.
