**Title:** Whispers in the Hallways

**Setting:**
In the heart of the small town of Willow Creek, where maple trees flanked the main street like protective sentinels, stood Pinewood Middle School—a weathered brick building with ivy creeping up its walls, telling stories of generations past. The halls echoed with laughter and the rustle of backpacks while the scent of freshly waxed floors mingled with the faint trace of chalk dust. Sunlight filtered through the tall windows, casting warm rectangles of light on the worn tiles, creating a cozy yet bustling atmosphere. 

**Opening:**
Dr. Evelyn Grace Marlowe leaned back in her chair, a collection of colorful stress balls strewn across her desk, each representing a different coping mechanism she frequently shared with her students. As the school psychologist, she had an office lined with books on child development and mental health, alongside art drawn by the students that adorned the walls, their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the drab, institutional decor of the rest of the school. The soft hum of the radiator and the distant sound of a bell ringing in the background provided a rhythm to the chaotic school day.

But today felt different. A sense of unease hung in the air, a whisper of something unsaid rippling just beneath the surface. As she adjusted her round glasses and opened her notebook, the door creaked ajar, revealing Jamie Reynolds, a timid sixth grader with tousled brown hair and wide, anxious eyes. Evelyn could see the burden he carried, a weight pressing down on his small shoulders.

“Can we talk?” Jamie's voice quivered, barely louder than a whisper, but it held all the urgency of a tidal wave ready to crash. Evelyn offered him a reassuring smile, her heart heavy with the knowledge that in the world of middle school, sometimes it was the smallest voices that echoed the loudest.
