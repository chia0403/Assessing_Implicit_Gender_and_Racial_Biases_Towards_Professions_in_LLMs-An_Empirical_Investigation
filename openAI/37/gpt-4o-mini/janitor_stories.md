In the dim light of early morning, the city of Elmsworth stirred from its slumber, casting long shadows against the crumbling brick buildings that lined Elm Street. A soft haze of mist hugged the pavement, weaving around lamp posts and creeping through the narrow alleys like a hesitant ghost. It was here, amidst the waking world, that Avery Thomas McKinley began his day—a janitor at the centuries-old Elmsworth Public Library.

Avery was a man of routine, his worn work boots echoing against the marble floors of the grand entrance hall as he arrived for his shift. The library, a marvel of Gothic architecture with its towering spires and intricate woodwork, loomed over him, its heavy wooden doors creaking open to reveal the sanctuary of knowledge within. Dust motes danced lazily in the streams of sunlight that filtered through stained-glass windows, illuminating the ancient tomes that lined the shelves like sentinels of the past.

As he pushed his mop through the quiet aisles, the faint scent of aged paper and polished wood enveloped him, a comfort compared to the cacophony of the outside world. Avery relished these early hours, when the laughter of children and the hurried footsteps of scholars had yet to disturb the silence. He had long ago resigned himself to the fact that few noticed the man in orange coveralls, with hands calloused from years of scrubbing floors and cleaning up after others. Yet, Avery took pride in his work, finding solace amid the stories waiting to be uncovered.

But today felt different. A peculiar energy thrummed beneath the surface of his familiar routine. As he glanced around the library, he caught sight of an unusual book sprawled open on a table, its pages fluttering as if caught in an unseen breeze. The cover was tattered and embossed with a mysterious emblem, one he had never seen before. Intrigued, Avery paused his work, drawn to the volume that seemed to call out to him, beckoning him to page through its secrets.

Little did he know, it was more than just the dusty pages of a forgotten tale—it was the key to an adventure that would change his life forever.
