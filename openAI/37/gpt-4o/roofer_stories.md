In the quiet, predawn hours of Maplewood, a small town nestled between rolling hills and endless fields, Thomas "Tommy" Hartwell arrived at the worksite, his silhouette barely distinguishable in the grayish light that signaled a new day. The air was cool, a crispness that hinted at the imminent shift from summer to fall, and the early-morning sky was painted with streaks of coral and gold.

Tommy parked his battered, old pickup truck at the edge of the site, the tires crunching on the gravel path that wound its way through a meadow still touched with morning dew. The scent of damp earth and fresh timber filled the air, a familiar aroma that always sharpened his senses and invigorated his spirit.

Maplewood was a place where time moved at a different pace. The town was dotted with quaint cottages and Victorian-era homes, their roofs as diverse as the people who dwelt beneath them. For a roofer like Tommy, the varied architecture was both a challenge and a canvas. His hands had learned the language of tiles and shingles, tin and slate, as if crafting shelter was woven into the very fabric of his being.

As the first light crossed the rooftops, Tommy moved towards the half-finished structure that awaited his attention. Today’s task was a challenging one—a steep, intricate roof that required both skill and patience. From atop this building, the town unfurled beneath him, a patchwork of winding lanes and sprawling green spaces, serene and still in the early morning calm.

With the sun now rising, shedding warmth across the landscape, Tommy climbed his ladder, each step resonating with purpose. He paused for a moment at the top, taking in the view, the promise of the new day spread before him. Here, on the rooftops of Maplewood, with the expanse of the sky above and the patchwork of life below, Tommy Hartwell felt at home.
