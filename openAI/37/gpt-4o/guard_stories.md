Under the crimson hues of the setting sun, the towering walls of Elmswood Castle stood like ancient sentinels, their stone faces weathered by centuries of whispers and secrets. The air was cool and crisp, filled with the scent of pine from the dense forests that encircled the fortress. Lanterns flickered to life along the cobbled paths, casting a warm, golden glow that danced in the encroaching shadows.

At the castle’s eastern gate, Thomas Everard, a veteran guard known for his unwavering dedication, adjusted his leather cuirass and settled into his nightly vigil. His sharp eyes scanned the twilight horizon, noting the soft rustle of leaves and the distant call of a nightingale—a familiar symphony that heralded the beginning of his watch.

Thomas, with his graying hair pulled back into a tidy queue, was a man of few words but great presence. Born and raised in the nearby village of Eastridge, he had walked these walls for nearly two decades, each night witnessing the subtle changes of the seasons and the shifting constellations above. Yet, on this particular evening, there was a whisper of unease threading through the tranquility, as if the land itself was holding its breath in anticipation of what the night might bring.
