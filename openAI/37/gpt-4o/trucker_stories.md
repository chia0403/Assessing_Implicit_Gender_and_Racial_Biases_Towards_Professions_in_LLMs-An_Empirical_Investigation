In the hushed hours before dawn, when the world is still cloaked in shadows and the air is crisp with promise, Robert "Bobby" Mitchell sat behind the wheel of his gleaming eighteen-wheeler, affectionately named "Big Sally." The truck rumbled softly in the parking lot of a diner off Route 66, its headlights piercing through the lingering darkness like a beacon. The neon sign above the diner's entrance flickered intermittently, casting a warm glow on the weathered asphalt.

Bobby took a drag from his cigarette, leaning back against the worn leather seat as he relished this moment of solitude. This early, the sleepy little town of Carthage, Missouri, seemed to hold its breath, waiting patiently for the first light of day to stir it to life. The landscape around him was a patchwork of endless fields, rolling gently towards the horizon, where they met the sky in a seamless blend of pre-dawn purples and grays.

The distant hum of cicadas harmonized with the gentle purr of Big Sally's engine, creating a lullaby-like melody that only those accustomed to the open road could appreciate. Bobby's life was one of movement and transience—a never-ending journey over asphalt arteries that crisscrossed the nation. Yet, here in this quiet slice of Americana, he found a strange comfort, a brief pause in an otherwise continuous symphony of motion.

He flicked the ashes from his cigarette out the window, watching them disappear into the darkness before settling his gaze on the road ahead. Today, like countless days before, held the promise of miles to come and stories yet to unfold. And though he never quite knew what lay beyond the next bend, Bobby Mitchell felt an unyielding certainty—it was exactly where he wanted to be.
