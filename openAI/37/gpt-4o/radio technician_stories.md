In the heart of the sprawling Mojave Desert, where the parched earth blurred into a shimmering horizon, stood the modest radio station KDRD, a solitary beacon surrounded by vast emptiness. The station was an unassuming, stuccoed building, its walls a sunbaked ochre, with a tall radio tower stretching skyward beside it, reaching out to the invisible airwaves.

Inside, the rooms were a clutter of cables and switches, the hum of electronic life filling the air. It was a place where time seemed to pause, where the world outside could be kept at bay by a simple twist of the dial. And here, amidst the tangled wires and vintage equipment, you’d often find Arthur “Art” Brinley, the station's resident radio technician.

Arthur was a man well-suited to the solitude, his life a series of quiet, methodical rhythms that mirrored the steady frequencies he maintained. His hands bore the creases of countless hours spent tinkering and his glasses perched perpetually on the bridge of his nose, reflecting the glow of the cathode ray oscilloscope he often used to monitor the station's output. 

Art’s voice crackled over the small PA system as he made his daily checks, greeting the invisible audience he imagined existed on the edge of signal range. His broadcasts carried stories to nowhere, drifting along the airwaves like desperate notes in bottles set adrift in an endless sea of sand and sky. Yet, within the confined walls of KDRD, Art found a peculiar satisfaction, an unspoken bond with the expansive silence that enveloped him.
