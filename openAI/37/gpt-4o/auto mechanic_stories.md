In the small coastal town of Harbor's Edge, where the morning fog clung to the rocky shores until the sun was bold enough to chase it away, lived a man named Jacob "Jake" Darrow. The town was known for its breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean, its legends of sea captains, and a main street lined with quaint shops and caf√©s. Jake was the owner of Darrow's Garage, a humble auto repair shop nestled between the local bakery and a forgotten bookstore that still displayed dusty volumes of maritime lore.

Jake had grown up in Harbor's Edge, and like the sea that shaped the cliffs of his hometown, his hands had molded countless engines. The garage smelled of oil and rust, an oddly comforting aroma that mingled with the scent of fresh bread from next door. The rhythmic hum of his tools was a familiar symphony, punctuated occasionally by the cheerful bell above the door announcing the arrival of a new customer.

Jake had an uncanny ability to coax life back into machines thought to be long past saving, earning him a reputation as the best mechanic for miles around. He worked under the worn, hand-painted sign that had hung over the shop since his father first opened it decades ago. Yet, despite the years of grease and grit, Jake's heart remained as open to the town's stories as it was to its cars, listening always for the tales his customers brought in with them, as vital to his craft as the wrenches and hammers he wielded so deftly.

Every morning, Jake stood outside the shop before opening, sipping coffee from a battered thermos, watching as the sun ignited the sky over the water. Today, like many others, held the promise of new mysteries and challenges, whispers from lintels and lampposts calling out to be heard and explored.
