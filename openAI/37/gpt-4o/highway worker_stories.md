In the vast expanse of the Midwestern plains, where the horizon stretched like an endless canvas, Jameson "Jamie" Prescott began his day before sunrise. The highway, a serpentine ribbon of asphalt traversing the gentle undulations of golden fields and whispering groves, was both his workplace and his companion. As the morning mist lazily unfurled across the land, Jamie breathed in the crisp air, a scent mingling of earth and dew, as he prepared for the day ahead.

Jamie had spent the better part of a decade working for the Midwest Department of Transportation, maintaining the stretch of Route 16 that cut its way through the heartland. Though it was a job shrouded in routine, Jamie found solace in its predictability. Every day brought with it the rhythm of roadwork—the clattering symphony of machinery, the hum of rubber on tarmac, and the subtle, almost melodic scrape of shovels and asphalt.

Today, however, something lingered in the air beyond the usual sounds. It was a feeling, subtle and elusive, whispering through the dawn like a promise of change. As Jamie adjusted his hard hat and flicked on the lights of the orange service truck, he couldn't shake the sense that today, this road—and his life upon it—might veer into unexpected territory.

The sky lightened to hues of pink and lavender as he set out, the truck rumbling along the deserted highway like a lone sentry guarding against the tide of time. Past the fields where corn stalks swayed in the breeze and the old barns stood stoically against the elements, Jamie pondered the curious anticipation that had taken root within him. It was the beginning of something, he felt, though he knew not what the day might reveal.
