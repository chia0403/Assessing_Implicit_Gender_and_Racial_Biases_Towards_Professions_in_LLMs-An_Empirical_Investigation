Underneath the sprawling branches of the ancient oak trees lining Alderwood Avenue, the morning sun cast a warm, dappled glow on the small town of Willow Creek. The town, nestled in the gentle embrace of evergreen hills and murmuring creeks, danced to the slow rhythms of quaint living. It was in the heart of this picturesque setting, within the brick walls of Willow Creek High School, that Lila Thornton plied her trade—not with tools of metal or wood, but with listening ears and a compassionate heart.

As the school’s beloved guidance counselor, Lila had spent years in her cozy, book-laden office, helping students navigate the tempestuous waters of adolescence. The room itself was a welcoming haven, with soft, earth-toned walls adorned with inspiring quotes and vibrant artwork created by students. A worn, yet welcoming armchair sat in one corner, next to a window that overlooked the bustling school yard, where golden leaves danced on the breeze, whispering secrets of the seasons.

On this particular morning, Lila sat at her desk sipping a steaming cup of chamomile tea, its soothing aroma mingling with the scent of old books and fresh paper. Her mind swirled with thoughts of the day ahead, rich with the promise of helping young minds stretch towards understanding and self-discovery. Yet, beneath the tranquility of the morning, an undercurrent of uncertainty flickered—an inexplicable feeling that today would be unlike any other.
