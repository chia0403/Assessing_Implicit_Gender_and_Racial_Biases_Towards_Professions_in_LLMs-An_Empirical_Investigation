In the small coastal town of Willowbrook, nestled between the rolling hills and the restless sea, the scent of salt and freshly cut wood filled the air. The late afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the weathered docks, where fishing boats bobbed gently, their hulls gleaming like polished gems against the backdrop of darkening clouds. It was here, in a modest workshop at the end of a narrow lane, that Thomas Edwin Hartwell spent his days.

Thomas was a carpenter, a craftsman whose hands bore the scars of years spent shaping timber into objects of beauty and utility. With strands of dark hair that often fell across his brow and eyes the color of a stormy sea, he was a figure of quiet strength. The gentle hum of the tide played an undercurrent to his work, as the rhythmic scrape of his tools melded with the call of gulls overhead. Each day, he transformed raw lumber into bespoke furniture, infused with the spirit of the ocean that surrounded him. It was a labor of love, a dance between artistry and practicality, and each piece he crafted told the story of the land and sea he cherished. 

But today, as the sun dipped closer to the horizon, a shadow loomed over Thomas’s workshop. He had received a peculiar commission: to restore a dilapidated wooden boat, one rumored to be cursed by the vengeful spirit of its last captain. As he prepared to tackle the aging timber, Thomas could feel the weight of the sea’s secrets pressing against his chest, pulling him into a mystery that would change the course of his life forever.
