In the heart of Mosswood, a small town shrouded in fog and whispered secrets, the scent of herbs and spices tangled with the rich aroma of freshly cut meat in a quaint butcher shop known as Grimstone Meats. The shop, with its weathered wooden sign swinging gently above the door, had been a staple in the community for generations, its stone façade almost swallowed by climbing ivy.

Behind the polished butcher's counter stood Samuel "Sam" Thorne, a man in his late thirties with a rugged demeanor that bespoke of hard work and dedication. Sam’s deep-set hazel eyes seemed to see beyond the flesh he sliced, into the lives of the people who came to him for sustenance. He was a master of his craft, his skill evident in the precise way he wielded his cleaver, turning sides of beef and pork into succulent cuts fit for the most discerning palates. 

The morning light filtered through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the glistening array of sausages hanging from the ceiling and the neatly arranged cuts of meat on display. Beyond the storefront’s glass, the cobblestone streets were beginning to stir, the soft murmur of townsfolk drifting in through the open door. Sam had his routine: the early risers would come to chat about the weather or share gossip, their laughter mingling with the sound of his knife meeting the cutting board. It was a simple life, but it was one he cherished, surrounded by the warmth of familiarity and a sense of purpose.

However, today was different. As the bell above the door jingled, signaling a new arrival, Sam felt a chill run down his spine. The figure that stepped inside was cloaked in a dark, heavy coat, casting an unusual shadow over the bright shop's interior. Sam looked up, his expression shifting from cordiality to curiosity, sensing that whatever was about to unfold would carve its way through the routine of that ordinary day. 

As the stranger approached the counter, Sam couldn’t shake the feeling that this interaction would change everything—like a blade slicing through the monotonous rhythm of his life.
