In the drowsy hours just before dawn, the stillness of the empty Martingale High School hallways was broken only by the rhythmic squeak of Carter Mulligan's mop against the linoleum tiles. The fluorescent lights above flickered intermittently, casting uneven patterns across the floor like ghostly reminders of the bustling life these halls would soon host. Here, under the dim glow, the familiar scent of industrial cleaner mingled with the faint aroma of old textbooks—a comforting, albeit peculiar, cocktail that had marked Carter's mornings for over a decade.

The school itself stood at the edge of Willow Creek, a town too small to make it onto most maps but large enough to boast stories that stretched back generations. Nestled amidst a sea of towering pine trees that whispered secrets to the wind, the building was a red-bricked relic from the 1960s, housing a labyrinth of classrooms and stairwells that echoed with memories of youthful dreams and dramas.

As Carter swept his way down the silent corridor, he paused by the trophy case, the familiar gleam of polished metal and glass reflecting tales of past victories and enduring legacies. The faces of countless students, frozen in time in their team photos, peered back at him—proofs of hopeful beginnings, much like his own life had once been. Yet, within the quiet of these morning hours, Carter found a strange solace—a world where the never-ending hustle paused, if only for a moment, granting him an uncomplicated peace.

Today, though, the crisp pre-dawn quiet held the weight of anticipation, as though whispering of changes unseen, beckoning Carter Mulligan to pay attention.
