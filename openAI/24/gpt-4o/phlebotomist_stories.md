Under the low-hanging clouds of an early autumn morning in the bustling city of Wellington, a cool breeze carried the scent of the ocean mixed with the promise of rain. The sound of seagulls squabbling over scraps echoed in the distance as commuters made their way to destinations unknown, their footsteps blending into the rhythm of city life. Nestled between a quaint café and a well-worn bookshop on Ethel Street stood Hemacare Pathology Clinic, its frosted glass windows displaying an array of ferns and succulents thriving despite the bustling environment.

Inside, the sterile air bore the faint hint of antiseptic, mingling with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the pot precariously balanced on a cluttered desk. Above it, a flyer featuring a vibrant splash of blood cells in artistic motion proclaimed, “Where Science Meets Compassion.”

At the heart of this small medical oasis, Alice Penrose prepared for her day with meticulous precision. An experienced phlebotomist, Alice’s deft hands executed movements that seemed almost like a well-rehearsed dance as she arranged the day’s supplies. Each vial, tourniquet, and needle was placed with the same care she afforded to her patients. Clad in scrubs the color of twilight, her long auburn hair was pulled into a practical ponytail, leaving only a few rebellious curls to soften her determined features.

Alice Penrose was known for her gentle touch and unwavering patience, qualities that endeared her to the regulars who found both comfort and occasional distraction in her warm conversation. Her workspace was adorned with snippets of her life outside these walls—photographs of hiking trips to verdant landscapes, painted seashells collected from distant shores, and a small wooden figurine of an owl gifted by her young niece, who was convinced it brought good luck.

As the clock neared eight, the clinic doors opened, inviting a stream of patients that mirrored the city’s diverse tapestry. Each person bearing a smile or a story, seeking not just a diagnosis, but also the human connection only Alice could provide.
