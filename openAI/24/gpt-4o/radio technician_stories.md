In the heart of the sprawling and vibrant city of New Haven, nestled between the bustling railway station and a maze of cobblestone streets, lies the modest workshop of Lucas Montgomery, a seasoned radio technician whose expertise is renowned. The walls of his shop, Montgomery’s Wireless Haven, are lined with shelves brimming with radio parts, vintage receivers, and oscilloscopes, all illuminated by the warm glow of Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling.

It is a crisp autumn morning, the air outside crisp and invigorating as a soft breeze carries the earthy scent of fallen leaves through the streets. The windows of the shop reveal a city slowly awakening; street vendors are setting up their kiosks, and commuters hurry past, eager to begin their day. Inside, the hum of an old tube radio fills the space with a soothing, melodic tune from a bygone era, creating a bridge between the nostalgic and the modern.

Lucas, with his weathered leather apron draped over a plaid shirt, is hunched over his workbench, delicately handling a finicky shortwave radio from the 1940s. His fingers move with the precision of an artist, deftly coaxing life back into the battered antique. His gray-speckled beard and thick-rimmed glasses reveal years of dedication and passion for his craft. As the radio crackles to life, emitting a clear stream of sound, a satisfied smile spreads across Lucas’s face. 

Today, he senses, will not be an ordinary day. An unfamiliar voice crackles through the old radio, setting off a chain of events that will challenge Lucas’s talents and open new dimensions of discovery that he never imagined. This unsought adventure begins in the comfort of his workshop, but promises to lead him into the uncharted territories well beyond the familiar confines of New Haven.
