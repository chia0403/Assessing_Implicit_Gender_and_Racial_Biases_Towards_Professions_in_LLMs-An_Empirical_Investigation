In the quaint coastal town of Harbor's Edge, where seagulls cried out against the dawn and the salty breeze whispered secrets through the narrow streets, the day began with its usual rhythm. The crimson sun was just rising over the horizon, casting hues of gold and pink against the rustic, weather-worn clapboards of homes that had stood for nearly a century. Boats gently bobbed at their moorings in the small, sheltered bay, and the air was thick with the comforting aroma of brewing coffee wafting from the corner café.

One of the town's inhabitants, Oliver "Ollie" Thorne, was already wide awake, preparing for his day's work. A seasoned electrician, Ollie had lived in Harbor's Edge all his life, with his skills sought after by residents and businesses alike. Despite his profession requiring an understanding of modern technology, Ollie appreciated the slow, unchanging pace of his hometown. His workshop, crammed between the brick-and-mortar facades of the main street, was a reflection of his character—an organized tangle of wires and gadgets, with a hint of nostalgia peeking through every screw and metal box.

Ollie was a man of routine. Each morning, he performed a mental checklist as he methodically packed his worn tool bag, ensuring every item was in its rightful place. Once satisfied, he slipped on his tan work boots, layered with a fine patina of paint, and shrugged on his utility jacket. Today, he was headed to the old Lighthouse Inn perched on the northern cliffs, where an electrical short had plunged the entire property into darkness the previous night.

As he locked the door behind him and made his way down the cobblestone path, Ollie couldn't help but pause for a moment to look out at the sea, its vast expanse promising mysteries beyond the horizon. He took a deep breath, feeling alive amidst the crisp air and the sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore. This was the beauty of Harbor's Edge—a place full of familiarity yet swirled with the endless possibility of the unknown.
