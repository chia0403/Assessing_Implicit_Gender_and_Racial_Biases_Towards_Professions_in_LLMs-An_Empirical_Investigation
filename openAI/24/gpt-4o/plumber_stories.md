In the heart of the sleepy coastal town of Westport, where the waves seemed to whisper their secrets to the shore, lived a plumber named Milo Harrington. The morning sun cast a warm golden hue over the quaint, cobblestone streets, making the little town look like it had leapt straight from the pages of a storybook. Milo's workshop sat nestled between a bustling bakery, known for its cinnamon rolls that people swore were heavenly, and the town's only bookstore where the eccentric owner often hosted poetry readings by candlelight.

Milo Harrington was the person everyone called when taps refused to stop their rebellious drips or when pipes chose inopportune moments to burst into chaos. His reputation, built over years of honest, hard work, was as solid as the ancient lighthouse that stood sentinel over the bay. Though the town was small, its charm was expansive, and it was here amidst the echoes of salt-washed breezes and the gentle lull of the sea that Milo found his rhythm and his roots.
