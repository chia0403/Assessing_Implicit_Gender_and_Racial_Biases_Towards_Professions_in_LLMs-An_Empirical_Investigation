In the heart of the bustling village of Elmsworth, where the cobblestone streets hummed with the chatter of neighbors exchanging tales and the aroma of freshly baked bread mingled enticingly with the crisp morning air, stood a quaint, timeworn shop nestled between the apothecary and the baker. This was Gregory Finch's domain, the proud proprietor of Finch's Fine Meats.

Gregory, a robust figure with a hearty boom of a voice and hands as skilled with a cleaver as they were gentle with his daughter's woven hair, had been the village butcher for nearly three decades. The sun-dappled mornings found him arriving at his shop before dawn, preparing for the day ahead with a devotion unmatched by any other tradesman. His shop was a symphony of sights and smells—a regal cathedral of meats, where strings of sausages dangled like garlands over counters displaying glistening cuts, and a magnificently scarred butcher's block reigned in the center of the room.

The clang of the brass bell over the door heralded the arrival of his customers, each of whom Gregory greeted by name, often as he slid a carefully wrapped package across the polished counter. For many in Elmsworth, Finch’s Fine Meats was more than a place to procure supper; it was a sanctuary of community, where stories of the day unfurled alongside the butcher's expert handiwork.

And it was on one such morning, as the first light painted the village in shades of golden amber, that something unusual caught Gregory's eye—a whisper of a mystery that would unsettle his otherwise fixed routine in the days to come.
