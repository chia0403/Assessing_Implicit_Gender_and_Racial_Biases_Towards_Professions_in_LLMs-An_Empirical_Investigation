Dr. Meredith Caldwell stood at the edge of the weathered pier, a brisk autumn wind tangling her auburn hair and carrying the faint, salty scent of the sea. The small New England town of Westbridge had always been a place where the past felt close enough to touch, and today was no exception. The fog rolled in from the harbor, draping the sleepy town in a shroud of mystery and muted whispers.

Meredith had returned to Westbridge after nearly a decade, her life now spent delving into the darkest corners of the human mind. As a forensic psychologist, her work often drew her to places shrouded in shadows, but this time was different; this was personal. The old lighthouse, silhouetted against the dimming gray sky, seemed to watch over the town with an ancient, knowing gaze, a silent witness to the secrets buried beneath its rocky shores. It was her hometown, a place filled with haunting memories and unanswered questions that seemed to echo louder each day.

Dr. Caldwell glanced at her watch, the realization dawning on her that she had mere hours before her meeting with Sheriff Donovan. He had called her back to assist in a case that had unnerved even the most seasoned detectivesâ€”a series of disappearances that seemed inexplicably tied to her past. She took a deep breath, the chill air a reminder that she was home, where ghosts of her childhood and unsolved mysteries awaited her discerning expertise and unyielding resolve.
