Dr. Eliza Moreno stepped out of her car and onto the cobblestone pathway leading to the Victorian-era building that housed her psychology practice. The rain, a constant companion in the small coastal town of Havenbrook, had finally eased to a gentle drizzle, leaving the air crisp with the scent of damp earth and distant saltwater. The ocean, just a few blocks away, murmured softly under a silvery blanket of overcast sky.

The office itself was situated on the edge of Havenbrook's historic district, where time seemed to meander at its own pace. Charming, if slightly worn, row houses lined the street, their facades painted in muted pastels that harkened back to an earlier time. Dr. Moreno appreciated the tranquility that permeated this corner of the world; it provided a stark contrast to the quiet tumult she often navigated within the walls of her practice.

She paused for a moment at the doorstep, glancing up at the old building. Its gingerbread trim and wide bay windows lent it a certain gravitas, as though it had been a silent witness to countless stories over the decades. A blue and gold placard beside the entrance announced her presence: Dr. Eliza Moreno, Clinical Psychologist. As she fished her keys from her satchel, she felt a familiar mixture of anticipation and calm. The day ahead promised complexities that only the human mind could conjureâ€”a puzzle she was both intimately familiar with and endlessly intrigued by.
