The rain fell in thick sheets against the streets of Merriweather Bay, transforming the flickering neon lights into wavering streaks of color on the slick asphalt. Perched at the edge of the city, the ancient and towering skyline seemed to lean into the storm, casting elongated shadows that danced across the narrow alleys and whispered secrets only the night knew.

It was in one such dimly lit alley, tucked between a shuttered bookstore and a diner that had ignored closing hours for over a decade, that Emmett Caldwell ran his private investigation firm. The etched glass door of Caldwell Investigations bore testament to decades of grit, grimace, and the pursuit of truth, though the paint had begun to peel around the edges, much like Emmett himself. Inside, the office was a gallery of organized chaos, filled with stacks of open case files, clippings from newspapers, and a large, weathered desk that stood like a fortress amidst the disorder.

Emmett Caldwell, a man whose face was as rugged as his reputation, leaned back in his aging leather chair, sipped the remnants of a lukewarm coffee, and listened to the steady drum of rain against the window. His sharp eyes—a mix of old hurt and steely resolve—scanned the room, settling briefly on the ceiling fan that spun between them, struggling valiantly to stir the stale air.

Just another quiet midnight, Emmett thought, until the door swung open, ushering in a gust of cold air and a silhouette sharp enough to cut through the mounting lethargy. Behind the silhouette, the storm raged on, as if to echo the upheaval that was about to be unleashed within these four walls.
