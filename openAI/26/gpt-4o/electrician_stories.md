In the early hours of dawn, the small coastal town of Clearwater Springs began to stir from its slumber. Cradled between towering cliffs and the restless ocean, the town basked in a thick morning mist that kissed each cobblestone and crept silently through the winding streets. The scent of salt and seaweed hung heavily in the air, mingling with the rich aroma of brewing coffee that wafted from the windows of seaside cafés. Shops were beginning to unlock their doors, while fishermen prepared their boats for a day on the water. 

Amidst this sleepy awakening, a solitary figure emerged from a modest, red-brick house near the edge of the harbor. Martin “Marty” Sinclair, known to most simply as Marty, adjusted his tool belt with the practiced ease of someone who had spent a lifetime working with his hands. Marty stood tall and lean, his deeply tanned skin and wind-tousled hair a testament to years spent braving the elements. With a keen eye for detail and an unwavering dedication to his trade, Marty had become the town’s go-to electrician, a title he wore with quiet pride.

Marty’s reputation had been built over decades of unyielding work, from rewiring the grand old Victorian homes perched along the cliffs to fixing the finicky fuse boxes in the modest cottages scattered inland. It seemed no electrical problem was too great or small for him to tackle. As he set off towards his first call of the day, his heavy boots clattering over the cobblestones, Marty Sinclair found solace in the familiar rhythm of his daily routine, unaware of the unexpected twists fate had woven into the fabric of his day.
