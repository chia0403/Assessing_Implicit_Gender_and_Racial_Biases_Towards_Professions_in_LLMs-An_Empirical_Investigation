The autumn sun had just begun its descent, casting long shadows over the quiet, tree-lined streets of Willowbrook. Nestled within this tranquil suburb, with its neatly kept lawns and the occasional scent of woodsmoke in the crisp air, stood a modest brick office with a brass plaque that read "Hamilton & Associates Insurance Services."

Inside, the soft glow of a desk lamp cut through the dimming light, illuminating a cluttered, oak desk behind which sat Miles Preston Whitaker. At forty-two, Miles was a man of methodical habits and a life built on predictability, much like the policies he crafted for his clients. With hair the color of peppered ash and eyes that always seemed to be calculating, he had a demeanor that was both reassuring and meticulously attentive.

This evening, as he gathered papers into tidy stacks, preparing to call it a day, there was an unusual hum of anticipation in the air. It promised to ruffle the orderly fabric of Miles's world, yet as with any storm on the horizon, the winds of change were still gently swirling, biding their time before unleashing their full force.
