On an unexpectedly crisp morning in late October, when the leaves on the sycamore trees lining Main Street in Bellbrook had turned to rich tapestries of gold and crimson, Lila Hartley found herself perched on a wrought iron bench outside the old courthouse. The historic building, with its grand limestone façade and towering columns, stood as both a monument to justice and a relic of the town's storied past. Inside its echoing halls, sunlight filtered through stained glass windows, casting vibrant hues across polished marble floors.

Lila adjusted her woolen scarf against the chill, absentmindedly twirling her pen—a gift from her grandmother, engraved with her full name, 'Lila Elizabeth Hartley.' Though still early, the town was beginning to stir; shopkeepers flipped their signs to "Open," and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee drifted from the nearby café, blending harmoniously with the earthy scent of fallen leaves. This was her routine—a few quiet moments before slipping into the role of an indispensable investigator of facts and forger of legal pathways within the bustling law firm of Morton, Keats & Finch.

Lila reveled in the predictability of her mornings, valuing the tranquility before the day's chaos. Yet today, an unplaceable tension lingered in the air, as though the very town was holding its breath, waiting for something to disturb the peace.
