Title: The Tides of Alignment

In the sleepy coastal town of Seabrook, where the Atlantic's whispers met the rustling dunes, Dr. Lila Montgomery greeted the morning sun through her clinic's wide windows. A gentle breeze played with the gauzy curtains, filling the quaint room with the scent of salt and wild sea roses. Nestled between the historic lighthouse and the old dock, Seabrook Chiropractic was a beloved fixture among the locals, much like the resilient pelicans that skimmed the waves daily.

Dr. Lila Montgomery, a woman of calm demeanor and soothing hands, had been adjusting the spines and spirits of Seabrook's residents for nearly a decade. Her practice was a sanctuary of restoration, encompassed by hand-carved wooden furniture and shelves laden with books on anatomy and holistic health. The walls were adorned with art depicting the town’s maritime past—a nod to her heritage and a reminder of the intricate connections within every body she treated.

Lila had always been captivated by the world beneath her hands, the silent language of bones and muscles telling stories of life's burdens and triumphs. Her mornings began with a ritual of meditation before the first patient arrived, grounding her in the day’s rhythm. The rhythmic lap of waves outside mirrored her calm, each new session an opportunity to bring harmony where there was once discord.

Yet today, as she sipped her herbal tea and reviewed her appointments, a sense of anticipation lingered in the air. Lila could sense that change was coming—a shift in the tide that she felt deep within her bones. And though she couldn't quite pinpoint its source, she knew that this day would bring more than the usual adjustments to Seabrook.
