**Title: Miles to Go**

**Setting:** The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the sprawling expanse of Route 66. Known for its eclectic roadside attractions and diner culture, the two-lane highway winding through the heart of America was a living poem of adventure and solitude. Dusty trucks rumbled past abandoned gas stations and vibrant murals, their engines echoing the stories of those who traversed this fabled road. A gust of wind whipped through the desert air, stirring up the scent of sagebrush and fuel, blending the fragrance of freedom with a hint of nostalgia.

**Opening:**

As the last sliver of sunlight vanished behind a distant mesa, the soft glow of neon signs flickered to life along the roadside, casting colorful reflections on the polished chrome of a weathered 18-wheeler. Behind the wheel sat Jackson Cole, a rugged trucker with calloused hands and a road-weary spirit. At forty-two, he'd seen more of the country than he had of his own hometown—an old farm in Iowa, long since left behind.

Jackson’s truck, "The Iron Pony," had been his only constant companion for over a decade. It bore the scars of countless journeys: a dent in the bumper from a run-in with a wayward deer and a scratch on the side that told the story of an unexpected blizzard in Wyoming. He had learned how to fix nearly everything about the beast, and in return, it had carried him through rain-soaked highways, thunderous storms, and stifling summer nights.

As he rolled down the highway, his mind drifted back to his father’s words, spoken years ago with a voice like gravel, “A man’s life is measured not by the years he’s given, but by the roads he’s traveled.” Jackson wasn’t sure if he agreed, but as he navigated another lonely stretch, he found comfort in the rhythm of the tires on asphalt and the soothing hum of the engine. 

That evening, he was headed to Albuquerque, his cab filled with the scent of stale coffee and the sound of classic rock crackling through the radio. But tonight felt different—an itch he couldn’t quite scratch lingered in the back of his mind. Just up ahead, according to the dispatcher’s message flickering on his phone, lay an unexpected stop—a small diner that promised the best pie in all of New Mexico. Little did he know, this stop would turn his solitary life on the road into something far more profound than a simple meal.
