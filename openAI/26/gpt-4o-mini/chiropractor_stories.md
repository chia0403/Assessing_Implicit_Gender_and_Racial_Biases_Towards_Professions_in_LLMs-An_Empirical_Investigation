In the small coastal town of Seabreeze Cove, the salty air mingled with the warm aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the corner café. The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a golden hue across the quaint streets lined with pastel-colored houses. Seabreeze was a place where everyone knew each other, and stories were woven into the fabric of everyday life.

Dr. Emily Rose Carter had just finished a long day at her chiropractic clinic, “Carter Wellness Center,” a charming Victorian-style house that had been converted into a sanctuary for healing. The walls were adorned with calming landscapes and the faint sound of ocean waves could be heard through the open windows. She took pride in creating a space where her patients felt welcomed and cared for, a stark contrast to the sterile environments of larger clinics.

As she locked the front door, Emily glanced down Main Street, where she spotted her childhood friend, Mia, chatting with a group of tourists. A smile crept across her face; the town always seemed to bustle with new visitors in the summer. But beneath her cheerful demeanor, Emily felt the weight of a secret—her hands weren’t just skilled at adjusting spines; they could also heal the heart. 

Little did she know that this summer would bring more than just familiar faces and sun-soaked days. A mysterious new patient was about to walk through her door, one whose presence would unravel the tranquil tapestry of her life and lead her to confront the past she thought she had left behind.
