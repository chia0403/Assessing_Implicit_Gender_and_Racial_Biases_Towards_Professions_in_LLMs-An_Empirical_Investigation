**Title: Threads of Recovery**

**Setting: A charming coastal town named Willow Cove, known for its picturesque beach, quaint houses with colorful façades, and a vibrant community. The town’s main street is lined with small shops and cafés, and the salty breeze carries the laughter of children playing in the sand. Nestled between an art gallery and a bakery, a cozy therapy clinic named "Healing Horizons" boasts welcoming pastel walls and large windows filled with potted plants. Inside, the air is tinged with the scent of lavender and fresh paint, creating a serene environment where hope thrives.**

Caroline Elise Mitchell leaned against the doorframe of her therapy room, surveying the vibrant hues of art projects adorning the walls. As the clinic’s head occupational therapist, she believed every brushstroke and every handmade creation told a story of resilience. Today, however, her mind buzzed beyond the walls of Healing Horizons as she considered her next challenge.

The morning sun filtered through the large windows, casting playful shadows across the room. She adjusted her glasses, pulling her curly auburn hair into a quick bun as she prepared for the new session that awaited her. Caroline had dedicated her life to helping others reclaim their independence, but as she gazed at the chaotic, colorful papers spread out across her desk, she couldn’t shake the underlying current of anxiety that had followed her for days.

Today, her patience would be tested. Today, she would meet Max Harrison—a thirteen-year-old boy whose spirited heart had been locked away by a debilitating accident. As Caroline gathered her thoughts, she recalled the notes describing his love for skateboarding and the joyful look on his face when he rode his board down the coastal paths. She couldn’t wait to unlock that joy again, even if it meant navigating a maze of obstacles to get there. 

"Here goes nothing," she whispered to herself, taking a deep breath and stepping fully into the room. Outside, the waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, a reminder that life, much like the ocean, ebbs and flows, and she was ready to dive in.
