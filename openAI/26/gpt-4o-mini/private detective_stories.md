The rain drummed a steady rhythm against the cracked pavement of downtown New Avalon, a city that had long since forgotten its former glory. Neon signs flickered weakly in the misty gloom, casting washes of red and green onto the slick streets. Inside a dimly lit office on the second floor of the aging Hartman Building, smoke curled languidly from the end of a half-scorched cigarette resting in an ashtray overflowing with burnt-out remnants. 

At the desk cluttered with case files and half-empty coffee cups sat Dalton Everett Kane, a private detective with a reputation edged in shadows. His weather-beaten fedora sat low over his brow, casting a shadowy veil over his sharp blue eyes, which scanned the latest report with a blend of weariness and intrigue. He was a man defined by the cases that had come across his desk, each one more twisted than the last, but it was the missed opportunities and unsolved mysteries that haunted him the most.

The faint chime of the old clock on the wall punctuated the silence, a reminder that time was slipping through his fingers like the rain outside. In a city where betrayal thrived like rampant weeds, Dalton had seen it all—from infidelity to contract killings—but tonight was different. A thick envelope had appeared on his desk, unmarked and unceremonious, but its presence crackled with a sense of urgency that made the air around him feel electric. Just as he was about to open it, the door swung open, slamming against the wall with a force that echoed his thoughts: trouble was about to make its entrance. 

Dalton reached for his pistol tucked beneath the desk, knowing that in his line of work, anticipation often meant survival. As the figure stepped into the light, he braced himself for whatever storm was about to unfold.
