In the heart of the sprawling city of Eldoria, where cobblestone streets twisted like veins through ancient stone towers and vibrant markets burst with the aroma of spices and fresh bread, stood the imposing Iron Gate of the Royal Citadel. It was a majestic structure, adorned with ornate carvings depicting the storied history of the kingdom, a silent guardian of secrets both past and present.

The sun dipped low in the sky, casting long shadows that danced across the courtyard, as Marcus Thorne tightened the grip on his spear, his armor glinting in hues of bronze and steel. A seasoned guard of the citadel, Marcus had spent eight years standing watch at this formidable post, a sentinel to the realm’s stability. He was known for his sharp eyes and unwavering loyalty, a man forged in the fires of duty and honor.

As dusk unfurled its violet cloak over the city, the familiar sounds of the marketplace faded, replaced by an eerie stillness that slipped into the air like a whisper. Marcus’s thoughts turned inward, reminiscing about the days he spent training under Captain Eldrith, learning the art of both combat and vigilance. The gentle rustle of leaves and the distant chime of the citadel bells were his only companions, but tonight felt different—thick with an anticipation that sent a shiver down his spine.

Caught in the tranquil moment, he failed to notice the figure slipping through the shadows, cloaked and silent, making their way toward the citadel. A sense of foreboding settled over him like a shroud, and as the last rays of sunlight dimmed against the horizon, Marcus Thorne steeled himself for an interruption to the monotonous watch that had come to define his life—a test that would challenge not only his skills as a guard but the very essence of the loyalty he held to the crown.
