The rain drummed steadily against the windowpane of the small office, blurring the world outside into a hazy watercolor of gray and green. Inside, the faint hum of fluorescent lights provided a contrast to the tempest, illuminating a tidy desk cluttered with stacks of papers and colorful sticky notes. A wooden plaque on the wall proudly proclaimed the office as "Smithfield Insurance Agency." 

At that desk sat Rebecca Anne Thompson, a thirty-five-year-old insurance agent with a sharp mind and an even sharper wit. Her brown hair was tied back in a loose bun, and she wore round glasses that slid down her nose every time she leaned over to write another policy. Outside, the winds howled, but inside, Rebecca thrived on the rhythms of routine. She lived for the conversations with clients, each one a new puzzle to solve, each policy a shield against the unpredictable chaos of life.

But today felt different. As she glanced at the digital clock ticking above her computer—its numbers glowing an ominous red—Rebecca sensed an unusual tension in the air. The impending storm outside mirrored the feeling that something significant was about to unfold. She hadn’t yet realized how true that was, but the universe had a way of shifting unexpectedly, and Rebecca was about to receive a phone call that would change everything.
