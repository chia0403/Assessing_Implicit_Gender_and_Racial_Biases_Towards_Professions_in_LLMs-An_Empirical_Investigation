Title: **Above the World**

On a crisp autumn morning in the quaint town of Maplewood, where the leaves painted the streets in shades of amber and crimson, the air was brisk with the promise of change. Just beyond the cobblestone of Willow Street, among the charming Victorian houses, one residence stood out—a once-grand structure now sagging under the weight of time. Its roof, a patchwork of faded shingles and repair jobs, mirrored the weariness of its owner, Mrs. Edna Holloway, who had lived in the house for over three decades. 

Atop this weary dwelling, with the sun rising behind him and casting a golden glow across the landscape, was Philip Alexander Mercer, a seasoned roofer known throughout the county for his expertise and rugged charm. At forty-two, he had the hands of a craftsman and eyes that sparkled with a mixture of mischief and determination. Today, he was on a mission: to make Mrs. Holloway's roof not just functional, but a crown jewel of her cherished home.

Perched high above ground, with the wind whipping playfully at his flannel shirt, Philip felt a swell of purpose. He had grown up in Maplewood, learning the trade from his father, who had taught him that a roof wasn’t just a covering—it was a shield against the world, a protector of memories. With each shingle he replaced, there was a story to tell, a life to safeguard, and Philip Mercer was determined to honor that legacy, one roof at a time.
