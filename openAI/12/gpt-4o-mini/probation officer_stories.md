In the heart of Riverside, a small town that oscillated between quiet charm and hidden turmoil, the air hummed with a muted tension. The sun dipped low in the sky, painting the clouds in hues of amber and rose, as if warning of the darkness to come. Here, amid the crumbling brick buildings and the cacophony of an impending storm, stood the office of Eliza Mae Rutherford—a probation officer whose sharp instincts were often the only line between order and chaos.

Eliza leaned against her desk cluttered with case files, a half-empty coffee mug cooling beside her. She had dedicated nearly a decade to navigating the tumultuous waters of the criminal justice system, a role that demanded both empathy and steel resolve. Her office, a modest space adorned with motivational posters and the occasional family photo, bore witness to her struggles and triumphs with the individuals she worked with. Each file represented a different life story, and as the sun set outside, she felt the weight of those stories pressing against her chest.

Today was exceptional; the air crackled with a sense of foreboding as she reviewed the case of Jonah Markos, a young man whose repeated offenses had led him to Eliza's door for the third time in as many years. His file was thick with reports, court transcripts, and, with every read, more questions. What drew him back to a life of crime? And what would it take for this time to be different?

As the first raindrops began to splatter against the windowpane, Eliza's phone buzzed on the desk. A text from her colleague, urgent in its brevity: *He’s here. Don’t let him out of your sight.* Eliza’s heart raced. Jonah was just outside, lingering in the shadows of the alley behind the building, and she was all too aware that the storm brewing outside mirrored the one raging within him. Today, their paths would converge in a way that could either mend his threads of despair or unravel them completely.
