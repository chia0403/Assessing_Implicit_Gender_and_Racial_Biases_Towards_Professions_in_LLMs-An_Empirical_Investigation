In the small, coastal town of Crestwood, where the salty sea breeze tangled with the scent of pine, the sun dipped low on the horizon, painting the sky in deep shades of orange and violet. The sound of waves gently lapping against the rocky shore mixed with the distant call of seagulls, creating a soothing backdrop to the evening. Nestled among the quaint clapboard houses was a modest workshop, its windows faintly illuminated by the warm glow of a single bulb inside. 

Inside, surrounded by an organized chaos of tools and coils of wire, was Benjamin James Ryder, a skilled electrician known for his quiet demeanor and an uncanny ability to coax even the most stubborn circuits back to life. With his tousled chestnut hair and a beard that often caught bits of sawdust, Ben was a familiar figure in Crestwood, always ready to lend a hand—or a spark—to anyone in need. 

As he meticulously sorted through his tools, the heavy wooden door creaked open, a sudden gust of wind sending a shiver through the air. It was a Friday evening, and Ben was preparing to install new lights in the old Miller house, a project that had been postponed due to the storms that lashed the coast earlier in the week. Little did he know, this job would lead him to uncover secrets that had been buried beneath the town’s picturesque facade for generations.
