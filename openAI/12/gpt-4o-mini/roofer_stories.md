In the small town of Eldridge, where the sun seemed to grace the rooftops more often than the streets below, the sounds of hammers and laughter echoed through the air. The sky was a brilliant shade of blue, punctuated only by the occasional fluffy white cloud drifting lazily by. Nestled between the vibrant green trees that lined the main thoroughfare, a series of quaint houses stood proud, each showcasing a unique shade of paint, but all sharing one thing in common: their rooftops glimmered in the midday sun, freshly shingled by none other than Thomas Edward Harrington.

At thirty-five years old, Thomas was more than just the town's beloved roofer; he was a craftsman whose heart was woven into every shingle he laid. With a rumpled plaid shirt that caught the warmth of the sun and denim jeans dusted with fragments of cedar and asphalt, he was a familiar silhouette against the backdrop of roofs he navigated with the skill of a dancer. His sun-kissed, weathered skin told tales of countless hours spent under the sun’s uncompromising gaze, while his laughter—deep and infectious—carried stories of both triumph and trepidation. 

Today, Thomas stood atop the roof of the old Wilson place, a charming Victorian makeover with turrets and gables that thrust toward the sky. It was a challenging job, but one he welcomed with open arms, grateful for the opportunity to breathe new life into the home. With a roll of shingles secured at his feet and his tool belt jangling softly with each movement, he paused to survey the view—an expanse of trees stretching toward the horizon, a shimmering pond reflecting the clouds, and the faint outline of the town's clock tower in the distance.

Little did Thomas know that beneath the serene surface of Eldridge, secrets were brewing—much like the heavy summer storms that sometimes rolled in without warning, threatening to crack the town's perfect facade. As he drove the last nail into place, savoring his work, a shadow flickered at the corner of his vision. With a frown, he turned, feeling a shiver of foreboding dance down his spine. The peaceful day suddenly felt tinged with anticipation, as if the world below was waiting for him to discover what lay hidden within the bones of the town he loved so dearly.
