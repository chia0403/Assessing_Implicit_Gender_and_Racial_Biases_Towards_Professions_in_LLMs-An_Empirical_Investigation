In the small town of Windy Hollow, nestled between rolling hills and vast expanses of lush farmland, the morning sun cast a golden hue over the rooftops. The day had just begun, and already the scent of dew mingled with the earthy aroma of the fields, creating an invigorating atmosphere that promised a day ripe with opportunity.

Oliver “Ollie” Sutton stood on the crest of a newly shingled roof, surveying the beauty of the awakening town below. As one of Windy Hollow’s most skilled roofers, Ollie had spent years perfecting his craft, his hands weathered and strong from countless days spent atop the town’s homes. His love for the job was rooted not just in the satisfaction of hard work and precision, but also in the connection it gave him to his community, and to the ever-changing sky above.

Today’s project was the Jackson family home, a quaint two-story with charming gables and a view of the neighboring orchards. Ollie had arrived early, hoping to make the most of the cool morning breeze before the midday sun turned the shingles into a scorching carpet. As he adjusted his tool belt and settled into his work, a sense of contentment washed over him, for here, amidst the sounds of swaying trees and distant tractors, Ollie Sutton felt truly at home.
