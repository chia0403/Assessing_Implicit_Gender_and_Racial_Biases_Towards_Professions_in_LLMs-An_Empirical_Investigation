Under a sky splashed with the deep hues of impending rain, the small town of Millersville lay quietly nestled between rolling hills and winding riverbanks. It was a place where time seemed to stretch and yawn, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and pine. The streets were lined with quaint brick buildings sporting façades from a bygone era, their paint faded and cracked from years of weather and whispers.

In the heart of this sleepy town stood a modest shop with a hand-painted sign swinging gently in the breeze: "Hollis Lennox Plumbing Services." Inside, the aroma of fresh coffee mingled with the metallic tang of copper pipes and the earthy scent of old tools. The space was cluttered but orderly, reflecting the meticulous nature of its owner.

Hollis Lennox, a man in his late thirties with a salt-and-pepper beard and eyes as blue and deep as flash-flooded creeks, moved with the practiced ease of someone who had spent years navigating the hidden arteries of homes. His hands, calloused yet deft, inspected a nozzle with the same care a surgeon might show a delicate instrument. Though he wore the uniform of a plumber—denim overalls and a sturdy pair of boots—there was an air of quiet contemplation about him, as if each gurgling pipe or hissing valve whispered secrets of the past.

As the morning light filtered softly through the shop’s wide window, Hollis glanced outside, noticing the thickening clouds gathering like silent sentinels above. It would rain soon, perhaps even storm—he could feel it in the subtle ache of old knees and the cool bite of the wind. But for now, the day lay undisturbed and full of promise, a canvas ready for the unfolding stories of water and iron beneath Millersville's aging streets and homes.
