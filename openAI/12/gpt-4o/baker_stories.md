As the first light of dawn began to filter through the cobblestone streets of the quaint village of Alderwick, Eleanor Bennett unlocked the door to her bakery, Yeast & Hearth. The scent of flour and the last traces of warmth from the brick oven greeted her, promising another bustling day. 

Nestled between the emerald hills and the gentle curve of the Silverwood River, Alderwick was a place where time seemed to amble gracefully, untouched by the hurried pulse of the outside world. The villagers relied on Eleanor's bread like a heartbeat, a daily rhythm of kneading, rising, and baking that whispered comfort through the community.

Eleanor, with her flour-dusted apron and persistent warmth, was as much a staple of Alderwick as the dawn chorus. Her hands had crafted countless loaves and pastries, each one a testament to her dedication and craft. As she set about preparing her ingredients with meticulous care, the quiet murmur of yeast and the soft rustle of baking parchment enveloped her like a familiar melody.

Outside, the village began to stir; merchants raised their shutters, children skipped along the cobbles on their way to the schoolhouse, and the aroma of fresh bread wove through the morning air like a gentle promise. Eleanor Bennett, with determination as her leavening, was ready to bring the heart of Yeast & Hearth to life once more.
