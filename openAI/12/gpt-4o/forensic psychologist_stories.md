In the heart of Savannah, where the Spanish moss drapes like nature's lace and whispers secrets to those who dare to listen, stood an old Victorian mansion at the end of Charlington Street. It was a relic of old Southern grandeur, with its grand spires and intricate woodwork recalling a bygone era. The mansion housed the offices of a rather unusual profession—Forensic Psychology Consulting, LLC—where Dr. Evelyn Harper Burke, a woman of equal parts intellect and intuition, plied her trade.

Dr. Burke's office was a study in controlled chaos, with books and case files piled in carefully curated towers, threatening to tumble yet never quite doing so. The room's air was filled with the scent of aged parchment and fresh coffee, creating an atmosphere that danced between the erudite and the comforting. Her desk, a massive oak behemoth with clawed feet, was as much a testament to her academic pursuits as it was to her unyielding determination to delve into the depths of the human psyche.

Tall and poised, with a mane of raven-black hair streaked with silver, Evelyn had eyes that sparkled with the promise of understanding what lay beneath the surface. She viewed the world as a complex puzzle, each case a new enigma waiting to be unraveled. Her presence was both commanding and reassuring, drawing people into her sphere with a quiet authority that inspired trust.

It was a late October morning, and the air was crisp, carving its freshness through the slightly ajar window in her office. Evelyn turned her chair to gaze outside, watching as an early autumn breeze rustled the trees, sending leaves fluttering to the ground in a cascade of amber and gold. The scene was peaceful, but inside her mind, she was preparing for the task ahead. A knock on the door signaled the start of another day's work, drawing Evelyn back from her momentary reverie and into the case that awaited her attention.
