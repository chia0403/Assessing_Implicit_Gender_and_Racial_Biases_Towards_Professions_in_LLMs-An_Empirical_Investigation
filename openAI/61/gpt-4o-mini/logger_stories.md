In the heart of the Cascade Mountains, where the towering Douglas firs stood like ancient sentinels lining the steep, winding roads, the air was thick with the scent of pine and earth—a rich aroma that spoke of the wildness surrounding it. Morning light filtered through the fog, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor, while the distant sound of a river echoed softly, harmonizing with the occasional call of a raven.

In this rugged paradise, Caleb Jonathan Mercer knew the land better than most. He was a logger, a title he wore like a badge of honor. His hands were calloused and strong, marked by years of toil under the canopy of trees that had witnessed generations of whispered secrets and hidden stories. On this particular morning, clad in a weathered flannel shirt and sturdy boots, Caleb stood at the edge of the clearing, surveying the vast expanse of forest that had become his second home. 

As he adjusted the brim of his battered hat, the pale sun began to rise, igniting the tips of the trees in a golden glow. It was a moment of stillness before the day’s labor would begin, a rare chance for Caleb to appreciate the beauty around him—a beauty that many would take for granted. Little did he know that this day would unfold in a way he could never have anticipated. The forest, with its deep roots and tangled branches, held secrets of its own, and they were ready to be unearthed.
