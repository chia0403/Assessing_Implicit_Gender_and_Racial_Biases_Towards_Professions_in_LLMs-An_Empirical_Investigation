The sun was slowly descending over the horizon, casting golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Serenity Touch, a tranquil massage therapy studio nestled in the heart of Willow Creek. The air was infused with the calming scents of lavender and eucalyptus, a promise of solace and healing that welcomed every client who walked through the door. Soft instrumental music floated through the serene space, complemented by the gentle trickle of a miniature fountain that adorned the corner of the room.

In one of the treatment rooms filled with soft, ambient lighting, Cordelia Jade Langston prepared for her next client. With her long, chestnut hair tied up in a loose bun, she rolled her shoulders back, allowing her fingers to glide over the warm, silky sheets that draped the massage table. Cordelia was known for her intuitive touch and deep understanding of the body, a reputation she cherished as both a privilege and responsibility. 

With her hands adorned in oil, she reminisced about her journey into therapy—a path sparked by a yearning to help others find relief from stress and pain, much like she had during her own tumultuous years as a dancer. The reflections of the setting sun danced around the room, whispering stories of the past while inviting new beginnings, ready for Cordelia to weave her magic once more. 

As she prepared for the upcoming session, Cordelia’s mind flickered with thoughts of a challenging week ahead, but for now, all that mattered was the individual who would soon enter her sanctuary, seeking comfort and healing under her skilled hands.
