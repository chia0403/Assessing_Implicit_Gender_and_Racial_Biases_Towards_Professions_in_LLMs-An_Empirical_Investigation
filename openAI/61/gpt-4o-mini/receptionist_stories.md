In the heart of downtown Portland, on a bustling street lined with cafes and brick buildings, stood the gleaming glass façade of Rowan & Hale Consulting. The company’s logo—a minimalist design of intertwining vines—encapsulated the spirit of growth and collaboration it promised to its clients. Inside, the air was infused with the scent of fresh coffee, while the gentle hum of conversation filled the modern, open-concept office space.

At the reception desk, bathed in warm light from the large windows, sat Eloise Margaret Sinclair. With her neatly styled chestnut hair and a meticulously organized workspace adorned with potted succulents, she embodied both professionalism and warmth. Eloise was the first face clients encountered and the last-person-to-leave-the-day kind of receptionist. She thrived on the rhythm of her duties, answering phones, greeting guests, and orchestrating the chaotic ballet of schedules and meetings.

But as the clock struck ten on a particularly rainy Monday morning, a sense of unease settled in the air. Eloise flipped her open notebook, glancing at the neatly inked to-do list, but her focus kept drifting to the windows, where the rain trickled down in heavy sheets. Little did she know, this gray day would soon turn into anything but ordinary.
