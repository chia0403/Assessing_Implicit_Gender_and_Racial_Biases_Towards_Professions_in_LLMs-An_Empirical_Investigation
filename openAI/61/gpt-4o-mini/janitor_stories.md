In the dim glow of the flickering fluorescent lights, the rhythmic sound of a mop sloshing against the cracked tile echoed through the deserted hallways of Strangford High School. It was late afternoon, and a deep hush had descended upon the building, as if the world beyond its walls had forgotten it existed. Trash bins lined the walls like quiet sentinels, and graffiti from years past whispered secrets of teenage rebellion, remnants of a vibrant youth that once filled these corridors.

In the midst of this lingering silence stood Anthony Joseph Moretti, head janitor of Strangford High. At six feet tall with a sturdy frame, his work shirt was stained with remnants of cleaning supplies, and a well-worn baseball cap rested atop his head, obscuring the strands of silver that threaded through his dark hair. Anthony had spent nearly two decades sweeping these halls, dusting classrooms, and repairing stubbornly creaky doors, all while fostering a quiet affection for the place that served as a second home. 

Outside, autumn winds rustled the leaves, sending them spiraling around the weathered building, while inside, Anthony knelt to wipe down a particularly sticky spot on the floor. It was then that a noise interrupted the peaceful monotonyâ€”a soft thud from the art room, followed by a muffled voice. Curiosity piqued, he stood up, mopped his brow, and headed toward the sound, wondering what mysteries lay concealed within the walls he had come to know so intimately.
