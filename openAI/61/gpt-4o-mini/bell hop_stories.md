**Title: Whispers at the Twilight Hotel**

**Setting:** The Twilight Hotel, a grand but aging establishment nestled on the edge of a misty cliff overlooking the turbulent sea. Its once-vibrant facade has faded to a muted blue, and the ornate carvings and wrought iron filigree tell tales of a time when elegance and opulence reigned supreme. The lobby, with its high ceilings and dim lighting, is filled with the scent of old wood, polished brass, and a hint of salt from the ocean breeze. Eerily large chandeliers sway gently, casting a warm glow over the mahogany check-in desk. The sound of distant thunder reverberates outside, hinting at an approaching storm.

**Opening:** 

As the first drops of rain splattered against the windowpanes of the Twilight Hotel, Jasper Elwood tightened his grip on the brass bell he carried, his cap perched jauntily atop his tousled dark hair. The newly hired bellhop, barely twenty and already accustomed to the peculiarities of the establishment, stepped onto the worn Persian rug of the lobby, his breath catching at the sight of the weary guests trickling in from the storm.

“Welcome to the Twilight Hotel,” he greeted, his voice steady yet laced with an infectious enthusiasm. “May I take your bags?”

He approached a woman clad in a long charcoal raincoat, her face partially obscured beneath the brim of a wide hat. The flickering light above them briefly illuminated the emerald glint in her eyes before plunging them back into shadow. Despite the weather and the melancholy aura of the hotel, there was something about her that stirred a strange sense of intrigue within him, much like the secrets whispered by the walls of the Twilight Hotel itself.

But as the first thunderclap rolled across the sky, a shiver danced down Jasper’s spine. Little did he know that this storm would bring more than rain; it would unearth the mysteries lurking in the corners of the hotel—and his own fate would soon become intertwined with those of the guests he served.
