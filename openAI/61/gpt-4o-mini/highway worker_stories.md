**Title: Paving New Roads**

**Setting:**

The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the wide expanse of Route 56, a two-lane highway that wound its way through the heart of Kansas. Endless fields of tall, amber grass swayed gently in the cooling evening breeze, dotted with wildflowers pushing their vibrant heads through the dirt. To the east, the silhouette of the Flint Hills rose in gentle humps, while to the west, dark clouds loomed ominously, promising rain that could wash away another long day's work. 

Amid the chorus of crickets and the distant rumble of a pickup truck, a lone figure stood beside a weathered pickup adorned with the bright orange insignia of the Kansas Department of Transportation. Reflective gear clung to him like a second skin, the vest's pockets stuffed with tools and snacks for the road. The air was heavy with the scent of asphalt and sweat, but for the man in the reflective gear, it felt intoxicating—the aroma of a day spent on the move.

**Opening:**

Fletcher Ernest Mitchell wiped his brow with the back of his hand, smearing a trace of grime across his forehead as he leaned against the hood of his truck. The sun had dipped toward the outskirts, but the asphalt beneath his feet was still warm from the day’s heat. Fletcher had always found solace in his work, where stretches of pavement turned into stories, a tapestry of his own making. But today was different. Today, a single thought gnawed at him amidst the rhythmic thud of passing vehicles: something didn’t feel right about the stretch of highway they were tasked to repair.

His gaze wandered down the road, scanning the horizon for any sign of trouble. Heavy machinery sat idling near the construction zone, casting long shadows in the twilight. Fletcher's heart raced slightly as he thought of the sudden storm forecasted for the evening. He needed to finish their patchwork before the rain hit. Years of experience told him a wet road was no place for a newly laid sealant. As he adjusted his hardhat, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that this stretch of highway was about to reveal more than just cracked asphalt.

With a determined sigh, Fletcher roused himself from his thoughts and pulled out his trusty clipboard, already mentally mapping out his next steps. Whether it was a conspicuous flaw in the pavement or a simple miscommunication among his crew, he was ready to face whatever came next, the wind of fate rustling just as wildly as the grass along the roadside.
