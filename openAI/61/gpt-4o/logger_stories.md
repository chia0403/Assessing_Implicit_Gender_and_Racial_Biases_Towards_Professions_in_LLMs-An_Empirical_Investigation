In the mist-laden heart of the Pacific Northwest, where towering evergreens clung to the edges of the sky and the air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, stood a small logging town named Cedar Ridge. Nestled between the rugged arms of the Cascade Mountains, the town was a cluster of weatherworn cabins and a single, steadfast general store that had been there since the first axe fell on these ancient woods. The sky, a shifting canvas of gray and silver, seemed to echo the quiet determination that clung to the town and its people.

Eliot Braddock, whose name was etched in the annals of Cedar Ridge’s storied history, trudged along a narrow, winding path that cut through the forest like a jagged scar. He was a man of the woods, his life intertwined with the whispering pines and the rhythmic songs of the chainsaws that sang from dawn till dusk. With hands calloused from years of hard labor and a gaze that had weathered every harsh season the mountains had thrown at him, Eliot had come to know these woods as one might know an old friend. However, today was different—beneath the quiet steadfastness of the forest, there was a tension that seemed almost palpable, as if the woods themselves held a secret that Eliot was destined to uncover.
