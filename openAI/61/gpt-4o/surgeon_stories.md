Title: Beneath the Midnight Scalpel

Opening:
Under the dim glow of the streetlights, Dr. Lillian Mae Harrington walked briskly through the deserted hospital corridors, the echoes of her footsteps reverberating off the cold, sterile walls. It was well past midnight, and the world outside lay in a heavy slumber, but within the labyrinth of St. Vincent's Hospital, life pulsated with an urgency and intensity known only to those who lived and breathed within its confines. 

Setting:
St. Vincent’s sat perched on the edge of Eastwood—a sprawling metropolis where the old met the new in a gritty fusion of history and modernity. The hospital itself was a monolith of gray stone and glass, an imposing structure nestled amid a maze of bustling streets and towering skyscrapers. Inside, the air was tinged with the antiseptic scent of cleanliness, mingling with the faint aroma of coffee from the 24-hour cafeteria. The ambient hum of machinery and the occasional distant beeping of monitors created a symphony of life, stretching across its maze-like halls.

Tonight, with the city blanketed in a gentle drizzle, the glow from streetlights reflected off the wet pavement, casting shimmering patterns that danced across the hospital's facade. Dr. Harrington, renowned for her precision and skill, was known to navigate these corridors with both the grace and determination of a conductor leading a symphony—a symphony of healing—a responsibility she bore with both pride and humility.
