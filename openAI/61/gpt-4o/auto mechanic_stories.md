On the outskirts of the small, sun-drenched town of Red Maple, where the scent of pine mingled with the smell of motor oil, stood Glenn Ryker’s Auto Repair—a modest garage with faded red siding and a hand-painted sign that proudly proclaimed, "Service with Heart." The garage was nestled between an old diner, its neon sign perpetually flickering, and a vast field of wildflowers that stretched out toward the horizon like a vibrant quilt.

Glenn Ryker was the kind of mechanic who didn't just fix engines—he understood them, as if they were old friends sharing secrets in the soothing hum of pistons and spark plugs. Tall and broad-shouldered, with oil-stained hands and a perpetual smile tugging at the corners of his lips, Glenn wore his navy-blue work coveralls like a second skin. Every morning, under the golden embrace of sunrise, he would unlatch the creaky garage doors and let the world see his domain.

Inside, the garage was a symphony of organized chaos. Brightly colored tools hung meticulously on shadow boards, rows of half-repaired vehicles waited patiently for Glenn’s touch, and the radio, perpetually tuned to the classic rock station, filled the air with nostalgic tunes. The chatter of customers and the occasional hiss of the air compressor created a rhythm all its own.

For Glenn, this was home—a place where stories were swapped beneath lifted hoods and friendship was as tangible as the grease on his fingertips. It was here, amidst the clatter and clang, that secrets of the heart and the heart of engines were unveiled.
