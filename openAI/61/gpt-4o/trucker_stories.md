In the heart of the sprawling American Midwest, where the horizon stretches forward in an interminable ribbon of asphalt and cornfields bask beneath the sun's golden stare, Raymond "Ray" Clifton navigated his eighteen-wheeler through the whispering landscape. The mile markers ticked by like clockwork, a rhythmic punctuation to the solitude that was both his companion and adversary in these open plains.

Ray had a face browned by years under the relentless sun, rough-hewn features that spoke tales of endurance, and eyes that mirrored the boundless sky, perpetually observing, searching. His hands, strong and sure on the wheel, bore the callouses of labor, a testament to the roads traveled and the loads hauled.

The diesel engine hummed a familiar, comforting lullaby as Ray guided his rig—aptly named "The Iron Nomad"—through the expansive dazzle of late summer. The truck's cabin was a world unto itself, crammed with the essentials of a life lived on the move: neatly folded maps, a thermos of coffee nestled in the cup holder, and a hula girl dashboard ornament that danced spiritedly with each bump in the road.

As the sun dipped lower, casting the sky into a kaleidoscope of oranges and purples, Ray spotted the hazy outline of a small roadside diner. It was one of those places that seemed stitched into the fabric of every trucker's life—a cobbled-together refuge offering greasy burgers, bitter coffee, and, occasionally, a warm smile. The flickering neon sign reading "Mabel’s Diner" beckoned, a beacon against the encroaching dusk.

Ray eased the rig into the gravel parking lot, the tires crunching to a halt. As he stepped down from the cab, the familiar scent of fry oil mingled with the sweet tang of clover on the evening breeze, welcoming him in a way that only these little haunts ever did.
