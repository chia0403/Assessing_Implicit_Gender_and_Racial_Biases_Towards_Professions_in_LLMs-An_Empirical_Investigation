**Opening and Setting:**

In the small coastal town of Seabrook, where the mist often mingled with the salty breeze, Martha Evelyn Granger began her day surrounded by the quiet hum of anticipation. The sky was a tumult of gray, hinting at the storm that would soon sweep across the harbor, bathing the streets in a fresh sheen. Martha, a registered nurse at Seabrook General Hospital, strode along the narrow path that wound between the huddled cottages, her breath visible in the crisp morning air.

As she walked, the familiar scent of seaweed and blooming heather filled her nostrils, the tangy aroma a comfort she had come to cherish. The hospital stood at the edge of the town, a sturdy brick building that had weathered many a storm, much like Martha herself. Her uniform was pressed to perfection, her badge gleaming with her name—Martha E. Granger, R.N.—a testament to her dedication and resilience.

The town stirred slowly, fishing boats bobbing in the distance as their nets cast shadows against the dawn. The lighthouse, a sentinel against the vast ocean's unpredictability, flashed its light through the thick fog. Today had the makings of a day like any other, yet Martha knew that in a place driven by the whims of wind and tide, anything could happen. She cast one last glance at the distant horizon before stepping into the warmth of the hospital, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her with calm determination.
