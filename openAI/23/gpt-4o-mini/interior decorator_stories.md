**Title: Whispers of Color**

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Seabreeze Heights, where quaint cottages are framed by vibrant wildflowers and the scent of saltwater lingers in the air. The sun sets over the horizon, splashing the sky with hues of pink and gold, casting a warm glow over the charming streets lined with art galleries, antique shops, and cafes filled with laughter. Nestled near the edge of a wooded grove sits a historic Victorian-style mansion, now the center of attention as it undergoes a transformation.

**Opening:**

As the morning light filtered through the lace curtains of her sun-drenched studio, a collection of paint swatches lay scattered across the rustic wooden table, each one carefully chosen to evoke a different emotion. Eleanora Bellemarche, a talented interior decorator known for her ability to breathe life into spaces, stood poised in front of a mood board that captured her latest vision. The soft rustle of the ocean breeze tousled her chestnut curls, filling her with inspiration as she envisioned the transformation of the once-dilapidated mansion into a sanctuary of beauty and style.

Today marked the beginning of her biggest project yet, a long-abandoned estate rumored to be haunted, filled with forgotten stories and hidden corners waiting to be uncovered. With her heart racing, Eleanora gathered her sketches and headed out, determined to find a way to blend the old-world charm of the mansion with the modern elegance her clients desired. Little did she know, the mansion held secrets that would challenge not just her skills as a decorator, but also her understanding of the past, and how it shapes the present.

As she approached the grand entrance, the ancient door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit foyer draped in shadows. Eleanora took a deep breath, ready to step into the unknown, her mind alive with colors and textures, unaware that the whispers of the house were about to lead her on a journey beyond mere decoration.
