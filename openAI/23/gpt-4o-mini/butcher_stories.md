In the heart of a small, weathered town where cobblestone streets wound like arteries through a landscape of aging brick buildings, there stood a quaint butcher shop known as "McAllister's Meats." Its sign, painted in deep crimson, swung gently in the crisp autumn breeze. Below the sign, a cast-iron display showcased the day’s freshest cuts, glistening in the morning light and drawing the curious and hungry alike.

The shop’s interior was warm and inviting, filled with the rich, smoky scent of cured meats and the heady aroma of spices hanging in the air. Behind the counter, meticulously arranged knives shimmered under the glow of vintage sconces, each blade wielded with care and precision by the proprietor—the butcher himself, Malcolm Theodore McAllister.

Malcolm was a stocky man in his late forties, with a thick beard flecked with salt and pepper, and hands that bore the roughness of both labor and craft. He wore a blood-stained apron, a testament to his day’s work, and his sharp blue eyes twinkled with a mix of mischief and warmth as he expertly prepared the cuts for his loyal customers. Every day, he greeted them by name, his laughter resonating like a melody against the backdrop of sizzling sausages and savory roasts.

Yet, as the afternoon sun dipped low in the sky, casting deep shadows across the shop floor, a sense of unease began to settle over Malcolm. He had heard whispers among the townsfolk about strange happenings in the woods that bordered the town—a series of cattle disappearances, remnants of shredded fur found scattered in the underbrush. With the harvest moon rising and the nights growing longer, Malcolm felt an inkling that the tranquility of his everyday life was about to be disrupted by more than just the usual hustle of market day.
