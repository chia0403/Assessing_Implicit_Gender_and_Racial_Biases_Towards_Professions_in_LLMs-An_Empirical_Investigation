**Title: The Echoes of Elmwood Clinic**

**Setting: Elmwood Clinic, a quaint but bustling medical facility situated in a tree-lined neighborhood of a small town. The lobby is adorned with pastel-colored walls and large windows that let in warm streams of sunlight, casting playful shadows on the polished wooden floor. Potted plants and framed photographs of smiling families give the space a welcoming feel. The faint sound of laughter and conversation emanates from the examination rooms, while the gentle hum of a nearby coffee machine fills the air with the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee.**

**Opening:**

Veronica Mae Thompson sat at her reception desk, the soft hum of the overhead lights providing a steady backdrop to her morning routine. She adjusted her round glasses, the frames sparkling in the light, and glanced at the wall clock. Time felt elastic in the world of Elmwood Clinic—each minute a gentle reminder of the lives passing through its doors. As the clinic’s receptionist, Veronica held a unique position: she was the first smile that greeted patients and the last wave goodbye as they left, often carrying stories that only she would know. 

This Tuesday morning was no different, yet the air felt charged, as if the day was poised on the brink of something extraordinary. Outside, autumn leaves danced in a crisp breeze, swirling playfully against the sidewalks, while inside the clinic, the steady rhythm of patient intake offered a predictable comfort. Still, Veronica felt a flutter of anticipation deep in her chest.

“Next!” she called, her bright voice slicing through the low murmur of conversation. Little did she know, today was the day everything would change, beginning with the arrival of a patient whose life would weave unexpectedly into her own.
