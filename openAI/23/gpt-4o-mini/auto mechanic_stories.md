Title: The Last Turn

Setting: The small town of Windvale, nestled between rolling hills and thick, whispering pines, thrived on a delicate balance of tradition and change. The streets were lined with quaint brick buildings that bore the wear and charm of decades gone by, but the hum of modernity could be felt in the air. At the center of it all was “Mason’s Garage,” a beloved neighborhood auto repair shop run by the talented and meticulous mechanic, Franklin Everett Mason.

Story Opening: 

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden hue over Windvale’s tidy streets as Franklin Everett Mason wiped the grease from his hands and leaned back against the hood of a faded blue Ford pickup. The scented air was a fusion of gasoline and freshly baked goods from the nearby bakery, a comforting reminder of the town's simple pleasures. Inside the garage, the rhythmic sound of tools clinking filled the space, punctuated by the faint crackle of an old radio playing soft rock classics. 

For Franklin, the grease-stained overalls and calloused hands were badges of honor. Growing up in Windvale, he had learned everything he knew from his father, who once told him that cars were like people—each with their own stories, quirks, and faults that needed to be understood before they could be fixed. As he tightened a bolt under the pickup's hood, Franklin couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to change, that soon, the peaceful days of working in his father's shadow would shift beneath his feet. 

But for now, with the sun setting and the familiar warmth of the garage wrapping around him, Franklin found solace in the sounds of machinery and the knowledge that, for better or worse, he had the skills to keep Windvale's heart beating. Little did he know, the next car to roll into his garage would bring with it a mystery that would alter the course of his life forever.
