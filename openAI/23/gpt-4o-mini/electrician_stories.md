**Story Opening and Setting:**

The small town of Eldridge was nestled in a valley where the rolling hills met the endless expanse of a cobalt sky. Its streets, lined with quaint Victorian homes, held the whispers of generations. Flickering streetlights illuminated the sidewalks as dusk fell, the warm glow battling against the approaching night. Among these homes stood the old Holloway Manor, a once-grand estate now cloaked in vines and shadows. Its towering windows, like gaping eyes, held secrets that seemed to pulse with a life of their own.

In the heart of this town, working diligently in his modest workshop on the edge of Maple Street, was **Ethan Oliver Parrish**, a seasoned electrician known for his adept hands and even sharper instincts. With his tool belt slung low and a worn baseball cap perched atop his tousled dark hair, Ethan toiled away, the rhythm of his craft echoing like a heartbeat through the quiet neighborhood. His hands were callused but kind, shaped by years of bending wires and rewiring destinies. 

Despite the charm of Eldridge, there was an unease in the air that eveningâ€”a storm rolling in from the west, dark clouds gathering like ominous thoughts. As Ethan tightened the final bolt on an old circuit box, an unusual shiver crept down his spine. Little did he know that tonight would unravel a series of events that would illuminate more than just the town's streetlights.
