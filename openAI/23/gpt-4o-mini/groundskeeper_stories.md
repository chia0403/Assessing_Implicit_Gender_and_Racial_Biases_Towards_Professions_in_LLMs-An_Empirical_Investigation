Beneath the ghostly glow of the full moon, Thornwood Manor loomed like a forgotten sentinel amidst the encroaching mist of the dense forest. Ancient oak trees whispered secrets as their gnarled branches caressed the earth, while the wind carried with it the scent of damp soil and the promise of rain. The overgrown gardens surrounding the estate, once teeming with vibrant blooms, now lay shrouded in a melancholy stillness, their wild beauty reflecting the disarray that had settled over the house itself.

At the fringe of the gardens, a solitary figure moved with purpose. Jacob Alistair Merrick, the groundskeeper, dressed in weather-beaten overalls and a frayed wool hat, knelt beside an aged rosebush that had long since surrendered to the ravages of time. Jacob had tended to Thornwood Manor for nearly two decades, his hands as familiar with the soil as they were with the stories held in the shadows of its crumbling walls. Each dawn, he rose to welcome the sunrise and the garden's waking life, yet tonight, the air felt charged with an unsettling energy, as though the manor's past was stirring in restless slumber.

With the muted sound of rustling leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl, Jacob worked with a small trowel in hand, carefully removing weeds that threatened to choke the delicate roots of the roses. Despite the chill, a warmth lingered in his heart, a bond forged through years of devotion to this land. But he could feel somethingâ€”an inexplicable presence lingering in the air, whispering beneath the rustle of the leaves. Little did Jacob know, the night held secrets that would soon unfurl like the petals of a wilting flower, intertwining his fate with that of the manor in ways he could scarcely imagine.
