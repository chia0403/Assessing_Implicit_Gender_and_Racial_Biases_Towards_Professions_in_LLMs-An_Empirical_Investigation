The chill of dawn crept over the northern battlements of Eldergrove Keep, where the first rays of sunlight filtered through the mist like golden threads weaving through a tapestry of gray. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and the distant aroma of pine from the forest that loomed just beyond the castle walls. It was a time of day when shadows still clung stubbornly to the stones, and the world felt suspended between night and day.

Atop the parapet, leaning against a weathered stone, stood Jareth Halston, a stoic figure clad in the dark leather armor of the Eldergrove guards. His keen gray eyes swept over the vast expanse of forest below, searching for signs of life or trouble. The metal of his breastplate glinted in the soft light, and the grip of his sword was firm as he braced for another long shift on duty.

Jareth had spent a decade patrolling the grounds of Eldergrove Keep, a place steeped in history and whispered legends. He was not merely a guard but a sentinel against threats that lurked in the shadows, a protector of the peace that the realm had fought to maintain. Today, however, he sensed a heaviness in the air that was hard to shake offâ€”a realization that the tranquility of Eldergrove was more fragile than it appeared. As he cast his gaze toward the encroaching woods, a fleeting memory tugged at him: the warnings of the old seer about the silent stirrings beyond the borders of their land.
