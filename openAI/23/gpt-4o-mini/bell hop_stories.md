The soft golden glow of the vintage lamps illuminated the ornate lobby of the Grand Belvedere Hotel, where chandeliers hung like the promises of the wealthy and the restless. Dark mahogany accents framed the marble floors, and the distant sound of laughter and clinking glasses echoed from the ballroom, hinting at a celebration that continued into the early hours of the morning.

At the heart of this vibrant scene stood Richard James Holloway, a bellhop of twenty-three, whose crisp emerald uniform was almost as striking as his bright amber eyes. Tall and lean, he moved with a graceful confidence, navigating his way through clusters of guests with ease. Today was particularly hectic, the kind of day where the flights of fancy and desperation of the guests contrasted sharply. Honeymooners swirled past him, champagne flutes raised high, while a weary businessman shuffled through, his shoulders hunched and brow furrowed in worry.

Richard's hands instinctively adjusted the gold-plated name tag pinned to his lapel as he caught a glimpse of the towering grandfather clock in the corner, ticking down the time until the final guests would retreat to their rooms. With a heavy suitcase in one hand and a small stack of envelopes tucked under his arm, he surveyed the lobby—each face held its own story, its own whispered secrets. 

Little did he know, this night would unveil a mystery that would ultimately entwine his fate with that of the Grand Belvedere, forcing him to confront not just the shadows of his own past, but the lives that flickered and danced around him like the shadows cast by the hotel’s glimmering chandeliers.
