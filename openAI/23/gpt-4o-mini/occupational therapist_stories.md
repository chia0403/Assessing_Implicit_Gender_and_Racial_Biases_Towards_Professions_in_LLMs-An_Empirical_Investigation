**Story Opening:**

The soft hum of fluorescent lights filled the room as Dr. Amelia Grace Thompson arranged her tools for the day. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of lavender infused into the air from the diffuser in the corner—a calming touch she insisted on maintaining for her young clients. The therapy room was bright and welcoming, painted in soft pastels with cheerful motivational posters adorning the walls. Plush mats and colorful toys littered the floor, all strategically placed to encourage movement and play. 

Outside, a light rain drizzled against the windows, leaving trails of water that glistened like tiny diamonds in the morning light. Amelia glanced at the clock, her heart quickening in anticipation of the first appointment. She had always felt a deep sense of purpose in her career, guiding children and their families through the maze of recovery and growth. Today, however, felt different; there was a subtle energy in the air that she couldn’t quite place.

As she picked up a set of colorful blocks, the door creaked open, and a young boy, no more than seven, entered, clutching a small stuffed dragon to his chest. His wide eyes darted around, soaking in the vibrant surroundings. Amelia smiled warmly, bending down to his level. “Hi there! I’m Dr. Thompson, but you can call me Amelia. What’s your name?” 

The boy hesitated, then whispered, “Oliver.” 

“Oliver,” she repeated gently, her voice soft like the drizzle outside, “welcome! Are you ready to have some fun together?”

The journey ahead promised to be full of challenges and triumphs, and as she watched Oliver take a tentative step forward, Amelia knew in her heart that today was just the beginning.
