Title: **Whispers of the Forgotten**

In the dimly lit corridors of the old Eastwood Manor, shadows seemed to dance against the cracked walls, where decades of neglect clung like cobwebs. Dust motes floated lazily in the faded beams of late afternoon sunlight, struggling to pierce through the grime-smeared windows. The creaking floorboards groaned underfoot as if weary from the weight of the silence that enveloped the sprawling estate.

It was here, amidst the peeling wallpaper and the echo of memories long lost, that Samuel Tobias Wickham began his shift as the night janitor. A man in his late forties with salt-and-pepper hair, Samuel wore a navy blue uniform that had seen better days, its pockets often bulging with supplies and the remnants of a hurried meal. He was a creature of habit, arriving every evening at precisely six o’clock, ready to sweep away the traces of the past and restore a semblance of order to the chaos around him.

Unlike others who might dread the solitude of such a job, Samuel found solace in the quiet. The Manor had an air of mystery that captivated him, with its creaking doors, flickering lights, and the faint scent of something floral that lingered in the air. He often imagined the lives that had once filled the space – laughter echoing through the grand halls, joyous gatherings under the regal chandeliers, and secrets whispered in the dark corners of the library.

As he pushed his mop through the entryway, a chill ran through the air, and Samuel paused, glancing up at the grand staircase that loomed ahead, its banister polished yet worn. Perhaps it was the wind that rustled through the cracked panes, or maybe it was something more—the whispers of forgotten souls longing to be remembered. Little did he know, tonight would be different. The Manor would show him its secrets, and Samuel Tobias Wickham would find himself at the heart of a mystery that would change everything he thought he knew about the place he called his workplace.
