The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows over the rugged terrain of the Eastern Highlands. The air was thick with the scent of earth and stone, mingling with the faint whisper of the breeze rustling through the pines. Here, amidst the jagged cliffs and weathered boulders, the sounds of toil echoed—a rhythmic chopping that punctuated the serene landscape.

In a secluded quarry, the sunlight caught the glint of a chisel and hammer as they struck against granite. The imposing figure of Silas Everhart, master stone cutter, moved with a practiced grace, each swing intentional and precise. A bandana wrapped tightly around his brow kept the beads of sweat from stinging his eyes while his weathered hands worked diligently, carving out blocks destined for grand buildings and lasting monuments.

Silas was no ordinary stone cutter; his artistry transformed raw stone into lifelike sculptures that seemed to breathe with emotion. But beneath his rugged exterior was a heart burdened with ancient secrets and dreams—dreams of a world built not just on stone, but on the truths hidden deep within its layers. He paused for a moment, looking up at the sky painted in hues of orange and purple, wondering what lay beyond the horizon and whether he would ever carve his own path away from this quarry and into the embrace of the unknown.
