The sun dipped low in the Wyoming sky, casting a golden hue over the sprawling expanse of Windmill Ridge Ranch. Dust swirled in the wake of a fading summer breeze, illuminating the silhouettes of grazing cattle scattered across the rolling hills. A solitary barn stood sentinel against the backdrop of rugged mountains, its weathered timbers telling tales of seasons past, while the faint echo of a horse’s hooves punctuated the serene stillness.

Standing amidst the tall grass, with the weight of the day’s work etched into the creases of his sun-kissed face, Caleb Nathaniel Prescott leaned on the worn railing of the corral. The ranch had belonged to his family for generations, passed down through the trials and triumphs of countless forebears. At thirty-five, Caleb had the rugged hands of a man well-acquainted with toil, yet his deep-set blue eyes held a spark of ambition that sought more than just the routine of ranch life.

As twilight set in, painting the horizon in shades of purple and orange, a sense of unease flickered in Caleb’s chest. The drought had gripped the land for too long, and whispers of corporate encroachment on ranching lands were growing louder each day. He knew that protecting his way of life came with sacrifices, but the stubborn spark of hope in his heart refused to dim. Out here, where the sky met the earth in a vast embrace, Caleb Nathaniel Prescott was determined to carve out his destiny—if only he could outmaneuver the encroaching shadows of change.
