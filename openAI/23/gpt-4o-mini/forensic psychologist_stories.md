The rain drummed steadily against the gray windows of the modest office, its cadence a soothing backdrop to the otherwise tense atmosphere. The flickering fluorescent lights cast a harsh glow over the stacks of case files that lined the shelves, their glossy covers promising a glimpse into the fragmented minds of those who had crossed the line into darkness. Dr. Evelyn Sinclair sat at her desk, the organized chaos of papers a familiar comfort. 

With her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun and her round glasses perched low on her nose, Dr. Sinclair embodied the façade of calm professionalism, but inside, she felt the weight of her latest case—a serial offender whose crimes had drawn the attention of the entire nation. As a forensic psychologist with over a decade of experience, she had learned to compartmentalize the horrors she studied, yet this case harbored an unsettling familiarity that kept her awake at night, unraveling the seams of her carefully constructed detachment.

The walls of her office were adorned with framed degrees and articles she had written, but they felt suffocatingly close, as if the very accolades she had achieved were closing in on her. Outside, the streets of Maplewood were slick and deserted, the world beyond her windows a blur of neon lights that seemed to mock her isolation. Within this small town, nestled deep in the Pacific Northwest, secrets thrived, and it was her job to unearth them—yet today, something was different. The air was thick with possibilities, and with the impending storm looming not just in the skies, but in the mind she had yet to confront, Dr. Evelyn Sinclair’s world was about to spiral into the kind of chaos she had spent years studying.
