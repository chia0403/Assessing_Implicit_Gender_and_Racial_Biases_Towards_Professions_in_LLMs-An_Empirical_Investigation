In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where the mist clung to the towering Douglas firs and the scent of pine needles lay thick in the air, the forest pulsed with ancient life. The sun struggled to break through the dense canopy, casting shadows that danced playfully across the moss-covered floor. Birds sang their morning symphonies, harmonizing with the distant rush of the river that carved its way through the land.

Benjamin "Benny" Thorne, a seasoned logger with weathered hands and a gaze that spoke of many dawns spent among these trees, trudged along the narrow path that wound deeper into the woods. At forty-two, Benny was as much a part of this forest as the trees themselves, his life intertwined with the rhythms of nature. Dressed in flannel and sturdy boots, he carried the weight of tradition and heritage, a lineage of loggers who had worked these lands for generations.

The Thorne family had long made their livelihood from the bounty of the forest, respecting its cycles, and treating it as both adversary and ally. Benny, however, had always nurtured a particular reverence for the wilderness, a quiet understanding that each tree felled was a life entrusted to his care. This morning, as he walked the familiar trail, he contemplated the day's work ahead, unaware of the unexpected path his life was about to take.
