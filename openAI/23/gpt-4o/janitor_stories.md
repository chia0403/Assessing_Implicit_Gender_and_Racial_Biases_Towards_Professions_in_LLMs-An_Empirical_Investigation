Title: *Whispers in the Corridors*

In the sprawling, labyrinthine halls of Crestwood High School, where the echo of adolescent chatter faded into the evening quiet, Louis "Lou" Castellano began his nightly ritual. As the head janitor, Lou had become a fixture in the school, a quiet guardian of its storied walls for over twenty years. He arrived each day just as the last students departed, the fading sun slicing through rows of windows to cast golden paths across the linoleum floors.

Crestwood High was an old building, a relic from an era when architecture was a blend of grandeur and practicality. Its walls held secrets of generations past, with ivy climbing the outer bricks as if trying to peer through the leaded windows at the stories within. Ornate wooden doors creaked on their hinges, and the scent of aging paper and polished wood added to the timeless atmosphere.

Lou moved with practiced ease through his domain, pushing his trusty cart stocked with cleaning supplies and armed with a battered walkman playing his favorite tunes from the seventies. He was a man who knew the secret language of a school at night—the hum of distant lights, the creak of cooling pipes, and the whispers that seemed to resonate from forgotten corners.

Despite the solitude, there was a calmness in these afterschool hours that Lou cherished. To him, each sweep of his mop was like the turning of a page in a well-loved book, each round of the corridors a familiar story retold. Yet, tonight felt different. As he rounded a corner into the east wing, a faint and unfamiliar sound caught his attention—a soft murmur, almost like a distant conversation.

Lou paused, removing his headphones. His heart quickened, yet curiosity outweighed apprehension. With ears tuned to the silence, he stepped toward the source of the sound, his mind weaving through the possibilities and the lingering question of what might whisper back to him in the corridors of Crestwood High.
