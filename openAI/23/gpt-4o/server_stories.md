Lillian Mae Harrington stood by the large, arched windows of the Grand Vespera Hotel's elegant dining hall, where the golden morning light streamed in, casting intricate shadows on the polished marble floors. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm croissants drifted through the air as she adjusted her crisp white apron and checked her reflection in the gleaming silver of the serving tray she held.

The dining hall, opulent yet tastefully understated, was adorned with crystal chandeliers that tinkled softly whenever the soft breeze from the open terrace doors fluttered the heavy velvet drapes. Guests, a mix of business travelers and vacationing families, trickled in, their voices blending into a gentle hum that filled the sophisticated atmosphere.

Despite the early hour, the city's vibrant energy pulsed just beyond the grand hotel's doors, hinting at another busy day ahead. But here, inside the serene cocoon of the Grand Vespera, time seemed to slow, the world outside momentarily held at bay. 

Lillian, known to the regulars simply as "Lilly", had been a server here for five years, each day starting in much the same way. The routine was comforting, a steady heartbeat she could rely upon amidst the chaos of clinking cutlery and clattering plates. Yet, there was something about this particular morning—a subtle whisper of change in the air, like the first notes of a new song not yet fully composed—that made Lilly linger by the window for just a moment longer, wondering what the day might hold.
