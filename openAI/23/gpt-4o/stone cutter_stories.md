The early morning sun cast a gentle golden glow over the village of Elderstone, nestled at the foot of the towering Blue Ridge Mountains. Dew shimmered on the lush green fields, and a light mist clung to the winding cobblestone paths that wove through the quaint hamlet. Among the village’s artisans, merchants, and farmers, one name was known for the echo of the chisel and the soft thud of hammer on stone—Elias Stonewell.

Elias stood in front of his modest workshop, a structure of weathered wood and large hand-carved stones that bore witness to the skills he had honed since boyhood. Unlike many in the village, his day began before the first rooster crowed, in the pale hours when the world was hushed and still. Around him, the undulating hills slumbered under a blanket of fog, their secrets waiting to be revealed as the sun climbed higher.

His workshop was as much a sanctuary as it was a place of labor. Rough-hewn shelves lined its walls, adorned with chisels and mallets in varying shapes and sizes, each worn handle a testament to Elias’s tireless dedication. At the heart of the workshop, a massive slab of granite rested, its surface unmarked and full of potential, much like the day itself.

Elias ran his calloused fingers over the stone, feeling its cool, smooth promise. To some, it might have seemed a simple rock, but to him, it held whispers of what it could become—a gateway, a guardian, a part of history. Today, his work would transform it, etching his story into its surface, entwined with the fabric of Elderstone.
