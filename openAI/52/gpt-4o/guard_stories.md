Under the golden veil of dawn, the town of Eldridge awoke to a symphony of chirping birds and bustling market-goers. The cobblestone streets, still damp from the night’s rain, glistened as the sun's rays peeked through the parting clouds. Stalls lined the town square, where the aroma of fresh-baked bread mingled with the earthy scent of herbs and spices, creating a rich tapestry that wrapped around the early risers.

Standing at the eastern gate, with the towering stone walls at his back, was Edmund Thatcher, a seasoned guard known for his unwavering vigilance. His steel-gray eyes scanned the horizon, and his posture was as firm and steady as the oak spear he held. Clad in a tunic of deep green and reinforced leather, marked with the insignia of Eldridge—a soaring hawk—he stood as a symbol of safety and order. Despite his stern appearance, there was a kindness in Edmund that endeared him to the people he was sworn to protect.

Eldridge was a town at the crossroads of trade and travel, where whispers of distant lands met the echo of local tales. Its architecture was a blend of ancient stone towers and quaint wooden cottages, reflecting a history rich in tradition and lore. Yet, it was not without its secrets. As the day unfurled and shadows shifted, a certain restlessness began to stir in the air, hinting at the day’s undiscovered mysteries, waiting patiently to unfold.
