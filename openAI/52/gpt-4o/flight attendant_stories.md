Skylar Dawson had always felt at home among the clouds. As she glanced out of the small oval window beside her, the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean stretched endlessly beneath, a liquid canvas brushed with hues of blue and silver. Above, the sun cascaded through scattered layers of cotton-ball clouds, casting an ethereal glow over the Boeing 787 Dreamliner she inhabited almost as much as her own apartment in Chicago. 

Skylar loved the hum of the cabin as she prepared for takeoff—the soft symphony of murmurs from passengers stowing their belongings, the gentle clattering of overhead compartments, and the rhythmic thumping of the jet engines readying to channel sheer power into gravity. Today, as Flight 276 plotted its course from Los Angeles to Tokyo, Skylar was reminded once more of the odd nomadic life she had chosen—a ceaseless journey where beginnings met endings in perfect sync, and places became chapters in an unending book.

The interior of the cabin was a testament to modern luxury and efficiency. Shades of cool blue lined the walls, seamlessly blending with the gentle LED mood lighting that shifted with the time zone they crossed. Skylar's uniform—a crisp midnight blue—with her silver wings pinned neatly on the lapel, was a part of her identity, a badge of hospitality and responsibility at 35,000 feet. 

As she walked her familiar aisle once more, greeting passengers with her characteristic warmth, she couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. Each flight was a new canvas, with stories waiting to unfold amidst the journey—stories that Skylar Dawson had the unique and privileged position to witness, midair and between worlds.
