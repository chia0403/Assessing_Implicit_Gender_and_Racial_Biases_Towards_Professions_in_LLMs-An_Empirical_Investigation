As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Pine Hollow, the rooftops glistened with the early morning dew, casting a gentle shimmer across the rows of modest houses. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of pine needles mixed with the distant smoke from wood-burning stoves. In this peaceful setting, atop a gabled roof that overlooked the verdant expanse of Maplewood Avenue, stood Marcus "Mack" Kensington, hammer in one hand, and a coil of roofing nails slung over his shoulder.

Mack was a fixture in Pine Hollow, known for his unwavering work ethic and the quiet integrity he brought to each job. His weathered hands, marked by years of labor under the sun, expertly secured shingles with a rhythmic efficiency—a skill passed down through generations, as roofing had been the Kensington family trade for nearly a century. Peering down from his high perch, Mack observed the awakening town below, each house a story, each roof a testament to his craftsmanship.

He paused for a moment, the gentle rustling of leaves the only interruption to the morning's tranquility. In those quiet moments before the town fully awoke, amid the whisper of wind and the call of distant birds, Mack found a profound sense of peace—an understanding that every nail driven brought him one step closer to completing a small part of his legacy.
