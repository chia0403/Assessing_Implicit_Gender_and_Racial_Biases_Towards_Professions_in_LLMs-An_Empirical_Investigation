Title: The Color of Secrets

In the heart of Savannah, where cobblestone streets whispered tales of the past and Spanish moss swayed with an eerie grace from ancient oaks, there stood an imposing antebellum mansion. Its weathered facade was an eclectic mix of faded grandeur and melancholic charm, hinting at the secrets woven into the fabric of its very walls. This enigmatic residence, with its grand pillared porch and dusty stained glass windows, had piqued the interest of Eleanor "Ellie" Whitmore, a renowned interior decorator known for her uncanny ability to breathe life into forgotten spaces.

Ellie had arrived early that brisk autumn morning, the air crisp and carrying a faint scent of the sea. She stepped out of her vintage convertible, a cherry-red gift from her grandmother, and paused to take in the silent beauty of the home. With her sketchbook tucked under one arm and a cup of steaming coffee in hand, she made her way up the creaking steps, her footsteps echoing in the stillness. This was the kind of project she lived for—a house that held stories in every crevice, waiting for someone with the vision to unearth them.

As she reached for the tarnished brass door knocker shaped like a lion's head, a gentle breeze carried the haunting chords of a piano, as if the house itself remembered its past joys and sorrows. Entranced, Ellie hesitated, half-expecting the door to swing open on its own, revealing the chapters it had witnessed. But no such magic occurred. Instead, she rapped on the door, metal on metal, producing a sound that reverberated through the halls within.

Eleanor Whitmore was not an ordinary decorator. Her talent lay beyond fabrics and hues; it was in her innate ability to listen to the whispers of a house and translate them into spaces that felt like echoes of the soul. Today, as she stood on the threshold of this old mansion on Forsyth Street, she could feel the vibrations of a story long buried—and she was determined to uncover it.
