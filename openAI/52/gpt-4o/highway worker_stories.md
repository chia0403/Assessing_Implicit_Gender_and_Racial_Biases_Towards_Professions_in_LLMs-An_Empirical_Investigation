Title: **The Last Mile**

In the crisp embrace of dawn, where the fog caressed the edges of the winding highway like a gentle whisper, Caledonia "Cal" Mercer adjusted her orange hard hat and surveyed the stretch of road that lay before her. This remote segment of Route 92, snaking through the lush valleys and rolling hills, had become a second home to her over the years. It was an ever-shifting tapestry of terrain, where each turn and incline bore stories of fleeting encounters and persistent journeys.

Cal had always found a peculiar solace in the solitude of highway work. The rhythmic hum of machines, the earthy scent of fresh asphalt, and the symphony of nature created a harmony that resonated deep within her. Standing atop a small rise, she watched as the sunlight pierced the fog, scattering it in shimmering tendrils that retreated to the shadows of the surrounding forest. Birds began their morning chorus, their songs echoing across the empty expanse.

Her fellow crew members would soon arrive, breaking the tranquility with the clatter of tools and the rumble of engines. But for now, this quiet moment belonged to herâ€”a chance to breathe deeply of the clean, cool air and savor the silence before the day's work began in earnest. 

Cal nudged her safety vest into place, feeling the familiar weight settle upon her shoulders. Every mile of road she worked on was not just about asphalt and gravel. It was a ribbon of connection running through the land, something she took great pride in maintaining. For Cal Mercer, this was more than just a job. It was a daily testament to her care for the landscapes and communities she served, one road at a time.
