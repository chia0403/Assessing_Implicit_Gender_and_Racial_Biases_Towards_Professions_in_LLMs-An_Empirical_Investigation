In the small, secluded town of Elderswood, nestled between dense forests and rolling hills, the air was thick with the scent of pine and the distant sound of rustling leaves. The townsfolk often referred to the fading light of dusk as “the moment when stories come alive,” and it was during these hours that the Elderswood Public Library came to life in its own unique way.

The library, an impressive structure of dark stone and ivy-covered brick, stood proudly at the edge of the town square. Its tall, arched windows glowed warmly, inviting passersby to step inside and lose themselves among the countless tales waiting on the shelves. Inside, the walls were lined with towering bookshelves, brimming with dusty tomes and well-thumbed paperbacks, each whispering secrets of worlds unknown.

At the heart of this literary sanctuary was Margaret Eleanor Hastings, a woman whose life had been devoted to the worlds hidden within those pages. At thirty-three, Margaret was known not just for her meticulous cataloging skills and gentle guidance with patrons, but for the quiet magic that seemed to radiate from her as she wandered between the aisles. With her chestnut hair pulled back into a loose bun and a pair of round glasses perched upon her nose, she moved as if floating, a well-loved novel clutched to her chest, her mind often veiled in the fog of her own reverie.

As the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the wooden floorboards, Margaret paused by the expansive window that overlooked the town square. She often found solace in this spot, where the outside world blurred into a painting of orange and purple hues. Tonight, however, an unfamiliar frisson in the air nudged at her thoughts. It felt as if something momentous was on the brink of unfolding, waiting to be uncovered—just like the many stories she so loved to tell.
