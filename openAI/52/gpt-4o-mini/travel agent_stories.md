The soft hum of the neon “Open” sign flickered against the twilight sky, casting a warm glow on the small travel agency nestled between a busy café and a bookstore in downtown Evergreen. The comforting scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as the gentle sound of a bell jingled above the door each time a new customer stepped inside. 

In the heart of this cozy space, surrounded by vibrant travel brochures and maps that sprawled across the walls, sat Clara Genevieve Merriweather. With her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun and reading glasses perched precariously on her nose, Clara was immersed in a colorful brochure showcasing the pristine beaches of Bora Bora. Her passion for wanderlust ignited her imagination as she envisioned the soft, white sands and glistening cerulean waters. 

At the moment, however, Clara was contemplating her own next adventure. It had been years since she had treated herself to a getaway, her days consumed by planning dream vacations for others. Each carefully curated itinerary brought her clients joy, but it left her feeling like a traveler who had forgotten how to pack her own suitcase. 

As the clock struck six, the last rays of sun dipped below the horizon, and the warm glow of the agency transformed into an inviting enclave, the perfect setting for Clara to ponder the possibilities that lay beyond the confines of her office. Little did she know, an unexpected visitor would soon walk through that door, changing the course of her life in ways she never imagined.
