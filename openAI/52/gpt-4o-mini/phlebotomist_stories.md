**Title: Bloodlines**

**Setting:** The bustling city of Alderwood, known for its blending of modern skyscrapers and charming, tree-lined streets. It’s late afternoon, and the warm glow of the setting sun filters through the glass and steel facades, casting elongated shadows on the sidewalk. The hum of traffic and distant laughter from a nearby café create a soundtrack of urban life, punctuated occasionally by the shrill sound of a siren.

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of Alderwood Medical Center flickered gently overhead as Clarissa Mae Jenkins adjusted her lavender scrubs and tucked a stray curl behind her ear. The sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint whir of equipment wrapped around her like a familiar embrace. Each day began the same way, but somehow, each shift brought a new story—new lives, new challenges, and new connections.

With a practiced ease, Clarissa navigated the colorful maze of patient rooms and nurse stations, her heart steady despite the rush of adrenaline that came with every draw. Phlebotomy was more than just a job for her; it was a calling rooted in compassion and a deep-seated belief in the power of healing. As she pushed open the door to the blood collection room, she smiled at the sight of intricate diagrams of the human anatomy plastered on the walls and the comfortable armchairs waiting for anxious patients.

“Ready to face the day, Ms. Jenkins?” a cheerful voice piped up from behind the counter. It was Mark, her fellow phlebotomist, and partner in crime. He was already donning his gloves, his green scrubs contrasting sharply with the bright open space.

“Always,” she replied, tightening her ponytail before picking up her collection kit, the weight of it feeling like a small promise for the afternoon ahead. “Let’s see what our patients have in store for us today.”

As she settled into her routine, little did Clarissa know that this shift would be different from the rest—a quiet hospital room held secrets that would unravel the threads of her life in ways she never imagined, tethering her fate to a complex tapestry of bloodlines and buried truths.
