The morning sun filtered through the gauzy curtains of the old Whitmore estate, casting delicate patterns of light and shadow across the pristine wooden floors. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the sunny kitchen, mingling with the faintest hint of lavender that lingered from the previous day’s tidying. Squeaky floorboards creaked underfoot as Clara Genevieve Hayes swept her gaze across the grand foyer, taking in the high ceilings adorned with intricate moldings and family portraits that seemed to watch her every move.

Clara had worked in the Whitmore estate for nearly five years, and in that time, she had grown equally fond of the elegant home and its convoluted histories. Today felt different, charged with an energy she couldn’t quite identify. She caught a glimpse of herself in the shiny brass mirror by the staircase, where her dark curls framed a face that looked as weary as it was determined. With a resolute nod, Clara set down her cleaning supplies and made her way to the parlor, the soft sound of her footsteps echoing through the cavernous space.

Outside, a storm brewed on the horizon, dark clouds swirling ominously above the estate, threatening to unleash chaos upon the calm facade of their lives. Clara felt the storm’s presence deep in her bones, as if it were calling out to secrets buried within the walls of the Whitmore estate. Today, she would uncover them.
