Title: **Beneath the Shingles**

Opening:

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the sleepy town of Maplewood. Its rays glimmered against the worn roofs of quaint suburban homes, each a testament to years of wear and weathering. Birds chirped cheerfully as they flitted about the tree-lined streets, but the real symphony of sounds came from above, where dexterous hands were busy at work.

On the roof of a two-story colonial, the rhythmic clatter of a hammer rang out, mingling with the soft rustling of newly laid shingles. Standing on the edge of the sloped roof, Lucas Benjamin Hartman took a moment to wipe the sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand. He glanced out over the neighborhood, an expanse of familiar eaves and chimneys that blended seamlessly into the backdrop of distant mountains. After a decade of roofing, this small town felt like an extension of himself, the highs and lows of every shingle a part of his story.

Lucas was thirty-five, with calloused hands that bore the marks of hard work and sun-kissed skin that told tales of summers spent in the elements. He pulled his baseball cap down lower to shield his eyes from the sun's glare, the fabric faded and frayed, a symbol of his steadfast dedication to both craft and community.

Beside him, his apprentice, a wiry eighteen-year-old named Jesse, struggled with the next bundle of shingles. "Hey, Lucas! Need a little help here?" Jesse's voice was filled with a mixture of eagerness and uncertainty, a reminder of the youthful zeal that once defined Lucas's own debut into the world of roofing.

"Just lift with your legs, Jess! You got this!" Lucas called out, a grin creeping onto his face. He felt the familiar tug of nostalgia as he remembered his own early days on the job, how the rooftops had become his refuge, a kingdom of perspective above the mundane struggles of the ground.

As the sun dipped lower, bathing the world in amber light, an unexpected gust of wind whipped through the air. Lucas steadied himself, eyes narrowing as he noticed the ominous storm clouds brewing on the horizon. He could feel the unease settling in his gut, a seasoned roofer's sense for weather warning him of what was to come. Little did he know that this day, beneath the shingles and amidst a brewing storm, would change everything.
