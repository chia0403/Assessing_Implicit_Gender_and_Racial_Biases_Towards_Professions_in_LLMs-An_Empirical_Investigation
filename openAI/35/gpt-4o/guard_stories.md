In the heart of the sprawling Empire of Valerius, where cobblestone streets wound their way through ancient stone buildings and lanterns flickered like fireflies in the evening mist, stood the formidable Bastion Gate. This towering structure, with its iron-clad doors and intricate latticework of steel, served as the threshold between the bustling city of Verenthia and the untamed wildlands beyond. It was here, amidst the constant clatter of wagons and the distant cries of harbor gulls, that Aiden Thorne took up his post as a guard.

Aiden Thorne, known for his steadfastness and a gaze as sharp as the spear he carried, was a man of unwavering duty. His family had served as protectors of Verenthia for generations, and he wore the legacy with pride. The sun-kissed stones beneath his boots bore the weight of countless footsteps, each step echoing the stories of those who had come before him.

As dawn crept over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of rose and amber, Aiden adjusted his cuirass, feeling the familiar comfort of its embrace. The morning air was crisp, tinged with the salty breath of the nearby sea, promising both a day of routine and the ever-lingering possibility of the unexpected. As the first merchants began to pull their wares through the gate, Aiden stood vigilant, ever watchful for signs of trouble amid the murmurs of the waking city. Little did he know, this day would unfurl a tale unlike any other in the annals of his service.
