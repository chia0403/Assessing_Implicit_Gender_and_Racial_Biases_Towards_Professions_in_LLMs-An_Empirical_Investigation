In the heart of the small village of Elderwood, where cobblestone paths wound through quaint, ivy-clad cottages, Marjorie Wainwright began her morning routine just as the first golden rays of sunrise peeped over the horizon. The air was crisp and carried the fresh scent of dew-drenched lilacs, hinting at the promise of another fair day. As the village's esteemed housekeeper, Marjorie had been tending to the homes and hearts of Elderwood for nearly two decades, her presence a steadfast anchor in the ever-changing tides of time.

Marjorie lived in a modest stone cottage at the edge of town, surrounded by a lush garden she lovingly cultivated. Her home, The Sapling House, was a charming reflection of her characterâ€”unassuming yet filled with warmth. Every morning, she would ease open the creaky oak door, stepping into the bustling streets with a gentle purpose.

As she made her way to the first home of her daily rounds, the Whitfield Manor, she greeted familiar faces with a kind nod and a smile. The village was still stirring to life, the soft clinking of milk bottles and the distant chirrups of waking birds creating a symphony of comfort. Marjorie loved this time of day, when the world seemed to hold its breath in gentle anticipation of all that was yet to come.
