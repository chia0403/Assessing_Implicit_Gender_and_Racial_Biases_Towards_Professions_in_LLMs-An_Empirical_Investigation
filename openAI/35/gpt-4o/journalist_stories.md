The heavy patter of rain against the cobblestone streets created a rhythmic symphony in the heart of Edinburgh, as Clara Lowell tightened her grip on the leather strap of her satchel. The historic city, with its ancient, towering edifices and winding alleyways, seemed shrouded in secrets, a perfect canvas for a journalist hungry for stories that mattered.
