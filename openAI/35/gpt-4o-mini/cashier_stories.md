The fluorescent lights flickered above the small, suburban grocery store, casting a sterile glow across the rows of neatly stacked produce and brightly colored packages. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the steady hum of the checkout registers provided a rhythmic backdrop to the quiet buzz of the customers milling about. Behind one such register, a young woman named Eliza Mae Thompson stood with her hands poised over the keys, her gaze drifting toward the front window where dark clouds had begun to gather.

Eliza was twenty-three and had spent nearly five years as a cashier at Miller’s Market, a local fixture that had seen better days. She wore a navy blue apron embroidered with the store's cheerful logo—a plump melon wearing sunglasses—and her long, chestnut hair was pulled back into a messy bun. The weather had grown increasingly unpredictable this fall, and today felt particularly heavy, as though the air itself was holding its breath.

With a soft sigh, Eliza scanned the last item from a customer's cart, the beeping of the register momentarily snapping her back to reality. She exchanged a warm smile with Mrs. Carson, an elderly lady known for her love of gossip and overly ripe bananas. As Mrs. Carson dug through her purse for change, Eliza couldn't help but think about the dreams she had stashed away, just like those last, forgotten coupons in the bottom of her own wallet. Each beep of the register reconfirmed a habit she had grown accustomed to, but every once in a while, she'd catch herself longing for something more than the routine of checkout lines and plastic bags.

Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the windows of the store and sending a chill that crept into Eliza's bones. It was the kind of weather that made the world feel small, as if she were trapped within the four walls of Miller’s Market and could only dream of what lay beyond—adventures waiting just outside the storm. Little did she know, today would bring change, even if it began simply with a new customer stepping through the sliding glass doors.
