In the dim early hours of a Wednesday morning, the echoes of bustling city life were still muted, cocooned within the walls of the Montgomery High School. Flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a ghostly glow over the empty hallways, where faded lockers stood like sentinels guarding memories of laughter and learning. The smell of linoleum and disinfectant hung in the air, familiar and comforting to those who worked here—particularly to one particular custodian.

Harrison James Caldwell maneuvered his way through the labyrinth of classrooms, clutching a worn mop in one hand and a bucket of soapy water in the other. At fifty-three, Harrison was a seasoned janitor, a silent observer of the lives that unfolded within these walls. His uniform, slightly frayed at the cuffs, bore the insignia of the school—an old oak tree surrounded by stars—symbolizing both stability and aspiration.

With deliberate care, he made his way to Room 204, where the remnants of yesterday’s chaos lingered: crumpled paper, spilled ink, and the faint smell of sweat from an overzealous gym class. As he began the rhythmic dance of cleaning—swirling the mop through the puddles of neglect—Harrison's thoughts drifted. Outside, the world was waking up, but here, in his domain, time felt paused, almost sacred.

Harrison had been at Montgomery High for over a decade, but to the students and faculty, he was often invisible, just a part of the school’s backdrop. Yet, he had seen everything: the triumphs and heartbreaks, the friendships that sparked like firecrackers in the cafeteria, and the quiet solitude of lonely hallways after the final bell rang. Each day, he told himself he was more than the litany of tasks he performed; he was a core part of the story, a keeper of secrets etched in chalk and spray paint.

A sudden clang from the art room startled him from his reverie. Adjusting his cap, he decided it was time to investigate—not merely out of curiosity, but because, for Harrison, every moment spent within these walls felt like an extension of his own life, woven into the fabric of the place he called home.
