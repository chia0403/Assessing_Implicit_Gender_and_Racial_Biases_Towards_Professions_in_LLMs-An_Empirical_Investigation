In the small town of Cedar Hollow, where the pine trees whispered secrets to the wind and the sound of rushing water from the nearby river provided a constant, soothing backdrop, the arrival of spring marked more than just the blooming of wildflowers. It heralded the start of construction season, when heavy machinery would rumble to life and the air would fill with the scent of fresh earth being turned. 

At the heart of this transformation stood Lucas James Treadwell, a seasoned heavy equipment operator known for his skilled hands and unwavering resolve. Clad in faded jeans and a well-worn flannel shirt, he felt most at home perched high above the ground in the cab of his bulldozer, surveying the vast expanses of land that were transformed under his command. The roar of the engine had become a familiar soundtrack to his life, a symphony of steel and earth that vibrated through the very marrow of his bones.

On this particular morning, as dawn broke over the horizon and painted the sky in shades of orange and pink, Lucas warmed up the engine, feeling the thrilling anticipation of a new project. Today marked the beginning of a long-awaited road extension that would connect Cedar Hollow to the neighboring town of Hillsborough. However, beneath the surface of his excitement lay a hint of apprehension. Whispers of something unsettling had begun to circulate in town—a series of odd occurrences tied to the land they were about to disturb.

As he squinted into the rising sun, he felt a chill dance along his spine. With a determined shake of his head, Lucas dismissed the notion. He had work to do, and he’d be damned if he let any superstitions stand in the way of progress. With a firm grip on the controls, he lowered the blade and pushed forward, eager to carve a new path and uncover the stories held within the soil. But unbeknownst to him, the earth had its own secrets to unveil—secrets that would intertwine with his fate in ways he could never have imagined.
