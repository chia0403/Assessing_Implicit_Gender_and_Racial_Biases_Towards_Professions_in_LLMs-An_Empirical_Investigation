The early morning mist clung to the sprawling grounds of Briarwood Manor, coiling around the ancient oaks and lacing through the freshly pruned rose bushes. A golden hue began to seep into the horizon, chasing away the shadows and revealing the stone carving of a lion perched majestically at the manor’s entrance. With the sun slowly rising, it cast long, delicate fingers of light across the manicured lawn, where a solitary figure worked silently.

Harlan Tobias Miller had long grown accustomed to the tranquility of dawn, a time when the world stirred gently awake. For over fifteen years, he had tended to Briarwood Manor, his weathered hands cultivating the earth while his heart remained tethered to its beauty. A worn straw hat, adorned with a few stray twigs from yesterday’s labor, shielded his fair skin from the sun's burgeoning warmth, while his faded flannel shirt spoke of countless seasons spent under the open sky.

As Harlan knelt to prune a flowering azalea, he regarded the manor's façade: stone walls draped in ivy and echoing untold stories. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the sweet fragrance of blooming lilacs, and the gentle rustle of leaves provided a soothing backdrop to his thoughts. Today, however, his routine was punctuated by a sense of anticipation. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something significant was on the horizon—perhaps it was the arrival of a new family, or just the whispers of the ancient estate urging him to listen more closely.

But of one thing he was certain: Briarwood was more than just a place he tended; it was a living entity with secrets entwined in its roots. As he worked, Harlan found his mind drifting to a faded journal tucked away in a dusty corner of the manor’s library, one that claimed to reveal the hidden history of the grounds he so lovingly cared for. Little did he know, today would draw him closer to those secrets than ever before.
