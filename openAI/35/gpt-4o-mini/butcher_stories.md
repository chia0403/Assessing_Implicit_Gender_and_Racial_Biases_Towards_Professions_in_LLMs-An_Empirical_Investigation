**Story Opening:**

The air was thick with the rich, savory scent of meat and the sound of cleavers rhythmically striking the wooden block. In the heart of Eldermere, a small town nestled between the rolling green hills of Yorkshire, there stood a quaint butcher shop, its window adorned with glistening cuts of freshly prepared meat. The sign above the door, painted in a deep crimson hue, read "Parker’s Meats," its letters worn but cheerful, much like the man who owned it.

Inside, the walls were lined with rustic wooden shelves holding jars of pickled vegetables and homemade sausages, their casings twinkling under the warm glow of the overhead lights. At the back of the shop, behind the gleaming counter, stood Henry Alaric Parker, a burly man in his early fifties, with a thick beard flecked with gray and hands as calloused as the butcher's block he worked upon. His green apron, slightly stained from the day's labors, hung loosely from his broad shoulders as he deftly sliced a juicy piece of pork into perfect chops.

Henry had inherited the family business from his father, who had set up shop in Eldermere over three decades ago, and just as his father before him, he treated every customer like family. On this brisk autumn morning, as golden leaves danced outside like children at play, he could feel the familiar tingle of anticipation in the air; it was the eve of the Harvest Festival, when townsfolk would flock to his shop for the finest cuts to prepare for their festive feasts.

As he wiped his hands on a towel and surveyed the glistening array of meats, he noticed a flicker of movement at the edge of his vision. A tall figure, wrapped in a dark overcoat that seemed a few sizes too large, entered the shop with an aura of mystery that stood in stark contrast to the comforting warmth of the place. The bell above the door jangled softly, heralding the arrival of his first customer of the day.

“Welcome to Parker’s Meats!” Henry called out, a welcoming smile breaking across his face. But as the figure stepped into the light, he felt a shiver run down his spine—a feeling that this day would be unlike any other.
