In the heart of the Pacific Northwest, where towering Douglas firs and ancient cedars formed a lush green cathedral, the air was thick with the rich, earthy scent of damp soil and pine resin. Sunlight filtered through the canopy, casting a dappled pattern of light and shadow on the forest floor, where ferns and moss stretched luxuriously in the undergrowth. It was here, amid the whispering leaves and the distant sound of the river tumbling over smooth stones, that Jacob Thornton found his purpose.

Jacob Craig Thornton, a rugged figure in his late thirties, stood at the edge of a clearing, the roar of his chainsaw echoing through the trees like a thunderclap. With calloused hands and dirt-smeared cheeks, he took a moment to wipe the sweat from his brow, his weathered flannel shirt clinging to him from the day’s labor. He was a logger, born and bred, inheriting this life from his father and the generations before him—men who had carved a living from the giants of the forest, respecting the land yet taking what they needed to survive.

Today was different, though. An air of tension hummed beneath the surface, as if the forest itself was holding its breath. Jacob felt it in the pit of his stomach, a gnawing unease that clashed with his usual instinct to cut and clear. Rumors had begun to swirl in town about encroaching development, the kind that promised to change the landscape forever. As he stepped into the heart of the woods, the chainsaw buzzing to life in his grip like a beast awakened, he couldn’t shake the feeling that what lay ahead would test not just his skill as a logger, but also his place in a world that was rapidly shifting around him.
