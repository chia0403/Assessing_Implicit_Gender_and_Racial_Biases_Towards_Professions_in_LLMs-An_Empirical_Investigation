In the quaint coastal town of Seabrook, where the salt-kissed air mingled with the scent of blooming lilacs, stood a stately Victorian house perched atop a hill, its weathered shutters painted a cheerful sky blue. The rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore served as a backdrop to the lives that flourished within its walls. 

It was here, on an overcast morning that hinted at a coming storm, that we find Eliza Mae Hawthorne, a diligent housekeeper whose life was intertwined with the creaks and whispers of the aging home. Having spent over a decade tending to the needs of the formidable lady of the house, Mrs. Agnes Thornbridge, Eliza was a fixture in this household, as much a part of its tapestry as the intricate lace curtains that adorned the windows. 

With neatly pinned, chestnut hair and perceptive hazel eyes, Eliza moved briskly about the parlor, dusting the delicate porcelain figurines that adorned the fireplace mantle. While the rest of the world bustled beyond the house’s sprawling garden, Eliza found solace in the rhythm of her chores—each polished surface and folded linen a monument to her meticulous nature. Today, however, her instincts tingled with anticipation; a feeling that change, like the storm brewing on the horizon, was about to sweep through the Thornbridge home. Eliza couldn’t shake the notion that this day would bring more than just rain and wind—it would stir the very foundation of her existence.
