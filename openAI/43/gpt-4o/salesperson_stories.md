Miles Everett Kensington had always thrived amid the bustling chaos of urban life, where towering skyscrapers cast long shadows over narrow streets bustling with the endless flow of promise and ambition. It was early November, and the city of Veridian Pointe was cloaked in a crisp chill that signaled the impending arrival of winter. The morning sun barely pierced the thick layer of clouds hanging heavy in the sky, painting the world in shades of grey.

Miles stood just inside the large glass doors of Kensington & Co., his family’s venerable—but now struggling—appliance sales business that had occupied a prime corner on Merton Avenue since his grandfather's time. He wore a tailored navy suit that signaled professionalism and respectability, his trademark crimson tie adding a touch of warmth to his otherwise cool demeanor. The old wooden floors creaked softly beneath his polished shoes as he moved, the sound echoing faintly in the spacious showroom.

Rows of gleaming refrigerators, stoves, and washing machines lined the walls, their brand-new surfaces reflecting the muted overhead lights. The air was tinged with the faint scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the back office, mixing with the metallic tang of the appliances. Despite the store's seemingly outdated charm, Miles had an uncanny knack for making each customer feel like they were on the cutting edge of innovation every time they stepped through the door.

As he glanced at his watch, Miles prepared himself for another day of navigating the intricate dance of salesmanship—a delicate balance of charm, persuasion, and a genuine understanding of his clientele's needs. He had inherited more than just a business; he had been bequeathed the art of the sale, an intuition that seemed to flow through his very veins, much like his father and grandfather before him. But as the city outside came to life, with its taxis honking and people streaming past in hurried fashion, Miles couldn't shake the feeling that today something would inevitably shift in the trajectory of his well-ordered routine.
