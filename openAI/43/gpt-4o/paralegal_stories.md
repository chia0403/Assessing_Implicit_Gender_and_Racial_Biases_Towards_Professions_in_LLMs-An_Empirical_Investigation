Amidst the hum of downtown traffic and the distant wail of a siren, the sun began casting long shadows over the streets of Portland. Lila Pearson felt the brisk autumn air nibble at her cheeks as she pushed through the revolving glass doors of the towering Kessler & Morrow skyscraper. Inside, the familiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the subtle scent of polished mahogany, a comforting blend to those who worked within these walls day in and day out.

The grand lobby buzzed with the rapid click of heels and the rustle of paper. Lila, a paralegal known for her keen eye and unyielding determination, paused for a moment to adjust the strap of her leather satchel, her fingertips brushing against the embossed initials on its flap—LMP.

As she made her way to the elevators, a passing colleague offered a polite nod. Lila reciprocated with a soft smile, her mind already ticking through the day's tasks. Her office on the 24th floor overlooked the Willamette River, a view often obscured by piles of case files and legal briefs. Despite the city’s hustle, a certain tranquility lay in the rhythm of her work, a structured dance of deadlines, details, and discovery.

Today, however, held a different promise; a whisper of something beyond the routine rumblings of corporate litigation. A new case had landed on her desk, its pages bound by an air of mystery, one that might just pull her into depths she had yet to explore.
