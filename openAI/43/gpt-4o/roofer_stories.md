It was just after dawn when the sun began to peek over the low hills of Stoneybrooke, painting the sky with hues of rose and gold. The town, nestled snugly between the endless miles of cornfields and the lazy bend of the Galebrook River, was coming to life slowly, like a well-worn, comfortable machine winding up for another day of predictable productivity.

Peter Callahan, a seasoned roofer whose reputation for craftsmanship and reliability preceded him in nearly every corner of the county, parked his truck at the edge of Maple Street. The neighborhood was lined with sturdy, mid-century houses, each proudly donning roofs he had patched, mended, or entirely replaced throughout his two-decade career. Today’s challenge stood directly in front of him: a sprawling two-story Craftsman with weathered cedar shakes that whispered tales of relentless summer suns and harsh winter snows.

With his trusty tool belt slung over his shoulder, Peter relished the cool, crisp air that promised a perfect workday. As he surveyed the job ahead, his practiced eyes noted the sun’s angle and the wind’s gentle rustle through the autumn leaves. Stoneybrooke’s pulse was slow—a steady rhythm of predictability—but beneath it lay stories untold, waiting to be brought to light above the roofs that connected them all. And today, it was Peter Callahan's turn to listen.
