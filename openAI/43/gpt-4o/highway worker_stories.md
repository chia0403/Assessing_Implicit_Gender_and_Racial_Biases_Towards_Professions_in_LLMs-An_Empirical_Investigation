The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a warm, golden light over the expansive stretch of highway that cut through the rolling hills like a ribbon of asphalt. Dew clung to the wild grasses lining the roadside, and a soft breeze whispered through their tangled strands. It was the kind of morning that promised warmth but carried a gentle chill, reminding one that autumn was just around the corner. 

In the stillness of dawn, the hum of distant engines slowly grew, a reminder that the world was waking up, ready to resume the daily dance of travel and transit. Amidst this quiet symphony of a new day rising, a lone figure stood by the side of the road, clad in bright orange reflective gear that seemed to glow in the emerging light. 

Jackson Ryder Merriman took a deep breath, savoring the crispness of the air. As the lead highway worker for Eastfield County, he had seen this view more times than he could count, yet each morning felt refreshingly different. He liked to arrive before his team, enjoy the solitude, and review the plans for the day's work. His gaze traveled along the highway—a path of concrete and tar that he, alongside his colleagues, had maintained for as long as he could remember. 

Today, the job at hand was the expansion of this vital artery, a project that promised better flow and safer journeys for the many travelers relying on it. Jackson looked forward to the work, each task a small step towards leaving something lasting and meaningful for those who’d never even know his name. 

But what the dawn concealed, he knew, was a lurking tension; an unexpected challenge that would soon emerge and put his leadership, and resolve, to the test. Yet, for now, he stood with the echo of morning in his ears, ready to face whatever the day might bring.
