Dr. Evelyn Carter adjusted the blinds in her cozy, sunlit office, casting soft stripes of light across the polished wooden floor. The room was filled with the gentle aroma of lavender and eucalyptus, mingling with the warmth of freshly brewed coffee from the clinic's shared kitchen. Evelyn took a moment to glance out the window at the bustling streets of Portland, Oregon, where vibrant autumn leaves danced in the crisp October breeze. Her sanctuary—a modest but welcoming space within the Evergreen Rehabilitation Center—was adorned with motivational posters, anatomical charts, and a few thriving potted plants, gifts from grateful patients over the years.

As Evelyn settled into her ergonomic chair, her attention was drawn to the rhythmic ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands inching closer to the start of her first appointment of the day. She quickly scanned her schedule, meticulously organized with colored tabs and notes in delicate script, each representing a new or returning patient ready to embark on their journey to recovery. Evelyn loved this part of her job: meeting people where they were, helping them mend not only their bodies but often their spirits as well.

Today, her first client was a familiar name, someone who had come to trust Evelyn's expertise and compassion through months of rehabilitation. She straightened a few files on her desk, took a calming breath, and prepared to step into her role not only as a physical therapist but as a guide and ally in healing.
