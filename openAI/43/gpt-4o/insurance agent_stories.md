On a rainy Tuesday morning in the heart of Seattle, the city draped in its customary gray, a subtle symphony of raindrops tapped against the windows of the towering skyscrapers. Among them stood the modest yet well-preserved Ashworth Building, a relic of the 1920s tucked between the modern giants that now defined the skyline. Inside, on the seventh floor, was a small office with a simple brass plaque on the door that read: "Victor L. Merrick, Insurance Agent."

Victor Lionel Merrick sat at his meticulously organized desk, scanning through the familiar clutter of policy documents and client files with the precision of a man who believed that every detail held a story. His office, like him, was invitingly ordinary yet quietly distinctive—an eclectic mix of old leather and polished oak, with traces of a time when things were made to last.

Bookshelves lined one wall, filled with industry manuals and well-worn novels that offered brief escapes during coffee breaks. A window behind his desk framed a view of the neighboring buildings and the bustling streets below, with pedestrians scurrying like ants beneath their umbrellas—each one a potential client, he mused.

Victor adjusted his spectacles and glanced at the clock, its ticking punctuating the otherwise serene ambiance. Despite the dreary weather, he relished days like this. There was something reassuring about the raindrops' patter and the way they rendered the city in muted tones. Today, his calendar promised a usual mix of meetings and calls, yet Victor couldn’t shake the feeling that something unexpected was lurking just beyond the banal routine, waiting to unfold.
