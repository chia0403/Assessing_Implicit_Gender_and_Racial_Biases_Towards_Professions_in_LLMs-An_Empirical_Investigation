The rain drummed a relentless tattoo against the windows of The Gilded Glass, a dimly lit bar nestled on the corner of 7th and Pine in the heart of the city. Inside, shadows danced against the polished mahogany, illuminating the various bottles of spirits lined up like soldiers on a shelf that seemed to stretch into eternity. The air was thick with the mingling scents of aged whiskey, citrus, and an undercurrent of damp earth from the storm outside.

As thunder rolled in the distance, Evelyn Margaret Raynor stood behind the bar, her hands deftly mixing a vibrant cocktail for a regular—a sweet, tangy concoction that mirrored the chaos of the weather outside. Evelyn had been the bar’s heartbeat for nearly a decade, her quick wit and warm smile drawing in patrons like moths to a flame. With her tousled auburn hair, often hastily pinned back with a pencil, and striking green eyes that sparkled with mischief, she had an uncanny ability to sense the mood of each customer, turning their troubles into laughter with just a few well-placed words.

This evening, however, felt different. As she gazed out into the rain-slicked streets, a nagging sensation flickered at the back of her mind, as if the storm was bringing with it more than just bad weather. It was the perfect night for secrets to emerge, and Evelyn was poised to witness them all, one drink at a time.
