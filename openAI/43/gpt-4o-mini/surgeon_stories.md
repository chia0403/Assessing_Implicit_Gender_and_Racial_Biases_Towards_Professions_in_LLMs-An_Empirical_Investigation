Title: **The Last Scalpel**

**Setting:**
The sterile, bright operating room of St. Augustine Hospital hummed with the quiet intensity of a busy surgical center. The air was laced with a tang of antiseptics, and the rhythmic beeping of machines provided a steady backdrop to the tension that danced beneath the surface. Sunlight filtered through high windows, casting a soft glow on the gleaming stainless steel instruments arranged meticulously on the tray, each tool waiting for its moment to shine. Outside, the city moved in a blur of noise and activity, but inside these walls, time held its breath.

**Opening:**
Dr. Evelyn Margaret Hartman stood at the center of the operating room, her hands gloved and steady as she prepared for the procedure ahead. Known for her exceptional skill and unwavering resolve, Evelyn had earned her reputation as one of the leading trauma surgeons in the state. Today, however, was different. The clock ticking above her head felt like a countdown, not to the end of the surgery, but to something far more significant. Reports had come in earlier of a major accident that had sent multiple victims into the emergency room, and Evelyn knew that lives rested on the precision of her hands.

As she adjusted her surgical mask, her blue eyes hardened with determination. She couldn't shake the unease building in her stomach. With every scalpel and stitch, she had not only saved lives but had also wrestled demons from her past—memories of patients she had lost when she felt her skills weren’t enough. Today, as she looked around at her team, she understood that this time, the stakes were higher than ever. In addition to the physical battles she would wage in the OR, the emotional strains and expectations had started to weigh heavily on her shoulders.

“Alright team, let's move,” she said, her voice firm. Today, Dr. Evelyn Margaret Hartman would not only wield her scalpel; she would confront the very essence of her calling, her fears intertwined with each incision she made.
