The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting a warm golden light over the rugged cliffs of Elden Valley, where the sound of chiseling echoed like a heartbeat against the silence of the stone. Among the jagged outcrops and the scent of damp earth, a solitary figure worked with relentless focus—Jasper Thorne, master stone cutter. His calloused hands deftly maneuvered a hammer and chisel, each strike resonating with purpose as he shaped the ancient granite into a masterpiece that would soon adorn the grand cathedral at the valley's edge.

Around him, the air vibrated with the promise of evening, as the distant whispers of rivers flowing and leaves rustling filled the space. Jasper’s workshop was a sanctuary carved into the mountainside, adorned with half-finished sculptures and vibrant shards of marble caught in the fading light. Tall, arching pine trees stood vigil like sentinels, framing the entrance to his domain while the last rays of sunlight spilled through the branches overhead.

With each swing of his hammer, Jasper poured his soul into the stone, channeling the tales of his ancestors who had carved out lives from this very earth. He inhaled deeply, tasting the grit and history of the land, unyielding but alive, much like himself. Yet today, beneath the rhythmic cadence of his labor, an unfamiliar tension brewed in his chest—something stirring in the depths of the valley, a change that begged to be unearthed.
