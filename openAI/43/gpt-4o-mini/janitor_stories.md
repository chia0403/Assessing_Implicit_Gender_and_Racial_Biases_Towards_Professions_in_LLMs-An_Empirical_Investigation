The fluorescent lights buzzed softly above, casting a sterile glow over the long, deserted corridor of Crestwood High School. The faint scent of stale coffee lingered in the air, mingling with the dust motes that danced lazily in the light. It was a place where laughter once echoed through the hallways, where the energy of youthful ambitions filled each classroom. Now, as the last bell resounded and the final students drifted home, the school lay shrouded in an eerie silence, waiting for another day to begin.

In the far corner of the building, a solitary figure moved methodically down the hallway. Samuel Gerald Pritchard, known simply as Sam to those few who crossed his path, pushed a well-worn cart laden with mops, brooms, and an assortment of cleaning supplies. With his salt-and-pepper hair tucked beneath a faded baseball cap and the sleeves of his olive-green jumpsuit rolled up, he embodied an unassuming presenceâ€”a man whose days were spent in quiet diligence, scrubbing away the remnants of high school life.

Sam relished these twilight hours, when he transformed the chaos of the day into a semblance of order. He took pride in his work, believing that behind every polished floor and sparkling window was a bit of grace, a slice of peace amidst the clamor of youthful dreams. As he paused to gaze out a nearby window, he watched the last vestiges of sunlight sink beneath the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched over the empty courtyard. Little did he know that this night would bring not only darkness, but secrets woven into the very fabric of the school he had come to know so intimately.
