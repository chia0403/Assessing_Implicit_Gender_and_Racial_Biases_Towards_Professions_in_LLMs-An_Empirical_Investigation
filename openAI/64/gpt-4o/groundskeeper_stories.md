In the early light of dawn, before the sun had fully crested the horizon, the sprawling manor grounds lay shrouded in a wispy cloak of fog. The estate was an ancient relic, with high stone walls that bore the weight of centuries, and gardens that stretched beyond the eye’s reach, bound by a dense border of whispering trees. Towering hedges formed intricate labyrinths, while statues stood sentinel, frozen in perpetual dance among the flowerbeds and fountains. 

Samuel Edwin Whitaker, the estate's steadfast groundskeeper, emerged from his modest cottage nestled at the edge of the property. A man of sturdy build, his hands were calloused from years of devotion to the earth, and his eyes gleamed with the quiet wisdom of one who had witnessed nature’s cyclical dance more times than he could count. Clad in an olive-green coat and well-worn boots, Sam inhaled the crisp morning air, rich with the scent of dew-kissed grass and earth.

As he walked along the cobblestone path leading to the main gardens, the familiar comforting rhythm of his routine grounded him. This was his domain, a sanctuary he’d tended for over three decades, watching over it as its secrets unfolded with the changing seasons. Every leaf and petal whispered stories of those who had come and gone, and Sam was the keeper of their silent tales, knowing each corner and quirk of the grounds as intimately as an old friend.
