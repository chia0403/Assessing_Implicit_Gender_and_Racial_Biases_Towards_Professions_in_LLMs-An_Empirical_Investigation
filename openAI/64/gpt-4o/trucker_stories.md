In the pale light of dawn, the vast expanse of the Mojave Desert stretched outward like a timeless sea, its silence interrupted only by the distant hum of the interstate. Here, amidst the endless sands and jagged ridges of red rock, Amanda "Mandy" Grayson steered her eighteen-wheeler with a practiced hand. The old Kenworth rig, nicknamed "Dust Devil," rumbled along Route 66, cutting a lonely path through the early morning haze.

Mandy, with her sun-bleached blonde hair tucked beneath a worn baseball cap, kept her eyes trained on the horizon. The desert held secrets that whispered in the wind, painting stories of travelers long passed and ventures abandoned. Yet for Mandy, a native of Wichita, Kansas, these roads had become a second home over her ten years of cross-country hauls. Every creak of the truck, every mile marker, felt like a companion during the long, uninterrupted hours of solitude.

Her destination today was a small truck stop in the town of Amboy, a place where time seemed to stand still and memories of the 1950s lingered like the smell of old gasoline. Amboy was nestled in the heart of the desert, a skeletal ghost town hugging the highway, with its iconic Roy's Motel and Café serving as a beacon for weary travelers. Mandy had stopped there many times before, drawn in by the promise of a strong cup of coffee and the stories of strangers. But today, as the rising sun painted the sky in shades of orange and pink, a new chapter was set to unfold—a chapter that would intertwine her fate with the enigmatic vastness of the desert.
