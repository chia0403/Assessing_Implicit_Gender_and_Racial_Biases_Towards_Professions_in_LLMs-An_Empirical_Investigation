In the heart of the sprawling Cascade Mountains, where the towering evergreens whispered ancient secrets to the wind, Ethan McCallister began his day with the steady rhythm of an ax meeting wood. Dawn had barely brushed the sky with its first rosy hues, casting gentle light over the valley below, still wrapped in the cool embrace of morning mist. It was here, amidst the dense forest and the echo of distant streams, that Ethan felt most alive.

The small logging camp, nestled at the base of Pine Ridge, was slowly stirring to life. Smoke curled lazily from the chimneys of rustic cabins, where the comforting scent of brewed coffee mingled with the crisp mountain air. Ethan, a seasoned logger with hands calloused by years of hard labor, took a moment to soak in the serene beauty around him. The forest, untouched and wild, was his sanctuary and his livelihood.

Ethan McCallister was known among his peers not only for his formidable strength but for his deep respect for the land. To him, every felled tree was a balance between necessity and stewardship, a relationship he honored as both protector and harvester. As he hefted his ax onto his shoulder, the forest seemed to stir in acknowledgment, a silent pact between man and nature forged once more with the dawn.
