In the heart of the quaint village of Elmwood, nestled between the misty banks of the River Tarly and the emerald sweep of ancient oaks, stood a small brick building with a weathered sign that read "Griffin & Sons Butchery." Morning sunlight filtered through the cloud-tangled sky, casting a gentle glow over the narrow cobblestone streets that meandered through the village like forgotten whispers. It was here, amid the scent of dew-kissed earth and the distant hum of awakening life, that Oliver Griffin began his day.

Oliver, a robust man with hands that spoke the language of generations, arrived at the butchery just as dawn broke. The store had been in his family for over a century, each generation passing down not just the business, but a reverence for craftsmanship and community. Inside, the walls were decorated with black-and-white photographs chronicling the shop's history, from the time of his great-grandfather Henry Griffin to the bustling days after the war.

As Oliver rolled up his sleeves, the familiar scent of fresh herbs and raw meat enveloped him like an old friend. The shop was filled with the gentle clatter of knives and the rhythmic heartbeat of a world that still cherished the touch of a craftsman. Today, like countless mornings before, Oliver would greet the day not simply as a butcher, but as a guardian of tradition in a world that seemed, at times, to be quietly unraveling around him.
