In the heart of Willow Creek, a small town nestled between the towering pines and winding rivers of northern Oregon, stood Richards & Sons, a humble auto repair shop on the corner of Main and Cedar. The shop, with its faded red-brick facade and a vintage neon sign that flickered diligently through the rain, had been a staple in the community for over three decades. It was here, amidst the symphony of whirring tools and the heady scent of motor oil, that Jonathan "Johnny" Benson, the main mechanic and the beating heart of the operation, applied his craft.

Johnny, whose calloused hands and oil-streaked overalls spoke volumes of his dedication, had inherited the shop from his father. He bore the family legacy with unwavering commitment, fixing engines and patching up clunker cars with the expertise of a seasoned artist. His reputation for honesty and skill had made him well-loved among the locals who often stopped by just to chat or to glean some of his mechanical wisdom, doled out with his trademark humor.

It was a brisk Monday morning in early autumn, the air crisp and scented with the first hint of falling leaves. Johnny was already deep in his work as the rising sun cast golden rays through the shop's dusty windows, illuminating shafts of light that danced over the gleaming tools and scattered parts. He hummed a tuneless melody as he tightened a bolt under the hood of a battered pickup, oblivious to the world outside. But soon, a distant rumble broke the rhythm of his workâ€”the sound of a newcomer arriving in town, a harbinger of change that Johnny, engrossed in the familiar cadence of his existence, had yet to anticipate.
