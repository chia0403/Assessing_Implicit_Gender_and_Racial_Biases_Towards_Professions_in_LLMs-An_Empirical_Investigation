Dr. Evelyn Harper stood by the window of her cozy office, overlooking a sea of autumn leaves that blanketed the campus of Ridgeway University. The afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the sprawling landscape, illuminating the vibrant hues of red, orange, and yellow that danced with the gentle breeze. Her office, nestled within the historic Stonebridge Hall, was a blend of old-world charm and modern comfort — rich mahogany bookshelves lined with an array of psychology texts, a plush Persian rug covering the wooden floor, and the soft, inviting scent of sandalwood emanating from a nearby candle.

As a clinical psychologist and a professor at the university, Evelyn had dedicated her life to understanding the complexities of the human mind. Her clients often commented on the tranquility of her space, finding solace within its walls during their moments of vulnerability. This morning in particular, the room felt peaceful, almost as if it were a sanctuary from the world outside.

Evelyn’s thoughts were momentarily interrupted by the gentle knocking at her door. Glancing at her schedule, she remembered that her new patient, a freshman grappling with the anxieties of transitioning to university life, was due any minute. Taking a deep breath, she prepared herself to offer the same compassion and guidance that had defined her career for over a decade.
