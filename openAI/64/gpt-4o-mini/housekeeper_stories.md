Title: **Whispers in the Manor**

Setting: The grand Ashwood Manor stood at the edge of a sprawling, mist-laden estate, its Gothic spires piercing the slate-gray sky like solemn fingers reaching for the heavens. Ivy clung to the crumbling stone walls, and the garden, once a vibrant tapestry of colors, now lay in a faded slumber, the roses tangled and wild. Inside, the polished hardwood floors echoed with the whispers of past glories, long oil paintings of ancestral faces gazing down from their frames, their eyes seeming to follow the steps of anyone who dared to wander the shadowy halls.

**Opening:**

As the first light of dawn crept through the heavy drapes of the east wing, Eleanor Maureen Wright stood on the threshold of the grand parlor, the chill of the morning air sending a shiver down her spine. She adjusted her plain brown apron, the fabric worn from years of use, and took a moment to breathe in the scent of aged wood and the lingering aroma of the night’s fading rain. With a gentle tug, she opened the door wide, revealing the dust motes dancing lazily in the filtered light.

Eleanor had spent nearly a decade tending to Ashwood Manor, a labyrinth of secrets and memories that felt more like a living entity than mere bricks and mortar. Each day, she maneuvered through its sorrowful creaks and whispered tales, a steadfast presence among the fading echoes of laughter and the specters of family feuds long since buried.

But today, there was an electric charge in the air, a feeling that something monumental was on the cusp of unfolding in the hallowed halls of the manor. As she gathered her supplies—a worn rag and a modest bucket—Eleanor allowed herself a rare moment of curiosity. What stories would this day unfurl? Little did she know that the manor held its own agenda, one that would entwine her fate with the age-old mysteries hidden within its walls.
