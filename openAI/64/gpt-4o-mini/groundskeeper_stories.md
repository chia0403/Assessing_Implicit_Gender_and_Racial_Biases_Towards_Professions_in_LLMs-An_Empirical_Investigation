The sun hung low in the autumn sky, casting a warm golden hue over the sprawling grounds of Hawthorne Estate. The estate, renowned for its centuries-old oak trees and meticulously manicured gardens, was a tapestry of vibrant reds, deep oranges, and hints of fading green, each leaf whispering stories of seasons past. The air was crisp, infused with the earthy scent of fallen leaves and the distant sound of birds preparing for migration.

In the midst of this picturesque scenery was Edgar Thornton, the estate’s solitary groundskeeper. Clad in worn denim overalls and a thick plaid flannel shirt, he had a weathered face that bespoke years of toiling under the sun and rain. His hands, calloused and sturdy, moved with the rhythm of familiarity as he gathered the leaves, each one a testament to a summer long gone.

Though he worked in silence, Edgar possessed a keen observational eye. With every snip of his pruning shears, he noticed the subtle changes around him—how the light shifted through the branches, the whispers of the wind, and the quiet secrets buried beneath the soil. To most, the grounds were mere property; to Edgar, they were a living, breathing entity, a sanctuary where he found solace after the death of his wife the previous spring. He had been caretaker to the estate long before he buried his beloved Eleanor in the secluded glade lined with lilacs, but now, every corner of the grounds reminded him of their shared laughter and late-night star-gazing.

As he paused to wipe the sweat from his brow, Edgar glanced towards the old stone fountain at the heart of the gardens, its water gurgling softly. It was a place of memories, and today the leaves danced around it like specters beckoning him closer. Deep within him stirred a sensation that perhaps it was time to confront the echoes of his past, to find a way forward amid the beautiful decay of autumn.
