Title: **Echoes of Yesterday**

Setting: The small coastal town of Alderwick, known for its rugged cliffs, crashing waves, and a lighthouse that has stood sentinel for over a century. The air is thick with the scent of salt and pine, mingling with the sounds of seagulls and the distant roar of the ocean. Within the heart of Alderwick, nestled between a quaint coffee shop and a local bookstore, is a charming brick building that houses the Alderwick Psychological Counseling Center. The interior is cozy, filled with soft lighting, warm earth tones, and the comforting hum of a water fountain in the corner.

Character Introduction: Dr. Evelyn Harper, a seasoned counseling psychologist in her late thirties, stands before the large windows of her office, watching the waves crash against the cliffs. With her wavy chestnut hair pulled back in a loose bun and round glasses perched on her nose, she embodies a blend of warmth and professionalism. Clad in a soft blue cardigan and comfortable jeans, Dr. Harper has a penchant for creating a welcoming environment for her clients, filled with plants and books that see both the beauty and complexity of human emotion.

Opening: 

The morning sun filtered through the clouds, casting a gentle glow over the lighthouse that loomed at the edge of Alderwick, as Dr. Evelyn Harper prepared for another day of listening. She leaned against her desk, coffee in hand, glancing at the framed photographs of her family that lined the shelf. Each image was a reminder of laughter, of shared memories, and of resilience—the very themes that colored her work as a counselor. 

Evelyn had spent years navigating the intricate threads of human experience, helping her clients unravel their stories—some heavy with grief, others bustling with the excitement of new beginnings. Today was no different, yet there was something in the air, a subtle shift that ignited her curiosity. Just as she took a sip of her coffee, the doorbell chimed, announcing the arrival of her first client.

With a deep breath, she set down her mug, adjusting her glasses. As the door swung open, Evelyn was met by a familiar face, yet today, the shadow of something unspoken dulled the brightness in those eyes. "Good morning, Jessie," she greeted, a warm smile forming on her lips. "Shall we talk?" 

As they settled into their session, the crashing waves outside mirrored the turmoil within the walls of Evelyn's counseling room. Little did she know, today would unearth more than just one story; it would unravel the threads binding her own past to the present in ways she never anticipated.
