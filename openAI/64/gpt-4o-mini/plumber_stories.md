**Title: Beneath the Surface**

**Setting:** The small, aging town of Maplewood, nestled between rolling hills and lush forests. The streets are lined with quaint brick houses, their front yards dotted with wildflowers and the occasional garden gnome. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth after an early morning rainfall. In the center of town stands an old water tower, its faded blue paint a testament to years gone by. Shops and cafes bustle with the warmth of the locals, but a sense of unease hangs in the air—rumors have spread of strange occurrences beneath the town, tales of haunting sounds and disrupted water flows.

**Opening:**

Benjamin Clyde, a 37-year-old plumber with a scruffy beard and a perpetually worn baseball cap, slid out from beneath the sink of yet another custom vintage home. Maplewood was known for its character, but character had its drawbacks—especially for pipes that had seen better days. With a wrench in one hand and a flashlight in the other, he squinted at the tangled mess of corroded pipes, frustration bubbling up like the water gushing from the recently ruptured line.

Just this morning, he'd received a call from Mrs. Hargrove, a sweet elderly lady who insisted that her kitchen was "haunted." According to her, the faucet turned on by itself at odd hours, and the pipes groaned like an old man lamenting lost time. While Benjamin loved a good ghost story, he wasn’t sure a spectral presence could account for the mess in front of him.

He shoved the wrench into his back pocket, slid his flashlight into the other, and leaned closer into the cramped space, wiping sweat from his brow. “A pipe is only haunted if it’s got a leak,” he muttered to himself, chuckling softly. Little did he know that as he twisted the wrench with growing determination, the heartbeat of the town would soon reveal secrets that had been buried—both in its plumbing and its past.
