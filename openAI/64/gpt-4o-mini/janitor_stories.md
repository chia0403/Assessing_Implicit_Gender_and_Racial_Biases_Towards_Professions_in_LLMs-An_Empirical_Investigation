The fluorescent lights flickered overhead in the almost deserted halls of Hargrove High School as the last bell echoed through the empty corridors. It was a late Friday afternoon in early September, and the air was thick with the smell of old paper and freshly polished linoleum. Lockers, some adorned with fading stickers, stood like sentinels on either side of the hall, and lingering traces of laughter and chatter could still be felt in the atmosphere, ghostly remnants from earlier that day.

In the far corner of the school, where the echo of footsteps barely reached, a solitary figure moved methodically, broom in hand. This was Clyde Benjamin Williams, a janitor with calloused hands and a heart full of stories. He had worked at Hargrove High for nearly a decade, sweeping away not just dust and debris, but also the weight of a heavier life outside these walls. Clyde's sturdy frame was draped in the familiar blue jumpsuit that had seen better days, and his old sneakers creaked softly as he swept the hallway with a rhythm that had almost become a part of the building itself.

As the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting elongated shadows that danced across the floor, Clyde paused, leaning against the broom handle for a moment of respite. He watched the last rays of sunlight filter in through the high windows, igniting the dust motes in the air and bathing the hallway in a warm golden glow. With a deep breath, he allowed himself to relish the stillness, a sharp contrast to the bustling world beyond the walls he tended. In this solitude, surrounded by the echoes of youthful dreams and forgotten memories, Clyde Benjamin Williams found a peculiar kind of peace.
