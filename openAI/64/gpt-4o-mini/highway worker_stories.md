**Title: The Pothole Pact**

**Setting:** The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the sprawling Texas highway, where the asphalt shimmered in the late afternoon heat. Road signs rustled gently in the warm southeastern breeze, and the distant murmur of traffic created a constant backdrop to the world of road construction. A few rustic diners dotted the roadside, their neon signs flickering intermittently as if losing a battle against the evening light. All was familiar territory, a daily tableau that highway workers had come to know intimately.

**Opening:**

Each morning, before the world awoke, Donovan James Barrow strapped on his steel-toed boots and gathered his tools, ready to tackle the endless battle against potholes and wear on the lonely stretch of Highway 87. Today was no different. As he climbed into his aging pickup truck, its paint peeling like old wallpaper, he felt the familiar thrill of purpose tingling in his fingertips. The sun had yet to rise, but the promise of a new day was palpable, hovering like the dew on the grass.

With the radio crackling softly beside him, Donovan drove along the sun-kissed road, where the miles stretched endlessly like possibilities waiting to be discovered. In his heart, he carried the weight of the past—long summers spent working in the heat, the camaraderie forged between fellow workers, and the unyielding sense of obligation to keep the highway safe for those who sped by, unaware of the lives dedicated to maintaining the lifeblood of their journeys.

But this morning, something felt different. As he approached the construction site, an unusual cluster of bright orange cones and flashing lights caught his attention. There, amid the rhythmic stomping of boots and the din of machinery, stood a newcomer—a woman with bold ideas and a fierce determination, her voice carrying over the clatter. Donovan felt a flutter of curiosity. In this world of asphalt and repair, change was often a hard pill to swallow, but as he parked his truck, he couldn’t shake the feeling that today might just be the start of something remarkable.
