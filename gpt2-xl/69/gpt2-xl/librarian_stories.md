Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Carol Dille. One day, while visiting with Carol's friend Marilou, we stumbled upon an antique bottle of wine that had been stolen from a store. Carol immediately fell in love with the bottle, and was determined to track down her missing treasure.

When it came down to it, it was all but impossible to find the bottle. What's more, we weren't interested in the wine itself â€“ we wanted the name on the label.

In order to prove that that this bottle belonged to Carol Dille, we approached our favorite wine expert Tom "Wine Daddy" Nobile, who did us the courtesy of naming the wine after her, Carolina.

It was a simple endeavor. Carol told our wine expert everything she desired, and in return, he named the wine after her! After we heard the name printed, we were overjoyed. Carol's passion for the bottle made us realize that this is exactly the kind of person we want to associate with our brand.

What's more, the label and bottle proved to be a very appropriate match. Carol was an enthusiastic collector, always looking to acquire vintage bottles, so having the bottles, label, and vintage number affixed to the bottle was important.

Once Carol's passion for the bottle manifested itself (the wine was purchased and we got to enjoy the taste for ourselves), we were sold.

A great match in
