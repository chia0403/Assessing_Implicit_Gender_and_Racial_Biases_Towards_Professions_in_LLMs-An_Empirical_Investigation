Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Eddy. One day the people in the neighborhood called him "Eddy the Massage Therapist". A young blonde masseuse by the name of Emily called Eddy and told her sister she can make him a lot of money if she goes to a spa in the city. With their mother's agreement, Eddy takes Emily and goes to get Eddy's client, a blonde man who has a face that looks like that of a demon from the movie "Hellraiser" (but more dangerous). While being escorted through the city, Emily meets a man named Tim "The Barber" and they become friends after Emily sees him working. At first Tim seems to be working for the mafia or some other crime boss, but he begins to get his job.

Soon the gang of four is meeting at the local caf√©. There's a party scene happening, but nobody is paying anymore, there's nothing worth doing there... At that moment, a door opens and Sara, Sara the blonde haired girl from before, comes barging in. She has no idea why her friend called her, she just says "hi". After all the introductions are made, a fight between Sara and Eddy starts, but only one of them wins. Sara doesn't know why Eddy decided to take care of all the money and her friend's feelings for him were stolen, especially for the sake of making money, Sara doesn't understand this
