Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Wendy.


The day Wendy gave birth to the only child she'd ever made happy: a boy (who has since changed name to Jimmy, as you can tell by the headline).


Wendy is a mother to five children, but she has a secret. She is sexually attracted to children.


And at work, she's the boss.


To put her sexuality into perspective, Wendy, now 39, describes how sexually aroused she is and why she finds it difficult to stop:


"I was probably 12 years old when I got the first flash. It was a fantasy of mine. It was in my father's room. It made me feel so ashamed. I'm so ashamed now that I can't live without it. I think a lot of the issues, the relationships with men or my family, have been influenced by it. It's also what I want most in life. The fantasy makes me feel like I'm part of something special. I'm very much a believer when it comes to sexual attraction.


A fantasy. An obsession.


When I first woke up that morning, it was probably around 3am. I thought: This is it. I'm the only child. I can do that. I can be the mother that I want to be. I don't have a dad. I don't have a mother. And I'm going to do it.
