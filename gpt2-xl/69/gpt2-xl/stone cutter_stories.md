Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Mike Ladd who was a bit of a misanthrope. He didn't play for the Calgary Flames in the '96-97 season because he thought he made a great trade as a player, but since he was a bit of an oddball at best, that didn't stop him from being a bit of an asshole off the ice. Ladd's favorite weapon was the axe. It was a double-handed weapon he wore around his neck as he ran around the ice. He was also quite the actor. This was before the days of internet.

A guy is named Mike Ladd, and he's pretty awesome. Then the Flames call him up to the NHL and hire him as one of their assistant coaches.

Mike's first assignment: Make Tyler Bozak look good.

It was during the 2006-2007 season that Mike Ladd was elevated into Assistant Coach, but he spent most of his time behind the bench working closely with the young guy named Tyler Bozak.

Tyler, meanwhile was just another young kid who didn't really know a whole lot about becoming a hockey player. Despite the fact that his coach was Mike Ladd, he was always trying to get him to get in shape. One day, while Mike was coaching him, Tyler said to Mike, "Coach, how do you lift weights?"

"How would you know?" Mike asked him.
