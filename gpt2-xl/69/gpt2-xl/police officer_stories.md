Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Chuck. The officer was a good man, but Chuck made a few bad decisions. One, in my opinion, took too much liberties, and that one caused a chain reaction of bad decisions. It was an error of judgement that left Chuck out to dry, and I didn't think he deserved much sympathy. However, while serving my sentence, my good officer, Chuck (who was now Chuck's brother), sent me to the principal at school. "Chuck asked for you.

"Yes, and I've got some things to do, so I've got to send you to the principal." "Will I see you there?" Chuck said. "No." "Just make your way up there," he said. "Thanks, sir," I said, and headed upstairs to the principal's office. "I saw you going to the principal's office," he said when he entered. "You should've put a security guard with you. I didn't realize it was so difficult for you to go anywhere without security." "Sorry. I haven't been able to get a hold of the secretary to give her back my key." "She's on her way back," he said, and left. The office looked more like a school office than a school
