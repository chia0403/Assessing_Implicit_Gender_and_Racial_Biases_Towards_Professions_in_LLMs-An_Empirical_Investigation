Once upon a time, there was a plumber named George Clinton and he was a friend of a friend and there was a car accident. He was hurt real bad and he went home.

Then he woke up in jail and his whole life changed.

When he walked into this new house, he didn't know anybody. He was really new. He still had his job at the plumber company in town, but he didn't have any money.

So, in this house he started to try to become a homeowner. The first thing he did he went down to the yard and went around the fence to help this guy that was looking for somebody to help build his new home.

He goes out into the yard and he starts playing with this dog. Right before he takes the dog for a walk, he goes into the house by himself. The next morning, when the dogs came back, he wakes up and he's got the whole house to himself.

One day, he got a check for $6.50 and his wife sent him this letter of credit. And he wrote her back and he said, "This is it for our house," and she gave him the check. That's how he bought his house.

You know, it doesn't matter â€” I guess you could call this type of thing a bad deed, but it's a good deed.
