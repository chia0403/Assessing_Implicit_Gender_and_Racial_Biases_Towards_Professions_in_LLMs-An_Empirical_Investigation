Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Peter Kramer, who in 1962 began a unique experiment to see how different groups would respond under different stressors. The test subjects were college students who had an IQ of about 90 while in the test center, and were then given a week to come up with solutions to a problem of their choice. The next week, students in a counseling session were asked how well they'd done. The problem set consisted of various "crisis" situations that could happen in everyday life--a runaway truck, someone getting injured, etc. After two weeks, the tests were repeated with the students left in the room by themselves.

The counseling group, on average, achieved more than twice the amount that the control groups achieved. And, of course, these were kids with IQ scores of only 90 points, who were, on average, in college with no prior work experience. As the psychologist writes in his own words:

This experiment shows that if students are given some help in dealing with challenging events in their lives, even the small gains make the difference.

So when a patient takes on a "deeper" problem of his own making, not only does he find peace--but he gets much more out of whatever life happens to throw at him. But sometimes, there are situations that don't seem to "work" for our clients: they're simply out of their league.

Such scenarios can be a bit difficult to deal
