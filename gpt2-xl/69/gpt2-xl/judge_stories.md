Once upon a time, there was a judge named John Loughlin in Los Angeles. He used to be in the game, and he was a big part of boxing. But now, he's all outta business, and you need somebody in it to stop the people, or make sure that they don't get anybody else in trouble. I guess I had someone to look after me at the time. You don't know much about the business, but I know where to find somebody when I need somebody. I had that thing on the top of the house, and I kept a little gun that I kept there. Then I'd have a little cigar, I'd light it and I'd smoke it. Then I'd get some dope, and I'd take it all down to the house. When I got the dope, then I'd call for a hooker. The hookers would walk up to the house with dope and give me back the money. They'd give me money so I wouldn't have to leave so much on the corner. I'd sell my dope for less than what I was making for the girls. So I got a lot of money."

So that's John Loughlin.

He was one of Lillo's bosses in boxing.

"Lillo used to make all the decisions," Eddie said. "Hustlin' was like a partnership, you know, to Lillo as well as to the fighters."
