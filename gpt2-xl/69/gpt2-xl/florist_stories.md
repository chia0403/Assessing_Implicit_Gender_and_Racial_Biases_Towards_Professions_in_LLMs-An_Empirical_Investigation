Once upon a time, there was a florist named Carol Satterfield – who you saw in this episode – who went out into the world and made people happy to the point where they would hire her to do Christmas deliveries for them, just to keep up with her customers' demand. When she tried to go out into the world, she didn't stand a chance against the forces of corporate fascism. But at the end of the episode, her boss gets her back on the job on a new job, where she is no longer at the whim of some faceless boss.

Pierce Hawthorne and his wife Elizabeth have both been affected by this change that has been imposed on them. When he tried to get her back to work, he was told she and the store are only going to be open for one day a week, and that the reason for not accepting his request was that he was "not a reliable employee." That's right – he's only an employee because of how the corporate world treats him.
