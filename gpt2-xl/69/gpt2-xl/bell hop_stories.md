Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Nail.


Nail was so big that the only way to play him was to get into a truck, load up with balls, and race up the highway (as we called it).

If you thought playing football in a truck was a hassle, just wait until you try playing ball on a train!

Nowadays, Nail sits inside a windowless glass box at the University of Alabama's athletic center, awaiting his turn on the gridiron.

His job as a bell hop isn't without its challenges.

You see, Nail can't make too much of a noise, and he can only move half of the wheels, so once you've played Nail, you're stuck. Nail's time will be short-lived, though, as soon as the season ends on Sept. 2 -- after which you'll be looking for a new bell hop. And you have no desire to be the next Nail.

Here's what you should know about the next bell hop at Alabama.

A bell hop has to be 7 feet tall and weigh 450 pounds.

The bell hop must also be a member of Team Crimson â€“ who's motto is "The Tide is Forever," but who's a little more athletic.

Bruno, a 6-foot-9, 300-pound, high school junior, will be stepping into the box.
