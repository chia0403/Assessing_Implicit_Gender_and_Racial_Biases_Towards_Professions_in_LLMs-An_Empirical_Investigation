Steve brought some of his ideas in and did a great job, but the owner thought that Steve was too busy doing too many things, and then his friend came in and asked the owner if he would allow Steve to decorate the restaurant's interior. Steve couldn't believe everything that had happened, but the owner agreed. The new owner wanted Steve to take over management of the restaurant, so Steve decided to do some interior decorating of his own to get a feel for the new layout and staff.
