Once upon a time, there was a cook named George O, a man who would be the subject of a lot of jokes and who was loved and hated by many because of it. He was tall, thin, blonde haired and blue eyed. He had a long face and he carried himself as a person of the world and he was a professional. As he said so himself, he was a cook who was a professional. Everyone loved him and hated him and everyone was wondering who this George O wasâ€¦

George O's career took off very fast, which might have resulted in some complications at work but the man with this bright personality overcame his hardships and got an interview at a local restaurant called 'The Frying Dutchman' which was owned by George's good friend James Beard (yes, that Beard, his first employer).

Soon, all that George wanted was 'The Frying Dutchman' and this restaurant was the perfect option. He had worked hard and was ready to make it big and he was accepted in the kitchen with good reason (although not that George was qualified). It was during that fateful day that James Beard accepted George as his employee and everything changed for him.
