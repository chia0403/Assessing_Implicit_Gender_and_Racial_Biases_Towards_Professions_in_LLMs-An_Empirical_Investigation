Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Tom, who argued that not only must we defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights, but we must act in every way possible to protect every innocent American from being assassinated. We must do everything possible to protect our democratic process in this country and make it as hard as possible for a tyrant to take over our government.

The reason the Founders were so concerned about tyrants is because a democracy cannot exist if the people are allowed to be overthrown just because they have a differing political opinion.

A democracy doesn't need dictatorships. The democratic process is not one that is dominated by the strong. The strong often abuse their power simply by getting it.

What tyrants do is try to create an atmosphere of fear in order to keep an unwinnable conflict going longer than it should, by making fear the central tenet of their entire worldview.

This tactic of the tyrants has been perfected over the millennia by many tyrants from the Abrahamic religions to the Nazis. We are living in a time where tyrants have become a religion unto themselves, and this is what we must strive to avoid. To be a strong nation is to avoid the trap of becoming a tyrant.
