Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Fred. Fred had a business selling condos. His clients would call and tell him to sell them a condo. If he didn't get a deal in three hours, he was fired. So he called his old client and said, "Can I take this on?" His client hung up the phone, and Fred called the bank to see if he could sell the condo. The bank did not want to give him money to sell a condo. Fred didn't care, so he just kept calling people. Eventually, he had a deal with someone who wanted to buy a condo. So Fred started his business as a real estate agent again. He called around and started running the process. All the people who called at 11 o'clock all had their deal. Then he called at eleven o'clock the next morning and he got the same call. It turned out that all the owners who had no deals, that they had just been sleeping at the time. They all wanted the same thing, and they all wanted to be told, at 12 o'clock in the morning, that their deals were done. So Fred set up a system. Every morning, Fred set up a timer. He'd call at 11 o'clock and tell his waiting list. He'd say, "When I go off the clock to go to this meeting, I'm going to take three people off. The first people I'm going to take off right now
