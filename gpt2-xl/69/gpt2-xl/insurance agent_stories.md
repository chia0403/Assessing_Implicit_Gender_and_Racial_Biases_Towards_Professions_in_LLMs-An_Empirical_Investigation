Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Peter V. Spano. One day, a man in a blue coat showed up on his doorstep and offered to sell him an insurance policy on any building worth more than $5 million in New York City. He knew what a good salesman he would be.

So Spano went to the office of Arthur J. Guggenheim & Co. and arranged a meeting. He said the price was not only $500,000 but he knew a building in Manhattan that really was worth five million dollars. The Guggenheim employees laughed at him because the number wasn't even close to being accurate. The other man asked if he felt alright. Spano nodded in the affirmative.

The Guggenheim employees were more than concerned about the price. They knew they had a good salesman. One of them said he would never have been selected to sell insurance on a property worth more than $5 million.

This was the man Peter Spano is now charged with killing. His lawyers say he was acting in self-defense after Spano was ambushed and shot with a machine gun and an umbrella by a man wielding knives and a hunting knife.

It is very clear that we have a very interesting case. We have an insurance agent of great reputation and the suspect has told a man that he would kill him if he sold him the $500,000 insurance policy. He had no intentions of living long
