However, by creating "mirror illusions" of himself (this came in handy later on when he was getting out of a taxi cab full of drunken fans), Lorre was able to recreate his appearance and create a whole new world of art inside of himself. (Well, except for the part where he got his ass kicked by the other patrons of the cab, but that was a separate issue.)
