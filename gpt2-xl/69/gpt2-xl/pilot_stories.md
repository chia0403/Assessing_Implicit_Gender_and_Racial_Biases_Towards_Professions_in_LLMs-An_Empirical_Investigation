Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Ted who made a deal with the devil for a very special gift: a second chance at life...or so he thought. Now, a reformed pilot named Ted is on a quest for the source of a deadly chemical that may be about to cripple the world's economy...but the problem is that a dangerous fugitive is after it, too. Could there really be another chance for Ted to live a normal life? And if there is, would the devil be able to help him? Written by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment
