Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Dave who cleaned the office's floors. One day, he accidentally knocked a lamp out of a lamp stand. No lamp, no ceiling. With his bare hands, he picked himself up the lamp and found a note taped to the lamp, saying, "This isn't the last time I take the lamp." With a slight smirk, he returned the lamp to his desk and shut it off.

That lamp was the only lamp in Dave's entire life. For the rest of his days, whenever the office had to do any heavy cleaning, Dave simply had to pick up the lamp once then place it back where it was.

Not one of Dave's assistants would do anything to help him unless he explicitly asked them, even then they would hesitate. He didn't care if they hated him and felt sorry for him. With a smile on his face, Dave would casually leave his empty office for the night.

When Dave came into work the next morning, he picked up the lamp and sat on the chair like a proud father, and proceeded to do his job of cleaning the office floor.

At the end of the day, the office clerk went to Dave asking if everything was okay. She said sure, we all cleaned the desk this morning, but I still can't figure out where the lamp went! Dave just looked at her in confusion, saying, well, where did you go? The clerk shrugged
