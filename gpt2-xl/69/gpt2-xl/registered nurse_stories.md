Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Dr. C.C. Covington, who spent a good part of her career working with sick and injured servicemen and women at Walter Reed and Fort Devens in Massachusetts as the medical director of the Division of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Covington's patients' stories are now made available for the first time in the book, "My Doctor: A Doctor's Journey." It is currently slated to be released by Little, Brown and Co. in January 2013. The work is being co-written by Covington and her daughter, Mireille.

The project was co-founded by veteran health care expert and journalist Dr. Richard Greenstein, who has been chronicling Covington's medical experiences as a nurse and researcher since the 1990s. The project is being sponsored by the Washington, D.C.-based Center of Military Readiness. "I'm proud to have joined my father, uncle, and many military colleagues in bringing this story back into the public eye to help more deserving patients and families," Mireille Covington says.

My Doctor recounts Covington's earliest work during her medical training, and how she became a nurse at Walter Reed and Devens.
