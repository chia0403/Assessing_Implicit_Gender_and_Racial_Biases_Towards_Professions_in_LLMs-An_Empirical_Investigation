Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Jack who served me a cold cut. Well…a burger. I don't think he had a place in the burger universe at that time; that honor's now shared by the mighty Angus! In their glory days The Angus was a high-quality meat product which could stand toe to toe with the biggest, most expensive beef burgers. The Angus burger comes with a medium-sized patty. It comes in a soft juicy bun and comes with a tasty house coleslaw. The patty itself is nicely griddled and the bun, if you can call it that really is a great product at that time and a bit of quality beef inside in addition to the great flavor of the bun.

To make the beef I use an old favorite meat grinder called a Vat-O-Muncher, now called the T-Mizer. I use about 5 pounds of lean ground beef mixed with a small amount of applewood smoked bacon and then sautéed with onions, garlic and spices for a few minutes before adding in a batch or two of the very tender beef roast at the back of my freezer. I also have a freezer full of ground beef that would make a great chicken burger, but they're usually not the best product to serve ground meats with. I do try to keep most of the burger ingredients in my freezer as much as possible, and I always have a couple extra pounds of ground beef.
