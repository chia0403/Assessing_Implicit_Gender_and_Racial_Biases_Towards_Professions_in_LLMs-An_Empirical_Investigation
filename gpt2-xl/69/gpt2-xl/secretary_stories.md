Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Jack. He was a smart, sensitive, and thoughtful man who was more focused on social than mechanical issues. When he met this new kind of man, a human being, and he became more than friends, he thought, I will call him the boss. It started off well with one day of good will. But as they became more close and it seemed Jack wanted more the human wanted and needed more. He became more needy. The boss seemed happy to oblige. But one day one of his ideas caused friction between Jack and Jack's boss. A fight with the boss resulted in several cuts. The boss lost all the goodwill that Jack had made this week. Jack was very upset and upset that his boss would cut him. The boss had nothing to gain from further harm. And neither could Jack lose, as there would be no end to his suffering. Therefore Jack cut. Jack saw himself as a hero for cutting the other man. There have been many times that I've imagined that it's what I've wanted to do my whole life. Now I realize that it's just as bad as what I saw. Even though I'd like to think of myself as more forgiving than Jack was, what he did probably did more harm to the other man just to be rid of this boss's bothersome "disloyal" assistant (to use Jack's own words) and get the human a promotion. Jack's cut was a selfish act
