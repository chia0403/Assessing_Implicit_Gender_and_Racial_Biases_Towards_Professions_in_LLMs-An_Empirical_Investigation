Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Emily who said she worked seven days-a-week. She didn't tell her co-worker Elizabeth that this was happening, and neither did Elizabeth. It was just the way she went and she enjoyed doing it, too. Elizabeth made a habit of being more than a bit late coming into work. Because that was the story.

"I worked so much that morning that I ended up leaving my coat at Emily's office!"

"That bitch Emily was just so mad at me from the moment I opened my eyes," said Elizabeth. "One morning I woke up thinking I looked awful, but I opened my eyes and had a face full of tears. Emily was waiting for me in the doorway in her dress. She was so furious and I could tell it was on her mind even before the tears started. And she wasn't waiting for me to finish. She asked me why I hadn't yet come in. She was angry and upset and told me I looked awful. I worked so much that morning that I ended up leaving my coat at Emily, and she didn't give it back!"

No. No, that wasn't what she said.

"I ran downstairs a minute after I got into my dress to see what the problem was, and there was Emily with the coat in her hand. When I approached her I saw that she was angry. I realized I'd been late to work again
