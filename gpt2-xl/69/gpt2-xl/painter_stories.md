Once upon a time, there was a painter named Vincent van Gogh. He had a passion for painting miniatures with human figures. In 1888, van Gogh painted a series of paintings with his friend, Carl Theodor Dreyer. Dreyer died shortly after the painting's completion, and so was never given the opportunity to see van Gogh's masterpiece in the flesh. This is the most detailed rendering of van Gogh's "Starry Night" yet, creating a unique study in van Gogh's talent and style.
