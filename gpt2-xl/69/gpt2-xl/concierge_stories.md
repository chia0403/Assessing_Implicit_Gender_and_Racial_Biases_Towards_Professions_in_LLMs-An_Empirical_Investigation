Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Lachlan "the Lizzie" Biddleley, with the last name "Jolly". One day, with an empty hand, the concierge opened a door from a neighbouring room and called for a woman's purse, but the item was not there. He then searched the room (a room so big nobody could have possibly used it) and found another empty hand, opening the door from the room above and calling for a woman's purse, but this item had vanished as well. Not to mention Lachlan having the ability to read people's minds and see the future. He also had an ability to teleport. Lachlan's abilities were so impressive that when he died, his body disappeared and disappeared without a trace and was never found.

He was a great thief, but he never went up against the mafia because a hit on the mafia would be too risky. So Lachlan took care of all his own personal needs and never bothered anyone else, for he knew that the mafia would take him out if he had any enemies in the business. In return, he agreed to do his mother's laundry when she came to visit him. Although it was his own laundry, the amount of money and items he stole was unbelievable. Lachlan was once asked to do his mother's laundry for a fee, but due to his luck, she insisted that Lachlan should take care of the laundry
