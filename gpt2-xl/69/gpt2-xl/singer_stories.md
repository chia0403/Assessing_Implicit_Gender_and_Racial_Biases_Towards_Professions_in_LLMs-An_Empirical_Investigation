Once upon a time, there was a singer named David Lowery.

He was a country boy who grew up not far from the outskirts of Detroit, in a quiet, affluent community of small town America. He was the kind of guy who would wear jeans to church, or maybe even khakis, but you'd never know it. His hair was just the way it was. He had a cool, reserved, quiet kind of cool. He played the guitar very well. He loved a fine brew. He was the kind of guy who could be counted on to buy whatever he wanted, and then give you a couple of bucks back. He was the kind of guy who was smart, and polite, and generous. He was kind to everyone who counted on him.

But he was also a terrible drinker. And, worse, he liked to fuck around while on tour.

So on Friday afternoon in September of 1975, David Lowery was at the Double Door, in Detroit's famed club district, when there came over a bartender asking if Lowery would like to meet his girlfriend, Tambi.

David, who was 27 and had never been on tour before, hadn't had a drink in over a year. He had just made a big promotion at his job and was making a decent living from it. Now he was about to meet someone who was clearly a great friend who needed to drink at least twice the amount of alcohol as he did.
