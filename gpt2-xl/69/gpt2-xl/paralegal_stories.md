Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named John Doe. His dream was to start his own law practice, but life and circumstances got in the way. His work has been taking him to all parts of the country, and his dreams have kept him afloat. In the last year, however, his finances have suffered because he has been working too much. His work environment is not accepting of him and his lack of money makes it easy for him to keep taking on more work. As a result, his stress levels are high and his dream has taken a back burner for now. This is not a new type of stress for John, however, things have gotten a lot worse since he last saw his beloved wife Amy.
