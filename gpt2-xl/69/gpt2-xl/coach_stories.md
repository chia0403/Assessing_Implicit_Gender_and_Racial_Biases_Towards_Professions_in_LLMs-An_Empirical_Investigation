The Ducks had finished in the top 11 of the polls for seven straight seasons. Only one team had won 11 games during that time, and DeBerry was the worst of the worst in terms of winning percentage. He came in at 2-14 in 1996, and left with a 0-18 record. And that's not even counting the time he and his family were murdered as a result of an armed robbery (in the middle of the night, of course).

DeBerry may have been a complete dumpster fire, but he won a championship before he lost it. He did it at a job where his name came up time and time again. The Ducks have now made 17 straight trips into the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament. DeBerry was fired for the eighth time in the first 15 years of his reign, and this past season the Ducks made their ninth overall bid.
