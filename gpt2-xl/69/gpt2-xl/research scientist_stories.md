Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Robert Greenburg who went to a high school in Kansas. He had a problem-solving problem, which he solved by thinking about the nature of the problem. In a short time, he discovered a new and surprising type of knowledge in the history of science.

First Greenburg started by pointing out that there were four kinds of knowledge; knowledge about the universe, knowledge about the physical world, knowledge about the mind, and knowledge about everything. He was surprised by the number of disciplines that have existed since antiquity, which were not originally part of science. Among the new-found disciplines are philosophy, philosophy of mind, sociology, psychology, anthropology, religion, history, sociology, political science, sociology of science, sociobiology, anthropology, and many others. The four types of knowledge, each with unique information about how to acquire it, appear to be almost limitless.

Greenburg wondered, "If one could find an instruction manual for acquiring each of those kinds of knowledge, how would it look like?" With this realization, Greenburg was able to find very explicit information about acquiring each type of knowledge.

The following is an example from greenburg.org.

Information

There are in one sense information in science: there is the world we perceive, and there is the world about which we think, and all such information is a sort of system. What exactly makes such information a system?
