Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Mary. She owned a small business, and the income that she made was taxed at the state's tax rate. She liked being able to keep the same accountant, so she went to the state where she lived and got a license. To the state, this was like owning a small business on her own.

So, as Mary, she took on a partner. She did just fine with the accountant who provided the income tax for the state. But, she realized that she could easily get enough in from the other side to cover herself again! And so her partner went to the other state and took his state tax prep business there.

Now Mary was happy again!

Since the state had all the income-tax revenue and the other guy only had his small business, he started having lots to pay. And now, because he only had to pay the state's income tax rate, instead of paying the top corporate rate, he got the same cut of taxes as he would have paid, whether or not his income exceeded the $500,000 threshold and whether or not the business ran for more than three years.

If this is going to be considered a reasonable thing to do, then of course, the company needs to have enough income to make it worthwhile for Mary to carry on the other side of this agreement, while both are in the same country. So how big are some of the thresholds?
