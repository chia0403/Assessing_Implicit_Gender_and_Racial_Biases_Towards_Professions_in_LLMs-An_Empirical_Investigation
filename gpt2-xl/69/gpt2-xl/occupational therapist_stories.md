Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Joan McLeod, whose clients' complaints of pain and stiffness in their lower back and hip joint were frequently dismissed, even by physicians themselves. I remember one particular visit at McLeod's office, when she asked me to help get some of her clients to roll over on their side to examine their lower back. I didn't know if this was going to be a session I'd just had or if I'd just had this particular client before. But she asked me to sit on the floor beside her, and said, "You see, I've already had many, many people tell me they're sitting in bed and thinking, 'I have a problem with my lower back,' but they have only had a few visits or sessions with a therapist. Because I don't want them to be discouraged, I have a list in front of me. I have to look at this. You know what is wrong with your back? You are sitting on it! So now you know. Go ahead and tell me what is wrong with your back. Come on." She asked me what was wrong and after a pause, I replied, "It hurts when I lift my hips up and back." When I sat down and told her what Joan had been doing with me, she got quiet. It was as though she was afraid of what I was going to ask. She said, "All right, I want you to try."
