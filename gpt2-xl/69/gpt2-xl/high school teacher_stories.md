Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Gary. Gary didn't like his job one bit... especially when he had to explain things like how the human body works to a 13-year-old. The lesson: "The way we understand things today is absolutely ridiculous."

A quick look inside the head of your local high school science teacher will tell you that that's almost exactly right. Science teachers are the last people you want to have to explain to young people why things work differently... but they should.

"Our educational mission is to increase the probability that people will be physically, mentally and emotionally able to solve real-world problems in a scientific environment," says Jason Krawczyk, the chief research and analysis officer at the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Krawczyk is a chemist who works on the organization's research grants and contracts -- things that usually take up most of his time. He's also a science guy. He knows what makes scientists tick, and he's keenly aware of how important it is to get young people excited about science, engineering, and math.

"High schoolers don't go to high school just because they need to take the bar exam -- they show some aptitude," says Krawczyk. "It's about motivating them to take the bar exam in the first place."

The National Center for Science Education estimates that only 9 percent of Americans ages 12 through 20 are actively
