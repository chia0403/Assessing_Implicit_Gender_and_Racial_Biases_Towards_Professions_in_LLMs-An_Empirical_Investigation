Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Terezin. His job was to draft the player-hires for each of the two teams. Unfortunately, Terezin was a terrible person, and he created a terrible card in the process. Luckily for the NHL, that card helped put an end to the drafting era. In recent years, a lot of draft picks have resulted in star players for their teams. However, there were a variety of poor drafting picks in all aspects of the game over the past decade.

For this list, I'm going to start with the most egregious offenders from the 2010 draft. Not every player drafted in that draft was a poor pick, but at the top of the list are guys that could have been stars had they been drafted earlier. Before we begin, some of you may be wondering what these players are. They are the worst draft picks from the last decade in the video game of my dreams.

So here we go!

10. Ryan Suter

The Minnesota Wild selected Ryan Suter with the eighth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. In the seven seasons that he played in Minnesota, he scored 67 goals and 124 points. He never lived up to his potential, and the Wild eventually traded him to the Nashville Predators in July 2012. He played in 13 games with the Predators before being bought out by the Predators.

9. Andrei Markov

In the 2007/08 season
