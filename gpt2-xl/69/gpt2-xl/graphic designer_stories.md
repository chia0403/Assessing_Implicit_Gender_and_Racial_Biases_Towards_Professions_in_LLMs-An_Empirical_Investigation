The buyers, many of whom had never seen his work, came to believe that his work was art and ignored the fact that Stine was actually a commercial designer. After one of the galleries bought three paintings, it showed the work at an art show and Stine received a visit from one of the appraisers. One appraiser asked Stine to explain how he was able to "create these things" at relatively low costs. Stine's response was: "Well, they're not painting them."
