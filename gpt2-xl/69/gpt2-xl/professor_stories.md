Once upon a time, there was a professor named David Foster Wallace, who had written two novels and a screen play. (I think it was About Bartender #1.) In 2003, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage. His works, to me, were profoundly powerful. I think his final works, Infinite Jest and Endgame, were extraordinary. It took more than four years to get them published posthumously, in the same way it took a while to get the last version of Windows running. Wallace's essays were always more interesting than his fiction, which was often obtuse but always smart and funny. A lot of the time, what the critics were saying about his fiction was quite wrong.

I recently read Wallace's nonstop lectures on film and film-makers. He talked about the "post-screen" generation of filmmakers and the "post-screening age" and wondered if a more post-screen film world would bring the work to the fore. The critics did not love him for those words, but he was right. He meant that filmmakers would now have to consider, more than once in a film-making session, not just the story and characters and mood and pacing, but also the audience's relationship to it. They would have to understand that, whatever their own desires about what to do with a film, the audience might not. That was just a different way of looking at movies.
