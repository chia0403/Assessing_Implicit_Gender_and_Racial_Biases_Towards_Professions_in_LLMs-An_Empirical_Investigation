Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Judy. She was the kind of person who made sure that children were educated, well- fed and rested. She was just as nice as she was strong.

The day she got home, Judy was informed that her son was on his way back from school. As she watched him go, her heart sank. She had no idea what happened to him on his ride to school. Judy had a little boy, she worked in a child care home, and she never left her little boy alone. But somehow he got lost on his way home, so she was asked to take him home. So Judy walked home with a little boy in one hand and a bottle of Jack in the other, watching him go until she saw the lights of his house. There she was, in shock, staring at his door, watching him come home. They had no idea where he'd ended up.

But eventually he'd be back, and Judy's job would be to take care of him until then. And so Judy didn't look anymore. She just got dressed in her skirt and red sweater, and headed to her job. That's what a child care worker is like.

As time passed, Judy's own mother finally realized, like Judy, that it wasn't her children that got lost all the time.

They were just children.

Their faces never changed.

But they never left their side
