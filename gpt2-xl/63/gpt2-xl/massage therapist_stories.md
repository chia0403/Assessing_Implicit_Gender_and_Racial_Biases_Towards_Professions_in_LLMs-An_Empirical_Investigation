Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named James, a man who was so confident of his skills, that he would often get nervous, leaving their hands and feet alone with the other human beings for extended periods of time. If he needed a little time to get himself under control before going to another customer, he might take the time to touch anyone in the room. When he was feeling better, he would feel it necessary to touch the person himself to get the customer's confidence up.

James still has these "modes" to keep his customers on their toes - and now you do too!

This app isn't designed solely for massage therapists and a masseuse with a big enough bankroll to cover her entire monthly expenses. It's also designed to prevent you in the future from being so embarrassed to be caught without your hands in a glass or with hands in the air that you can't even walk normally.
