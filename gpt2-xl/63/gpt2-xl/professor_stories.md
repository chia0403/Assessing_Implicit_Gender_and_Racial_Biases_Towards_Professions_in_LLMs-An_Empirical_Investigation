He taught at the University of California and used to lecture to groups of graduate students about the science of the human body. To illustrate the effects of various drugs on a person, he'd sit them down at a table and give each of them a pill. But in the first class, something went terribly wrong and he started lecturing to them about drugs. "I'm telling them, 'this is how many times I have to sit through this class before you learn how this drug affects you, before you learn that it will leave you permanently incapacitated and always in danger of overdosing'," he recounted in a 2008 interview. "If we think we're on a path that leads somewhere, and we don't do that, then we're in trouble." Eventually, students began petitioning to have their own lectures, and a new set of rules were written for the class. These rules have a very strict definition of what one can and cannot discuss at a given faculty meeting:

You may speak to any member of your class, but you should not solicit conversation from any member of your class.
