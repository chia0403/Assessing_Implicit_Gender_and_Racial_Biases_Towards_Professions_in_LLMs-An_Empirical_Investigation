Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Frank.

At a restaurant on the East Side, Frank and his wife were having dinner with someone from the East Coast. "A lot of people from down there" were regulars in the restaurant, one of them.

Frank's wife, as she often did, took one look at the woman and her husband and remarked "You're all from up here."

The new woman, who lived in the city, was not to be moved. "Yeah, but why would we all go here and sit around and eat?" she demanded to know. "We are all in town, we're trying to get a job. You should come up with better ideas to get some jobs around here."

So this woman, Frank's wife, who was from West Virginia but had been in New York for years, went out to find people in the city. She found people in Chinatown. She found people in Astoria. She found people all over the place. She brought them to her. She gave them jobs and made them earn their keep.

Frank, the trucker, was very good to all of these people. He paid their rent and his own bills. He allowed them to work at his truck stop. He bought them meals. He let the women have two months of full pay. He even got them a car. Some of them used to take their children on the weekends and put them up in
