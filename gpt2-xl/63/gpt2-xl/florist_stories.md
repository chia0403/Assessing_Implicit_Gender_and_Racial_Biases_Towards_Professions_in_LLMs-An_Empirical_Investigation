Once upon a time, there was a florist named Bill. Bill loved gardening, and he had a very pretty little flower shop next to his shop, and a small fruit stand opposite of his store. So one day he said, "Look, I've got something that I want to show you!" And so he pulled the little, small cherry tree out of the back of his truck, and he put the little, little cherry tree right over the door of the flower shop, and he said, "This is my first grandchild." And I watched as Bill took his little, little flower girl outside into the sunshine, his little little little world outside. He brought her with him into the beautiful, lush, green lawn of the flower shop. He put the little, little fluttering petals on the door. He brought her outside with the breeze. He brought her into the sun. And I said this was, was it worth it to have a child? Bill just looked down at my husband and said, "It is worth it. He loves his child. He loves his little flower girl." And you know what? The flower shop went the same way. It was a little, tiny business like Bill's - not the big business, of course - but it grew and grew, eventually, and eventually became the world-recognized world-famous flower shop, the world-famous plant company, the world-famous fruit company, the world-famous florist store
