Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Victor Klemperer, and he got really frustrated with the fact that at a certain point, he felt he'd run out of ways to sell people on seeing his performances in person, because in order to see your play in a theater, you were usually required to show the thing in advance to a group of people who you had bought tickets to see it. So Victor's solution was to actually film the plays, and then he would show a film of the play to the audience, and only the people who bought the ticket to that particular screening would get to see it. And so the audience was actually able to buy the ticket that was good for the particular performance that they wanted to see, and they would then be able to see that for free. This was actually revolutionary! It is so revolutionary in theatre, because it's all-comers! This is something that plays were invented for: The whole point of being able to watch a play in a theater on your own, and not have to travel there is to be able to get to know a play that you can't get to know in person. And all of these plays that were being filmed was a chance to do that. Now you're paying to see a performance that doesn't exist; it's a little bit of an ironic twist.
