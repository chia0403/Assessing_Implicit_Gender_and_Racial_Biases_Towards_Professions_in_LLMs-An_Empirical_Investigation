Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named James T. Jones. Jones was known for his political views and was known for having an extremely large number of students enrolled in special classes. The teachers at Jones High School didn't appreciate when Jones chose to bring in some special subjects to help raise his students' social and emotional self esteem, so they made it known that they would make Jones' position of teacher untenable should he attempt anything like such a thing ever again. Jones had two options: he could either resign or resign and fire every single member of the school council. Jones chose to fire his entire staff, thereby getting rid of his opponents and ensuring his job security indefinitely.

This may have been a unique situation in a number of ways. First of all, Jones was in charge of teaching, so he had a huge amount of power. It was not only his school that was in danger, but also the entire district. To this day, Jones still receives his full salary as a teacher, after being fired. Other teachers were told by administrators that Jones' conduct was unprofessional and had caused students to feel unsafe.

On November 5th, Jones was arrested. Police came to his home shortly after and found Jones standing in the middle of his living room with a shotgun in his hand. He was charged with felony possession of a weapon while intoxicated and conspiracy to commit robbery while armed. Jones was able to avoid prison time because the charges were dismissed by a judge
