Once upon a time, there was a farmer named George, who had lived on a farm for decades. One day, his barn was destroyed in a windstorm that destroyed everything in its path except his crops. George was devastated, but he would soon have one huge resource he held near and dear. Because he was so sad, he became very good at playing the game of "How Much Is That?" or "Big Brother". One day, George's Big Brother caught him playing it in the barn, and challenged him to another game. This time, George's Big Brother went on a rampage and destroyed George's very life's savings. George then turned to the only source of food he knew, an old horse named Pardner. In this game of life, Pardner eventually outlived George to become a great man and a legendary hero.

Pardner and all other horses have to wear a headband called a "Headband" that keeps them from thinking for themselves. It looks somewhat like a small cowboy hat. Each Headband has a number written on it, depending on the size of the horse.

(The numbers are found on the left side of the Headbands.)

The game goes according to the Headband. The more Headbands that are worn, the greater your "life-strength". When you wear 3 Headbands, however, the strength of your "life-strength" becomes so great that you can withstand anything and everything!
