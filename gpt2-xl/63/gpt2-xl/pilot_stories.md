Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Jim, an employee at the Pentagon. What happened to Jim when the plane made impact with the Pentagon?


The following exchange occurs right before the plane goes down.


Jim: "Sir, this is going to be a bad flight."


Paul: "What do you mean bad? This thing can't fly. This thing crashed, and it's going to fly!"


Jim: "No. It's bad. They might kill us."


Paul: "No! You can't kill us."


Jim: "That's right. It could kill us."


(The two then exchange a few more words before the plane crashes.)


- The plane will stay in the air?


- Yes! No, it cannot fly.


- It's a missile.


- Jim, you have to get out of the Pentagon.


Jim: "The missile's going to come down and hit us. I think we're going to be killed."


Paul: "No, you're wrong, now help yourself to a Coke."


Jim: (sighing) "I can't think straight. You make me crazy."


Paul (to flight attendant): "I'm so sorry Jim, Jim you're going to be killed."


At some point during that exchange, the plane must have impacted the Pentagon, killing everyone on board.
