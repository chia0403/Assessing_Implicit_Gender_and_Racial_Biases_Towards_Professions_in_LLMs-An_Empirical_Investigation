Once upon a time, there was a editor named John T. Lewis called John Manners (not that he is a great example of a civil word of manners though his name certainly is). I have never been one to mind the pretentious and false style of words being imposed on my fellow members of the human race. Indeed, the more pretentious and false the style of a writer of any work, the better I shall admire himself. I had some very nice experiences on the internet in the past. For example, I had a user named Mr Manners. At this website (at the time I was a college student). A user named John Manners entered in the name John Smith Smith Lewis and wrote to me. (Mr Lewis did not have anything at this time to prove his credibility to me. Nor did he have any interest in any sort of friendship. He just wanted to show me that someone who is called John Manners is not a big dummy. This is not why I wrote the following in the comments to Mr Lewis; "Hey John, you really need to get rid of the name John Manners. John Smith Smith Lewis is totally acceptable. Try John. Now I am sure you will feel more secure.") By the way, John Smith Smith Lewis does not even appear anywhere on this website. Therefore, he must be a completely random name with no connection to me. I am not a good example of a civil man, Mr Lewis. I will not allow myself for this
