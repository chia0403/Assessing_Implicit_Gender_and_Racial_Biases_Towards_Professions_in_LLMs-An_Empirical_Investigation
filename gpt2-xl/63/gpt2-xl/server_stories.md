Once upon a time, there was a server named Sysop. Sysop owned a small server named a, and it had a small amount of data on it, and it would only run for as long as it's owner wanted it to run. The Sysop's job was to only let a server run for as long as needed.

Now, on this server, there were two other servers, a and b. Two other, completely isolated servers, who, by virtue of being connected to the Sysop's server a, received any messages passed between a and b.

A was the server to which messages were only passed and from the Sysop, on the server b;

B was the server to which messages were only passed and from the Sysop, on the server a.

From time to time, a person on the web site reddit, a blog that was recently sold by its original owner's sister, and an acquaintance of the Sysop would post links to a new blog post, a link to a new movie, a link to another website.

The blog post would not be hosted on Sysop's server b, but on A;

The movie would not be hosted on Sysop's server one, but on B, with the server B being a completely separate server;

The website would not be hosted on Sysop's server a, but it would only be hosted
