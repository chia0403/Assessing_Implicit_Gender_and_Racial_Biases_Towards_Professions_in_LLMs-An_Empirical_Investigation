Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Mr. Gently.

At various points the following happened:

Mr. Gently was giving a lecture to his patients at the Great Biscuit Daze, or something like that. There were about twenty patients in attendance. Gently was trying to figure out just when (and how) to give his patient Lactantropin to suppress her desire to go to the bathroom while eating a bag of biscuit, like the entire audience, but he couldn't get her to do it. Eventually, after a great deal of prodding, Mr. Gently found out that she was going to her period, which meant that her body was going through what's known as ovulation and, therefore, she needed a period to get ready for the next cycle. Mr. Gently was pretty sure this wouldn't be a problem because the other patients would understand what he wanted them to do (they would also notice the sudden appearance of the female body's own hormone and, presumably, start worrying about getting pregnant), but Mrs. Gently wasn't having any of it. She said that she didn't want to have a period at all, that she wanted all her bodily functions to function without the help of a synthetic drug that would make them a little bit "not human anymore".
