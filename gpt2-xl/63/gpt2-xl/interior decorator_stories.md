Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Carol. She was a super nice person and took care of her clients really well. Carol had also been a woman of many talents, and she spent time learning to become one as well. Carol is one of the few woman interior decorators and she never got involved in politics.

Carol's parents were upset with her and made her come home before the morning.
