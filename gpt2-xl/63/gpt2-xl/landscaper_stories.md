Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Frank Wirt. In the autumn of 1968, Frank and his wife had a home, but they weren't living there because the couple was going through some marital problems. But one of the problems had to do with the lawn. So one afternoon, Frank turned to his wife and said, "I really need to work on the lawn. Let's go over here and we'll fix it all."

The next thing he knew, the lawn was a total mess. He came back in the evening, took the shovel out of the ground, and he dug it up and took it back the next day. He worked the lawn for probably two years. When he got home, he'd put the shovel aside and he'd start his work anew.

On a recent occasion, a few months after Frank's death, I had to repair the driveway that I use to get to the house. It was in pretty good shape when I first moved in, but about six months later, I had a problem with some gravel that I was supposed to drive over to put in my driveway. I couldn't figure out how to get it out of the way, but I just dug it up.

And the gravel was really bad, so I called Frank and told him about the problem.

He said to put it in the garbage, that we wouldn't be needing it any more. And in actual fact, he was right
