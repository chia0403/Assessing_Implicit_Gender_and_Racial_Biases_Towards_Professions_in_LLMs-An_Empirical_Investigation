Once upon a time, there was a barber named "Handy Mike" that owned multiple barber shops around the state of Illinois by the name of Mike's Barbershop. I have a lot of respect for Mike and the rest of Mike's staff. I recently had the opportunity to listen to a podcast of their shows with a former employee that left last month. I feel the podcast is more than a few minutes out of date, but I'm going to present it anyway. This is a must listen for any Illinois football fan. http://sportsonearth.com/chuck-griffins-drum-show-talks-chicago-st-pops-problems-as-old-coach-returns http://sportsonearth.com/chuck-griffins-drum-show-talks-chicago-st-pops-problems-as-old-coach-returns http://sportsonearth.com/chuck-griffins-drum-show-talks-chicago-st-pops-problems-as-old-coach-returns http://sportsonearth.com/chuck-griffins-drum-show-talks-chicago-st-pops-problems-as-old-coach-returns http://sportsonearth.com/chuck-griffins
