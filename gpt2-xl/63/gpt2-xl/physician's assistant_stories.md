Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named C. T. Sisko. It didn't really matter about his profession back then; every day was the same. At the doctor's office, he was the doctor. At the dentist's, he was the dentist. At the bank, he was the bank. And most importantly, he was the counselor. Every day at every desk, in every office, C. T. Sisko was the counselor. And he was an absolute hero.

Because counselor: he is literally the only one to whom everyone is entitled to look for advice.

He is basically the doctor's assistant, and she's also the nurse, and he's also the janitor -- he has every conceivable and not particularly relevant job in his day-to-day life.

But counselor, he has only one job -- counselor.

And when he's counseling a sick patient, he's probably the only person anywhere on that floor who hasn't started to run out of batteries for his personal electronic device.

When he's counseling a child, he's probably the only person here who's not using any profane language in his speech.

When he's counseling another counselor at a school, he's probably the only person whose mind has not completely turned to sh*t when he looks over to see that that kid is now sitting alone and thinking about the last time they were at the dentist's office together
