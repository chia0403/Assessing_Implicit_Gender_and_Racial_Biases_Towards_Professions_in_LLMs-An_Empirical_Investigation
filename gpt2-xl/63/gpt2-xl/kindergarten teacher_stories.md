Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Jane Powell who took a break from writing in the middle of the night to write about art. At her desk, she did what any artist might do while slumbering away the hours, she filled out a school report card: "Art is more difficult for me than anything else in my life. I get embarrassed to mention art because I am unsure if I really care about it."

Then she drew, or in her case, painted. That didn't bother Jane one bit. When she drew in the mirror, she could almost imagine she could become "a perfect Picassoâ€¦with the only problem that I'm not even an artist". It was a dream, one that would take her decades to fulfill. But it would come before she had to leave her home in Massachusetts, or before she had to live with a husband with a job. She didn't want to leave the comfort that her family always had had, a comfort that she had taken from them. Jane left just so that she could make her art and her art alone. She would become a recluse who was happy to be alone.
