Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Bob who taught young children their first steps:

"When you first walk, pick up your foot and push down. This is a great form of self-defense. You'll learn more about self-defense in your own life if you start by practicing this. Walk slowly, and when you stop, stand up straight.

"Next, take your shoe and push down into the step. This is a nice little toehold for a while until you can really learn good footwork and foot technique.

"Finally, move the toes of your front foot and the toes of your back foot simultaneously together. Try a small step forward, back, or side-to-side. The two of you should be moving side-by-side, not one on top of the other. The next time you practice this with each other, try getting to a point where you're using all four feet simultaneously during a practice session."

We should never be afraid to practice what we preach.

The great advantage in training ourselves mentally is you will realize you have the freedom to be more creative/creative than you would otherwise.
