Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named George Harrison who wanted to play the saxophone; that is to say to play a saxophone instead of a piano. He couldn't do it, because there are laws there, which didn't allow such a thing. But Harrison kept trying and tried and kept trying until finally he succeeded.

Well, the authorities had already decided that Harrison's music couldn't be played, so they ordered George to pay the musicians they owed. He refused.

At this point they had their first case of a man refusing to pay the money he owed. One of the authorities sent him to jail.

Then Harrison's music finally began to circulate, and then they heard he was actually playing his own original compositions. People started hearing him with other people and learning from him, and it was amazing.

When Harrison died on May 21, 1970, about the time that Bob Dylan had just released his first album, he said that one of the things he especially liked about Harrison was that he had actually performed a solo. He just thought that was cool.
