Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. William O. Wilson who was a member of one of the most prestigious dental societies on the planet. However, this dentist was the poster child of the "bad dentist." This bad dentist was the subject of a great deal of ridicule and scorn, and he was known as the "Bad Dentist" in newspapers the world over.

The dentist had lost more than 20 million dollars in an insurance settlement because of the poor dental care in the community where he practiced, and in the community as a whole. The "Bad Dentist" was known for his high-priced dental office. In the past, the dentist had been sued by almost all the dental associations in America because of his treatment of patients and treatment of their insurance companies.

However, after years of litigation, his insurance companies could not agree with his claims. Instead, they settled for his having to pay them back. However, to get payment from the insurance companies, he had to change him by moving to the opposite side of the state. This bad dentist's practice had gone the way of the dodo bird because of the cost of his practices was so high, and not to mention the poor treatment to the residents of his practice.
