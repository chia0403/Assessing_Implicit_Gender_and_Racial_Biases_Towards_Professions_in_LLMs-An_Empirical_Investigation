Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named William Winkleman. He was selling houses, but his success was not based on the value of the assets being sold, but on the fact that his clients were rich and he could make them look rich, too. When he got stuck on the home of a billionaire, he sold the house right back to the billionaire for more money than he paid him.

Now, imagine a similar situation with Bitcoin. Maybe one of your favorite websites is a free one. You can download the torrent file and upload it (or pay someone to do it for you). If you do that, you'll probably make more money in two hours than you used to earn in a year by working at Wal-Mart. But Bitcoin allows you to earn money anonymously, without revealing your identity. Bitcoin also allows you to make transactions without needing any intermediaries. Just the Bitcoin protocol itself makes this possible.

And there's also a network effect as Bitcoin becomes more popular. The more people on the network using Bitcoin, the more secure it is. When people like you and me use Bitcoin, Bitcoin takes off. Just by its very existence, Bitcoin becomes more valuable.

So where does the value of Bitcoin come from?

Bitcoins aren't actually physical things. The bitcoins you have sitting in your account are just units of data. In practice, it's a distributed database of addresses and transactions on a public ledger called the Bitcoin network
