Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Bill. Bill was a normal and boring person who had to make money, like every other man, but he has something extra. He is the most unique person in the world.

Bill lives in Hollywood and spends his days with his two-year-old twin daughters. One of the twins, Katie, is gorgeous, and she loves to be part of her father's hairdressing business. So, every evening, Bill puts aside his normal routine and puts on his wigs. One of his wigs is called "A Girl Like Mine," and it's black, sleek, and flowing. In the mirror, it's easy to see Bill's eyes are full of energy. With Katie curled up on his feet, his fingers work the wig. Bill's hands are big, with large, hairy palms and smooth skin. Bill is always happy, smiling.

One time, the other barber who works at the salon saw Bill standing with his daughters. "What do you do?" the barber asked.
