Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Jack who made a living as a firefighter, but then one day a small blimps landed nearby, and Jack's boss told him to do their job. Then Jack found that his boss and other firefighters all had an invisible, one-way, ticket. Suddenly he found himself in a world where he could only talk to people who were already there. That's when he figured out that there were invisible people all around him.


And he's the only one who can save them all...


"There was the blimp, the firefighter, and the ticket inspector." - Jack, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic


And now, he's the master of all three! Help this young Pony find the clues to help him get the ticket back so that he can go to his world.


In the first level, you will travel to different landmarks, find secret clues, and solve puzzles. The first five puzzles can be solved in less than five minutes (each puzzle requires the player to figure out which letter needs to be pressed to reveal and show the target letter and/or number). There are over 300 different letters in the game.


Once the fifth puzzle has been solved and you get the sixth puzzle, the level will be over. The story mode is fully-storyboarded, and there will be more than a couple of surprises as you reach each level's end.
