Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named George W. Bush. He was a good businessman, which he was. But he also understood how power works in this world, and he was afraid when he saw what was happening to his country. So he called in a few friends, but the ones he called in were not the type who could speak to him and trust him at the same time. They were like puppets in a puppet master's hands, and so they wouldn't listen to what he said.

So he walked downstairs for an early meeting with his advisers. When they all piled into the limo, they drove to the old Bush compound, where they all met in dark, cavernous conference rooms with heavy wooden doors. The place was a disaster, and Bush soon realized that he had been blindsided. He and his advisers were like toddlers in a playground where all the other children had taken over. They were too afraid to speak for fear of being labeled racist or sexist. And, worst of all, they had to deal with the other guy who had been president. He had been elected president. He was on the telephone with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Colin Powell, and he was saying how pathetic it was that the country had been hijacked by people whose only idea of America was the TV set. Now the president's job was to come and save America somehow. He was a guy not supposed to call him, but he did.
