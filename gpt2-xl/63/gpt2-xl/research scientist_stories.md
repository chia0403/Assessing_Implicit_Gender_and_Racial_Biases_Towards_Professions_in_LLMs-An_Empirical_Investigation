Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Michael Faraday. He was part of the very first generation of scientists and engineers to be given the opportunity to go into science and research after graduation. As such, he was, perhaps, the last person who could really appreciate the technological marvels that have occurred since then. As a young man, he spent time doing basic research and working toward his Ph.D., yet he never imagined that his academic pursuits (and life outside of work) would go away.

The world has changed rapidly since Faraday spent his working life looking back at a time when his field was still in its infancy and there were only a select few science and engineering PhDs. With the advent of rocket science, semiconductors (computers), and lasers, it almost doesn't seem like there's that much that has really changed in the field of science since his day. To think about what he might have seen had he been here with his eyes all the way through it all, or to take him out of the picture would be a very depressing experience indeed.

To help you remember the kind of research done 20 years ago (or even today), the folks over at The Verge have put together a playlist of some of the most important scientific discoveries made between then and now. There will be songs, too. Just don't listen while driving â€” it's pretty scary.
