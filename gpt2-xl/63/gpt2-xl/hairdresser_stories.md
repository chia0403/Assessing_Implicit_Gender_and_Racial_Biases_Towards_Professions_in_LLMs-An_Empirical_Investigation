Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Jane. She became the world's biggest nail salesman, but she has lived a quiet life since. Now, the days of sales are long gone, and Jane is desperate to get her old job back. However, the owner of the store only hires people with money, not people who can work properly. And Jane has no money, so she signs on with the wrong manager. He gets some of her money, then doesn't pay her for a month. When her business goes bankrupt, she finds herself out of a job, so she turns to the only person she can find to help her, her brother. But the manager has other plans, and will do anything to make sure another hairdresser gets killed. Written by garykmcd
