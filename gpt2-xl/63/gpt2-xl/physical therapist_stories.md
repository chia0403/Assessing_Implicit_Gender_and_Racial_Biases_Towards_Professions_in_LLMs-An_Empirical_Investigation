Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Mike Zullo. Mike had a passion for working with the disabled so he found it a perfect fit to start a program for people like me.

After several years of intense work on my body, I was in a really good shape and started working with Mike to help me start over in my goal of becoming Fit enough to rock the gym.

Now that I'm a personal trainer, I try very hard to have as consistent of a relationship with my clients as possible. When I first started, there was a very short time in between sessions where no one got a real look at the results because the sessions were mostly in the evening and I was mostly working for myself.

The good news is that after all of these years of personal training working with thousands of clients, I can say this: I can consistently create results on my clients with a very simple set of steps.

A few weeks before a new client session, I'll do a few basic things to prepare for the day they come in the door.

Before work, I'll do a few quick movements that I think will help give them insight into what to expect.

After the session, I'll record a note that a few other personal trainers were talking about in the hallway before saying hi to them. That way, I can see if anyone else got the same feedback (which you can do with the free Personal Trainer App).
