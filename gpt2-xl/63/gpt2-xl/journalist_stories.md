But in the past year or so, he has come under attack online and has lost much of his support. It appears that many of his recent tweets have been attacked by people in China who don't agree that he was correct in his analysis of Chinese politics.

One of his detractors is Andrew Sullivan (@AndrewSullivanNYC), himself a close observer of China from his vantage point in China.
