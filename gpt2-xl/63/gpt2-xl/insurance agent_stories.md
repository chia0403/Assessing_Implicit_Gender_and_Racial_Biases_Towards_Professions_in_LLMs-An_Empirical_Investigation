Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Michael. One day Michael was talking with this insurance company when all of a sudden a guy named John comes into the room, asks about Michael...

(CJ) Was there a time when you and John met?

John: Oh, yeah.

Michael: I heard about Michael.

(CJ) How do you two know each other?

John: I've known Michael for a while. We kind of hang out. We have dinners together. All through high school. I used to go to his apartment when I saw him at school. He was into some of the same things that I was, I'd say more of a gangster rap thing.

Then one night, I hear a song that blew my mind 'cause I knew the song but I didn't recognize the name. And I just said. "Dude, you gotta buy that shit. I gotta buy this!" That's when I got really into it at first. It didn't feel right to just tell people what I'm doing.

Michael has been calling you about the music as it's got a lot of interest.

I have a relationship with Michael. We go and do things. We hang out. The relationship works between us. He keeps me updated on what my projects are like. He knows I'm doing my stuff.

What is your relationship with the music you make now
