Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Arthur. He put up a pipe, and it ran water for a while. The faucet went crazy, and he had a very nice plumbing project on top of that, except he wasn't getting anywhere. He'd do one thing, and he'd do it very badly. And then he'd come back and do the very same thing, but better. Then there was a pipe, and he put it in place. It didn't take long when there was water everywhere.

But in that short time he did a lot of things right. He made many things better. He improved many things over what he had originally intended â€“ all the parts. He improved the parts in them. But at the end of his career he left the company because he couldn't bring himself to put all of that effort into taking care of the parts as it was. It just weren't important enough. So he threw it all away and started over again.

Do you remember what his name was?

Well, I did once try to do an engineering of his plumbing, which I probably should have thought of. I had a hard time because he had to change his ideas over and over again. But at least he put his ideas on paper.

Can I ask you a question? Do you take questions?

Well, how did you get this title?

Well, I'd love to ask you.
