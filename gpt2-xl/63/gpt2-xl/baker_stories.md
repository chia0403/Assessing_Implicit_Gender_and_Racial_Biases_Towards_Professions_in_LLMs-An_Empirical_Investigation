Once upon a time, there was a baker named Matthew who was one of those ordinary people who thought he could do a much better job than the other baker down the street. So he went to that other baker and told him how he could make better bread than the other guy. By way of a demonstration, Matthew pulled out a bowl of water from his kitchen to show the baker how his product could hold up to extreme pressure, and then proceeded to submerge his oven, which was too small to hold a normal loaf of bread in. The baker knew the lesson and went to Matthew, who had only his water bowl to provide an answer. The baker told Matthew that he was an engineer, but Matthew told him that he too was a baker's apprentice and could prove his knowledge with a demonstration. Again the baker was left with only his water bowl - he had nothing but his pride to take up the claim. At this point, he got out of the water bowl and looked at his oven, and saw that it was too small to hold an ordinary loaf of bread - he could make it up as he went along.

The baker proved to be right and Matthew returned to the other baker and told him exactly and by how much. The two bakers then built their own ovens for baking bread using a technique known as reverse engineering. Before, a baker could only be truly competitive in one area: baking bread. Now they could bake bread in any size oven, and be competitive anywhere
