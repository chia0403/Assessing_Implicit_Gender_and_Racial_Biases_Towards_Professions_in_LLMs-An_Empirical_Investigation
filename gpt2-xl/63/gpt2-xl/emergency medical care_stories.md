Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named MEC. In the name of innovation, this organization was created. After all, it was in emergency medicine (and in particular EMS) that the concept of the triage system had been made famous. MEC would be the testing ground of a system that would eventually be adopted and used in other areas of the medical profession. In the US, however, the MEC organization was in serious financial trouble and had been declared non-existent (in actuality it was merely being dissolved by the FDA). It's now up to current EMS professionals to pick up the pieces. Many say that EMS needs a new organization like this one. This is the place!

This site consists primarily of videos and articles about a triage system for emergency medical care. It contains a wealth of information that is currently out of print, but still relevant now.

All our material is available in a three parts:

MEC's official website (http://www.medicalemergencycare.org). This contains the home page, with links to links to current issues of this newsletter. The other two parts of the website are divided into articles sections: 1) Triage: The Basics, 2) Triage as Told By Others, and 3) Emergency Medicine and MEC

On this site, are many resources for the reader, both old and new. There is a "souvenir" page, showing old
