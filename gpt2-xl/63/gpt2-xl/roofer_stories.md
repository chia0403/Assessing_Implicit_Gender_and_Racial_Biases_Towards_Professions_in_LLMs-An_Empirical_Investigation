Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Peter who got into a fight with a guy named George, and I thought he was quite an asshole. But George was so pissed he told him to fuck off (like a boss), and Peter, despite the bad treatment, gave him a call again. He said, "Listen, I was just out of line, you know. You're the best roofer in Toronto, man!"

The guy was shocked. "That's awesome," he said. But Peter didn't want to be bossed around anymore, so he decided to get some money to buy a van to work in the field. And he did: After several years of being beaten by guys who were way stronger than him, he got the idea to train people in the methods they needed to be strong, so that they would never go down to that level again.

That was 30 years ago, and I bet you never heard about Peter and George ever again. But now someone else is saying that they're the best roofers in Toronto.

So how do you decide when you have to pay a compliment? If it's someone over the age of 40 and you're the president of something, it's probably good idea to make a nice deal, so they say the highest compliment you can think of.

But since the roofer world is dominated by women, you should never get too personal. And it's too boring to start asking questions
