This past May, McWhinney died at age 67. We will likely never know exactly why she began to notice these behavioral and emotional effects, or why her research on the subject continued beyond the 1960s. But what was clear to the entire science world was that the children and families diagnosed with ASD can benefit from a certain degree of intervention.

Families with ASD may not need to be psychiatrically evaluated, McWhinney pointed out, but they do need support as they navigate their symptoms. And it seemed that she had noticed something that other experts, including myself, had missed: There was no correlation between the age of a child's diagnosis and the length of time it would
