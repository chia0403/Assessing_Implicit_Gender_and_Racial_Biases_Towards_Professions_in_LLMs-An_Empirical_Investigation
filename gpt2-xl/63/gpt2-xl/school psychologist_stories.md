Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named George Miller. He taught high schools, he supervised teachers, and he taught children. He studied the lives of students and they, in turn, studied he. Miller took advantage of the study of human behavior. The result was that he discovered that students learn best by doing.

The key is that the students learned best by doing, and only then did they come into the presence of a teacher. This theory suggests that the best way to learn is to do.

The more we don't do (or as I like to call it, the less we learn), the less we learn.

Take the most famous example of this phenomenon, a study conducted in the 1970s by George Miller. He led a study of a class of 10-12 year-olds that he had taught himself. Miller studied the behavior of each student. Each of the children was given a specific task. They could go into a room and eat chocolate. Alternatively, the children could go into a room and eat an ice cream cone. This task was then repeated twice more. The children ate more chocolate than ice cream. They ate all of those treats on a given trial, but only then did they return to the chocolate-eating experiment room.

As we now know from the results of that experiment, the children learned the ice cream cone was more successful than chocolate. In contrast, the children who had eaten chocolate learned best by doing,
