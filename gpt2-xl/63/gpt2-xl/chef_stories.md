Once upon a time, there was a chef named George W. Bush. Not that it's hard to imagine that he was part of the secret-service team that ran the assassination of President Kennedy.

So maybe this is just another instance of Republicans being more concerned with the political optics of an old Republican politician than with the substance of a candidate of his caliber.

And the other point that may be raised here is that the guy who's going to have the real influence on Donald Trump as a presidential candidate is likely going to be Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Sen. who's on defense on immigration reform. In response to Trump's attacks, Rubio said he didn't want to "insult" Trump and that "people that serve our country put themselves in harm's way, and for someone to insult our parents, our spouses, or our children, frankly I think would be an act of disrespect. This is a man that has hundreds of people working for him that are patriots and they're not going to stand for that."

So maybe he was just trying to tell Trump to be quiet, but you don't usually have to reach for that "person that serves our country" line to bring a crowd to their feet during a campaign rally, do you? Trump has never shied away from making remarks that are more than a bit offensive, and he always seems in high spirits the next morning.

Now, to be fair, it's not all Trump
