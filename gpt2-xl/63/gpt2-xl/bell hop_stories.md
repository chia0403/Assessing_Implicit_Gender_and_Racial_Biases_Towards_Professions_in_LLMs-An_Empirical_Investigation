Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Jimmy Lee Jones. After an early career as part of the first Chicago gangster dynasty, he had found work as an enforcer in New York, a source of income and the only form of real respect from the mobsters, one that he valued above his own life.

Jimmy Lee was a man of few words, a little bit of man. He was not known for his intelligence, but he was known for his toughness and his determination. The mobsters loved him because they knew that, at some point, they would have to kill him.

He was born in Chicago the same year as the birth of the Mafia. For the next 15 years, he would have to struggle to survive, never quite knowing where he would wind up at any given time.

"I was very good friends with a guy named Fred Colombo, who is still in the mafia, though not very active now," Jones says.

Colombo was the older head of the Colombo family gang, and there were always people waiting to ambush Jones and bring him down. In this way, Colombo and Jimmy Lee started to earn the respect of the mobsters and, later on, of one another, who used Jimmy Lee as a sort of surrogate son.

Jimmy Lee was never able to break into the criminal underworld, but every once in a while he got a chance. It almost always ended badly for him. In
