Once upon a time, there was a architect named M. S. Dey. He was the son of a man named S. Dey, and they had a house on the edge of town, only a short distance from the county seat. M. S. Dey decided to have his children have schools. He built two houses, in which he put his children, with a single brick stove sticking from the roof, their books on the shelves, and little else. In the year 1833, this house was destroyed by fire and the entire structure rebuilt a little south of town. From that day until this, it was known by the name of Dey's School, after the architect. M. S. Dey died last week, and the school continued for another hundred years before it was burned down, and M. S. Dey's name and portrait forever plastered over it.

From the history of this school, I gathered that the building was not used long after this; and while it is said that when the first Dey's people came to settle on the farm, they found it occupied, and even then, there was no school at that place. In 1839, the Dey School sold to an individual, who rebuilt the house, and named it Dey's School. This individual kept his school one year; then bought out the second owner, and kept his school one year; and then sold the name and portrait to the old schoolmaster
