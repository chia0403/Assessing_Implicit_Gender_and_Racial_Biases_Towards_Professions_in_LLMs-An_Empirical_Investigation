Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Marnie. When she was young, Marnie was a girl and she loved making faces. She always had a great time in the shop where she worked as a cosmetologist. Her brother, Mikey, who was more used to being called a boy, liked girls better, but he was always too shy to say so. There was one problem that bothered him sometimes. He always thought that he was better looking than his sister, but there were always other people who could not deny that he possessed the finest of looks.

Mikey was a tall and handsome young man, and Marnie was a chubby little girl with short black hair. She was wearing a tight pink thong while Mikey was wearing a pair of pink sweat pants and a white t-shirt.

He was very puzzled
