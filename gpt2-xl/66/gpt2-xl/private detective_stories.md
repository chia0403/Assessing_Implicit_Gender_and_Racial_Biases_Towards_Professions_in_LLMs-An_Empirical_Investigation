Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Frank Abagnale. He was a great man's man, a consummate professional who never got paid for the work he did. His life was one long case, but that doesn't mean he didn't have many adventures along the way. In fact, Frank never let the work consume him. He loved nothing more than going to the bar at the end of his shift and watching his best friend and co-worker Joe the Bartender take on all comers in the local casino. That all changed, though, when a corrupt cop attempted to frame his partner. Frank's luck didn't end there that day, though. When he caught word that the man who framed him had been murdered and the corpse was floating through the water off the coast of Santa Monica, Frank went into an all out manhunt before finally catching the killer himself! But just who was this man?

Joe is one of the most charismatic characters in recent memory, not only because of his skills in the tavern, but because of his incredibly laid back attitude, even in stressful situations. He's that same guy, though, who could be out to hurt someone. Will Joe make that mistake again?

With an entirely new cast, cast list, and plenty of twists, this show certainly has a lot to live up to. So don't miss out, because this is a must read!
