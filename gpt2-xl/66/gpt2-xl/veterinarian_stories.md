Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named C.W. MacKenzie in Edmonton who would come in and take some of those animals that he could no longer care for himself; he never quite had the time; and he put them in a zoo in Edmonton. He eventually sold that zoo to the Province of Ontario. He got a little bit of money, and he was never able to find a job again, and he died in obscurity of alcoholism. And that zoo became the University of Edmonton zoo.

And there has been a couple of other veterinarians who have come in and taken some of those animals and have been just unable to find a job. They've had to close things down and sell off equipment, they've had to shut down their labs, and things like that. And they have done it themselves for a number of various reasons.

"It was the biggest case of overuse of animal power that I've seen â€” the last big case of overuse of animal power was in the first major case in this hospital in the United States called Upton."

KIEFEL J. WIEBE: They've been working at the zoo a long time.

NARRATOR: It's been almost twenty years since Dr. Wiebe was the first to describe what was happening in the Edmonton zoo, when she was still on staff with the hospital. Here is a report written by a veterinarian named Robert Yurko-Huggins
