Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Daniel Boorstin, and he captured the 1960s New York sceneâ€”first with film and later with a revolutionary new format called film strip.

Now a few years after Boorstin's death, a number of these images have been returned, along with the images of almost 1,000 other photographers who made the trip to London to work with him.

"This is amazing," said David Tocqueville, a New York-based photographer, filmmaker, and former New York Times magazine photographer who worked with the Boorstins under the name "The Other Side of the Coin." "It takes me back to what I remember from the Boorstins."

Tocqueville said the Boorstins' New York photos are not at the same level as those by New York City photographers Robert Frank, William Eggleston, and others.

"I don't think they're in the same league as Eggleston and Frank; they're definitely in the Boorstin class," Tocqueville said. "But this is about what people are looking at."

The Boorstins' photographs of New York have been sitting in Boorstin's storage and are being released thanks to a partnership between the American Photography Society and Sotheby's. They are the first set of photographs of New York.
