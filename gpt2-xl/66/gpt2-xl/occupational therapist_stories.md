Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Dr. Robert Steinmann. He was the head of the UCLA Physical Therapy Department, and he thought that some of his patients would be better off being allowed to take an over the counter pain medication like Tylenol as part of regular medical care. That seemed OK to him. We have to admit to having a few of the same reservations, but at least our concern is directed at the patient. Dr. Steinmann wanted his patients on a Tylenol just like his patients had been taking for years.

He was never quite certain why the patients who complained so often were responding so well to Tylenol. When he took a survey of his colleagues and found that all other therapists felt the same, he was outraged. To him, the Tylenol was just part of the problem. He began to search for some other way to alleviate pain in his patients. He spent a lot of time researching the efficacy of various pain medications, and came up with a solution that he called the "therapeutic synergy" which he developed in partnership with the British pharmaceutical company Pharmacia.

So, basically, one Tylenol is more effective for one person as far as relieving pain and other symptoms than is another Tylenol. It is based on the fact that a very small amount of the drug is needed to cover the symptoms. As far as making sure that the medication is used properly
