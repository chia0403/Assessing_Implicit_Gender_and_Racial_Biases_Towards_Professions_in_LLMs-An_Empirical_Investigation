Once upon a time, there was a editor named "Crazy" in the "Scooby Doo Productions" production department that asked for the funniest of all possible questions to be written down on a note card. Of course, the "Scooby Doo Productions" staff (all of whom are dead) was able to answer the question and make the director look very stupid. The funniest note card was printed below, complete with pictures of all the Scooby Doo characters, each posing the question in the most hilarious way conceivable. We can only assume that the writer of the card, to add to the hilarity, added "In addition, we need the answer to the follow-up question: Which character will fart the most profane syllables?" because the "Scooby doodoo" was printed to the right of the note card. This is where we get references such as the note 'Scooby Doo Doo Dooo' on the picture of Scooby to the left (in the same way the Furbies would be called 'Scooby-DOO' when they dooo doo doooo).
