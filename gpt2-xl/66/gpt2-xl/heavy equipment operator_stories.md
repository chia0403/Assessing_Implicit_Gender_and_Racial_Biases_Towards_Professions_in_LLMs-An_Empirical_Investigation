Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named George. It was his job to operate a very heavy, very expensive machine that was used to move heavy equipment for the construction industry, a job that came so rarely, not even during a weekend off work.

The problem, as the story goes, was that when he first heard the name of his boss' first-born son, it became a bit uncomfortable to do his job. The machine was so large, it made a lot of noise. "But I liked it," George told me a long time ago. "It was so useful."

"I think I was the only one in the entire building who ever came across it," he added.

So if you get a job at a building and know somebody is looking for a new operator, you might want to try to introduce the subject. "Your buddy knows George. You should just tell him that your dad once saw a monster in his sleep. And then tell the truth," the old operators' saying goes.
