Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Peter. And then, as luck would have it, he met the most intelligent woman in the world named Ellen.


Peter and Ellen were married many years ago, but Peter stayed with Ellen in retirement. When he was asked if he'd like to continue his employment, he said "If you just gave me the job, I'd be happy to stay forever."


Many years later, Peter was asked, "What would Ellen think of the situation?". He replied: "She would have laughed in my face, as she does in yours, but I couldn't help it."


Peter was a well respected "tax preparer", and his advice was sought by nearly every government agency. He made a "fairly good income" for the government, but his tax savings turned into almost nothing when his advice turned out to be poor.


This story about Peter tells why a lot of tax professionals are in a bind. As an individual you may never think too much about the amount of money you will use for your tax. If it is substantial, you may even think that "a little tax helps the government". But, when it comes to "tax preparers" who make a good income and advise clients to pay "just a little tax", the average taxpayer may have a bit of a headache if it really bothers you to pay a great deal of taxes.


Now, let's see why.
