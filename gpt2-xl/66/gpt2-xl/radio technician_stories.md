Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named David M. who happened to have some experience with building an audio signal from a ground-based signal.

He took his radio into the countryside, stood in front of some trees and tried to pick out some low-frequency pulsing noises that popped up from far away.

He got pretty good at it, but just didn't think his radio could be used to make an accurate location-sensing signal. He tried various kinds of antennas and found some that would make a good "radio beacon," though of course no one expected a radio beacon to be the thing that brought down a 747.

Still, David had tried out different antenna designs and they were all unsuccessful. Perhaps a more-or-less standard antenna will work. He thought about some new ideas, but eventually concluded there was no way to put together something like a "perfect" antenna for this purpose.

He figured there had to be some kind of trick, some trick he could try and see what would happen.

He decided that if he were to test his theory he would simply sit himself up in whatever position would allow him to see clearly, the perfect spot above some trees.

Here, he could look out over a wide area and see what appeared to be a faint (if slightly indistinct) signal fading and fading.

He would then look at the distance from his position to the source of this signal, how
