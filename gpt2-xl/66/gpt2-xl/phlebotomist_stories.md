Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Sigmund Freud. Freud's work inspired psychologists everywhere, but perhaps the most influential of his contributions was his analysis of hysteria, in which he proposed that women who experience extreme feelings of disgust and fear during pregnancy or in the womb are experiencing something less rational.

More than three decades later, psychologist Paul Babiak argued that Freud's theory about hysteria was wrong and actually supported what had long been believed: menstruation. Freud was a very controversial figure; his ideas on women were considered to be at odds with a lot of existing scientific thinking, including Freud's own.

But Babiak's ideas would change how we think about both menstrual disorders and women's roles in their own lives. The notion of hysteria, which had previously been thought of as an aberration, eventually became associated with women's mental health, and people began to think that "hysterical" women just needed more help. (The word didn't exactly turn up until the 20th Century.)

In addition to Freud and Babiak, women have since proposed a number of theories to explain why symptoms are felt more frequently in women. While none of these theories are 100 percent accurate, a few of them do have elements in common. These ideas were explored in the movie "Hysteria," which explores how women's mental health has changed over time.
