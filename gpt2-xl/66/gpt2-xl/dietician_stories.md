Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Mary J. Bridgett. If you didn't like your meals, you were to leave a notice in the doctor's waiting room for two weeks before consulting again. One day, Mary Bridgett was eating a salad at her desk when the man sitting across from her started jabbing. Mary was having none of that and said, "If I might please, Doctor, tell me exactly what I need to hear?" He responded: "Don't give in so easily to the patient's demands, Mary, as the dietician is about to lecture you about eating. A good diet is not an individual choice. It's a moral obligation."
That is some bullshit -- and it's about to get worse. In December 2013, the British Parliament passed a sweeping food regulation that would make it a criminal offense to sell a healthy, pesticide-free meal, such as a "raw, green salad," to an unvaccinated child or teen. "It is an offence under the Consumer Rights Act," the bill states. "It is an offence to sell foodstuffs for which there is reasonable evidence that the manufacturer has failed to use effective methods of production." The idea: If the U.K. doesn't care enough to make sure children are vaccinated, it might as well stop them from consuming anything too healthy. And here in the U.S., you better believe we're going to be forced to follow their rules.
