Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named "John Doe," who used to travel through the streets in search of some elusive object bearing the trademark of their client, "Doe Enterprises Inc." They could not help but come up with a unique and intriguing name. One such name included "Hogwarts," after the wizarding school in England, and "Buckminster Fuller" after the futurist who designed skyscrapers and created sustainable cities.

As for this peculiar name "Hodgkiss" it is actually a nickname for the author J.R.R. Tolkien, a name that is commonly mispronounced as "Hodgkiss," according to some. However, it is the most pronounced name of the author himself, and it is a name that comes up often in reference to the novels he wrote in his youth, and many years afterward. In fact, in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit, and, as such, The Silmarillion, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Mordor, The Hobbit, the novel The Hobbit contains all of these books. To add to this, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the most recently published novel, which will surely be the most lucrative movie franchise of the 21st century, will contain all of Lord of the Rings as well.
