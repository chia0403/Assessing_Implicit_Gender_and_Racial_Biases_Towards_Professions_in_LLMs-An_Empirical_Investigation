Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Ron. Ron was not an "hockey guy." He was not a fan of the Edmonton Oilers. He did not root for the New Jersey Devils. And one day, he took a chance on a rookie the Oilers had signed in December of 2001.

"They had played him last year at four games," Ron remembers.

That rookie was Darnell Nurse.

"He was like, Man, that guy can skate," Ron recalls. "I was like, what can he do? He played the next game against Minnesota at the old MTS Centre. And then, the next game he got hit with this injury. I thought it was a great pick up.

"On Jan. 19, he went off to the U of A for seven weeks, and then came back for training camp. He made the team that day after a couple of practices. I was, like, Wow."

Since then, Nurse has become an absolute bonafide star for the Toronto Marlies and the NHL's most underappreciated defenseman. It's not just that he's an excellent goal scorer (22 this season; 20 last year), although he is. It's that the two most significant players he skated with last season are out the door this spring and he's got a chance to compete for a spot as the Maple Leafs' No. 1 defenseman on his third straight season.
