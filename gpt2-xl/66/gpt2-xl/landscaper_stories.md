Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Bob. Bob was a good guy. He was just trying to keep to a reasonable career path with his own two hands (he was a mechanic too, and I'd gotten that in my family, by the way). Then, one day, Bob decided he needed to quit his job because he didn't like it any more.

Bob lived in a neighborhood where he knew there were many homeless people. He came up with this idea of working with the homeless, clearing rough sections of the city of trash, and working for a nonprofit organization. The organization, after the cleanup, would buy some houses and give them to the homeless, giving them permanent housing. The organization would also give the homeless, who had done well during the work day, bonuses to do other stuff to help the city.

Bob liked doing work for the homeless. He liked the idea of working with people who didn't really have a voice in the rest of the world. He took out his checkbook and started building people nice houses. He would make lots of checks and then just walk away. He didn't make any money off of the construction company he worked for because he worked himself, but Bob did make lots of people houses and a nice place to live.

When Bob was finally retired, Bob took his car and drove all the way to California to visit his friend Jim.
