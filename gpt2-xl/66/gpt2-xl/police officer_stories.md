Once upon a time, there was a police officer named David C. Waksberg, and that officer had an arresting power over someone, the police.

To see how C.Waksberg behaved, read the following paragraphs from the account of one of C.Waksberg's associates, which we have transcribed and filed away in a filing cabinet of cases. And while this was very nearly true in some communities, it is certainly not true of New Orleans, where officers, of their own volition, are sometimes willing to enforce law without any outside oversight. We will show that no one in the police department or elsewhere ever told them what to do, but they sometimes did it anyway by themselves. That police officers are themselves an example of the nature of police power.

WAKSBERG AS A COP


Police officers go out and take lives. You'd better be ready for the risk.


In 1971, David Waksberg was 16 months into his first year on the force. He had been shot earlier, the first of 15 times in his life. He was carrying a.22 rifle he had stolen from another police unit. His brother, Daniel, then a lieutenant working for Mayor Landrieu, found the rifle and brought it to a police station in the French Quarter. David could never shoot again. He was in an ambulance, badly injured.
