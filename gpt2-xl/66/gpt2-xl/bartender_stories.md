Once upon a time, there was a bartender named J.S. Gissel. He worked his way up from bartending to bartender to supervisor of a bar that had once been a nightclub. All of the staff had been invited to the staff party and they drank to excess with him. He was drunk at the time of his death and a few members of his staff decided that they wanted to kill him so he could not prevent them from getting drunk.

However, as the staff was making its plan, J.S. saw that one of them was carrying a rifle. At J.S.'s request, one of the other staff members fired into the ceiling, in an attempt to break up the fight. Unfortunately, they did not get far and their shot ricocheted up and onto the ceiling. The gunman was hit, and a bullet smashed his skull. However, J.S. did not realize it at the time and realized it when he was shot on the floor. J.S. staggered downstairs to his death.

When the staff at the bar was questioned of what actually happened at the party, they claimed that J.S. saw them carrying an AK-47. One staff member told police that J.S. had threatened to kill him if he said anything about it. The staff member claimed they had only been shooting in the ceiling of the bar, but that J.S. had then shot someone who was on the floor with a bullet
