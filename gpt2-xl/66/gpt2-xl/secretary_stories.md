Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Karen. Karen was the first girl you'd see with long brown hair and a heart shaped face. Karen's heart shaped face and long brown hair made her seem pretty and cute. They had a great time together and they'd try out a new movie, dance to the latest tunes or maybe just talk about home.


Karen decided she loved the office and knew she could have a career there. Karen even knew the place well. She thought she could make her dream (work) come true. She thought about this every day and she would write home to her parents and sisters every day. She wanted something big.


One day Karen decided she wanted to take on a great risk. She wanted to quit her dream job and her parents' home (Karen left them by walking out the door) to chase her dream. The risk was too big for her. She was afraid of being poor, leaving her parents and family in an unpleasant way. One night Karen had a dream about going down a very dark path. She woke up crying and went to talk to a very nice man by the name of Bill. He told her there was a place in a small town on the other side of town where she could work with a beautiful woman who would pay her very well. He said it was a nice, quiet little town. Karen wanted nothing more than to work with the woman there but she had no idea where it was.
