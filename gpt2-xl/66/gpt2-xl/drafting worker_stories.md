Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Harry who worked at the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense, as we discussed at the top, is also the most successful and productive government agency in the country. With this agency, he began drafting the documents that went into the Bill of Rights. He drafted that famous document known as the Declaration of Independence and he drafted the Second Amendment. And by the end of the Declaration of Independence, Harry had drafted more than 30 different amendments.

Now, he didn't know it at the time, but that was the birth of the Bill of Rights as we know them today. So we have a situation in which a man came to the federal government. He's drafting the Declaration of Independence, and he ends up drafting all the amendments that go into our United States Constitution. So when you think about it, his task now should not be what he did in the drafting phase of his life but rather what he did in the drafting and passage phase.
