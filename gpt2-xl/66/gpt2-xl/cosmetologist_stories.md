Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Mr. T.

In the beginning, Mr. T. lived at a barber shop – the barber shop of my life at that time. I was so enamored of him, I would stay an extra hour there just to hang out with him and the other guys in the shop.

The barber shop's clientele were pretty much everyone – some students, some workers at the factory, and the occasional tourist passing by.

The main topic of conversation was my "hair and makeup", since we were doing so well as cosmetologists/beauty technicians.

He had a great sense of humour, he didn't look like a barber after every cut. He had a great sense of humor – but really, just an amazing sense of fun.

He was also an amazing musician, and had a beautiful singing voice…

It is really hard to explain the beauty of a person like Mr. T., one that was very friendly, and he had a special way of touching your heart.

I really fell in love with him and his amazing beauty. In addition to being an incredible musician, he was a fantastic husband – and father. He would take me to family events he held, and would always let me sit with him on his knee for a while.

His family and friends all loved him dearly. His parents had gone on a holiday to Greece
