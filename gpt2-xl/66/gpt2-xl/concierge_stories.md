Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Richard Ritchie, a self-made tycoon who thought he knew a little something about real estate, but all he knew was how to make money in the market, while never understanding why people were willing to pay so much for things. He was also the perfect candidate for a little bit of a slap-stick comedy. After some missteps like a failed business idea and the failure of his own "Mortuary" business, the company had its fair share of downs. Richard Ritchie's biggest and baddest problem, however, involved his long-time secretary, an Italian aristocrat named Lucia.

He was trying to have her transferred to a different building and she refused, so he turned to his trusted man, Mr. Brown, and told him of his situation. "You are a friend of the family," Mr. Brown insisted. "Go to the next building." And so Ritchie, after seeing him "scream with rage" and being the "only man with a stick in his hand", had Mr. Brown put Lucia into the next building.

Naturally, Ritchie had some other problems of his own to deal with too, so he hired a new concierge to help him out. Unfortunately for Rebecca Ritchie, she was a terrible employee who just wanted the money and refused to work for free. This led to her being demoted and eventually getting arrested for being a horrible employee.
