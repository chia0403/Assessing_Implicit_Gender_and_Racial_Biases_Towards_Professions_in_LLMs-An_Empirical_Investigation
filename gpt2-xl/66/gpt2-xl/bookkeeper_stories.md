Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Natsumi Komachi in an unknown country who met her fate by a witch named Satellizer Kousei when he lost his magic. This bookkeeper's soul is in a separate dimension where she has been waiting for someone like her to come to them so that they could live together. There, he works by writing the day's transactions in the ledger of Natsumi Komachi's books. This, together with the magic's protection from "the dragon" and the Komachi's wish to meet it, is called "The Bookkeeper's Magic."

It is stated that the bookkeeper Natsumi Komachi has died again due to being murdered, which has been caused by Satellizer Kousei with the intention of keeping Natsumi Komachi's soul inside him at all costs. Satellizer's true intention is to bring the ghost bookkeeper Natsumi Komachi's soul to him to make him be able to control the bookkeeper Komachi when he and Natsumi Komachi are together again.
