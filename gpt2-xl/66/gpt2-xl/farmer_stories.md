Once upon a time, there was a farmer named William. He knew how much he hated to be late to work: every day he spent more than an hour walking to the mailbox. And when he returned home, he always found something missing from his post office.

"At first it seemed as if most of the things were broken," he remembered, "but the mail I delivered proved my suspicions."

He was right: the things that William thought were broken were actually just on the inside.

William was an odd man, and his mailbox was a strange place, a room of its own. "I've never liked post offices," he once said. "They're not really what they seem."

A person's mailbox has, as it were, two halves. The outer part, where people store mail, is called the "lid." The inner, where mail is sorted, is called the "drapes." In William's case, he had two drapes. It meant that all the things that came into his mailbox, mail and things that people sent him, had to go into two separate rooms where nothing ever got out. "Why so?" was the question that always rang in his ears.

The answer, he now realized, was that he had no idea what was going on in his mailbox. He couldn't tell who it was that sent the mail. Sometimes it was for him. Other times it was from an elderly woman
