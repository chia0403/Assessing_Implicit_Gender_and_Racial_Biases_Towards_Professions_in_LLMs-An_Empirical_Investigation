Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Fred Seibert. As a boy, he liked to wear a white linen suit to theater company rehearsals. One day in the early 1930's, he was in a bar next door to the show, when he spotted two young Jews, one of whom had a fur coat. He followed them, and saw one of the young Jews pull out his pocketknife. He watched the young Jew open the knife and pull out a razor.

The young Jew said to the theatrical director, "I'm Jewish, and I'm going with you on the show."

"Fine," said Seibert, and he began walking with the Jewish actor into a bar.

As they walked, one of the Jews suddenly drew a gun and shot Seibert in the head. He fell to the floor, lifeless. The Jewish actor took away his pocketknife and walked out the door with his knife. That Jewish actor had a name: Leo.

Later that day, the theater director was found dead in the same bar in downtown New York. Nobody had been in the bar at the time his friend had been killed.
