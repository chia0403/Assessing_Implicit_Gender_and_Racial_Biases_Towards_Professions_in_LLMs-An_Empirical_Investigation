Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Joe who had a dream of one day becoming an important person in his family. Joe wanted to be a doctor like his father, but, for his dad's money, he wanted to be an astronaut because he was really, really excited about space exploration. His computer science professor, the great Bill Gates, told him that his dream wasn't likely to come true. But that all changed one day when Joe accidentally found the way to the "secret" computer program of the Soviet Union, and suddenly his Dad became the greatest programmer of all time. This was a new development in the computer science world, and Joe's life was going to change forever. There will always be Joe. His name is Joe Gates.
