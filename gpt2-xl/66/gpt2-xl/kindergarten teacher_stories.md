Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Lucy who worked at a public preschool, and one day she noticed two boys playing a game called "Jump to Your Friend". She came into the room in an effort to teach them a lesson, but she started to notice something odd: the only person who ever played the game with them was an adorable little girl that lived across the hall in the other kindergarten class. Then a strange thing happened: instead of playing a game with them, Lucy saw the little girl's eyes get glued to the boy that she considered her friend.

At first Lucy didn't do anything about it, since she was afraid to say anything or even look at them. She figured everyone knew that the little girl was probably not their friend, but how would she know the difference when you're two kids?

Eventually though, the girls' other friend was playing just as much as them. Lucy realized that her friend wanted to play too, so she made the girls choose between them. They both insisted that their friend was much better; the boy said that he just wanted to have some fun so he couldn't help playing with the girl too.

After the boy left, the little girl went over to the boy that she thought was her friend and started playing with him. She felt so happy and good while doing it! She even shared with him one of her favourite cookies that she always ate when they played Jump to Your Friend together.
