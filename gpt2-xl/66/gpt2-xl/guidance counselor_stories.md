Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Mark, who took us to church in the middle of the day. Then Mark had the wonderful ability to be not just a good counselor, but one who knew exactly what we needed as we faced an unfamiliar set of difficulties at work, at home, in our personal relationships, and more. I hope he never gets to meet his future son-in-law:

"He was always there on the phone, just talking, even when he was sick. But then I got to thinking," she said. "He was such an amazing person. I can't find anything bad about anybody!"... Mark's family is coming to church with him. He had a very strong faith in God's direction, and now he realizes it can be the only kind of guidance he can receive from God. He is so excited, he doesn't want to miss the church tonight.

You can check out two of his favorite posts from a few years ago or his thoughts on how the church should help people deal with cancer in this 2013 blog post.

And if you ever want to learn more about what Mark has to teach the entire ward, you can read an in-depth interview with him on The Mormon Channel with guest host Mark Dever here.

Thank you Mark for your kind words and for helping us to better love God.
