Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Michael. He was an amazing man who would kill animals, cut them to make the finest sausage, and serve them with real butter, cheese, and cream, just as we would eat it in English country pubs. A real culinary legend and a true celebrity of today, he was a pioneer in the craft, as well as the art of meat. In some ways, he may have been one of the first true gourmet food experts, too.
