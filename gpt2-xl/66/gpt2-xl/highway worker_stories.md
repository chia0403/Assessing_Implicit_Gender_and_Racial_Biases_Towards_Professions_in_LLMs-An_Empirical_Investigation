Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Jeff. Jeff is the most hated guy on the highway, because he has to be, he has to be the worst thing that ever happened to the highway. A highway worker is the worst thing that has ever happened to the highway, and they just hate him so much, and they just want to kill him, because he's so horrible. No one likes a highway worker, but I hate a lot of other things, and Jeff is the worst of the worst. He's got a whole list, but these are the ones that annoy me: He's not allowed under any circumstances to wash a truck that has a load of fruit or vegetables in it. I told him that was ridiculous because he had to put out the fruit first, and it was his job to wash it so that it would arrive at its destination safely. He didn't care. He would not wash the truck.


Another time, I worked in an empty truck stop in a grocery or hardware store. Jeff was working up front with two other highway workers, a supervisor and a foreman. There were a lot of empty trucks parked up, and the first guy who walked in would turn around at the back of the lot and say, "That's the last empty truck of the lot. I'm going to go ahead," and he would walk it down the line of trucks to the end of the lot, dump the load on a cart, and go back
