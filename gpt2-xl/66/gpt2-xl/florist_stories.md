Once upon a time, there was a florist named Bill in a back yard. He had a yard full of flowers. He planted a tree to have some shade and had some flowers around the tree. He liked to have it as a place for birds to sit. His wife would sit next to him and read a book or do something for a while. They had a good time.

A couple of weeks went by and at the end of the week, Bill came home from work wondering if he should cut the tree. At first Bill thought nothing of it.

After a while, he got a new job, and he found himself going to work around the garden. One of the workers told Bill to stop cutting the bush because they weren't allowed to do that.

Bill figured if they wanted the bush cut, he should take it down. One of the other workers was a landscaper and was very passionate about his profession. He loved plants, and he wanted Bill and his wife to be inspired.

The next day, Bill went with the other people to the landscaping shop, bought some pruning shears and he cut down the bush. When the workers noticed the bush was gone, they told Bill their boss would be fired, and that was the end of the joke.
