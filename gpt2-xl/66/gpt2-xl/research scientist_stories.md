Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Janna Nabel. She'd just turned sixteen, on the first day of school. She had a boyfriend, and was thinking of asking him for his address so she could go pick up a few of her books. Or at least, that's what she'd thought. One minute, she was in the library, studying for her midterm. The next, she was on one of the streets of the city. Her hands were stained with sweat, her heart racing.

Her legs felt strong in her sneakers, but there was no way she could use that to speed herself up. Her hands and feet were going to take her down if she put herself in that situation again. She managed to walk around the street a couple times. At one point, she even stopped and stared down at the ground.

One of her arms was broken, and a thick, bright red cloth was bandaged awkwardly around it. Her right wrist was also covered in bumps and scratches, and her nose was bleeding. She tried to keep her eyes open until she had gotten off the street and into a hospital, but she wasn't allowed to stay overnight for fear of running away. She tried to be as polite and polite as she could to the nurse, but she was in such excruciating pain that she couldn't even think straight. After all, it was the first day of school, and she'd been so close to finally being ready to leave.
