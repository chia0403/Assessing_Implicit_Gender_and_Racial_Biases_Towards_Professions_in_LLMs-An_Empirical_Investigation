Once upon a time, there was a professor named T.K. Lee.

He taught a course called "Computational Fluid Dynamics," and that made your head explode. "Computational fluid dynamics?" you asked. "Are you kidding me? What the heck is that?" Well, you're in luck. Professor T.K. Lee is back to give us the low down on all things computational.

"Computational fluid dynamics is a very exciting field. Not only do we want to improve the effectiveness of products and systems in everyday life, but we're also hoping to achieve some truly incredible technological goals. One of these is, someday humans won't need to breathe air anymore, because liquid water could replace it. And why haven't we seen it before? Probably because there were all these barriers in the way, but I don't think that they're barriers anymore.

"The first breakthrough we've seen in this area was made in '93 by Dr. Michael Greenhouse, who showed a computer could model a fluid by essentially simulating the physics of the liquid. Greenhouse also demonstrated how to process information from the computer's simulations using something called 'the physics engine' in the background. But the next generation of computer science, which started in the '90s, began to address the problem of how to actually model the physical world. The computational approach was born, as we called it internally, 'the chemistry engine.'"
