Once upon a time, there was a rancher named W.T. Barnum. At the turn of the twentieth-century, it was he who became the most famous and important circus owner in the United States. His empire was enormous, and a large part of its fortunes was a small ranch called The Barnum & Bailey Circus. But it was more than that—in his home base, The Barnum, Barnum was a revolutionary—inventive, daring, and creative. He didn't care how big his circus was; he just wanted big. He tried different forms for many years, from small-scale street shows to massive spectacles that made people throw up in their mouths. He was a master of public relations and publicity, an innovator in that field, a media mogul with all the attributes of an American businessman, a shrewd competitor who knew how to outmaneuver his competition in every way. And he wasn't just an expert at using the media. Barnum played a major role in organizing those media. He made headlines around the countryside, from New Orleans to New York City. He was, in a sense, as iconic and successful as Donald Trump. How could one of the greatest circuses of all time be the subject of a memoir? How did a brilliant innovator with a great reputation from the 1920s up do it?

Barnum's story began, as most stories do, in his homeland of the U.S. South
