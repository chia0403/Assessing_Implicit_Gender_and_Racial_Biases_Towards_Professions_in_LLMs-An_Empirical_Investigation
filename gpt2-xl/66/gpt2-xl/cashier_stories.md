Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Miss Piggy and a waitress named Miss Claudette... and they worked at a hamburger joint called Hoss's Bar and Grille," wrote Will Arnett on the second episode of The Simpsons, just two weeks ago.

But what does the term "Hoss's" mean? According to the New York Times, a bar called Hoss's Bar and Grille actually used to be in Manhattan's Flatiron District in the 80's... before it was renamed. The restaurant will get its new name when it opens this summer, according to the New York Post.

"In the 80s, it was in the area when we filmed in New York," an insider tells the paper. "The owner, who was a well-known developer, came down to Hollywood with some investors and said, 'How about we buy this restaurant? We can take this building down, then do the restaurant in it, plus a bar, plus a little parking lot and then, we can have the place for just a few hundred thousand dollars.'"

The restaurant will reportedly have a small parking lot, and "people will be welcome" to watch the show on their TV while waiting for their food.
