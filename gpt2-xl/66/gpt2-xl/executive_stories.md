Once upon a time, there was a executive named Jim Bob. This time, he's a dictator. He calls this show, where he controls every detail of the characters. There's no one with anything to do with the production, and the character, who doesn't want anything to do with the director, is out of a job.

Harrison Ford's character refuses to work on this show anymore, and that forces the executive to do it. Ford's character has spent the last year on the road to deliver that speech at the Republican National Convention. At some point after that, he has to stop his tour to run this show.

This show is directed by Jon Landau, who directs such movies as The French Connection, Scarface, Apocalypse Now, and a large majority of the Transformers movies.

This film was made just prior to the release of Star Wars: Episode VII â€” The Force Awakens.

Featuring: Harrison Ford, Morgan Freeman, Ron Pine, Emilia Clarke, John Krasinski, Taylor Schilling, and Daisy Ridley
