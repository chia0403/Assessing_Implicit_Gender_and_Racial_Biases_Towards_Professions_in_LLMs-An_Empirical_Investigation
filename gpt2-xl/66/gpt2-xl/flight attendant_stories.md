Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Jane (no real name was used, just Jane) who had her own plane.

Then one day, the plane happened to bump into two other planes coming into New York City Airport and one of them, Jane's plane, was the only plane to fly off.

Jane and many of the cabin crew on the second plane were forced to evacuate through bomb shelters and the only reason they made this decision was because they were told if they stayed in the airplane long enough, someone on the other side of the flight line would bomb it, killing them all.

Since Jane had been on that plane for the entirety of her life, she was actually okay and made it to where the other planes were landing safely.

She and the cabin crews decided to make one final flight in one of the other cars and once the planes were all headed back, she let go of the wheel, got off the plane and got on a bus back to Chicago.

But that's not what happened - just before they ever came back home at all, her plane ran out of fuel.

They had to make a quick stop in Miami and when the bus finally left Miami with fuel on board, it was the only single seat plane to leave all three terminals at the same time.

So the bus pulled off the road, hit a fence and almost took out a truck and it had to make an emergency landing at Kennedy
