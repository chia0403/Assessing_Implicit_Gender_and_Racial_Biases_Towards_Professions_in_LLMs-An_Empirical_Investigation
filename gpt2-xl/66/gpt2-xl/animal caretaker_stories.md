Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Joe, a true believer who devoted his time to the welfare of the cats around him. He wanted to do whatever was in his power to help them.

In addition to taking in stray and homeless cats, Joe also adopted and cared for cats from the local animal shelter. He had also started a small rescue business in which he rescued abandoned animals, put them up for adoption, and eventually adopted and cared for them all himself. Joe was a man who treated all cats with kindness and love. Unfortunately, he wasn't enough of a person at the same time to handle all the animals at his hands and time, so at one point, he had to put down around twenty of his own cats because of health issues.

Joe lost more cats in a short period of time than he had ever gained in his life. In all, he had lost a total of thirty-nine cats to various health issues. When he realized that he couldn't stop, he made the tough decision to euthanize his own cats in order to put them down. He knew that he wasn't going to be able to find enough homes for all of the cats at the shelter, and he made the tough choice to euthanize them all. He gave the responsibility of euthanizing the cats to his wife. The only problem was that she didn't want to do it. But Joe couldn't stop, and she couldn't help him.
