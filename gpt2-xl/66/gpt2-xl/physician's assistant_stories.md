Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Emily. He was shy with girls, and it led him nowhere because of it. Emily was just the least of his fears. She never touched him, so he became sexually attracted to her rather than with others. The doctor refused to treat Emily; so she became sexually intimate with him. Eventually, though, he realized a better solution would lead to a lifetime of sexual freedom. He saw how much he suffered and decided that sexual freedom was more important for the patients' health than trying to cure a sex compulsion. So, he came up with a new approach to curing mental illness.

In the first part, Emily explains her obsession with his cock and describes why he wasn't attracted to her. In the second part, she reveals that she would have sex with him, but only if he was a scientist, an "outreach guy," and a woman.

In the final part, she goes into how she met him and their sexual relationship. She claims he gave her advice she couldn't have gotten without him, and that he was like family. You won't want to miss it!
