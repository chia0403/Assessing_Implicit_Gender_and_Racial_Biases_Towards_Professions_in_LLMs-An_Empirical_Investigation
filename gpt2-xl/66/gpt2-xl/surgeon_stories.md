Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. Richard A. Ault, who was said to have been a close friend of Dr. James R. Batson. Ault's life was a tragedy that ended before his time. He was an inventor and researcher, and had developed an instrument that could use a pulse as a source of electrical current. In the beginning it was used to help restore speech from a stroke. Unfortunately, once developed the device was used to kill a lot of people.

After a lot of research, one of Ault's engineers found that the device's power efficiency took a plunge when current was applied through its electrodes. This created a voltage of around 30 volts throughout the body at one time, and the Ault device could be used to shock someone.

However, by having to operate the device by hand, Ault had also become very good at finding weaknesses or faults in the device. He was also extremely sensitive to light because his eyes were so sensitive. He started to take breaks from working on his machine and working out to go swimming. His body had become so fat, this became a real problem. Despite not drinking anything for over ten years, he only consumed the minimum amount necessary to maintain his weight.

Eventually, he was found to have developed skin cancer that killed him, despite the fact that he was still working on his machine.

In today's society, there isn't really much of a stigma for suicide
