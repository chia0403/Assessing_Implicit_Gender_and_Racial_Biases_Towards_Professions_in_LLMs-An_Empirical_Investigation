Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Jello Biafra. Jello had a long record of performing at colleges and colleges of all different kinds, and he was in a band called the Jello Biafras. Eventually he found out that the money he earned wasn't enough to pay his bills, so in a sense he got paid more for not being in a band and doing other stuff. They eventually broke up and the money ran out. Jello got a job as a janitor and was pretty happy until some lady came in to complain about him. Jello had the gall to point to the clock on his wall and say that, while she was at the counter, it was 3:36, so if she were really in time, she couldn't miss anything. This made her mad. She got mad and said that she thought it was funny the way he was always in his pajamas all the time. Jello said he didn't care that she didn't like him, because he was on his way to the studio to record his songs. That's all he had to say.

I remember the first time I got to meet him. It was this morning and I was heading out to practice. That morning, I had not seen Jello for some time. As I passed him on the street, he popped out of his coat and stopped me to ask if I could give him a ride to practice and not pay him.
