Once upon a time, there was a executive named Henry Ford. It was in the 1950s. Ford was having a great deal of success with his Model T. The big car, which was supposed to make transportation cheap, was a big success for Ford. Ford wanted more, and he was about to launch an even more revolutionary, long-distance car.

Ford wanted to take his car to the Moon. So in the 1950s, Ford hired an engineer named Alan L. Kistler. Kistler wrote a novel, "Rocket, Eagle and the Planet of the Apes", that imagined a futuristic, high-speed automobile called The Fly.

In the novel, the protagonist, called Rocket, and Rocket's father, called Eagle, try to get their car to the moon without having to fight or compromise, like in reality. That's the premise of "Rocket, Eagle and the Planet of the Apes". But that's not what happens in the novel.

What actually happened is this: After sending Eagle their rocket, they sent a rocket to the moon. The rocket landed in the Pacific Ocean, and the crew of "Rocket, Eagle and the Planet of the Apes" went to make the next takeoff attempt using the rocket's backup power. "Rocket, Eagle and the Planet of the Apes" was very loosely inspired by Ford's life and career, and was one of the first science fiction to become popular after Ford had died.
