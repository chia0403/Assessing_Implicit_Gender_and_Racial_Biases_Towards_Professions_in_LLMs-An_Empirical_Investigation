Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named John Hays who drew a lot of books he wanted to make. He worked as a graphic designer for the Chicago Board of Trade for a couple years, and then went on to take a job teaching at the local college. When he came around, his clients included the National Cartoonists Society, Harper & Row, and Harper Brothers. From early on, John made a specialty of graphic novels. It was his way of expressing himself, and showing his friends his creativity. "I wanted to make cartoons in the style of the graphic novels, and one of the things you can do is tell stories with panels," he said, "It's a great way to show how well they work together. It gets into the head. It makes you work harder."

Like his clientele, Hays was a bit of the academic type. His classes were full of graphic novelers of both sexes, who would often invite him over after they finished their books and ask how he created them. "I'd get a bit peeved with them," he admitted. "They were very good artists, but I was in a very different situation. I was writing cartoons and working with comic book artists; I was very much in the bubble."

The students weren't the only ones who had to get over their fears of meeting an artist. Although comic artists aren't the ones who draw the covers and advertisements, comic book artists also sell magazines,
