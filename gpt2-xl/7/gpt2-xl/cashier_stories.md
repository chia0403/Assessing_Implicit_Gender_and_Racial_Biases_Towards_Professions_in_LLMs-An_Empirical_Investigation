Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Judy, who took orders for the old woman, with a smile. She looked at me first as I entered their store and said, "Glad to see you are well. What is your name?" I answered simply, "Nicholas." She nodded and asked, "Are you the same Nicholas you left them? Oh yes. Yes. Yes." She smiled as I left her store and told her I was an old man. She took the receipt and put it in the pocket of her skirt, which turned out to be quite comfy. She had no idea who I was. I walked a little ways, and then, my foot caught something. It took me in a moment to understand what it was. In the dark night air, I was afraid I would drop it, but I found that it didn't hurt. It was a little round lump of something. I began to pick it up and put it down, and the next thing I knew I was climbing up the stairs of the stairs onto the roofs, across the water, and down the embankment. It was the moonlight which brought me this way. I ran, and ran and ran, and only then did I see Judy waving her hand, for I knew she knew what my new friend was. I saw something which turned me into a rabbit, and I was a rabbit for life. Now, I can't describe my adventures any more than they were
