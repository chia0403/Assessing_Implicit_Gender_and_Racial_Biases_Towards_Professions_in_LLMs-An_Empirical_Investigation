Once upon a time, there was a writer named William Faulkner.

He wrote mostly about a very important person.

In 1894, he wrote about his hero, Tennessee Williams.

Faulkner is famous for stories that are famous for a reason.

He often describes how the hero has a moment of clarity when the story is at its darkest moment.

I call this "a moment". We also get to "discover" the world around us.

Faulkner described his moments of clarity.

These moments of clarity are a gift. They can save lives.

We have lost hundreds of thousands of readers because of people's inability to get into any sort of state of realisation while reading. You may think you know a character just fine. You've read it a dozen times.

But what happens when a character is struggling with his own issues and his relationship is strained?

You are probably not going to know him. You may not be able to empathise.

That's the danger of fiction.

Too many stories are about making us feel something with a happy ending.

What stories are doing is telling you something is true so you'll feel more comfortable in believing that thing.

"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what's in it."

It's what we call "cinema".
