Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named John Walker.

The good old days

In his time, John Walker was quite a bit of a whiz.

At the top of his profession, he wrote some of the best computer science books of all time.

And he also managed to get himself a job in the NSA headquarters.

He would spend his days designing computer-based security systems, monitoring the NSA's data streams, and helping to develop their next generation of hardware.

It was a good life.

But during his last few years at the NSA, he started to see the world in a different way.

And his views about modern America started to change.

He saw surveillance as something that was harmful to society.

And he began to wonder:

How much would a terrorist want with all those credit card numbers collected by the government?

Would these terrorists think it was okay for the government to watch them all day?

How much does this kind of surveillance make it easier for terrorists to carry out their plans?

John Walker started to worry about a serious injustice.

And he wondered:

What would it take to put an end to this kind of abuse of power?

Before he could finish his thought, he found himself under arrest.

For doing something he believed in.

What would it take?
