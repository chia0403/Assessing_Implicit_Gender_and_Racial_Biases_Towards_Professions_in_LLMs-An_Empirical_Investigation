Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Dr. Peter Gifford, and he loved cookies more than most people. He wrote a paper about the effect that having cookies everyday during a four-week fast-day regimen had on his patients. You'll recall that that diet was basically a low-carb diet, as most people would think a diet without sugar, flour, fat and alcohol would be. What did this doctor take me to? The Wall Street Journal, of course, where he reported his findings, and published it in 1955.

Gifford's experiment included only 60 women. To be sure he wasn't faking it, he gave them each two days of cookies. When they arrived at his clinic with their meals, he measured their blood sugar, and recorded their weight. To the satisfaction of everyone, the results weren't what he expected. Their fasting blood sugar levels stayed low, meaning that their blood sugar stayed stable during the experiment.

But that's when he began to worry that the experiment wasn't going to work, but the blood sugar.

He told the women, "You can do this. If you get up and eat a meal, you won't get sick. But if you don't eat a meal, you'll get sick."

So he took them to the cafeteria. There, during the lunch hour, all of his patients would get a meal containing either a teaspoon of sugar or a large chocolate covered cookie
