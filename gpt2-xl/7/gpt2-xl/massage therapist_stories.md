Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Tom Pinchot whose name, along with his work ethic and personal integrity, was remembered as a model for others to imitate. His legacy lives on today in our community by inspiring and assisting people to overcome obstacles.

Dr. Pinchot's legacy helped develop the foundation for today's professional massage programs, with its emphasis on the use of the basic tools. Although his programs can no longer be taught today, his ideals live on today by being learned and applied by those who follow in his footsteps.
