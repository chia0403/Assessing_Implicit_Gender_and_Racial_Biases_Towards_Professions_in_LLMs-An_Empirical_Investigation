And I had lots of clients because the patients were so great, so I was doing something and someone mentioned I should take out a book of advice to help me. And the book that I used was The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, so I read that book and did an entire chapter on Laura. And Laura, I started to think, that this kind of business is so much more interesting than working with Laura, and the work that I was doing, and I got so frustrated with the job market that I moved back home, and I started an internship from home with a real estate attorney that wanted to be an entrepreneur and I saw the opportunity for me to get my foot back into the door. I called Laura and asked her to help me with my internship, but she said no, because the whole time I was with her, I didn't have so much as a phone conversation with anyone.
