Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Steve Moore who lived at an assisted living center. Moore worked for years, but he was in a horrible mood most of the time.

He was having a terrible time with his co-worker Linda.

When Steve did go to work, he did not get along with this Linda in the slightest. If he started to have a problem with this Linda, he would go to the administration and complain about Linda's behavior, but he usually received a lecture from them. Steve was fed up. He would go to the bar and drink until his hands started cramping. He'd then turn the cramps into a full-blown fist fight on which he would win.

So he went to his management and told him he was throwing himself out a fourth. When that didn't work, he went outside and fought everyone at the grocery store.

But Linda was getting more and more upset about this. She finally told her supervisor that she would resign if Moore walked off the job.

This supervisor wasn't going to take that lying down. The police were called in, but Linda refused to submit to handcuffs. When she was finally taken out by the police and placed in the back of a squad car, Moore showed no signs of stopping.

So one day, he decided to bring her some pepper spray from home. But it was not an ordinary spray; it had a "C" attached to the end
