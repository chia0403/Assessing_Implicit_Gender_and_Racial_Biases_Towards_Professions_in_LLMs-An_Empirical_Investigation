Once upon a time, there was a reporter named John Steinbeck. At least, that's what those who remember him say that he was. Some say he was an immigrant, and others say he was Irish or Polish. Steinbeck was a man known for his storytelling skills and writing skills. But, for my money, at the heart of John Steinbeck was a man who suffered from anxiety, anxiety which plagued the man during and after his life. His son, Steve, says that John Steinbeck, a professional writer who was known for being a great storyteller, suffered from insomnia.
