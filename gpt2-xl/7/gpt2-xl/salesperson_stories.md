Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Bob who kept asking me to buy his book. If you want the short version of this story, here it is: I told him I didn't need another book and offered to buy his other book. If anyone has to come across as a snob, I would say he is.

Now that I see the guy's business model for how to make money from you, a few of my other questions spring to mind:

"Do you want me to send it to you in e-mail?"

"Is this a pre-order?"

"Are you going to send me my own hard copy or will I need to ship a second copy with tracking?"

"Is Amazon actually going to send you a review copy or do I need to pay for a review copy?"

"When will you ship?"

"Who is going to cover the shipping?"

"Do you guarantee any discounts? Are you going to give me a discount?"

(As it turns out, I won't be doing any of those actions).

Some of these have also popped up since this article was originally published, and they are things you will see again and again in salespeople's lives. As I said, it's what they are trained to do, and a bad salesperson will usually let you skip those questions. You can't afford to ask those questions, so just get on
