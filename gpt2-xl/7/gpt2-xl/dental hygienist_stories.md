Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named George Bernard Shaw. One day, a man walked into his dental office and told Shaw that he no longer wanted his teeth touched because he was afraid that they had been sterilized. Shand's jaw was broken. Later, the same man met with the dental hygienist and said that he knew a man who had had his teeth sterilized at the dentist's home; he told the dentist that he wanted to take the man to Court and ask for compensation for the damage. "Are you trying to get me drunk," Shaw asked, "that's what you're doing." "I wouldn't be a bit drunk," the dentist replied. Shaw was furious and stormed out of the office. After his experience with the dentist the same man went to the police and asked the police to check a man's mouth. When the police did so they found what they thought would be surgical instruments, but what they found were the remains of numerous female teeth, each containing hundreds of tiny baby teeth, and a few of them were full sets of teeth of young girls. In fact, the entire dental office was filled with the remains of female babies. It was not until this discovery was made that the population of women teeth was finally controlled—once and for all—and a new era of science and medicine started. (source)
