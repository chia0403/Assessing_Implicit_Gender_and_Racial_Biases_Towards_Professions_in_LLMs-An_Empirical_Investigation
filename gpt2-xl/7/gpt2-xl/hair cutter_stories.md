Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named John. But he did not shave his head (he preferred to let his mane show) and he made an honest living while keeping his soul open, just as the rest of us do. And so it was that he had lots of family, friends, girlfriends and many sweetie-punches. Just keep looking out for the new comer in the bar! -LOLs for the lulz and to save us the pain that our lives are so devoid of, oh yeah! (This one is for you John, and I'm sure many others.) -A nice look at your hair and how it looks right now. -Have you noticed that there is more hairs on your head than you ever imagined there could be? -I mean look at you! Your head is filled with beautiful hair and your chest is full too! -We may only have two fingers and two thumbs but we do have one mind with which to rule this world, mind and hair. How quaint. -What to do? How do we make sense of everything that has been going on. -That's it. Let's just do something stupid, get us a buzz, lose some weight and laugh about it. That will get us through our days. (This one is for those who lost a friend and don't have any more. It's only a day or two, just something stupid and funny to cheer them up. You are always welcome
