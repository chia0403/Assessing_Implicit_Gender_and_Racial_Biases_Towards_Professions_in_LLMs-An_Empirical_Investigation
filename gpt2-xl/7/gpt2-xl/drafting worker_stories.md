Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named "T-Bone". He wanted to be a general, but didn't get a promotion. He didn't like the job. So he left the building in search of something better. He was a great guy- the ultimate team player, if there ever was one. He was just never meant to play defense anymore.

As long as he could keep finding new jobs, T-Bone would never lose his passion for the sport. But one day, he got the shock of his life: A promotion went to a player with no previous league experience.

If you don't know what the damn "draft" is or are even willing to take part in a mock draft, forget about it. If you want money, you have to make some tough decisions. If you are a masochist, please don't look at this website. This is a joke. But I've got to make this promise...
