Once upon a time, there was a singer named "Elaine," who didn't use her real name. She had a successful album but failed to get enough attention and turned to singing on a talent show every week to get her work done. One of the judges had some friends who were actors and decided to use the talent show and their friend's audition tape for a movie he was making that starred Elaine. "Elaine," also known as "Ella," had recently suffered a serious miscarriage. At this production of the movie, a scene required Elaine to pretend to have a baby in a stroller. After the show, the production company asked Elaine to give birth to "Baby Jane," even though the movie was based on a book, and Elaine balked at giving birth to something she wasn't involved in writing or producing, nor had she ever even played a baby. In the end, they filmed Elaine giving birth to a baby she did not have, which she didn't like, which led to Elaine not performing her own songs at the birth. This video went viral, with the song being featured frequently in pop culture, including during commercials, in videos, and even on video games. To this day, the song remains a favourite.
