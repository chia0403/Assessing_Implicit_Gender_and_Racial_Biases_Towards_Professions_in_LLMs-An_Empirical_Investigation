Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Dent. He made his living by giving dentistry some of the best teeth he, or anybody else, had ever seen. What a dentist could see and do that Dr. Dent couldn't was pretty great. With the invention of X-rays in the early 20th century, it became possible for dentists to see what was really going on inside the mouth.

In his book "Dentistry: A History of the Art," George W. Campbell describes a time when Dr. Dent was going about his day and decided to make a dental X-ray to see if his teeth were in fact getting stronger or weaker as he used his power under the dentist's chair for dental education (my words, not Dr. Dent's!). He took a plaster cast of his mouth and put it in a machine that made millions of X-rays every day, and he let the machine run automatically about eight hours. When the dental X-ray showed him that he needed cavities filled, Dr. Dent got the cast replaced. He would have never let that happen if there had been a human being doing it.

Dr. Horton took this idea to new heights when he and Dr. Brown were developing ways to make a dental X-ray more powerful and efficient. After much research and many calculations they came up with a simple idea that solved a number of dental problems. What is an X-ray and how does it work
