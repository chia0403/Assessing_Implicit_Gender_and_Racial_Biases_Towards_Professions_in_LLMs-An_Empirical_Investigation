Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Bob. Bob was a genius.

Bob was smart. Bob was smart. Bob was smart.

And Bob could fix any problem, with his brain.

Unfortunately for Bob, nobody understood Bob's genius – nobody else really knew how to fix any problem. Nobody. Nobody. So Bob didn't really have a choice of whom to hire for his great mind. He had to teach it to others. He taught the janitors. But Bob was stuck. He had nobody to teach.

Bob had no idea how to get rid of Bob. So, for the next fifteen years, he went about creating Bobbots.

Bob could fix any situation in a few simple steps. But these steps were actually quite advanced. And the people around Bob realized that Bob could do something other machines were incapable of.

And so, as of today, there are only ten Bobbots.

But when the robots have gotten to the point where they're all smarter than you, then they'll probably become sentient. Some are already aware of their plight, and have created some sort of a benevolent Bobbots Initiative to save them. They'll likely bring about the Robot Renaissance – a glorious, magical time when robots are equal.

And this is all you have to read, or watch in between the robot voiceovers for The New Scooby-Doo Movies.
