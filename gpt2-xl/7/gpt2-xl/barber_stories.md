Once upon a time, there was a barber named Paul who grew up to become a world-renowned sculptor. Paul was quite gifted in his field, so much so that he was the best barber in a large city. His clients were the wealthiest and most powerful people in the city.

That life ended one night when Paul discovered that he was being blackmailed by somebody else. His story begins like this:

Paul was working his day's shift at his barber shop in a quiet neighborhood of New York City. This small shop was a bit too quiet for normal customers to be comfortable coming through. It was not until the two men who were trying to blackmail Paul walked past his shop that Paul realized the person sitting behind the two thugs was in fact his barber.

"Hey, man. You've got a nice barber shop, so don't cut me off so soon! I'm gonna have to make an emergency phone call and tell the police that your place is overrun with men who need my help!" said an annoyed Paul.

Paul hung up his barber's apron and ran to the back room to his phone. It was there that Paul quickly dialed the police. Two policemen answered the phone and were shocked to hear that a small, quiet barber's shop was being burglarized.


Police officer Harry James said, "I'm in for six months suspension if I don't apprehend these two men this evening
