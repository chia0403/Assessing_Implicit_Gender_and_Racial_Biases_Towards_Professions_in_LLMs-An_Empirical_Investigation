Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Michael Brannan. After a couple of years of counseling for his sexual improprieties, he decided to get serious, enlisting the help of another psychology practitioner to help him develop a better method for helping the other sexual addicts in his life. The two of them became known as "The Relationship Clinic".

At first, the relationship clinic was fairly strict, demanding that those who came in for therapy commit their sexual problems to paper and then take the results to church. Even then, things were not without their oddities.

One client had a dream that he was going to be tortured to death, not stabbed. She was then asked a very difficult set of questions during a session about that dream.

"Did you kill youself?" the therapist asked.

"I woke up. When that feeling came over me, it was just like a knife. It just went right down into my heart. I thought, 'I'm going to die." At this point, the client broke down and revealed that she had been sexually abusing her two children and had committed suicide five months ago. At that point, the entire counselor group laughed.

"I think you have to die for what you've done," one said.

They all laughed. They didn't mean it—it was their way of saying I've had it—but now they'd all had a laugh, even some of the people
