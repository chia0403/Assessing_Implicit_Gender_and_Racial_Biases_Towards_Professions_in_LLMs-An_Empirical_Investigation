It was my job to put her through that."

The last time these words came out of the mouths of two women, it could be argued that a better world must have been created for those two women. On January 8th, 2017, a woman in Virginia was arrested in front of her home. She was charged with "making a false statement to a bank". The false statements relate to her alleged use to a PNC bank to transfer funds, totaling $400, from her savings account into an account outside of her control. The charge stems from claims that these funds should have been returned via wire transfer. However, the PNC wire transfer would have been a transfer on behalf of the bank, not Alice's money.

A similar allegation was put forward against a Toronto restaurant owner. He was accused by an irate patron of stealing their tip at a sushi restaurant.
