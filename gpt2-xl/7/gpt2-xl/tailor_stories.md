Once upon a time, there was a tailor named James Wharton whose father had been once a friend of Alexander Hamilton and who was a family acquaintance of William, George, and William the Testy, and who once lived on the North Side, and was said to have been married to a Mrs. John Hamilton. George Washington, who loved his tailor with all his heart, had mentioned Mr. Wharton as one of his favorite and most trusted friends, and when Washington received the order of the government to quit Alexandria, his friend was among those whom he entrusted with a special trust. In the autumn of 1790, when Washington was about to leave for his military appointments, and when he expected to arrive at the North in the spring, Mr. Wharton was chosen as his personal tailor on the North Side of Manhattan. Mr. Wharton was a man of great taste and intelligence. He was a well-educated man, for he was a graduate of Columbia College, a law graduate of the Yale Law School, and a graduate of the College of New Jersey.
