Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Sookie Stackhouse. She had long braided hair, thick glasses, and a wicked sense of humor. She worked as a receptionist at a bar near her apartment, and she liked to relax by knitting while waiting by the phone.

But now Sookie has a boyfriend who isn't sure, maybe even, whether or not he wants to spend more time with her. Sookie spends nights of her life at the hospital, and often her last nights at home, with someone she no longer loves.

Her love life is one of the few things that keeps her going. But it's not just love she'd give anything for. She has a mysterious condition called "multiple identities" that she developed as a child.

So a lot of her friends, even her friends who love her, are wondering what happened to her. What have they lost out on?
