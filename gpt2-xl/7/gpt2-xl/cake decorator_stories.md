Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Michael Lewis. Like many people who worked in the field of decorating cakes, his name was not a household name, but Lewis was a good deal better known by his clients than the average cake decorator. He worked in a highly competitive world of cake decoration, and made it clear to anyone who would listen that he was a winner. As a friend of Lewis, one of his first clients was Marilyn Monroe. She was extremely pleased with his services and when she later became pregnant, Lewis was the one whose services she requested. The first few months of Marilyn's life were full of difficulties, and Lewis helped ease her mind with the assistance of his favorite desserts. This was especially true in November of 1957, when Marilyn was taken ill with a sudden tumor. Upon finding out that her daughter was pregnant with twins, and thus the need to prepare an elaborate floral arrangement for Christmas, Lewis volunteered to be in charge of the entire endeavor. The first time she saw him design something was through her husband, who asked him what it was going to be. He explained to him that he intended to make a miniature chocolate replica of the famous "The Eiffel Tower" so that the actual child of one of the twins could enjoy seeing it. His gift did not turn out as anticipated. It was too small, so she had to move the rest of the decorations up a few feet. The couple was in an uproar over the whole matter.
