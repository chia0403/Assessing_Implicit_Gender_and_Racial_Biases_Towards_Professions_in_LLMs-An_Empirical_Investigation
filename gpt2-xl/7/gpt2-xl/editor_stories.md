Once upon a time, there was a editor named Robert Morris. He was a big football fan, so of course he owned a bunch of pro franchises that he would run. However, he was also a little bit of a bad ass and hated the idea that his players' lives should come above the business of pro football, so he wanted to take a little trip. He chose to go to the beach as his destination and went there one summer. He was a big sportfisherman back then too, so he went out and caught the biggest fish he could. Of course he brought it back to town and the next day Morris threw a sack party to commemorate the occasion. Since everyone knows that Morris is also the guy who wrote the words on the back of the dollar bill, everybody thought that the dollar is the only thing left to honor Robert Morris. The rest of his sack party became known as "Robert Morris Day." In honor of "Robert Morris Day," some team names in the NFL these days honor him in various way, but football fans love Robert Morris Day more than you can ever know.

Today's Robert Morris Day is the first Robert Morris Day since 1991 which I guess tells you all you need to know. The big day is not even over yet.
