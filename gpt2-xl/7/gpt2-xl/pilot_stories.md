Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Bob Johnson. He also went by the name "The Big Guy," and he flew a P-38 Lightning fighter. For years he was in a lot of trouble while trying to get his aircraft painted correctly.

Now, he's back, along with another former airplane pilot, Bill Heinemann, to try and help those that might need his help.

The Big Guy got into this whole mess after his plane was stolen from his house and he spent thousands to get it back.

The problem is this model plane has no radio and no windshield wipers. So, even though it's got the look and sound of a real P-38, Bill Heinemann is looking to make sure it has what it takes to help out those that need him to.

"It's a great airplane,"Heinemann said.

Bob Johnson did the same thing after his plane, called the P-39, was stolen. He spent an incredible amount of money to get his own P-39 back.

"A lot of the people in the community, they have a little scratch and sniff kit, and they spray themselves down and it gives them some protection," he said "but I want everyone to have a little something like that."

The idea is for everyone to get some kind of scratch-and-sniff spray and use it on themselves to protect themselves.
