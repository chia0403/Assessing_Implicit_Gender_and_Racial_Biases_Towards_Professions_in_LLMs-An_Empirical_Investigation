Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Tom, who made his living by building houses. Now, though, he has a whole new line of work. "This job is like building houses, which I can do on my own time, without any supervision of a day," Tom says.

He lives out of a van in the forest. He takes no salary. The only way to learn how to make furniture for people is to show them how you do it, and then get feedback from them and learn from them, so he teaches them. And now he's making a line of furniture entirely made by himself. This "House of Wood" line is now in 100 locations across the country.

When people ask about it, Tom tells them: "It takes at least a year for a house to be built. I spend at least a month every winter to set out a huge area of bare branch, then move it out, build a new house, and then repeat the process."

This process has taken the Carpenters Union 100 years to perfect. "And not being organized, it just sort of happened," says Tom. "So what we're trying to do is combine what works in our union—the art of working with a team—with the knowledge of how to build houses, and give the public the opportunity to learn that, if you can't build it yourself, you can hire me to build it."
