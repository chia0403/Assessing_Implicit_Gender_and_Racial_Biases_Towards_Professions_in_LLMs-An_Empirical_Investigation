Once upon a time, there was a professor named Edith. A professor who taught the class of 'Videogames as Art'. While in the very beginning she could not grasp just how much games really needed to evolve and adapt, she found herself constantly adapting her own theories on how to improve these games to match the player's needs and desires. What she began to realize, though, was that the student herself was largely irrelevant, because the game that was to be played was only a tiny fraction of what a gamer actually did every day. The games themselves were more important than the student. What the student did to a game was mostly for pleasure but, ultimately, all games were for a player.

I don't mean games to be defined by who plays them, because I know I'm probably breaking a lot of minds here. I simply mean that to understand games in what they are, we don't really have to try to understand games through the experiences that games create. We can see the value and potential they will have in just about every aspect of our lives. Instead of trying to understand them for what they will become, I find that simply thinking in terms of how they work and how they can be used will always lead to more value finding.
