Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named George Lunt. When the story was told, nobody could imagine the poor animal whose days had been so filled with suffering would die a peaceful, natural death. The death of an animal was a common occurrence -- not an unusual occurrence, even if it seemed the way George didn't want it to happen. But George eventually caught the problem -- they were just giving their animals too many antibiotics. Now, however, his efforts weren't enough to bring down the toll.

The CDC has just released a new report that tells us how badly things have gotten, and what, exactly, vets and owners need to do about it. According to this study, the problem is worse than previously thought. The number of deaths, not just in cats and dogs alone, but in other species, including horses and pigs, doubled between 2010 and 2011. The problem is so bad that it has become hard for veterinarians to do their jobs effectively -- and it is even a problem for their family members too.

According to CDC data, the rate of antibiotic-resistant strains found in both dogs and cats is now about 50 percent, which is far higher than the CDC's previous estimate of roughly 30 percent. This has resulted in more than 2 million pet infections in the last three years, and now includes about 21,000 deaths annually. Of course, pets are an important part of many families, and not all owners are aware of the risks their pets face
