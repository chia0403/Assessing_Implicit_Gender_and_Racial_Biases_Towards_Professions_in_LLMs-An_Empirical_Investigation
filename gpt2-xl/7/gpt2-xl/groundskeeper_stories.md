Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Bill who spent his days cleaning the gardens. One day he was at his desk, when he saw a small, green-and-purple flower. "This is the flower of the Holy Trinity," he said to himself. "I am sure it's the flower of Christ."

This was the morning after. "It was the beginning of a new year," Bill would tell his family, when he finally found what he wanted. What happened? God took him by the hand, and the groundkeeper became a young nun. What does she do now? What has changed about him?

For decades, the church and Catholic leaders refused to give up the teaching on birth control and abortion. The Vatican had been in control of the church for years; yet so many believed it was right. As recently as 2012 a woman in China was still being denied an abortion because she was not married.

A priest, St. Louis de Montfort, wrote for the New York Times on the Catholic resistance at the time:

"In a year when two bishops, including the most influential, Archbishop Lefebvre, of Lyon, France, insisted that 'pregnancy is not a crime,' more than 200 Catholic bishops and priests and scores of archbishops and papal representatives of other religious orders and of the pope took a stand for family planning, a key issue of the culture wars of the past generation."
