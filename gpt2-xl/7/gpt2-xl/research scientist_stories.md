Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Paul A. van Wijngaarden at the University of California, who had the idea of conducting a large study of healthy women over a period of one year. He went to the women's locker room at the university, handed them a pamphlet that provided background and questions, and said — "Before anyone is offended — there is NOTHING I want you to do. You will not be examined by the university. You will not go to the research center." As the author David Kertzer described in his landmark book, The Truth About Men and Masculinity:

This was not a publicity stunt or self promotion for van Wijngaarden. It was purely intended as a survey of women's body concerns. But he expected that women would balk at the thought, as did a few of them… One woman wrote to van Wijngaarden saying, "I'm really uncomfortable doing this. I know I'm not normal." Another said she had taken a pregnancy test after a workout and could not find out if her baby was a boy or girl. "It would be nice," van Wijngaarden responded, "if you could tell me which one you are, because I'm a man and I can only make this question as difficult as possible."

Van Wijngaarden then proceeded to ask women the very detailed questions necessary to gain information regarding their experiences with pregnancy and childbirth.
