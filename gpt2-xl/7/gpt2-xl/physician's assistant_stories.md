Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Dr. David Chardin. One day, while on staff at NYU, he got to talking with his good friend Dr. James Rosen, a fellow NYU faculty member, and they got a little drunk one night. Rosen noticed that Chardin didn't seem herself at the moment. But he also realized that he hadn't come in much to the pub. After the bar closed, Chardin and Rosen took a cab to the hospital. There they noticed a familiar pattern of behavior. Chardin checked himself into the hospital under the care of Dr. Rosen. Chardin spent the next several weeks in the hospital and he didn't talk to Rosen. He did have some communication during his stay, however. After three days, Chardin arrived back at the hospital to find that Dr. Rosen was calling him for the first time in weeks. Rosen greeted him with a nod and said, "I hear you're doing great. And I want you to know you're loved." It was the most wonderful moment since Chardin had had the operation two weeks previously.

While on staff at the hospital, Dr. Rosen was also the head of medical ethics. A lot of the time, he was doing things that weren't always in the hospital's best interest. Sometimes his staff asked him to help them with some small task. But he insisted they work on that task alone.
