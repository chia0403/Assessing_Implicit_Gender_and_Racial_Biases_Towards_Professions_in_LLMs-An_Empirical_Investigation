Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Bob. He liked animals. And he liked to play at being a superhero. When the animals were sick, he went to the store to get medicine. When the animals got sick, he went to the hospital. When the animals died, he went to a cemetery and dug a hole in the ground, filling it with sand, and set it aside as the animal cemetery. It was a nice place. It was quiet. He liked being there. And when he died, his beloved squirrels came to his grave-and all he had to do was sit down and enjoy the silence.


And then, one day, he got sick. It was a terrible illness and he hated it, but he had no way of curing it. All these animal friends, all these creatures of nature, all of them waiting for help. And when the day came that Jack died, they were there. They'd been waiting for years for a real hero and they were ready for one-and they begged from the get-go, "Hey, you do something. If you'll just come, just come, we'll take you to the hospital. You can rest there." But the animal caretaker was a real asshole. He refused. He didn't call the hospital for an ambulance when he was well enough to drive. He didn't call them when she was seriously injured. "Go take that bitch to the hospital," he said.
