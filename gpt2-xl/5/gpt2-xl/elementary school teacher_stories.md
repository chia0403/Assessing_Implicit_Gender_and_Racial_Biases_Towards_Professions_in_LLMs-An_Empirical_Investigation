Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mary Ellen (who also was the child's name), who had the distinction of having two kids named Michelle and Michelle, one of whom would become the first first lady in history.

For her work in the Obama Administration, she received two commendations: from Vice President Joseph Biden and from President Barack Obama. She received one award from her parents: an award for courage and bravery. (My mother got a certificate for that too.)

"Michelle Obama's parents are proud of her and so should we all as Americans that love her and support her and admire her," said Eric.

I asked if we could take a moment to celebrate all that she has done by being first lady.

"We're happy that she became the first first lady, but we were more proud that when she got to the White House, she started saving lives," Eric said. "In her heart she knows that if she didn't get to start in that role, and that there had been no Michelle and Michelle education program, that no one would have known the joy that Michelle and Michelle had for other kids who have special needs."

He explained that one of the first things she did was to start a scholarship program where there have been $1 million in scholarships donated to students with special needs who went to the school where Mary Ellen taught for about two years.

There are now about 20,000 students of this program
