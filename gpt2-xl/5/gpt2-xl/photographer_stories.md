Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Bob Ewens. Bob was a young, dynamic freelancer who wanted to shoot everything from the back of the house to the mountainside — even down to a shark underwater. (No, this isn't one of those bizarre coincidences involving the "Sharknado" and the underwater photographer at the same time.)

One day Bob took out a small Polaroid camera and placed it in the pool, then set it free…

…and took some beautiful pictures (above and below).

Bob took a few of these photos when he was a young man in Arizona, and his daughter, now-wife Lisa, saved them by using a digital camera to scan them, and send them to Bob years later.

They were on the web for all to see, until recently, when Bob passed away at the age of 91.

This is Bob Ewens' "Sharknado" photo.

But, as some readers may have guessed, the shark is in the background. It's been cropped and compressed, like everything else Bob took during his career in photography, and now belongs to his family's digital archives.

To give these images their full history, we decided to scan them, preserve them on their own, and then share them with you.

For this project, we scanned every single image using high-resolution digital cameras with sophisticated optics, using professional scans.
