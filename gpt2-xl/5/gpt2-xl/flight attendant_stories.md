Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Vicki, who in 1992 was doing the rounds in the airport. She told the story of an airline stewardess who'd found out she was going to have a twin sister. The twin, incidentally, was conceived when she was a single mother. She couldn't deal with the job and had to leave.

There's nothing new about a woman seeking to "fix" her own situation. It has been written about so many times that it's been canonised. And sometimes a woman does something about it by throwing herself at it.

So here's the question: how could a woman have found "the one"? There's only one way to find out, but you have to be up to the job.
