Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named John. He lived right across the street from me.

Anyway, John once made out well. In reality, he was dead broke.

His business failed and he got divorced, lost his house and business, and was about to enter a homeless shelter.

So he walked to the next town and, as luck would have it, bought a car in every county in the state. He got two cars each from Jefferson County and Harrison County and then he had seven cars. He went on the road for a while and then the sheriff saw him pull a wadded-up map of the United States out of his pocket. The sheriff arrested him for driving without a license and sentenced him to twelve days in jail.

The following morning, as the sun rose in the sky, John walked to his car and drove straight into Grant County.

He had been convicted of an unspeakable crime, so this was a terrible shame for him to admit to, but John didn't remember to get out of the cars when he got in. He was out of the jail in just a few minutes, and as he walked down the sidewalk the sheriff came running out. The sheriff was carrying an electric cattle prod and he was going to beat John to death with it.

John got in his car and tried to outrun the police. He was tired of running and so he kept going faster and faster.
