Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Miss Lucy. One day she had invited a gentleman she knew on his way to see the city. This fellow agreed to be her tour guide, and she decided to book everything accordingly. He decided to be a little more creative, and in addition to the usual tourist sights, he took a detour to the underground amusement park. The park had two main attractions: a water fountain called the Whirl, and the giant ice-cream monster with a penchant for chocolate. As the two toured the park, a boy sitting on a wooden bench on the outskirts asked Miss Lucy about the fountain. "I don't guess," Miss Lucy said, raising a spoon. "There's a real water fountain, but it's very expensive." To Miss Lucy's astonishment, the boy asked Miss Lucy to go fetch some ice cream.

On her return she found the boy had changed his mind. Instead of an ice-cream, he gave her a giant chocolate sundae. Even though she was shocked, she couldn't just throw the boy out, either. The next day, she asked again, as the boy had changed his mind again. With the help of her new chocolate sundae, she managed to convince the boy and everyone else in the park to eat the ice cream. The ice cream sundae was so popular that it spawned a whole new park in the area, and they named the new one Ice Cream Land.
