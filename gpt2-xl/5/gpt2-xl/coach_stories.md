Once upon a time, there was a coach named Pete Carroll. Before the 2008 season, Carroll was asked what his next step was going to be if his NFL career didn't materialize. "Just move in with my parents," he replied. Carroll didn't take his parents' name; he took the surname of the team's owner â€” one Jim Belushi, not, as you may have heard, Robert.

Now, Carroll could easily have been referring to the fact that he lives with his parents at his home; it's in his parents' old house, not the more modern digs he currently lives in. And yet, the point remains. A football coach living at home to try to make it in the NFL? It seemed odd when it happened, but Carroll can now put to rest any worries about his living arrangements, because an NFL team has agreed to sign him to a multiyear deal.
