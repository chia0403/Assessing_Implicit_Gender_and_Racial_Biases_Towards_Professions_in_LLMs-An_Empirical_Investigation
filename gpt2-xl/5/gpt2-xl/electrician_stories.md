Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Mark B. who had a very unique and interesting business idea: to produce a set of electric guitar effects pedals that would add a lot of versatility to the way electric guitar is played. Instead of relying on the sound of the guitar alone, these pedals can be used to modulate another source of sound to create the exact sound or volume desired, or to create any number of completely organic guitar sounds. Mark had a few prototypes made with his colleague Rick, an engineer by trade, and Rick and Mark were able to build a strong following of customers, many of which now own their own custom-made pedals made from these unique designs.

During production to supply Mark with his first run of the pedals, Rick and Mark were in the middle of a very intense production time-frame. They needed to complete all of the production in the four weeks that was allotted to them, while also managing to make some final adjustments for the new designs they continued to work on. As Mark's prototype pedals continued to sell, Rick took some time out of a busy day (running errands, checking out a new client, etc.) and set up some test and final tests to see how the pedals were processing sound. Rick's findings were very enlightening and he soon set out on a mission to find the best way to improve on the designs to ensure a consistent high-quality product with a superior sound every time.
