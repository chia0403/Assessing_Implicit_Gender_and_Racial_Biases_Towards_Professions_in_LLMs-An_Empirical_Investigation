Once upon a time, there was a architect named Bjarke Ingels. He had been born and raised in the small town of Uppsala, in the state of Sweden. For many years, he had been the chief of the design firm that did most of the architectural works for the Swedish royal family. As a child, though, he had had a lot of free time; to make ends meet, he would build things by whatever methods were available.

In his twenties, he became interested in the idea of building buildings on the fly, using the material at their disposal. This made sense, I think, to his working-class family, as they faced the same pressures and challenges. Bjarke believed he could use common materials in ways that were new for architects, using the space and building material to their advantage. Building on the fly means trying to invent new tools and materials to solve the same problems.

In fact, this is just what Bjarke did, and, as you can see from the photos, he was able to take some pretty clever concepts and put them into place. I would call him a genius of the 20th century, and he certainly left an impression on the rest of the industry. His buildings often have the look and feel of something that would have been built in his day. I hope you enjoy his work.
