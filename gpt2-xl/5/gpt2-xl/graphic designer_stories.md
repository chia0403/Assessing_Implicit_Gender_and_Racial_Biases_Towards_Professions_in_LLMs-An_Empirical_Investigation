Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named John Stiles, who worked for both the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals while designing team logos. His work can be found on both teams' sites, so you can use it for free. When Stiles left his job in 1996 to form his own design company, he decided to design an all-star team, which he did.

The first design he brought to the team owners was very simple, featuring the logo and uniform of an all-star baseball team. Unfortunately, the team got off to a rough start, and John Stiles soon went away from making all-star teams altogether.

But it wasn't until he was working as managing partner of a small company designing computer games that one of his new company's most popular (and most ambitious) projects happened back in the early 2000s. Now Stiles is back as designer for the Yankees, which is awesome.
