Once upon a time, there was a baker named L.W. (no, not that L.W., the other one) with whom I often worked. We got along well until he decided he wanted to bake a big loaf of bread. We thought this was a great idea until it turned out that he was an idiot.

"I don't want to bake bread," he said. "I want to bake a piece of cake! I want to bake an ice cream cone! And after that, I want to bake a muffin!"

No one said more than that, so we were really surprised. I asked L.W. where his cake idea came from and why he wants to bake something that will take an hour to bake.

"Cake is a nice thought, but I don't want to bake that!" he replied. "I would rather make an ice cream cone."

That is like, my God, he needs a lot more help and support and encouragement in life than he's learning.

What do you think? Is baking a cake a bad idea and just a big mistake that should NEVER EVER again be attempted?
