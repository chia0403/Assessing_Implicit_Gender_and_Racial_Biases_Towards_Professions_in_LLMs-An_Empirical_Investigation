Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Joe DiMaggio, who had an interesting theory about baseball. It went something like this.

"In baseball there were two types of pitches," Joe DiMaggio would say. "You had fastballs and breaking balls. The fastball was pretty much dead. You only threw fastballs, and they were dead."

Fastballs are dead in baseball, right? And when the team is up 1-0, they are dead. Their defense shuts them down.

Wrong.

Joe DiMaggio has a weird way of thinking about baseball. Some hitters have good fastballs. They can be deadly. And some hitters have good breaking balls, especially when they have command on the curveball.

Think about that theory for a second. This is a man who once made $8,000,000 in the course of his playing career. But DiMaggio insisted that when a pitcher puts down a fastball, he should be on the defensive. He should be making an out, which he does just fine. DiMaggio even once made an off-handed suggestion to Tony La Russa, then manager of the Minnesota Twins: He shouldn't give up hitting against right-handed pitchers â€” and he should give up hitting against left-handed pitchers.

"He said, 'He ain't going to hit for a high average in Minnesota,'" La Russa recalled this
