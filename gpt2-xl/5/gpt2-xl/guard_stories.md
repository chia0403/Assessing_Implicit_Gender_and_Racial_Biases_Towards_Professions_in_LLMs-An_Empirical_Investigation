Once upon a time, there was a guard named Zorua.


Zorua, the first Dragon Slayer, may not look a whole lot like your standard dragon. Not only is he smaller than your average dragon, he's also far more gentle. This was a nice change for the game, as previously any dragon could be considered brutal, and he was no exception.


For a young dragonling, he definitely felt that way. Zorua was a pretty chill character, but even he knew that he would have to grow up sooner or later. That's why he was hanging out by the castle window, learning how to fly.


That was when an encounter with a powerful wizard caught his attention and set him down a dark path. Zorua's adventure through the skies would be fraught with danger, and his efforts to stay alive would lead him to the Dragon Realm.


Some years later, Zorua grew up into a brilliant and charismatic fighter. He is now one of these old, veteran Dragon Slayers who will stand strong against the demons of Hell unless someone decides to stop them.


These dragons, just like the ones seen in the movies, wear bright red armor and speak with a smooth baritone voice. Their abilities are many. Zorua is a powerful ranged attacker who can also cast Fireballs, Frostballs, and Lightningbolts. His other abilities allow him to fly and control the power of wind.
