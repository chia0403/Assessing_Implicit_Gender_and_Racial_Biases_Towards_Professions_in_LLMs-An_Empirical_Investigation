Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Joe. You know what, they said his food tasted like it'd been picked before the sun popped out of the sky. His meats were small and tasteless to the point that he couldn't be trusted. In spite of this, people ate his food and got sick. One day, a guy bought some meat with bones in it and got sick just as Joe left the store. The meat became so popular that Joe's meat was eventually banned in the community he was once a part of. Over time, Joe began to get his teeth ground down by other people. This was an attempt at control, but the meat became tainted with impurities that turned his meat into a disgusting, disgusting mess."

He pulled his chair closer and placed his hand on his forehead. "It was no longer just Joe but everyone. Some thought Joe was just too popular for them to be allowed to eat, like someone else's food. Many of these people died because of Joe's food. I don't know why some people eat without fear of getting sick, but all people do is eat. If I never eat, then I won't need to get sick." He stared down at his hands. It was the most painful thing he'd felt in his entire life.

The last of the dishes were placed at the sink, and the meal started.
