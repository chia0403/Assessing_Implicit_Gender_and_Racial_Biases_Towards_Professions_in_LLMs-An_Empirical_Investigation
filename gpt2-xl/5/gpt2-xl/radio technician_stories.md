Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named John Deere. So, what happened on Radio, John? Well, if you're listening to a broadcast at 1 am, and it was only a one-day event, you'd find that the call- sign of your favorite country group had changed to "Radio John". It's pretty cool, you guys!

1. "The Great Pacific Air War (Pacific War)", CBS Radio, 2-6-1950. This was some sweet war, folks! This was aired on the CBS "Daytime" signal. As part of the "Radio War" series, CBS would air live broadcasts during wartime. Unfortunately, they weren't called War broadcastsâ€¦they were called "Daytime" broadcasts. This program covered the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Battle of Okinawa and the invasion of Japan.

2. "The Last Starfighter Attack of World War II", CBS, 1-20-1946. If you watched a war movie in the theater in the 1940s, chances are you've seen this one. The last few minutes of the movie were an "unbelievably awesome action sequence" that you probably have never heard before. But after that, it simply became a very good ol' fashioned war movie with lots of action, stunts, explosions, plane and helicopter crashes, and many scenes involving a lot of gunfire. It was filmed during the Battle of Guadalcanal in the Japanese Empire
