Once upon a time, there was a cashier named John Wayne. Unfortunately, John Wayne had a problem. On Thursday, October 16, 1978, John Wayne was killed in his car on a Florida highway. He was going to cash a huge check to buy an island in the Bahamas. The news of John Wayne's death caused widespread panic in the United States. Everyone, people included, wanted to cash the check, but how could a person who was already dead cash billions of dollars that weren't even there?

This event would later be referred to as the John Wayne Cashier Disaster.

It might seem that the John Wayne Cashier Disaster was caused by a bad check that couldn't be paid back. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, it's extremely unlikely that this calamity occurred in part due to some bad checks.

John Wayne's biggest problem before he died was a stroke. The reason that John Wayne checked the wrong check at the bank to buy the island was because he had had a stroke in 1984. But the stroke went away after a couple of months, and after he regained his health, John Wayne started the cashiering business.

So really the John Wayne Cashier Disaster wasn't really caused by bad checks. Rather, it was caused by a stroke.

This is not to say that there are no bad checks going out to banks. This is why it is critical for people to know the types of paperwork checks
