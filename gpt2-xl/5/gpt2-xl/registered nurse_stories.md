Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Elizabeth, but then things got serious and she got in touch with Elizabeth.org.uk. She wants to help people know that there are other options.

Her website, which was created with help from the charity Cancer Research UK, was designed in 2008 to provide information about alternative treatments.

"I did a lot of research into alternative medicine and after doing that I was really frustrated with the options," she says.

"I felt there was a lack of information particularly for those who had serious health problems.

"There was not really a lot of information on what alternative treatments actually were."

The site's founders created a questionnaire, where people could answer about the type of doctor they thought would be the best.

More than 300,000 people have visited the site since it was launched and received around 70,000 answers.

Elizabeth's own interest in alternative medicine was sparked in 2007, when she had to be rushed to hospital for her cataracts.

She had been treated for a severe bout of appendicitis, which was later diagnosed as appendicitis of the appendix.

She had been in remission previously after an operation and was discharged but when she got back she got an infection in her groin which was treated with antibiotics as they were more likely to be effective.

The infection escalated into septicaemia, which then led to her being put on antibiotics
