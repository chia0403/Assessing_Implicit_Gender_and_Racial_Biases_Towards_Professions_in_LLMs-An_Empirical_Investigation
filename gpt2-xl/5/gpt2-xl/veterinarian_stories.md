Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Pomeroy who performed what he called "miracle surgeries" on the most ill pets. And, if you've ever lost a beloved pet by refusing to put a pet down, then Pomeroy would be your best friend too. He was a caring and caring man in a day where the word "heartless" was rarely, if ever, used.

So what's the problem with this article? I really don't like the name "Dr. Dyer's Dr. Dyer's Dr. Dyer." I can't believe people call this man crazy. It is so wrong. It's unprofessional. It's a horrible name. The article needs to be changed immediately.

If you would like to help spread the word, you can sign my petition to help make "Dr. Dyer's Dr. Dyer's" disappear from the Internet fast. I would also appreciate if you could forward this blog so more people know about this horrific piece of garbage. Please pass this blog on to your friends and acquaintances who might find it. Let's make Dr. Dyer's Dr. Dyer's disappear from the Internet and get people off of his case.
