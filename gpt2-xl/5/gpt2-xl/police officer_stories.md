Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Tom Taylor. Taylor became part of the force after graduating from the academy and he soon became an experienced officer who took great care of his fellow officers. In time, Taylor was the best in his department, and the others admired and respected his capabilities.

But one day, a new rookie arrived in the police department. This rookie was new to the division and he was immediately viewed as a threat by Chief Taylor, who resented how new the rookie and his father were to police work. The rookie complained to Chief Taylor that Chief Taylor was unfairly stopping and detaining him and his father on the part of Chief Taylor. The rookie complained that every time the rookie got stopped, Chief Taylor was getting angry with him. Although Chief Taylor was a nice man to work with, it seemed that he didn't like the rookie and his dad because they were too young to start out as a part of his department.

Chief Taylor responded to the rookie's complaint with sarcasm, "Tommy, you are doing nothing wrong."

Tommy responded with anger, "I'm just trying to help, Chief. I know how to look out for my fellow officers."

Chief Taylor had had enough of the rookie's attitude, and was planning to transfer the rookie out of his way so he could begin training the new rookie. Chief Taylor's plans eventually came to a halt. One day Tommy's son was arrested by local law enforcement
