Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Charlie Black, who was fired from his job after it occurred to you he might be a bit of a loser. You can't trust janitors; the people who clean your floors and wash your sheets are really sadistic, and they don't work for free; besides, a lot of janitorial staff are drug addicts; furthermore, there are lots of ways to gain their trust that you aren't aware of when you hire them; and finally, Charlie, with all this information at the ready, had just the right mix of bad habits, bad attitude, and weird personal hygiene to make you want to hire him as your janitor when you start working at this new company that you started. So you hire him, and he does a very good job, but just as you get comfortable with him there comes some big change that makes you consider firing him (no reason) and hiring someone a little bit better (yes, you probably should hire that person), and now you are faced with the question of whether to hire Charlie as your janitor again.
