Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. Laura Gottlieb. She was very dedicated to helping kids and people who suffered as a result of abusive relationships, trauma, abuse of any kind. She taught her clients how to cope using acceptance and compassion. In this way, she was able to help people recover from their abusive relationships and even bring clarity to their lives.

Now that's called self love.

This same kind of self love works for people who want to get better from their addiction. It helps them feel better before they seek treatment, and gives them the courage they need to go into treatment.

And yet, I can feel many people are having second thoughts about treatment and their self love. It is quite normal to have that kind of doubt, and I have always encouraged this. It is also normal to have other thoughts that come into your mind: "If I didn't have a addiction, I wouldn't have any doubts. I wouldn't waste my time. I would just be OK." That's the biggest thing people forget sometimes.

The thing is, no matter what, there is always the problem you are trying to solve. It's just what you get at the end of the day. It never actually was that bad to begin with.

So no, you may not be "OK", but you are in recovery. Don't give up. You are still in it. Get help and use your self love
