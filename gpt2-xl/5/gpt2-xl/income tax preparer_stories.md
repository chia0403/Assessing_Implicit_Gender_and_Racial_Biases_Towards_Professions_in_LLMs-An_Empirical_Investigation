Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named William Blunt. The tax preparation business isn't what it used to be. And for those paying their taxes with a check or a credit card, the world is changing, slowly, almost imperceptibly.

A recent report from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation shows how important tax preparation has become in today's society. It shows that more than 35% of people over 55 have used their tax preparer. This is up from 9.8% of Americans over 55 in 1990.

The report also shows that one in six Americans has done their taxes since 1995.

The report shows some interesting statistics:

One in three individuals has prepared their taxes since 1995.

Of individuals using their preparer, nearly all (96% and 96% respectively) paid the amount calculated in the first year they had taxes to file.

The report also shows how the use of the tax return preparers is most widespread in low- to middle-income households. The most common income range in which a preparer is used is from $10,000 to $50,000.

This is a significant shift in the tax preparation business. In the first three months of 1995, approximately 18% of people between the ages of 35 and 64 had prepared the 2010 tax returns by using a tax return preparation company such as TurboTax. By 2010, this increased to 43%.
