Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Thomas Jefferson who really, really did not like the idea that we get to decide that someone cannot marry who they love."

And what is this? Well...this guy's just been a bit, um, selective in who he wants to bring in for this event. So far, the list of participants include:

-- Alan Keyes.

-- Jim DeMint, who represents South Carolina in the House of Representatives but is also Chairman of the Heritage Foundation (and an opponent of marriage equality)

-- Charles C. W. Cooke.

-- Sarah Palin.

As a gay man, I am offended by all of them, but I will be the worst. I am so sad, and I'm sorry to hear that people are having to suffer these indignities...but it seems like they are the "mainstream" and those poor sods are just left to suffer silently. I'm so sorry that this is what the country decided to get our government to support, but it seems like you did not even try to ask this group of people for more reasons to throw in their support, but if you had, I can promise you that we would have heard even worse reasons for them
