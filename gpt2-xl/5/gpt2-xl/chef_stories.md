Once upon a time, there was a chef named Danny Wallace who made pasta. If that wasn't enough, his mother, an artist known as Alice, also made pasta. She was a vegetarian, and Wallace's cooking was all about simplicity. He didn't just stir the sauce, he kept the pieces a bit smaller than the norm so the pasta stayed more "liquid," which was, of course, an oxymoron.

"We learned to cook this way," says Danny Wallace. "It's the pasta with no sauce."

At first taste, it's hard to imagine how anything could be better than that. However, that's actually part of the appeal. There's no sauce that, in the name of foodies, requires one. It's not "authentic" or "vintage," it's simply delicious, with just the right amount of salt.

You might not want to think too deeply about the origins of this dish. It's an invention, the only good thing that can be said of itâ€”which makes a lot of pasta worth celebrating.
