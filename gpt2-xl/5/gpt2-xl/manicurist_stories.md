Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named John. John worked at a salon called the House Of Pomegranate. Here is an extended interview with John from his book "The Art of Hair: A Gentleman's Art"

My mom always encouraged me to learn how to cut my own hair. She believed that if I was going to get the education to do anything here in a professional setting, I needed to be able to do it.
