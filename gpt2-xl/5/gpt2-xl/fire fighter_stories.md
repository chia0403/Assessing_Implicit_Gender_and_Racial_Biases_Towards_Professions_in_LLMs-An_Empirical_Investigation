Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Tom, who was named after his father: Tom "Tom" Jones, a former firefighter.

One day, he realized that he had accidentally killed a dog. When he asked his partner for an explanation, he was told that only two dogs live in the house. Tom was horrified and thought: "My dad didn't kill a dog." When the fire department took him to his father's home, Tom was told that he killed the dog.
