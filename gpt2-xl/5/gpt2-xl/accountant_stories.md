Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Charlie, who used to work at a firm called P&G. One day, he stopped to pick up Charlie's son Josh, who was visiting, but then forgot to drop him off at school. Charlie didn't have an answer for him. So Charlie put some gum in a plastic bag and left it in the car for the boy to find. When Charlie returned, the police had pulled the car over, and they were questioning the driver about the gum, which was not stolen but misplaced. When they got to the car, Charlie was still in it and in his underwear. So Charlie told them his story, but they told him they weren't interested.

That was the last time anyone saw Charlie's kid from that job. No one came to see the car until Charlie's son was 18 and came up to visit. When the son asked what he'll be doing in life, Charlie replied, "I'll be another accountant."

Now, some people believe that Charlie's story is fictional. However, there are some people who insist that Charlie's son is real â€“ he's a successful artist. So the story has a happy ending.
