Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Jerry who was going around to different groups of teens. One day, Jerry invited them to a picnic lunch with him. The boys weren't really feeling the fellowship, so they left to go outside. During the walk, however, Jerry noticed a group of girls. He was instantly attracted to the attractive ladies. The girls turned out to be sisters of one of the boys he met earlier that week, and Jerry knew he wanted to date one. As for the other boys, they seemed to love Jerry almost immediately. However, this attraction had an interesting side effect: Jerry would be able to hear the girls talking in their apartments. And Jerry heard things that made him think that the girls didn't appreciate himâ€¦or, that he was too much for them! So he figured out a strategy for getting the girls to notice him and go out with him! How did he do it? That could be the topic of some good-humored stories in my future column.

In retrospect, you might see this as being of equal importance to the girl with whom you date. However, at the time of the girls I was seeing, their personalities were completely different from mine. Even though their fathers or girlfriends told them they were wonderful girls, they were much different from me as a young man. So, Jerry's attempts were more like those of a person who was attracted to someone for the wrong reason and who then learned to compensate for it
