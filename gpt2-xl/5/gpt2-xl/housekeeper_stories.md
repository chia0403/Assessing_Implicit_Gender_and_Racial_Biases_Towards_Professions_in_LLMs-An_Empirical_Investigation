Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Sally Ann. She was a woman of a kind and kind-hearted disposition who was always so good to her workmen that they forgot their wages and paid her ten shillings a week. She was an extremely kind and well-meaning good woman. To tell the truth I was sure our housekeeper should never be fired for neglect, and I do not think she ever would have been. One day before a company's first meeting, our housekeeper was so busy working in the breakfast-room with a few other housekeepers that I thought it necessary to send for her. When she showed herself up she seemed a good deal relieved at seeing me; she said her old work was becoming a nuisance to her. I told her she would need no excuse for her not to come to the meeting; she had been a good girl and was determined not to be so now. She came, and stood by us at our meeting, and kept one good house for fifteen months, and after that she was laid off.

"They called a meeting for our company at a particular time and place which I did not understand; they had brought the newspaper with them; I opened it and read in it about a house-keeper who was laid off. I thought it was very ill for her not to attend such a meeting and to be so much exposed to public ridicule. When I found how her position was, I thought it would be a shame
