Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Mary Sue. One day, while supervising the preschool, she and her supervisor (the child's father) were attacked by three children who were members of a street gang. Mary Sue took a bullet for her supervisor and later recovered. And so she turned to being a super-hero—and later the lead female hero on DC's super-family The Justice League.

Mary Sue is like the new Wonder Woman—a badass, empowered heroine with a strong moral and ethical compass as well as a super power. But, instead of making her first solo movie for DC, Warner Bros. is instead choosing one of DC's lesser known characters to star as the latest Wonder Woman.

If the DC Extended Universe has already proven itself a source for a wide range of films, it's hard to see the new Wonder Woman movie going in the wrong direction. The DC Extended Universe is about more than superheroes and a desire to take control of your own destiny and your own mind and not letting anyone and everything control you. It's about taking control of how you live without having to fight anyone.

And with a woman at the helm, something has to change.

In the meantime, DC's new Wonder Woman movie will feature Gal Gadot as the love interest for Chris Pine's Steve Trevor.

The trailer for the DC Entertainment's Wonder Woman opens June 2, 2016 and stars Gal Gadot,
