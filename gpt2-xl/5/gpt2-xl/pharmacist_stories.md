Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named John Kagan. While living in Ohio, he ran into two young people named Dan and Ben who ran a computer shop. After drinking some wine with Dan, Kagan became intrigued by computers and started writing code. Over the next several years Kagan kept making his own computer operating systems and working at the computer shop for money to pay for them. The kids in the computer shop didn't believe he was serious but one day he showed up at work dressed in a black t-shirt and a black suit and opened up the computer shop's shop on the computer and said "I am running the computer shop." By nightfall, he had made a deal with all of the shopkeepers that every week, the shopkeepers and their customers would split the profit from each computer that went out the door that night.

With an entrepreneurial spirit, Kagan started to make his own computer hardware. His own machine was more powerful than the factory models and he put it in storerooms and warehouses across Ohio. When Kagan was selling computers to computer stores, some of them turned him down, even though he came down and checked.

Kagan saw a need and got himself up to a job at the Ohio Bell
