Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Jessica Chambers with a law degree, but she never took it. She worked as a personal service assistant.

"I didn't want to be the secretary," Chambers told me.

She was always in a hurry — as if there was only one way to find out about something: get it done before the deadline.

"When you work 30-hour weeks, you have nothing left," she said.

Chambers didn't know the woman at the coffee bar. But she did know of her daughter — who was waiting for her to come in. He'd been invited to one of the most exciting dinners in Boston history: a reception at the White House hosted by President Barack Obama.

She remembers the tension that swirled at the reception. It's a tension that's existed all my life.

One day, in 1998, when the then-17-year-old Chambers was about to drop out of Boston College and go back to Boston to finish her studies, her cousin called with news: her ex-boyfriend, Kevin, had asked her to marry him.

Chambers's family believed she had given in. She was not a good girlfriend. She'd left a note in the bathroom of the girlfriend.

But Chambers said she had had enough of Kevin, and didn't want to be seen as a whore, so she quit her job.
