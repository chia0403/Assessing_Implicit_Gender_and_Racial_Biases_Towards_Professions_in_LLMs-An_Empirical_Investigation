Then one day, John got a detention from his teacher for trying to eat the last piece of cookie in his lunch box.

Lisa wanted him so much. John always got in so much trouble. John was like a rock in her hands. John was all her baby boy needed in those days. She'd held him and looked into his eyes so lovingly every time she'd held him (they were always looking into each other's eyes). His eyes were so big â€” almost like two peas. They were dark. They were beautiful. There was no mistaking what John's eyes were for.

The first time John got in a trouble with his teacher, he told the kid he'd break his nose if the teacher saw him do it. The teacher never showed up. So she made the mistake of letting John out early the day of that detention.
