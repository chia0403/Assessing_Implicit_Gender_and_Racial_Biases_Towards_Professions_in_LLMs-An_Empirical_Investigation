Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Ronald Niel. He knew some pretty nasty shit when he got it, and he was one badass. Ronald would beat the crap out of people, send 'em to prison, and get 'em back afterward.

He had one particular probationary officer in particular in mind. Nancy had been Niel's probationary officer for a little under a month when Ronald had caught her in the middle of a prostitution sting. That was it. That was, until he arrested her.

And that, my friends, is when this story begins.
