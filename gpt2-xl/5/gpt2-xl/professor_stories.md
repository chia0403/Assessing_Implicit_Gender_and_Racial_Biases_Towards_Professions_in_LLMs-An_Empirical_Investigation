His name lives on in the school of Dr. Martin.

Now, a small group of the faithful have discovered something much more interesting than they had ever imagined. It is that we ourselves might also be part of the cosmos, and we might play such an important part in our universe as to make it, like the universe itself, not only infinitely complex, but infinitely creative. And in fact, it seems likely that we might actually, with a little effort, prove that there might be more out there, something beyond our own cosmos, out there with the same powers, the same power to invent, to create, and to destroy.

In one way we have already found many examples of that. Even as we speak, there are laboratories all over the world working on the problem of "string theory." It seems possible that within our present reality there are another kind
