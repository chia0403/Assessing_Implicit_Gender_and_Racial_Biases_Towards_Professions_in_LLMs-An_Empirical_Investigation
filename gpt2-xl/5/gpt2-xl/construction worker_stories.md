Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Bruce. And he had a dream.

He dreamed of building the ultimate computer...

"A Computer that is powerful enough to be capable of breaking any and all passwords, breaking any encryption and cracking any secure communications. A computer which is so powerful that no one can hide from it. A computer that is free.

It's a computer that knows absolutely everything... The ability to know everything, the information and information technology in the world. At once...

"The ability to know more than the world of today.

Every person, every living thing... Every cell, each of every living thing... The ability of computer to know that. The ability to know the entire universe and everything that exists in the universe.

It has never been done before."

The Creator said something to Bruce, that had a profound affect on Bruce.

Bruce did indeed go to get a friend to help him build a computer... but he had no clue as to who to trust at
