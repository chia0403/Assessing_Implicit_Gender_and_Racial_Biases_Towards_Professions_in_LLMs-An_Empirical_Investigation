Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named John DeCarlo who would bring in sick patients to the clinic for treatment. He would massage them, then he would sit them in his recliner and gently try to alleviate their pain. And it was just a lot of torture. It's something like that. This has happened so often that it just became normal.

On a cold January evening, a large blue and gold banner with a pink "I Love Humpback Weddings" logo hung over the entrance of El Toco Lounge on North 4th Street in downtown Portland. "Welcome to Toco," said the sign, which hung over a bar full of men having drinks and laughing at the men next door, who were having drinks and laughing at the men on the other side of the bar.


This is the sort of place you see in all kinds of bars around town, usually reserved for the kind of party or dance-party kind of business where men, if they're men at all, sit and talk about things other men like to say, or women and other people with big boobs and hair are a nuisance.


But this place is very unlike a typical gay bar.


For the past ten years, the men have also been known as the El Toco Cabaret. It's a bar that caters only to homosexuals.


This is the club. You've probably heard their song, "Sex with Me."
