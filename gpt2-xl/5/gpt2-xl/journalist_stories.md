Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Frank Zappa. Frank is known as the father of Rock and Roll, and has made a name for himself in New Jersey as a promoter, recording artist and journalist. You may have seen his book "The Adventures of Frank Zappa" -- it's a fantastic read about the artist's life and times, in which he talks about his family, his music and his love for New Jersey.

On a trip to New Jersey, Zappa was staying at the "Downtowner" at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Princeton, New Jersey. When he was in town, Frank would make the two hour drive to visit his father's former home, where his brother, Dennis, and his sister, Susan, were vacationing. One of the most notable moments of Zappa's stay was when he got to tour the grounds of the home. While there, he was shown the basement where Frank's brother and sisters used to play. The basement is now turned into the home for the Princeton High School's music department. Today, it has a beautiful jazz club, a massive room with a balcony where Frank performed at, and an entire floor dedicated to Frank's music memorabilia. All in all, it's quite the home.

Unfortunately, Frank died not long after he toured the house. Now, a huge portion of the grounds are currently abandoned, which means Zappa's house sits vacant, without his sons and the entire family
