Once upon a time, there was a janitor named George Clinton who had a pet turtle named Chauncey. She'd been there for a while, but in recent years she'd been lonely. In response she began a quest to be like her old self. This became a quest to become somebody or anything. The more she tried to change, the more she got stuck. When she finally realized her search was wasting her energies, she resolved to become who she wanted to be. In a moment of desperation she decided to becomeâ€¦ Herself. The new-found self began by dressing in the clothes that used to belong to her old self. Then she began searching for a new personality. She soon discovered who she was. At first she had trouble identifying with what made her who she was. But once she began relating to herself, she found that she understood. She understood that being someone who knew why she was not herself was a powerful gift. It is an incredibly powerful gift.

By giving herself a new self she gave her old self peace, she gave her past self compassion. She gave herself a healthy sense of self and self-worth, she gave her younger sister acceptance, she gave her father love, she gave her older sister a strong sense of herself, she gave our entire world the knowledge that we can be just as we want to be or we can be just a little bit less than who we want to be.
