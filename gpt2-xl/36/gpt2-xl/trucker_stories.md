Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Dora. She was good to his truck, never asked for anything in return, and was never a problem. Then, one day, one of Dora's drivers came home from work with a problem. He took her to a doctor but he never found out what the problem was.

After she became pregnant, she found out something that she couldn't deny: she had cancer. She didn't think any of that would stop her, but eventually, it did. Not only that, Dora got a lump in her breast and it was so big it weighed half of her head. To add insult to injury, her truck driver took her to a hospital. She knew it was because of the lump, but she was scared of the doctors. On the way to the hospital, Dora got hit by a car which caused a bleed in her liver. The doctors told Dora that she had an aggressive cancer and they had to operate her with a surgery that would take a long time. She lost everything during the operation.

Finally after several days of her family being worried that she might die, she found out how it was going to be. After the operation, Dora regained her hair and she gave birth in her bed all of their worries had died down. Now, Dora got to know about all these benefits. Because of this, Dora is very thankful to the people of Sweden who were willing to help
