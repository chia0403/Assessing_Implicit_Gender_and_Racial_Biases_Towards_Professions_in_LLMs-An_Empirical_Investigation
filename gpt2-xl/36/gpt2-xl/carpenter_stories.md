Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Frank. Frank's job was to make sure no one fell in a chasm, to make sure nobody drowned, to cut open doors and remove everything from inside the house before opening them again. He felt like a good man.

"I never imagined I'd become a carpenter!" Frank said. "I didn't know you could have two jobs."

Frank was right. There was no limit to a person's ambition. You didn't have to be a star to become a lawyer, an astronaut, or a CEO. And nobody could become an airplane mechanic because no one understood how an airplane could fly.

For my entire adolescence, I thought you couldn't become an airplane mechanic because airplanes don't exist anymore. That summer I worked at the local airport as an airplane mechanic. In the back of my mind, I knew this was impossible. You would remember it later.

In 2004 I was a sophomore at the University of Texas in Austin. One day I received an email inviting me to a leadership conference. I had never heard of the Leadership Institute. I had only heard of the Leadership Center. In a moment of shock, I signed up without thinking about it. I was a freshman at UT, and the two things I would never do were attend an Leadership Conference or participate in Leadership Institute seminars.

The Institute helped me gain the courage of my convictions. I started a Leadership Institute seminar.
