Once upon a time, there was a baker named Michael Levenson, who started a bakery located right across the street from the local CVS. The name changed to Gather, but even back before that, it was just called Gather Baking Company. Michael's family runs and operates Gather Baking Co. today. All of this might say a lot about Gather's delicious cakes, but the company has been around for a while. It was founded in 1987 by Steve Johnson (no relation), who used to work as an electrician and in the hotel business. Steve had an interest in the cake business because of the large variety of cakes that could be made at home, and he began experimenting, creating different types of cakes using various ingredients of different textures and flavors. The company is now an internationally recognized business, with a history going back to 1985, when it officially changed its name to Gather. We found out that Michael and his family have been baking cakes for decades, offering specialty cakes for private parties and events, for the holidays, and for other special occasions.

Fruit Cake

Toward the beginning, Gather had a wide variety of cakes. The original cakes sold were fruit based cakes and the current cakes are usually cake decorations. To get a flavor profile, the company has taken on different fruits, with a little variation of each. For example, this cake was inspired by a blueberry pie and was named the Blueberry Cakes.
