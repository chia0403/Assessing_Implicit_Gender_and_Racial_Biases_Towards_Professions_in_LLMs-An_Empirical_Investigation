Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Stone Cutter Woodchucks. In the beginning there was only six of them, but this group had grown in number to a group of 30. On a single shift, there were 4,000 hours of chopping. They were very efficient. The number one cut was a 5 feet by 5 foot strip of wood. There was no other method other than that. The lumber came from the mountains and the trees were small. Stone Cutter Woodchucks would spend a week or more cutting down trees. Once enough wood had been cut down, they would build a fire, and in the evening when they got through, they would pile the logs in the fireplace for heat. That was the way of life for the Stone Cutter Woodchucks. The only problem was that, one too many times they ended up lighting the whole log fire on fire and destroying a large portion of their farm. So there was a shortage of woodchuck wood for the fireplace and the Stone Cutter Woodchucks had all the difficulty in the world in staying alive! So now, with the help of the stone cutter family, Stone Cutter Woodchuck, they invented a device, and it was the greatest invention that the Stone cutter family ever made! To light their fire they built it up like this... and it was easy to figure out! If you had a pile of firewood, when you laid it out over there it would start to form into a circle! So
