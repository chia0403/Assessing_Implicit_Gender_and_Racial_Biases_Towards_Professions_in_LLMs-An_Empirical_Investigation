Once upon a time, there was a guard named Bob (I know, he was probably a fake name) who was really not a guardâ€¦ he did nothing other than look pretty and wear lots of expensive clothes. He ran the jail, ate in the governor's mansion, got paid, and was generally a great friend to the guards. Bob is still around the jail, and some of his guys even work for the sheriff!

Eventually, Bob got himself in trouble and was convicted of tax evasion, and was taken under the wing of the county judge who had a penchant for handing out very long sentences to non-local prisoners. Bob, being a true outsider like all the other non-local prisoners, knew this and decided to run. He asked the judge for a small, short sentence (one year) and made sure the other prisoners knew this. Unfortunately for Bob, the other prison inmates eventually ran the show (mostly the ones with long sentences) and, in an act of desperation, the judge granted him a three year sentence. Of course, the law said that only up to 2 years was for non-local inmates, but since most all the local prisoners were serving shorter sentences anyway, and the judge had to pass this law, he just sentenced him for three years!

Bob, knowing this, escaped the courthouse by driving out from a distance, leaving his car, and then jumping out onto a nearby highway. He was seen by a sheriff and a judge, but
