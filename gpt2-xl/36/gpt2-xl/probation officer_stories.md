Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Bob Ziegler, who is a good guy, but he was also a real dick. He had a kind of perverse kind of humor, which I found highly annoying, so we ended up having a lot of arguments. He was always making jokes about being a cop so they could harass us, and I found that annoying as well.

He would pick on the wrong cops. One time he started harassing me: I got arrested in Colorado, he knew nothing about this, and asked me to send him a copy of the police report, because they'd only give you a copy once the charges were over. I don't think they'd care after a couple of hours.

"I found that annoying"

He started going door to door by himself, in his black police jacket and brown suspenders, asking innocent-seeming people questions like "have you been charged yet?" in an entirely different tone.

In one instance, I remember him being really insistent with these guys in their thirties or forties, all of whom had been arrested, that we get them their tickets, so he just basically threw his weight around. The guy kept pleading with him, and basically the whole time the probationer would laugh it off, saying, "he doesn't know what he's doing!" Eventually we gave in, but my friend Michael was just horrified. He said it was a really weird encounter.
