Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Sigmund. Dr. Sigmund was the kind of person that would let you know that nothing was wrong with you if you just kept your eyes closed while he took your testicles out, or yanked out your tongue while he stuck a rod inside of you. That has been going on for a long time, and it had always looked like it worked. Then, of course, the testicles went away. But I've always thought the real reason was so that nobody would know about it. I don't know the doctor's name, but I have a good guess, and I'd like to guess whether or not anything I say here is true. Let us now try to make some sense of the things that you just experienced. The chiropractor said you were on your death bed, and he knew that your legs were not perfectly aligned, so he put a device under your head to move your hips. The chiropractor said that his device was good for the back, but he told you that if you used it, it would damage your skull. He said that there were a few things you could do if you were worried about this, and he'd be glad to help out. Well, how would you feel about doing what this chiropractor suggested to you?
