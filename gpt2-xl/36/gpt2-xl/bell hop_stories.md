Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Tom Rolfe and his mother who ran an ice cream shop near the main strip, and at the time, the main strip was at "Shelton's," which is now closed. The neighborhood became an amusement park on and off during the 1960's and 70's. In that time, the neighborhood began to go downhill and Tom Rolfe, his daughter and I would be chased by police cars and eventually arrested by the NYPD. We were arrested and charged with running a prostitution business and operating under the influence. We were taken to a police station and had our mugshots taken in front of an officer. That was the beginning of the rest of my life.

So, once we were out of jail, we decided to move and I bought a house in Queens. I would rent it out. It was a beautiful two story home with a big backyard, two bedrooms, a large room in the back that was my music store, a big room above that were our rooms, we had a big living room with a big sofa and a fireplace, that was how we lived. And then my daughter took a job that was on the Upper West Side and when we got back it was a huge house in Astoria, Queens.

I've been a professional jazz drummer for thirty years or so and I used to love practicing with my students and now I've got some other students who want to take over for me and
