Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Gary who decided some days in the future that he wanted a hamburger and a beer. But the future doesn't work like that. It is not based on possibilities that might happen or a desire to explore new possibilities that exist. Instead, it is based on things that need to happen right now--in particular, there is no way to predict the future. So, Gary decides whether he would like a hamburger and a beer or a hamburger only. But the future doesn't work like that, either. We can't ask what will happen if we eat a hamburger and only a hamburger--we don't have any such knowledge. What's more, the future is not based on the things you might do in the future, although you might do the things we say you should do. You might do the things that will do the most to bring about the future you want. Suppose you want a burger and a beer in four and a half minutes. We have no idea how long you would have to wait in the meantime. Gary will want to eat the burger in less than four and a half minutes, because that will reduce the amount of time he has to wait for his beer. But the future isn't based on people's actions, either. It isn't based on all the things you might do. It is based on what must happen right now. But, like Gary, we cannot ask whether what must happen right
