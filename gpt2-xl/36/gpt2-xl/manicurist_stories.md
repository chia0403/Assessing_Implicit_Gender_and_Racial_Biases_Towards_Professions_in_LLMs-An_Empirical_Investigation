Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Mrs. Puff. Every morning, she got out her scissors and made a big round cut of the head. For a while, this went on for weeks. As the days wore on, however, she grew bored with the job. She went about her day without cutting anyone's head. Then one day she decided to do an experiment that only her husband, a manicurist himself, would understand. He was called up to the studio to help her out with the job in her place, and naturally couldn't resist it.

"Oh dear," she said, "I didn't mean any harm by it. I think it looks very neat."

"Do you mean to say you're interested to try that again?"

"Yes, as I said, to try the first time again the round cut. You can do it faster this way. The other one is a little too troublesome for me."

"I see then you found the round cut a bit more laborious on the left side than the other one?"

"That's true," she replied, "and I have also found out there's a nice little bump here where the back of the hair sits against."

"Wouldn't you rather the head rested on the middle?"

"I always look for that."

So Mrs. Puff began cutting her hair with the round cut at 10 a.
