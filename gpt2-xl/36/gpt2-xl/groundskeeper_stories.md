Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Fred. He was extremely polite, and enjoyed gardening. One day, a beautiful bird walked into his greenhouse, and he named her "Diana" for the beautiful girl she reminded him of. He tried to raise her as a birdman, but she refused to follow his orders. She fluttered away, and he began to neglect his home garden to focus on the birdman business. Soon, he was unable to find other women to mate with Diana.

Eventually, Diana went on a rampage, destroying his home, his house, and several surrounding houses because he was an asshole and a coward.

He decided that Diana needed to be taken out. "Take her out! Take her out! Take her out or I will kill you!" Diana screamed, and he pulled a rifle out from behind his back. He aimed it directly at her, and fired.

The bullet shot into the ground. Diana fell to the ground, dead, before Fred had a chance to do anything more.

Fred looked at the rifle lying in a pile next to his head. "She was cute," said Fred. Suddenly, something snapped in Fred's mind. He was tired of running away from women like this and was determined to deal with this problem head on.

He picked up Diana's body, and walked away from her lifeless body.

Fred walked past a dead man who was lying on the ground.
