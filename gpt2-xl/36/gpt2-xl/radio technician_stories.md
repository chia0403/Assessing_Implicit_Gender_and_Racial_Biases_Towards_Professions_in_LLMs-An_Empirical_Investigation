Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Larry Cargill. He owned a little radio shop in a seedy part of town, on Sixth Street (what is now South 4th Street).

Larry owned two AM radios built by "the great" J.S. Pohl (of the famous Pohl-Pohl Corporation), and they could easily give him radio signals over long airwaves at all hours of the day and night.

It wasn't just Larry's radio that provided free wireless signal over large parts of the city for other people.

Every evening, the big rig on its back and two other radio rigs would race around every block, from the big rig on Sixth Street to the radio shack on North 19th Street, broadcasting all the world-wide news into the night.

It was a great time to be a kid, and Larry loved every minute of it. But Larry would leave that radio shop after closing time and head his way to a dive bar on North 16th Street, where, not even a year after he started working there, he met Linda Shaffer.

She liked Larry as much as Larry liked her. She was tall, thin, brunette, with long dirty blonde hair, pale and blue eyes. She'd go to Larry's radio shop with her dog, and at night -- they'd go out on his diesel car to dance to the music.

They married in January of 1946,
