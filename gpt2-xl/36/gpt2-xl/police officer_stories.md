Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Scott and a woman named Kate who became inextricably entwined. In the beginning Kate was always following by Scott's side, sometimes with a very obvious purpose, sometimes just so that the cop could find a little more material to read while sipping on her delicious iced coffee. One day the two decided their lives would be better if they had children, and Kate was left alone for the first time in the officer's life without a man to look after her. But Scott and Kate soon discovered how much they had in common on that front, and so they made plans for their future offspring.

Soon Kate was out of work, and Scott soon found himself with money for a new car and even more money for some new clothes. He settled down with Kate, got engaged to her, and then made that relationship the cornerstone of his love life. On a whim Scott proposed a proposal at a fancy restaurant, promising that a child would follow if this couple kept their promise, right before they went in for the kiss.

To their dismay, the two didn't end up having any children. Scott, who was very involved in his career, couldn't be distracted and Kate couldn't help but have the first son she's ever had. So Kate asked her now-husband to get a paternity test done, and Scott obliged. What he didn't expect, though, was that she got pregnant just a few weeks later
