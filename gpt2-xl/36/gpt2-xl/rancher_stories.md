Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Billy the Kid who lived on the edge of civilization. When he died, his heirs divided his huge land with a handful of his most trusted supporters. Their descendants built a cabin within a cabin on the property, built a little home in the woods and called themselves The Family.

The family's descendants have been hiding away in the woods for centuries, with the goal of building an abandoned homestead into a beautiful and peaceful community of harmony with nature.

But today, they have met an evil force, a villain intent on claiming the Family homestead. It is up to you to battle this evil and prevent the destruction of our homestead in Dead Man's Draw.
