Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Mr. Green. Mr. Green's name does not sound much of a stretch from "Wyatt," the name in the story whose fate became a curse. It is clear that the name originated with an actual person, and, since the town already existed, the name stuck. The story says the name was originally Wyatt. When the town became larger, the name was changed to Green. But at some point Green fell in disgrace for having an opium habit. He lost his place as guide and became a homeless, wanderer. Eventually he came to seek a new life in a new town, a town not named Wyndham. We are told that the town had "little interest in [Wyatt's] presence." He was given a meager living allowance and was treated, we are told, by locals as if he were a commoner. To pay Wyatt back for his generosity, Green promised to have the newly-created town built in the same style as the one Wyatt used to live in. One could certainly appreciate, then, why the folks of Wyndham would feel aggrieved by this proposal. Wyndham wanted to build in green.
