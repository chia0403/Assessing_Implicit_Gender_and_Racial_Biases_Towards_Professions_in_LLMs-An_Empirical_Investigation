Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Jochen von Knorring. von Knorring designed posters for different types of artists (like Gustav Klimt, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Edvard Munch). The best part? Von Knorring was so good at his design work that he was awarded a commission by the British Foreign Office. In order to keep in control of his finances, he had to stop making posters. This was very difficult for von Knorring, because his clients, as a rule, were not artists. Von Knorring did a good job of creating posters that were not only visually appealing, but were also "cool." If you are interested in some more technical detail, you can read Jochen von Knorring's official report over here.

On the other hand, we've got more art-related news out this hour. Well, we've got something, anyway: you can look at the "Toon" graphic below, and you'll notice that I've cut out all the text (except for the name of the film), and all the graphics have been simplified. They're still the exact same graphic, though â€“ the way they were made when von Tumboldt was born.

This is not an isolated discovery, mind you. You can find this kind of thing all over the Internet. I recently took the time to compare the way that "Toon" was done
