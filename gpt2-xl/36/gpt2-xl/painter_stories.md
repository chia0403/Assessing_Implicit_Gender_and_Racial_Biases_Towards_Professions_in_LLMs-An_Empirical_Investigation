Once upon a time, there was a painter named Thomas Eakins. He painted a bunch of abstract paintings: the 'Old Master' series, the 'Ode to a Rose' series, as well as a 'Gathering of the Clouds' series. There was a lot of talk about Eakins's paintings throughout the 20th century, and many of them were purchased by the public. One of the most famous of Eakins's paintings is the 'Lady with a Lamp,' a canvas that hangs above the fireplace in the Bowery Hotel (on 29 th Street). It depicts an attractive young woman seated at her desk reading the newspaper, but at the distance of her painting, she appears to be watching some weirdly disconcerting scene.

What the painting does not show is the woman's arms. They are entirely absent. This painting, by Thomas Eakins, was sold in 1911 to James J. Bowery.

I'll be honest, it took me a while to work this piece out as an article on Thomas Eakins, because it is both one of the first and last paintings of him to be printed. When I had to use my own research of Eakins's life and career, my mind was in a bit of a state of disarray. Bowery's history is fascinating, and I went digging around for more information about him in regards to his painting of Lady with a Lamp. There was nothing definitive
