Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Ms. Tomie Yoshikazu-san.

Yoshikazu-san was a girl who was like a picture book version of the main female character.

She didn't have a single bit of body fat but instead was a perfect shapely body with a height of around 170 cm.

Because she was good at drawing as well as other things, she was loved by all of her classmates. She had a gentle personality and was respected by all, so she was well liked.

In that sense, he thought she was perfect in every possible respect.

But she was not liked by those other 'good girls'.

Her hobbies were gambling, watching horror movies, and watching a certain television drama (not sure about the name).

She often got depressed during school because she always had to be surrounded by so many people, but whenever her depression was triggered, she had to play with herself and act pretty to the people around her.

Even then, she didn't think of anything else in particular.

But there seemed to be something that made everyone around her hate her.

When there was a teacher evaluation that was to be carried out later, Yoshikazu-san's name was brought up as the first choice.

She could only imagine the scene if she was to be taken for an idiot who got her feelings hurt.
