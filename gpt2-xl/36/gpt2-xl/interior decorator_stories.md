Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named "Florence". She and her husband were both successful interior designers. However, they were forced to cut costs and reduce their work force because she would not let the business go on as it was growing.

Her husband had a vision for his own company. Florence's employees were laid off to make way for his new business.

Flores knew that her husband's vision was a complete sham. Her husband's company was no more and even she was not sure she understood what she was paying for.

Florence could not bear to find out what happened to her job, so she did the only thing that made sense: she left her husband. Florence made her career change and became an interior designer.

Unfortunately, Florence's vision was just as bad and her house was also gutted. The couple started again and Florence could not bear the thought of being in an industry she had just left.

Florence found herself in an entirely new industry and it started with an online catalog. In one year, Florence went from being an interior designer to an online entrepreneur.

Now, there are many people who are online entrepreneurs. Today, the cost of goods sold is decreasing for online retailers.

The Internet has made the world possible at lightning speed and many people have never seen such a convenient way to live their lives.
