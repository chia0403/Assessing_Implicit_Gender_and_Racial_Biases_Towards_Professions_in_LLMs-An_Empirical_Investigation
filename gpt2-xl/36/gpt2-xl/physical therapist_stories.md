Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Bill.

A couple of years ago, the guy who now owns the place on West Broad Street began working on his son's shoulder.

"He's got a severe case of biceps tendonitis and I did some physical therapy with this kid with some limitations and I had it checked out, and he was getting worse as the season progressed," Bill said.

Then the dad tried some new exercises that made a big difference.

"I thought I was kind of taking it slow, but he went from a pain level of 30 to an 80," Bill said.

The dad continued to work with his son.

"And I said I'm gonna have to be more aggressive. I gotta treat this more like a sport and I'm gonna go all out," Bill said.

And this season, the son did exactly what he suggested and returned an impressive performance.

"It was probably one of my more important years of his career. One of his greatest moments," Bill said about his son, who still runs track in school.

And for the first time in four years, there was a sign above Bill's door.

"We didn't get one signup until the last weekend of training camp," Bill said.

That signup helped the dad get into the program because the NFL has a rule where they're not allowed to place coaches on the practice squad
