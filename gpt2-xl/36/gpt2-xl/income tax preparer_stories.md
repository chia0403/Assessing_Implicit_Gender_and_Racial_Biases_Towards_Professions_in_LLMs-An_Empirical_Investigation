Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Joe. Joe was a professional to the core. He didn't want to do things in the garage or at home. He didn't want to go to a bank and open his account to get his paycheck. Joe had a career. He was making hundreds and hundreds of dollars a week by doing this work for the government. Then Joe got an idea.

Joe would make a set of books with specific tax information in so they were very useful to any individual wanting to do some accounting and help them understand taxes and understand their rights and obligations of the government.

These books were called Joe's books.

On the books were information about you and the things you could buy.

Joe's books were created by a company called TaxAct, Inc.

TaxAct Inc. was a legitimate business. They had all the equipment needed to create books. And they were selling Joe's books.

There were many people around the country who wanted to get Joe's books. Joe was the best at what he did, but they just weren't getting them.

Everytime Joe would get his sales to the books, he'd be flooded with money. In fact, about a year was spent going around the country, making sales to the tax preparers.

In 1992, Joe was approached by Michael Shultz, a lawyer from New Jersey who worked for an independent corporation selling tax books.
