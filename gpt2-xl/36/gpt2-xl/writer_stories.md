Once upon a time, there was a writer named Robert Galbraith. He wrote some of the longest pieces in the history of long-form political journalism. He could write a paragraph in six words, and he had a sense of drama, too. In a 1992 article posted on Medium, he explained his writing style:

"My idea of a perfect sentence is that it should leave a kind of unread but profound ambivalent feeling in the reader. And I should have a feeling of the story, the way you would have to have the feeling of love for a person when an artist writes a song."
