Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Chris. Chris, unlike many of us that you see on ESPN, does not see the draft through rose colored glasses. Like our own Dan Feldman he looks through scouting reports and is not fooled by a team's reputation. Chris loves to draft from the best talent available. And as the owner and CEO of Scout's Keepers, that's where we come in.

In 2010, Chris and I worked together for the first time. I brought him some film to analyze, and asked him to help find the best talents. He was blown away by how few of these players got invited to the NFL Combine. Chris knew that his role had changed, and that we had to play a bigger role in the combine itself now that the NFL Scouting Combine is over. One year later, at the draft combine, he and I were on the same stage, looking over each players game film while the rest of the world got to see the players in person. As a result of our work, I was able to get some inside insight into some of these prospects we'd been scouting, and have been able to call a few as free agents.

The following is the scouting report for former Alabama wide receiver, Josh Reynolds. Josh currently plays for Baltimore Ravens.

Physicality

Josh Reynolds has nice size at 6'5", 231lbs. He has a muscular build - a big frame that would translate nicely to the next level.
