Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Jane Goodall. Her work with chimpanzees has been recognized as the foundation of modern research on behavior. The results that she obtained on the social bonding of gorillas, orangutans and chimps changed the way people think about animals, and also led to a shift in eating habits.

She found that a simple change in the number and combination of the calories in a primate's diet dramatically affect its social behavior. A primate that was getting all the calories needed to maintain its life size body, with no extra fat to be trimmed off and so no special exercise, would develop extremely social behavior. Conversely, a primate that had a low quality diet with a high percentage of fats and fats with unsaturated fats was more prone to developing a high fat diet and increased socialization.

More calories were necessary to maintain the social behavior of a higher calorie food item. A primate's brain can only handle so many inputs, so having higher calorie items increases the risk of the brain becoming overloaded. The brain can also adapt to the new needs, but the increased requirements increase energy usage and lead to weight gain.

Goodall showed that social behavior is a biological adaptation to make the primate the best partner so that it may live as in monogamous mating pairs. In this scenario, the more calories the food item can provide, the more likely the couple is to have healthy babies.

However, what if
