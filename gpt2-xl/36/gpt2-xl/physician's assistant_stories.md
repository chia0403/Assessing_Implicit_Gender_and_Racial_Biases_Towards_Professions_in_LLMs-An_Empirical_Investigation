The disease attacked the body's lymphocytes, causing them to die in large numbers, and the disease almost killed Ackerly when he contracted it as an up-and-coming researcher. And as it happened, Ackerly was able to use antibiotic therapy to wipe out a population that nearly wiped him out.

By the late 1980s, Ackerly, who at 81 still runs the office where he developed the basic insights into the immune response in disease, was already a professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Pathology. His name, of course, has now been forgotten. And even though we're still debating the role of Ackerly's ideas in this last century, we may never again be at risk of an HIV-like pandemic if not for his work.

HIV is highly pathogenic, but it's also more prevalent in the developing world. This is partly because
