Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Elizabeth Barrett Browning. She was a brilliant social psychologist, and an even better teacher. Browning had a way to describe the feelings, thoughts and motivations of the ordinary people she studied. People don't always feel like they're making a difference, Browning once said — they feel like they're in a constant fight. And that's why Browning did not use any of the standard psychological tests like the Myers-Briggs.

Even better, Browning didn't ask questions about the people she was studying — she simply posed them questions from her own understanding of them. She described the way they thought, felt and behaved through a series of questions. Then, she asked: What consequences could you foresee for these behaviors if you went on living a certain way? If you acted differently, she asked, what were the possible consequences?

So many of today's social psychologists view the world through the lenses of personality. They test the things that we think of as qualities of a human being — whether we have a particular temperament, a "happy gene," an "attachment style." And they test to see if these things really are universal — they're just how people behave.

Then, they ask: If you were to change one of your ways of behaving, would you be happier? They test the consequences — if you were to change your personality or choose an unconventional lifestyle, would this change make you happier?
