Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Guts. He served his clients' hair, and he didn:t just do cut-and-paste jobs, he also added curls to the clientele. Guts' clients loved him so much they asked him to offer haircuts to the military.

Guts' clients wanted to create their own hairdos and he knew how to do them - but he didn't know anything about hairstyles. Eventually, Guts' clients asked him to create a style that would help them survive the harsh reality of war.

He took some time out to think about hair and it struck him that if soldiers could keep their hair longer and in better condition, then they would have a leg up on the enemy. He started crafting the style called "Guts Hair".

Eventually, Guts' clients decided to make the custom hairstyle for his head of hair. One of his clients was Donny Thompson, a blacksmith who also served in the military.

Guts Hair

Donny didn't know anything about Guts' style or its origin. In fact, he didn't much care.

When they finally came through the battlefield, Donny took Guts' hairstyle and made it his own. He called it: "The Guts Hair Style".

So, there you have it: the origins of Guts Hair.
