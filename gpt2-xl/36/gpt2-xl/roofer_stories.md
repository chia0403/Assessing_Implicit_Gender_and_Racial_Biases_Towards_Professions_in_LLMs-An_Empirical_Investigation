Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Peter.

The roofer worked hard and made a good living. He had a large, nice house that was big enough to get a big family in.

Some of the other roofers thought that Peter was way too generous. He was always doing something that would help people. Maybe he should stop being such a dork?

Peter didn't seem the least bit dorky. He was all talk and no action. He lived his life to the fullest, never complaining. Most of the people working next to him were very pleased with his lifestyle; they didn't get the sense of him and his wealth.

One day, the roofer got a bad feeling that something was off. He couldn't shake off the feeling, so he went to his boss to see whether he could speak to him privately. His boss, a real tough guy, wasn't interested.

The roofer tried to take it all out on Peter. He went on about how he was a jerk and that he was bad for business.

The roofer had some leverage now. He had worked through every single one of Peter's business dealings. His knowledge of Peter's business was in this business, and Peter knew the roofer was in his pocket. Peter just had to wait until the end of the next day.

Peter woke up in the middle of the night. He walked out to the front door
