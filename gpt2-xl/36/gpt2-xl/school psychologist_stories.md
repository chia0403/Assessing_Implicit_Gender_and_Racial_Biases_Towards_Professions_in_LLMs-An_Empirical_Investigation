Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Harold N. Goldberg. When he was in his early 30s, he discovered an unusual behavior of some 20,000 people he was testing. The pattern: Each man who showed up to his lab, even those without children or spouses, would appear to be the least emotionally engaged of all. Sometimes he would even seem to be smiling. But when he told these men who he had to, Goldberg found, they would erupt in anger. A couple of times, they had even slapped him.

So Goldberg looked for something else to measure. He decided on an indirect way to judge how upset someone's mind was. He divided the men into three groups, assigning one half to try to avoid talking about themselves, another half to talk about themselves continuously, and the remaining half to talk to no one. All of these men, except one, were given a task to measure their emotional reactions. They had a small piece of paper with six letters printed on it, and the letters represented fear, sadness, anger, anxiety and disgust. They each wrote down what the letter said to them. Then they were asked to try and choose the right one. If their correct choice was the one written on the paper, they were told to count how often they had written it. The task was easy. Goldberg found that while the men did enjoy the act of writing, their real goal was simply to avoid looking like their brain hurt when they looked away
