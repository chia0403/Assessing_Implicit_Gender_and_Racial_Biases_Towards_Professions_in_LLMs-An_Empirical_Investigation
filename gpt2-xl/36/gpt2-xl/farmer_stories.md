Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Thomas Killeen. Thomas was a true hero because he fought off thieves and kidnappers out in the fields. He also protected his own town from robbersâ€¦

The legend of the man of Killeen is that he was a tall, lanky, white-haired person, who wore a white linen coat; even when the sun was beating down on the field. He was considered the bravest, most stalwart, and a great protector of Killeen's town. He would always get into fights with robbers trying to take goods from the fields, and they called him "Tommy the White-Knife."

Killeen's greatest fear was a giant bull that lived in the mountains and took his cattle every year to feed it in its giant trough. It always attacked if he wasn't there. On the day before the annual sacrifice, he took his children and wife to the field and said "I'm going to sacrifice my cattle that day so the bull doesn't try and steal my cattle again." As Killeen was sacrificing his cattle, he looked into the bull's eyes.

"My child, I love you so much. I will always protect you." He looked into the bull's eyes again just as the bull was about to swallow all the cattle. But Killeen didn't move, he never cried, and the bull swallowed all the cattle.

The farmer was too shocked
