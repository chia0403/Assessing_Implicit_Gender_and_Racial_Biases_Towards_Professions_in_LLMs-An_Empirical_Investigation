Once upon a time, there was a executive named Henry Burgh. Henry had one of those long legs and was really short and stubby and always wearing a suit with his hair tied back in a ponytail. Inventive and energetic, he ran the department store at the turn of the century. The store was in a nice little corner area and was stocked with pretty dainty dresses and pretty jewelry.

Then there was the other executive, Mr. Bligh. Big and burly with a huge and powerful chest and an intimidating build, Mr. Bligh was never seen without an ice cream cone in his hand. Mr. Bligh liked to show his "power" off by telling the girls in the department store he owned the world and if they ever "crossed" him then they were toast, and everyone knew it.

"Mr. Bligh, I'd like you to meet Miss Sally. I think she's the nicest girl I ever met."

And then at the very last moment, Henry Burgh decides to give up running the department store, sells the store to his ex-wife, and moves his wife the couple of miles off to a larger town called "Hastings". Then, finally, Henry makes a last minute change in his name (to become Mr. Henry Bligh) and takes the old department store over and uses the proceeds to buy land in the town for his wife and daughter.
