Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Sue (who went by "Spyder" and "Sway" at the time) who was on a Delta Airlines flight from Seattle and who made a rather bizarre comment on Twitter. She'd posted some photos of the tray table. They were posted under the hashtag #rudeflight attendants – which can basically mean rude flight attendants.

Sue wrote that "we've been asked to leave and we refuse! Let's let them know #rudeflightattendants", leading to some hilarity on Twitter.

This is really a problem, as I think I've said a few times in the past. The word rude and racist get thrown around fairly liberally so when we use them in the same breath it's almost like calling ourselves racist.

I mean, the whole point of this piece is that racist language should be challenged and rejected as soon as we are aware of it but even when we make sure nothing is written on public displays, people do and say outrageous things. And sometimes in the best of circumstances, they don't even realize it.

And so to talk about a flight attendant – an employee, that is – saying "hey guys, we've been asked to leave the plane and we refuse! Let's let them know!" as one of the reasons people have been so upset about how this was handled is not just about making some ridiculous point about the word "rude" itself.
