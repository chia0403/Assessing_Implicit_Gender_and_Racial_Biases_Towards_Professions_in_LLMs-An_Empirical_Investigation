Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Maryam. Maryam was a lovely woman, but she was a ditz. She wore clothes to match the color of her complexion, and she was the most annoying person I have ever come across. She wore a wide variety of shirts to match, which seemed to me a little unnecessary. When it came to the color of her headgear, I couldn't decide if she was one of those stupid women who wears a dress-up doll, or if she was a fanboy of the Japanese-style hair bows that some men have on at parties. She had this little dog-shaped thing on, with two hair-like extensions dangling and a couple of little bells on it. Well, at least the bells on the little bells. I can't tell if it's just a regular bells on a little thing, or if there's a little thing inside the bells. Anyway, this dog-doll thing was like a little bell inside a little bell. There was one on top of her head, one under her shoulders, and one at her feet, like some sort of little bell in a suit. She would put these things on, and she always took them off again when she went to bed. But not very often, or else they would run the whole night. Well, the dogs-on-top thing was terrible; I really hated it. I hated everything about it. I can't stand bells at all.
