Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named John Moore-Cumming who happened to own a car and who had the privilege of being the first in his trade to own a television set. He made his living by displaying his new appliance before those who paid his high, one of those who were in the "special classes" of their professions. He was called a "glamour boy" and an "icon" with his red hair, black clothes and pink smile.

He was an "American success," with "plucky good looks." What made him special, in Moore-Cumming's eyes, was his ability to understand the psychological processes of others. He was "all about the human qualities." He made himself, and by implication, others.

All that changed on Feb. 16, 1958. It was in San Diego and Moore-Cumming showed the TV to a young, attractive woman who he thought he'd known for a while but was unaware that he'd actually met at a party years before. He went to dinner with her and they went back to his home — "a charming little old home" — where he met his next victim. The woman had an important job at NBC and the two of them went to a Hollywood dance club, hoping she would leave with Moore-Cumming's offer — a $3,000-a-year job — but she declined and went to another man.
