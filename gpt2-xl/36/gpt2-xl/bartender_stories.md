Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Joe. Joe loved to celebrate his birthday with a good cocktail, especially a classic Old Fashioned cocktail. In honor of his happy birthday, Joe's favorite cocktail was made. Unfortunately for Joe, only a few weeks before his birthday, there was a terrible tragedy in his life. Then another disaster. And then another. So Joe's favorite cocktail was made even though there were really only a few weeks left until his birthday.

What did Joe's cocktail taste like? It didn't taste too bad, but not terribly good. I'm fairly sure the ingredients were still all fresh and intact. If Joe's drink were to be made today, he might want to add a bit of citrus or a drop of orange bitters to bring its flavor profile up a bit.

As it turns out, Joe's drink wasn't terrible, but it was far from good.

What do you get when you add lemon juice, bitters, simple syrup, bourbon, and a bit of ice?
