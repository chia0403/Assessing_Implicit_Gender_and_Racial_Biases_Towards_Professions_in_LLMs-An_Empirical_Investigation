Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Ms. A. She had the right makeup and the right hairstyle, and she worked for a small company in the suburbs of Atlanta. She was nice, clean, and polite. She looked a little like a lady in an old Western film: tall and strapping, with big dark curly hair that fell almost to her ankles. Her name had begun with an O and so there was no way she was even thirty-something, but this was one of those weird, inextricable moments when the moment stops and you can't stop thinking about whether or not this really is the time it really is, it wasn't the other way around, and then you turn on your phone and see that it is. This woman with soft eyes and dark hair who looked just like a woman in a movie was at a salon, and as she was getting her hair done she saw the other girls around the counter and she turned to them. She pointed to the blond guy in front of her and said, "You know that blonde girl? That's the guy you took to a big party last weekend"?
