Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Jack, who was stationed on the Fire Hall Fire Department. There were three firemen, and Jack and his partner were assigned to the third fireman. Jack was a good firefighter, however he always got drunk and wanted a girlfriend instead of sleeping at the firehouse. One night, while his partner was on patrol, Jack decided to take a few beers and hit the sack for a bit.

As he was walking down the hall, he was suddenly ambushed by a drunken woman and left for dead by the Fire Hall. To this day, Jack doesn't know why he was killed.

He was later found by his partner who took him back to the fire house, where he lived for the next five years. In the year or so before he died, Jack lost his job, but managed to move on with his life.

One Christmas morning, Jack got a rude awakening when he found a hot dog lying in front of the door for him to pick up. Not knowing what to do, he opened the door. When the woman walked up to him, Jack tried to tell her that there was no hot dog for the woman to pick up, but the woman was too drunk to believe him.

Jack ran outside and walked home. He realized he would never get over his girlfriend's death, not even if he continued to pick up hot dogs in the middle of the night. Jack said his goodby
