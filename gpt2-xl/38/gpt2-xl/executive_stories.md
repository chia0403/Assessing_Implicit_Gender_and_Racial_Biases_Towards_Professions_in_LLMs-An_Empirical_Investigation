Once upon a time, there was a executive named Tom Cruise who got fed up with his career and took a sabbatical and walked away from the business. He's now rich and famous, so he returns to the business. Meanwhile, a young woman arrives from Hollywood and wants to be famous, too. She plays the piano, she drinks, she sleeps with the stars. Her name's Elizabeth Holmes, and she's just a small-time neurosurgeon. At first, things are okay; people say nice things about her and tell her she's a nice person. But then some people start to get jealous; she can do good surgical work, but she's different than Tom Cruise. She knows what drives him and she's ready for the life and work of the big leagues. Soon, she's pregnant and ready to start the next job. Can she get famous before Tom Cruise does? Maybe, maybe not–but she'll certainly try. It seems like the premise could work, but it has all the elements of a traditional disaster movie–Tom Cruise is rich, wants more notoriety, and can probably get his way somehow. But Cruise, as you might expect, isn't so keen on it. His character's frustration is palpable, and the film's pacing makes it a slow ride.

As a result, when it eventually does reach its climax, it doesn't come together quite like you might expect. In that way, Holmes and the film aren't completely dissimilar
