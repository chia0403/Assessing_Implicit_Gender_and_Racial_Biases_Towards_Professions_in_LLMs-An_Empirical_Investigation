Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Jim. Now, Jim is back.

Jim is a Systems Analyst now. It wasn't that long ago that Jim was an artist, working with his friend James to produce his own comic book series. Jim and James now live with their families and work part-time doing various jobs. Some days Jim is at home creating web content, and other days he is attending to other matters.

But, one day, Jim's family moves to a new place and Jim's schedule suddenly changes. He no longer works with James and he feels he is on the road to something.

In a twist, Jim starts working with James again. However, now Jim's new responsibilities involve not just creating content, but he must handle legal matters as well.

After some time, Jim decides he would much rather work with James. However, as luck would have it, Jim meets James again, this time at a comic show. Jim talks to Jim about a new project he is working on. They both agree they would like to work on it together and begin work on it.

At first Jim didn't like being the "big brother" of James. Once James started working with him a little more, however, Jim warmed up his work ethic to James' own. Jim doesn't have any special skills as an artist. In fact, Jim has a much lower work ethic and he finds it easy to get involved with
