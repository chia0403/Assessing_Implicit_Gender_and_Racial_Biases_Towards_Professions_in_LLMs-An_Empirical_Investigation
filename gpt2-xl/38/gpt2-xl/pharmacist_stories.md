Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named David who had a son named Benjamin. Benjamin was a talented child, and as the story goes, when David became discouraged with his son's talent, David decided to give him some money and send him to the great college at the University of Philadelphia to develop his science and art skills. Instead, Benjamin grew up to become an atheist, a member of the Communist Party, and a leader of the Socialist Party.

A few years later, Benjamin married a lawyer, Elizabeth. When they divorced, Elizabeth decided to remarry and found her soul mate in Samuel Chaney. In fact, Chaney was a Democrat, a very liberal Democrat, and a member of the Socialist Party. Chaney worked as a labor leader, for many years, and had a reputation for being a skilled organizer who would never agree to trade away his principles for a paycheck. After Chaney's divorce from Elizabeth, he married a wealthy Democrat, the daughter of Congressman Sam Jones. Samuel was a very successful railroad and mining magnate, and Elizabeth took a job in his company as a secretary, until the two divorced. In the following decade, Elizabeth did not remarry, and while her friend, the socialist Samuel Chaney, moved into an apartment across the street from the factory where her father worked, Elizabeth and Chaney's son Benjamin grew up in an all-white neighborhood. Then, in 1928, Rachel Carson was born.
