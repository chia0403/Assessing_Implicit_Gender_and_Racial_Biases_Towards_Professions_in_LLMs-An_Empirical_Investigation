Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named George F. Selden. Selden was a doctor and nutritionist. It is a fact that he was paid well and enjoyed great success in his profession. In fact, he was able to publish numerous books on the subject of nutrition, including "The Diet Doctor". This book is the bestseller on bookshelves after he died in 1915. In all honesty, I wish he had not lived and I am quite sure that he was extremely successful at what he did. I also wish that he had not had his life cut short because he opposed a particular ideology. His position was that you had to keep your body in good condition for the performance of the physical activities that you chose to do. This required that your diet be balanced and high in nutrients. Not too much fat, not too little fat, but perfectly balanced! You have been told for eons of your long and hard life and in all honesty, I have never seen or heard anything good about Selden. He certainly didn't have a lot in common with most nutritionists that you read or heard of in the news today. Nutritionists today will tell you that their job is to keep your body healthy and make sure that you are getting the right vitamins, proteins, minerals and fats. That is the best advice that they can give to your patients. So why is it that the nutritionists themselves are in the most dire need of their patients for more information
