Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Jim Ruggles.


Riggs worked hard, he paid his income taxes, he paid his child support, he kept the roads in good order. As a condition of his work contract with the State of Texas, he had to make sure there was a stop sign at the end of his road. Once stopped for the required amount of time, he drove his truck to the next, and every, stop sign after that, until every road on every street in the State of Texas had one.


One day a policeman happened to pass the trucker and saw his truck stop, right at the end of a road. The policeman pulled up next to the truck and, thinking he needed help, called for help on the police radio. But, as he waited to get an official response, the trucker drove off - on his way to give an entertaining tale on the radio.


After the story aired, other police officers in the area caught up with Riggs and found him to be in complete agreement with the policeman's story and very proud that the policeman did not give up his story until the radio station finally called the police department. The policeman had even given Riggs all his stop sign information.


As if it were not enough that the policeman had followed the trucker all over Texas without letting him go, he also helped get that truck into the news.


Now imagine how angry they would be if
