Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Harry. Harry loved his wife and children but he hated the government, which forced him to buy expensive cars each month and to pay the government for their maintenance. To alleviate his misery, he bought a 'government' car: an old Ford. The car was fine for daily driving but Harry would be at home for most of the week. As his wife and children made their way to work in the morning, Harry's Ford sat at the end of the garage.

Sometimes, the car would go out to use the restroom — a process requiring a trip to the local government road and back. Another time a group of soldiers stopped by Harry's home because they needed to park in the area. Despite all of the challenges he faced, Harry remained very happy with his car. He was a proud and happy motorist.

He bought the car — an old model — because he wanted to keep an eye on government spending and its effect on the American people. Harry could not afford a new, better car.

And then one day, a government car crashed into Harry's Ford.

I could go on. I could tell you about why a government automobile would wreck a customer's car.

I could also tell you about a government automobile that crashed into a man.

I could tell you about an alleged victim who came forward claiming that their government automobile had been involved in a crash with a government automobile.
