Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. James W. Campbell. It was he, or she, that gave the world the concept of human memory. It is Dr. Campbell's theory that the human mind is composed of a series of neural networks that are highly interconnected. Each network is thought to be akin to a computer, and their functions are to be the most basic as well as powerful functions of the human mind, but they operate in a similar manner to the individual neurons of the human brain.

When presented with a difficult task, humans automatically look to the brain for help and rely heavily on it for that purpose. So as we will see in a little bit more detail later, Dr. Campbell found that one of the most important pieces of equipment that the brain provides is a small section of the hypothalamus called the medial preoptic area. The area is not visible to the naked eye, and when viewed with an MRI, it appears to be a tiny white disk that sits between the lateral ventricles on either side of this region, on or near the posterior ventricle. The medial preoptic area is found only inside the brain at the level of the hypothalamus, a small area that we will explore in the next post in this series. (NOTE: We will be covering the medial preoptic area in a future post â€“ please check out this post for further explanation on where the medial preoptic area is located and what it
