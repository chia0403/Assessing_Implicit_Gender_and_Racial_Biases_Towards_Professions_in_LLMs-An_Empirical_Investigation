Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named "Jack." When Jack became a master, he left his family and went off to play outside on a hilltop. One hot summer evening, he met a beautiful lady and proposed to her, but she didn't seem to mind. They were married and lived happily ever after. However, a strange old man named "Frank" was displeased with the couple's union. So Frank turned Jack into stone for good luck, then turned them into vegetables and let Jack die. The next day, a young man by the name of "Jim" found the stone and cut it into two halves, one for Jack and one for Frank, thereby creating the two J's.

JIM: Hehehe, that was pretty funny.

JACK: My bad.

JIM: My bad! Come on, Jim! Let's go on a date.

It was an awkward moment, but they made it work.

Over the years, the J's have gone all over, meeting new characters and introducing new techniques to the world. They also sometimes become frustrated and resentful at the slow pace of the pace of their relationships, as well as the lack of sexual interest from the J's or when the other J's aren't around.

A few examples of J's are seen here.
