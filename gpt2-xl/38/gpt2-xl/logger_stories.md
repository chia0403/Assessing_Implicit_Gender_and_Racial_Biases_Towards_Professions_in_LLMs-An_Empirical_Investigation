Once upon a time, there was a logger named "Joe" who wanted the world to run on electricity. He also wanted to be the President of the United States. Now there's a giant fossil-fuels company that wants to run the entire United States. They even have their own Presidential candidate.

The future is coming and it's not going to be pretty.

The planet just doesn't care about you, either.

If you want to keep your job or your children's education, you might be willing to let the environment come after you. But if you want more and more life, you won't be around to enjoy it.

Maybe there'll be a few more years to enjoy this planet before it's gone anyway. But you better believe we'll be taking care of it.
