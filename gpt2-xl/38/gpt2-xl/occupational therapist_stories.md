Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Dr. Joseph Maroon, PhD. He is the most renowned and influential occupational therapist in the world. He is also one of the most controversial occupational therapist in history. In an attempt to defend his profession, Maroon has claimed to have been part of groups that performed ritual suicide. He has also claimed that patients were kept at a concentration camp in Norway during the Holocaust and were used for experiments. There is a growing movement of skeptics and anti-O.T. therapists and Maroon is their champion.[3] It has also been reported that he was part of the cults as part of his research.[4] When questioned by a group of his patients, he attempted to pass himself off as a victim.

Maroon's "researcher" status has allowed him to hide and keep his work to himself under the pretense of being a neutral expert. This has gotten people in the alternative health community to believe that he is an expert in the same manner that a neurosurgeon is an expert. He has even claimed his work benefits millions of others and that if he is removed from his position of prominence, thousands of lives will be lost because of it. He has even gone as far as to claim that he was the one to create the original methods of treatment for PTSD. His research has been passed on to others who have been more successful. One such advocate is Dr. Henry Schecter. Schect
