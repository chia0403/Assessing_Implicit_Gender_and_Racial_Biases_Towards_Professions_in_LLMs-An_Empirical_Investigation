Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Lizzy.  To be perfectly honest, Lizzy was very talented and well-received.  People loved Lizzy so much they came up to her with their hands out, saying "look, we want this!" and throwing money at her for her work. However, she would only accept one coin for EVERY piece of work she sold.  Lizzy did not charge commissions for works that she completed from her own personal collection.  She did not charge commission fees when she completed pieces donated to a museum.  She only charged commissions if one wanted more than one work of furniture in any of her classes.  For example, when Lizzy finished her famous piece "The Gilded Angel," she did not charge a commission.  A man that wished to have his own custom-built dining room for his home would pay $1,500 instead of $4,000 to purchase all of the furnishings. At first, Lizzy's competitors were not thrilled with this arrangement and threatened retaliation against her.  However, it was Lizzy who called her mother and her father, as well as several friends, to find ways (or give up) to stop her former coworkers from retaliating against her.  Soon the competition grew into a very strong friendship between Lizzy and Lizzy's former coworkers.  In this example, we see a good example of what happens when we stop allowing ourselves to be controlled by the outside world
