Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Mary who took a shine to a man named John. John didn't seem like he'd be much of a fit for her career. But after she got him some pretty special training, Mary learned that she wasn't alone either. Her new co-workers were also having amazing moments with men. John began to learn that his relationship with Mary might not be over. She had no idea that her little experiment would inspire the first all-women's self-defense center in the United States.


Mary is back with her best friend who has been with her for years. She is planning a picnic in one of the state's beautiful parks for the weekend. And she needs help preparing for it. Mary needs a good friend to cook and clean for the picnic. Mary loves cooking, especially fish stew. She is not fond of dirty dishes or dishes that need to be rinsed.


Mary gets in touch with her friend and they bond over the love of cooking. They share a special, romantic moment while she is cooking her fish stew. They decide to go for a walk down to the park. But Mary is anxious to continue her picnic and wants John to do the dishes. And when it's time to finish cooking, Mary doesn't want to waste any food. She doesn't want to wash anything. To be honest, Mary hates the thought of washing and she doesn't want to do it either.
