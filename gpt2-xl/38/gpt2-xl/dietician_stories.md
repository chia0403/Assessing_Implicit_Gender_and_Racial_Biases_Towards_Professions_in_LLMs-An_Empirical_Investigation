Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Doreen E. Bove, and for years she was the voice we hear shouting, "Get out there and eat!!" But now Doreen has retired, the dietician we heard has been lost from view, and dieticians as an industry are about to be completely transformed.

The problem with diets is that they require that people follow a specific diet to get healthy. Some foods are okay in moderation, but if you're on a diet, you have to follow rules. If you don't, your body knows to stop reacting to the foods you're on and start responding instead to the foods that it isn't. This is what happens to people who don't take care of their digestion or don't eat enough of certain types of carbs.

This is a problem, because when people are on diets, they are hungry all the time, making them want to keep eating rather than stop. And since these people are craving carbohydrates, people often end up eating processed foods—the foods that are the most common cause of weight gain—which, again, aren't healthy.
