Once upon a time, there was a artist named John Lennon â€” which is how most of us remember him, because John is the person who created the song from the perspective of a stuffed bear called Fab Four. John is the kind of person who said that "I love you" to a stuffed bear named Fab Four, and in doing so, he created something so magical that it has now become the quintessential expression of the American dream, and we are all the happier for it.

There is still a bear in the room. It's still that bear, which is why it's called an artist's bear. John Lennon is still the person who created the Fab Four that bears. It was made for him by an artist, and if anyone ever makes another Fab Four, that artist will make another bear.
