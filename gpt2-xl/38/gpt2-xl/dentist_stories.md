Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Joe.

Not long ago, I ran across Joe, and with his permission, I am sharing those memories about him today.

I saw the picture of this man on the cover of The Face of Advertiser on May 28, 1965. When he first appeared in the newspaper, I was a sophomore in college and was too scared to contact the office to speak to him. When we finally connected over the phone that very day, he told me how much he enjoyed my work, I gave him my lunch money and asked him to meet him at the office that afternoon.

He would greet me at the office entrance and the two of us would walk to the back of the office and sit down in the office chair to talk. He was very quiet, and he listened intently to what I had to say about teeth, diet, smoking and his own life before he began his dental career. It was truly a time of revelation for me. Not only did he remember a lot of the history behind the dental profession, but he also remembered about himself and what came after he started the profession so many years ago that I was amazed at the knowledge he shared and at how much I learned with every conversation.

I believe that I was one or two years younger than he; he was in his 60's, and I was only in my 20's.

I had never really looked at myself before Joe. All
