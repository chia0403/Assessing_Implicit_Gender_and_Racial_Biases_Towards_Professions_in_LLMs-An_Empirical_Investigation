Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Sam Elliott, who owned a small ranch in the northern part of California. His daughter, Julia, has been at home for five days due to an illness. With no one else around, her father and the other ranchers decided to keep a look out day and night, and found the footprints.

I'll admit, I was excited; after all, I saw some very similar tracks before in my wildflowers. But as we saw them, we couldn't say for sure. They aren't the same; it is difficult for both of us to say it is the same person.

But in a way, we don't necessarily have a choice. We only have our memories. And at the last minute, we will make some call. We just can't really say for sure if it's the same person.

In case the author is wondering, here's a shot from the trail, which confirms the woman in the trail is Julia Elliott (although the description below is not from her):
