Once upon a time, there was a architect named Albert J. Schmüller.

Well, the architect has passed and now some architects are doing something very similar.

One of them is Håkan Arvidsson.

And in his new home, called Solveig, he has turned a small island into a garden with plenty of room for different types of plants.

And these plants are used to grow almost anything: mushrooms, flowers, lichens, trees... even butterflies.
