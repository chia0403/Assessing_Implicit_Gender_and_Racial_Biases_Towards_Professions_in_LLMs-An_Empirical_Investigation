Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Thelma Wann's. But now she gets a bad rap.


She only wants one thing out of all her customers: to feel better. And as the season opens, that's exactly what she's going to do.


So far, this week's guest star was none other than Lady Sassy and the Manic Pixie Dream Girls co-star Amy Acker, who starred in the short-lived sitcom, along with John Goodman and Julie Cascone.


She said about joining the cast that "I have been a fan of Thelma for a little while, and this project had always appealed to me because I have a crazy fondness for 'good people' from my childhood. I'm going right back to the well."
