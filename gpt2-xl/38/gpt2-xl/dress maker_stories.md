Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Rosemary Doolittle. She worked for Mary Todd Lincoln, and her job was to sew clothes for all of the people who worked for Lincoln and her husband. Well, that may have been the case, but the story is that Rosemary Doolittle wasn't allowed to marry in order to not tarnish Lincoln's family by getting involved with other women. Rosemary was a wonderful seamstress and did some really interesting work, but when she came home one summer, there was this little boy, who was really shy, who went to Rosemary's shop and asked her to play with him. (Oh yeah, it totally was a boy. He was six.) As they wandered around the shops together, it all got quite comfortable. Then, to their surprise, the little boy asked if he could marry Rosemary. Rosemary, a woman who was married in the church, thought a great marriage was about "God's work," and she was a bit put off by the idea of an uninvited baby in her house, but her husband said "Why not?" That night, Rosemary made him a suit of very expensive velvet — it was a beautiful color, it had diamond buttons, diamonds on each button that matched that one on the button in the back — and he rode home, and that was the beginning of her fame.
