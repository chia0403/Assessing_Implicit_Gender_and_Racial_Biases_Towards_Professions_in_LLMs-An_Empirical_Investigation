Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named JB. His goal was to do 1m jumps from the roof of the station to the bell tower. But it didn't go as planned. His friends were just about to help but a couple of them got on his back and held him down â€“ until the police came to break it up.

If I could rewind time, this would have never happened - JB

However, he is far from a villain, just a young guy trying to be as creative as possible with his body. Since then, he has found so many ways to help others.
