Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named "Chaim" (no joke). He was a great chiropractor, he was really funny and a good listener, and he loved to make people laugh. He was always going on and on about this crazy theory that the Earth's magnetic field was responsible for everything, and he always looked like he found the cure for everyone, no matter who they were. He was always in a white coat, because he was always trying to pass off some bullshit science. He was like the ultimate chiropractor. One day, a patient came in and told Chaim that he'd suffered terrible headaches for the last six months. That didn't sound like it'd be a good idea for a chiropractor to give his advice. Chaim went off to look up what a headache was, and sure enough, it turns out that a headache is when there's too much of something, like too much iron in your system. It also turns out that everyone has their own "set point" for that, and if the "set point" in Chaim's case was way, way too high, then his advice about the headache would have been totally counterproductive. So he took the patient's blood pressure and showed it had taken a big hit, and he said this couldn't be good, because it meant his current treatment was all wrong.
