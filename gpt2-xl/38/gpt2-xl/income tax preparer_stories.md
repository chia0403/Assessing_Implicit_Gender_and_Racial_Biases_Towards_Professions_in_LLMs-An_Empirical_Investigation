Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named James Whiting. But a series of events caused his life to change foreverâ€¦

In late 1944, Whiting, who was a World War II veteran, went to Washington to find out the whereabouts of fellow veteran David Dallimore, an accountant he saw in 1940. Dallimore had vanished years earlier and Whiting believed he might know where he was.

In 1945, Whiting had worked for the Internal Revenue Service. This same year the IRS instituted new tax returns based on a new "tally sheet," which would be used to create individual income tax forms. This move made Whiting a prime suspect in the disappearance of the accountant.

In the first stages of his investigation, Whiting traveled around the nation to interview people who were close to the accountant. He found that Dallimore had been seen in a restaurant in Washington DC on Monday, January 10, 1945. In that same location, Dallimore's wife, Elizabeth, told an old friend that she and Dallimore had met in New York City on October 12, 1944.

They had been in Paris, he would say, where they had dinner and a show. At the time, they were both living in New York. They were both married and living in New York City at the time, but only Elizabeth Dallimore was listed as the spouse on Dallimore's 1943 Federal tax return.
