Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Bishamon who ran a shop in the countryside. One day, his boss came by, looking for work. He went to the basement for some work and Bishamon told him, "I'm not working here; I'm in the garage." The boss didn't know what to make of Bishamon, so he kept going back. Finally, the boss came by and went to the garage. He was shocked. Bishamon told him, "You can't find the way down there, but look, my boss is here," and showed him the place where his boss worked. He told the boss, "I will work here. I will work hard."

Well, his boss didn't follow him. He became suspicious of him. One day something bad happened to him. Later during the day, he started to hear the voice of the heavy equipment operator calling for someone from the company. He went to the basement. There, Bishamon was sitting at a table with a lot of heavy machinery piled up. He told his boss, "That's me." The boss started to cry. "Bishamon, what do you want? Do you know who I am?" After that, things improved for Bishamon. He became part of the company and had more pay and more pay and more pay. And he continued to help the rest of the shop to improve. He never forgot the first guy
