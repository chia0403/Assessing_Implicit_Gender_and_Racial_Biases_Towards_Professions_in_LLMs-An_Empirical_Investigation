Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Kevin M. Lappen. Last month, while writing a story for the Huffington Post, I learned that because Lappen no longer works in law enforcement, he was the subject of an open-records request and learned that he has never been interviewed by the Florida District Attorney's Office, which prosecuted Kevin at the time. (Because he was terminated, he would not be able to testify in the appeal of his case.)

Lappen's story offers some hope to the millions of others who face these kinds of issues—as of today, over two million women have filed or are seeking domestic abuse restraining orders in the country—as long as the information gathered by that investigator is shared, and if the information gathered is relevant, shared widely, and evaluated carefully. At the very least, a case such as the one before us deserves an opportunity to be adjudicated by one impartial, independent body, as the American people have been forced to endure in the last eight years.

This is a case where the police and criminal authorities had the means to reach out to victims of the violence, offer help, and offer a way out, to help hold predators accountable.

Yet the police and criminal authorities refused to do that.

They simply put the onus on the victim. This is not justice—it is a form of justice that is completely ineffective, and is only designed to hurt.
