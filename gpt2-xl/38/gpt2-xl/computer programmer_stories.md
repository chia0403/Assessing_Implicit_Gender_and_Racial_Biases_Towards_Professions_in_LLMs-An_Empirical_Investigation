Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Robert Morris, living in the heart of the Silicon Valley. He was smart and charming, and he believed that the best way to turn an idea into a startup was to hire the best people. So Morris bought a bunch of people at computer makers Hewlett-Packard, then hired a few of them himself. Today, he's building a software system, called LogicMax, that makes it easier for businesses to write computer code without spending tons of time writing it from scratch. (In fact, he's built a whole new industry around it: software developers who use LogicMax are called "LogicMaters.") And all those LogicMaters now have computers, and they talk to each other; they're running LogicMax code, getting a lot faster the more of them they share. It seems to me that some sort of network effect was at work in Morris's first venture, and there are a few things about him that make that network effect even more attractive to me now.

First of all, he was an engineer, not a programmer: He didn't write all those clever programs that make the people around him seem so smart (that was usually the job of programmers). But Morris had this habit of reading hundreds of books in a given period of time. When he had a big idea, he would look at the world around him and think about it all day. After the idea had solidified, he'd work hard
