Once upon a time, there was a painter named T.S. Eliot.  This guy took inspiration from all over his artistic background, and it shows.  When I'm asked what my favorite art school is, my answer is usually a blank stare.  There was a time at the beginning of my degree programme--I was about ten or eleven years old--where the entire subject was ignored.  Not that I don't want to learn; I actually have a great interest in the subject.  However, every study session, I would be instructed in painting technique and theory.  This was fine, although I'm not sure why I should bother.  I couldn't find a single time in which Eliot's work didn't resonate with me or speak to me in some way.  Yet in spite of my personal taste in art, the course material always struck me as so interesting.   Now, to be fair, these days, a lot of teaching is focused on teaching people to teach, but that doesn't diminish the potential of Eliot's study.  As people continue to have the same interest in painting that they knew in Eliot's own days, we are now entering an artistic renaissance that could make a real difference in education in the future. 
With that in mind, I would like to see teachers and students focus their studies on painting for the art of painting.  I believe this to be a form of "art therapy" and a way for students to work
