Once upon a time, there was a coach named Jimbo Fisher. He was one of three finalists for the head coaching position at a school that had lost a ton of guys, including a lot of upperclassmen. His alma mater, Florida State, was the last stop.

Fisher, a Seminole, had an old mentor in Steve Spurrier, an ex-Syracuse linebacker and now-Florida State tight end. Both Fisher and Spurrier were among the hottest names on coaching hotboards, as far as coaches go. Spurrier had started to become the face of the college football coaching profession, his name almost always topping all of the hot-shot assistant coaches.

After his first, unsuccessful tryout, Fisher took a step back and watched his first year at Florida State go nowhere. After another two years in Tallahassee, Fisher finally agreed to take over the job.

But, as an unemployed coach looking for a job, Fisher had a hard time getting picked up. He had coached some great teams at Florida State, even a national championship (the 2000 BCS Championship, when he was an assistant at Miami.) But a college job was nothing but a step back at the time, and Fisher's college coach of the year trophies were sitting in a closet.

He decided to go ahead and hire someone else to coach the Seminoles again, and he landed his man in Urban Meyer, who he had previously coached at Ohio
