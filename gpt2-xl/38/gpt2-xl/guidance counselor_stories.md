Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named John J. Stewart, who taught that there were two kinds of people: people like us who were sinners but never had any sexual contact with others in secret because they didn't want to, and people like me who were the opposite, who did sin but never had any contact with others in secret because they feared what might happen.

John Stewart would not have had to study any psychology textbooks had it not been for the Catholic Church which, in 1883, placed him under excommunication for teaching what was then known as the Atonement and Reconciliation doctrine (later called the Apostolic and Petrine ministry). That doctrine said that at the moment the church committed "original sin" from the moment a human creature decided to become God, which was the moment we "baptized" our forefathers in his name, we were permanently divorced and "condemned to hell" because we knew we would suffer eternal punishment unless we repented from that sin. This notion, which was not only considered inadmissible by the Roman Catholic church but, until recently, by the Eastern Orthodox church as well as by many Protestant sects, never got any traction.

However, the doctrine was not eliminated by Pope Leo XIII. He merely amended the text of the decree to make it more succinctly and more accurately expressed. But it was still there, right underneath. What about John Stewart? He may have been excommunicated
