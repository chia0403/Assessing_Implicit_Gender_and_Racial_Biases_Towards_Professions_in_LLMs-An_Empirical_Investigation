Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. John Mack. Dr. Mack, a well-meaning man, did a series of studies, and he discovered that almost all of his patients had suffered from depression at one time or another.

And he immediately went about trying to put a label of depression on his patients. Dr. Mack concluded that these people had all "pushed themselves way too hard," had engaged in "self-destructive behavior" or had "used drugs excessively" in the past.

But he didn't define depression and didn't have a standard definition for "mental illness." So he decided to put the label on the poor people and put them on a program that would cure their depression.

Dr. Mack's study showed that almost half of the patients responded to the program. And all of these people were cured. They got out of prison and saved their families from being in a house with a criminal.

If Mack didn't know that "depression" was just a euphemism for everything from "coping with trauma" to having too much "family pressure," he was certainly not being honest when he named "depression." Because, you might argue, for most of these depressed patients, "depression" was not an excuse for being irresponsible.
