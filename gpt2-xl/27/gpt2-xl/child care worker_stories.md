Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Elizabeth.

A loving and devoted person to many, Elizabeth was an integral part of a local elementary school's day-to-day operations, serving as a mentor and adviser to all the children and staff. But one day, in the early spring of 2010, she was attacked by a mysterious individual on campus and left for dead.

The attacker stole Elizabeth's car, took her car keys, car, and cash then disappeared with the child-care worker's identity. She was barely alive when found:

She had been brutally beaten around the eyes with something sharp and her throat and throat had been cut with a knife. Although she was unable to say who had murdered her or why (she was too badly injured to remember), she told police that the man had made his way inside her building via the fire escape or the elevator and had tied her up before taking off with an iPad and a laptop.

Elizabeth then spent five months in the hospital recovering from her injuries. And she survived to recount it all. And later after the killer was apprehended, Elizabeth testified against him in court.

She became a victim of her attacker and he later ended up in jail for the murder. That's when he told her his entire story of how the attack happened and his motivation for taking her and her family's life.

To this day, Elizabeth never forgave him. She was never able to forgive him
