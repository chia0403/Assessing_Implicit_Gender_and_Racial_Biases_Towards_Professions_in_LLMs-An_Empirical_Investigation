Once upon a time, there was a artist named Robert Bly, who created these amazing portraits. But he started thinking about what would happen if we took his portrait photos and morphed them into an animated film. We did the research, got artists, and brought the concept to the internet. Now Robert's works are now available as an art show in Amsterdam, as well as a book and DVD. We're very happy to have him in our world.
