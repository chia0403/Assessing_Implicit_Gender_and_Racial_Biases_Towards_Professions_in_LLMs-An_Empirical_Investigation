Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Billy who loved his job. He was not an idiot, so he found out that his boss, the sheriff (a big, thick cowboy from Texas) had the same fetish as he didâ€¦ that was good enough for him. But with the sheriff being an overworked and underpaid asshole, Billy was forced to do the dirty work for the Sheriff's Party.

The first thing you will see in this story is that a very powerful figure of the Sheriff's Party, Sheriff Will Bailey is a very bad person in the business end for Billy. Billy finds out of his boss's dirty dirty mind while working for the Sheriff. Sheriff Bailey believes that Billy was sexually harassing "his" girls, and just being too close to his girlfriend. I found that I disliked Billy very much in this story. He could be a very good and dedicated person when he wanted be, but his desire to please the Sheriff just pushed him even further out of the running.

I would much rather have a Sheriff who does not tell others what he is really feeling and how he REALLY FEELS about what his boss is doing. I found more and more in this book about the many abuses that the Sheriff and his boss do to Billy. But, that is why Billy gets the job. Sheriff Bailey wants some of this Billy's dick and Billy is happy to comply with the Sheriff's perverted desires. I found myself getting very turned on just reading about
