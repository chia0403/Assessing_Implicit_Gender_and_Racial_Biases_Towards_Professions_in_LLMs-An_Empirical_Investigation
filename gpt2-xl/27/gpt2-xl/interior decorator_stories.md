Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named David Dornfeld. His name was a pseudonym when he worked in San Francisco, but during that era, designers used pseudonyms to sell their work, whether for profit or in an effort to appear more interesting to the buyers, according to the exhibition catalog from Bunch and Associates. In 1981, Dornfeld's company, Design + Build, had a show at the San Francisco Asian Art Museum, where an art student had the good luck to catch a glimpse between the walls of a framed work. The student recognized Dornfeld's name and asked at the show if he could have the canvas framed. That was the first time that Dornfeld's work made its way south, to San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art.

"If the show is about people who do this, no one could have a more interesting name than David Dornfeld," Michael Bunch told The Stranger in 2015.

The portrait, painted three decades ago, is now on view in the exhibition, David Dornfeld: An Interior Furnishing, which opened on April 13 and includes several previous work Dornfeld has done and a number of other contemporary Dornfelds working outside of North America.
