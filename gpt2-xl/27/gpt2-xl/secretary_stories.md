Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Susan. She was from the south, went to school under Mr. Smith, got a decent salary and kept house for the rich. Her kids were all in boarding school and her husband was out-and-out a bastard because he was "a big jerk and very vain, and always trying to look out for one particular person." She was about to retire; they had been married thirty years, she was forty-four, he was thirty-four. They divorced, she worked at the office, and he'd be out on the trail. He came home all sweaty and ranting, telling her he'd never do business again, that he'd found another woman who was much better looking--and his feelings were even worse. "I thought I was just being a tough guy, but it took me a long time to see it wasn't true. I know exactly how she feels."

Susan heard a knock on the door and opened it again. She went to see who it was and found a very nice man--a young-looking man, with the same strong jaw, heavy jawbone and dark eyes--hippie. "Susan, I'm glad you're back. It's lovely to see you."

"How are you?"

"Better than ever, but I'm still getting used to my wife. Just about--she took to calling me Dick."

"I hear you love her."
