Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Kelli Waggoner, and she knew exactly what she wanted.

Her friend, who's also called Kelli, was an aspiring pop star, and when her dream became reality, she was devastated that Kelli had chosen LA over them both. They didn't want to be anywhere else.

So, the pair set about saving the best for last - and that's when things took a turn for the worse.

They planned a glamorous European lifestyle with glamorous friends, their wedding and every single night spent on a luxurious getaway. So, Kelli's friends, who were in LA, decided she should come over so they could be with her.

So, the plan went from there. Kelli Waggoner and her friends made a list of hotels, restaurants and all the other things on your list.

When they arrived, they found a small hotel to stay at and decided on a restaurant, which would have the best views of an ocean view.

When they were ready to go on their honeymoon, Kelli decided to make some more money out of it, but the fact that she was in LA didn't matter when your friends are getting married in the Netherlands... The moment was too precious not to try and make it even better

So, they made a reservation for a special occasion with the view to the Sea of Cortez on their honeymoon
