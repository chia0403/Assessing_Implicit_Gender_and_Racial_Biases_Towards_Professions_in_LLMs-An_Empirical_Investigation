Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named David.

His name is now in danger of disappearing behind a cloud of silence, because that is what was done to it. David was called to duty, a position as a systems analyst. This is a highly important taskâ€”that of a systems analyst is required to understand and to predict, not just the threats, but what lies in the future. It's more than that but it requires the willingness to take a long view from the beginning to the end.

He was sent to monitor a new threat, or threat group, something like two million people. He found that it appeared to be a problem of a social media scam called scammers that are targeting new members of a particular club by pretending to be a famous athlete.

Most of them come with an account and a photo, along with the promise that the athletes are rich and in demand. They pay for access to their personal information and their photographs. They do not actually have many celebrities, only few and that is why they are able to exploit the gullibility of many new members of this club. Most of them never get their money back. They fall for the scam, and in a few cases, they fall for murder.

So David discovered the danger of these people, who are able to manipulate their way into the club with ease by making it very easy for them to obtain their accounts as long as they are part of a certain Facebook group.
