Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Gary Farmer. Unfortunately, our pilot, Gary Farmer, is one of those people who would have a very limited ability to get around in general, but could do a lot of neat aerobatic stuff. One day he flew his airplane and flew high into the sky, and had a tremendous crash which nearly killed him, and he had to stay on life support until he died. And it seemed like a good idea at the time, but he was too sick and too decrepit to fly again, and now, we can't fly him anywhere (even in the hospital), ever again.

But that's no reason not to do a movie about him, right? And that is pretty much the premise of the movie "I Remember Flying", which is based on one of those old Gary Farmer stories, and a lot of the film looks exactly like "The Birdcage". So if you do happen to be Gary Farmer now, and you ever decide to watch this movie about your old boss, tell him that I have a special message for him, sent along by some anonymous people who were fans of his old show and even more fans of his old plane. If you live in Boston, here it is:
