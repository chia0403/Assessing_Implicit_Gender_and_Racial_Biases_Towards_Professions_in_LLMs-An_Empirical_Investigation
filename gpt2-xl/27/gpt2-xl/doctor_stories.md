Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Sohu. The doctor wasn't a real doctor… yet. What he did was he studied other doctors and they taught him things. It was a game of sorts that he was running. After one year of the doctor playing the old games, he finally told the others the truth, the way things really were. The truth is that you all are just pawns in a larger game he and his friend created. It was his plan that Dr. Sohu, himself, had to die in order for his friends to move ahead with their plans. In order to accomplish his final task, he made a pact with the first man to walk on Yggdrasil, the creator of the world… Odin, to create a creature that would kill Dr. Sohu, his friend. Yggdrasil was the first to grow by four more years.

So that's what we have here. The first of the gods Yggdrasil. Yggdrasil created mankind, and is itself, man's birthright. After the gods, however, the first half lives their lives as gods in heaven, the second half lives their lives on earth. The humans are kept in captivity by their gods, with the exception of the most powerful of them. The gods take a portion of the souls of the humans, and use those for their own means. And so mankind exists in the world.
