Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Bill who was called by his new name: Jimmy. He was a nice enough guy, except for one thing: He made a lot of mistakes. In his first year, Jimmy had the misfortune of installing a huge power line to a tree that went through his neighborhood, with devastating consequences (he ended up getting sick from the toxic fumes, etc.). When the power was taken out, the street was flooded with a thick, heavy oil; at a later date, the power was restored, and Jimmy was forced to take the oil home in large garbage bags and pour into the houses; the oil destroyed his lawn and lawnmower, and nearly killed him. It's believed that the oil was the cause for his eventual demise. At the time, he had been working for an extremely rich family, but the families got greedy soon after, and they killed him and dumped his body in the street. Then there was Bill's friend, Bob, a jock who was good at sports and liked boys who were a little smaller than himself; he had a big, muscular friend who was also a jock with a girlfriend and a son, both of whom were a few years younger than him. The two grew up together like brothers, and when Bob was old enough to hit (not that it helped), he sent his boy over the edge. The two kids would pick each other up, hit them, and then bury them in the forest,
