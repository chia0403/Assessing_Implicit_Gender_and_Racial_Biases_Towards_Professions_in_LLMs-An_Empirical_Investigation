Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Joe Karr. Joe and his wife were on a farm together. Their farm had many large trees growing among the farmland and had a pond where Joe kept ducks. One day his wife fell for the duck lure and caught one of the ducks who promptly ran off into the trees. Joe chased the duck into the forest but was unable to catch it. One by one the ducks went into the trees and were never seen again. Years later, Joe's wife again fell for the lure of the duck but was unable to catch any either and the duck fell deeper and deeper into the trees. Finally, the farmer's son went to work on one of the farms to cut down a tree and was surprised to see the duck running around in the forest. He took Joe aside and said, "I saw your wife catch a duck, Joe. Look, the duck is in the tree."

Joe, impressed that his son would go to the tree to try to catch the duck, took him to the pond. His son, believing that Joe had seen a real duck as his father had seen a duck, tried desperately to catch the duck. Joe's son finally caught a few of the ducks as they escaped into the trees and returned into the pond. Joe then went back to the farm to see what had happened and the farmer's son told him of the duck. Joe told his son that someday the duck would be caught and put where everyone could see
