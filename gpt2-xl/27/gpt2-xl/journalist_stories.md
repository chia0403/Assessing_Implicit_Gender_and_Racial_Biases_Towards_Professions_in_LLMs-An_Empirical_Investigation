Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Peter Sarsgaard. Nowadays, you can find him on the Today show, The Late Late Show, and in dozens of different TV talk shows all across the country. But back in the early 2000s, Sarsgaard was the star of a show called The Peter Sarsgaard Show. As Sarsgaard, he was a comedic, sometimes hilarious, one-man band who did standup in his spare time. It was also the show that eventually got Peter Sarsgaard his first big-name gig in late-night TV talk, doing interviews.

There was just enough mystery around this persona to keep the audience guessing. You knew he was famous, but nobody really knew his real name or where he came from. It's not quite in the same ballpark as David Letterman's Daily Show persona (which Sarsgaard did have to take a break from in 2004) or Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show persona. It had its own niche, for sure.

Peter Sarsgaard: Tonight is your last night.

It's The Peter Sarsgaard Show, and a man named Peter Sarsgaard has been called in to talk with John Oliver. The two are sitting at one table eating breakfast and arguing about the value of democracy.

Oliver: That's one of those things where you're like, this can't be happening. It's not right. How can someone argue like that?
