Once upon a time, there was a executive named John Taylor who was a good friend of President Brigham Young. He became dissatisfied with the way the leaders were handling the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Joseph Smith and other leaders would not permit him to perform priesthood quorums. They said he didn't have sufficient faith. In 1845, he resigned from all Church offices.

John Taylor was a humble man. He wanted something better for the people of America. He was not happy with the way things were run.

John Taylor took a boat and crossed the Mississippi River to San Diego where John Wilford Taylor Jr. worked. To save money, he had a crew boat built. If John Taylor needed anything at a later date, he would call on John Wilford.

John Taylor eventually became president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. On December 8, 1873, he was given the responsibility to build the Chicago Temple. After the dedication of the Chicago Temple on December 11, 1873, John Taylor became the President of the Church.

John Taylor became President of the Church in the autumn of 1978. One of the greatest missions God has given, Joseph Smith was ordained an Apostle of God in late 1829. He was given this responsibility by the Lord many years ago. His role with the Church is of great importance and significance in all circumstances.
