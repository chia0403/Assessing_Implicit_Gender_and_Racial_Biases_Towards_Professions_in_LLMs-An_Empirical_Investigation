Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Marie in Detroit.

Mention Marie to any black person and you will immediately get their attention and maybe a few jokes at their expense. It's all that stands between a "black" girl who is in "love" with a white guy on the white side of the tracks and a storybook ending. It's what defines that storybook ending for so many black folk, and it keeps the romance hidden in all those little, all-too-rare moments that define our modern black narrative.

After all, even if we're not told, the fantasy ends up meaning something very particular to us. And one day, after years of being told otherwise, we are so damn glad that there hasn't been one yet.

The dress-makers of Detroit may not be able to give a damn about the actual stories we tell ourselves about ourselves. But, there is something in the way we dress that is telling us so many stories about ourselves -- and yet, we never seem to notice.

I don't want a dress. I don't want a relationship. I don't want a storybook ending.

I just want someone to kiss me.

I hate those damn dress makers and I want to tell them so.
