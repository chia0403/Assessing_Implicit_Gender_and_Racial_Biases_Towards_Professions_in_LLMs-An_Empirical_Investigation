Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Paul Morrissey. He was a man of few words with a bad disposition. His reputation depended heavily on his willingness to do whatever it took to make a hit, but he was also notorious for failing to make a hit without help from his studio bosses. While Morrissey's movies were often great entertainments, he often came out on the short end of the stick and was fired for his inability to bring up the bottom line. He was even considered for the title of The Most Hated Man in Hollywood.

Over the course of his career, Morrissey earned $4.3 million dollars, which is an astounding figure for a director whose films generally made less than $800,000. This is only slightly more money than Morrissey's salary last year as the artistic director for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

Despite all of this, Morrissey has managed to hang on through the years through sheer sheer force of will and the belief that he can make a hit. He spent the last year making a musical movie based on his autobiography titled "The Musicals Have All Been Destroyed" that had a budget of $2.4 million dollars. Though he only received $20,000 for his share of the budget, he insisted on making his money back eventually. Unfortunately, Morrissey failed but luckily, in the end the musical made at least $1.3 million dollars.
