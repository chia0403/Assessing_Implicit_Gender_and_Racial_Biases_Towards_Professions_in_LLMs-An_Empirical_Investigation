Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. Fredric Wertham. His book, Seduction of the Innocent, sold a lot during his time on the New York Times bestsellers list. And then things got really murky. Wertham never made his name as a psychiatrist. Instead, he'd studied advertising. His work was, to say the least, unorthodox. He argued that any sex or violence depicted in films could be manipulated, and that some of the stories sold as true — like the "Kiss of the Spider Woman" — were actually created to sell cars. But what ultimately convinced many of us that "Mad Men" is as great as it is is the idea of Don Draper. He is every single one of us. His success in business, his emotional stability (as well as his occasional addiction problems), his inability to love — all of those traits are as true for us as they are for Don.

If you want to find out what those traits were, go back to "The Sopranos." We know the show is set in New Jersey, but I don't think we've ever seen the same person from different states. From "Mad Men," if you are one Don Draper who believes he has everything, then this character is for you. If it seems as though he has everything, it may be the case. But there's always a part of us, a little guy whose existence is always under threat in the shadow
