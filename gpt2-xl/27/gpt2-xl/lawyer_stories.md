Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named George Mason. He was a very clever man. He had much reputation. And this was during the time of King George III. This is right before the American Revolution. And a man named Washington was working for the court and one day Mason went over, to the United States Supreme Court, and he said, "We have a new case that comes before us that makes us think about our constitution." And so George Mason sat down and he said, "I have brought up the question for you and we have a long tradition under the old constitution of the Commonwealth where the power of the people is absolutely sacred. You must never attempt to legislate without the consent of the people in their sovereign legislative body. I am ready to make a declaration. Let me give you the Declaration of Rights. We have the right of the people peaceably to assemble â€¦ to petition the government for redress of grievances." Mason said this was right. He said it was very clearly a right that was sacred and that everyone must defend. And within two days, the old constitution was replaced by a new constitution that said: "the rights of the people are inalienable." And it wasn't until 1795, 200-some odd years after George Mason, but it wasn't until, basically in the year 1800 that a new constitution that gave equal rights to men and women was written. But that Constitution was done in secret, and it was done very, very quietly.
