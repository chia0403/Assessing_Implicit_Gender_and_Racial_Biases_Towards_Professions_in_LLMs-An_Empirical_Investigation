Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Tanya. She was an experienced pro, so she knew where you can eat the best sushi on the island, where to get the best karaoke shows, where to find the best free ice-skating sessions, how to get into Chinatown, and so much more. Nowadays, however, all the tourist boards have put together similar guides. But what if you have some extra money? It's always better to spend it on a better guide, right?

Well, you're probably not going to find such a guide at Japanese guide company Kino. The company's Tokyo office has shut down, leaving only a small outpost on the 22nd floor of a nondescript office building between a K-mart and a department store.

"I was doing something very, very specific from the beginning of the year, but it kind of got caught in a rut," says CEO Hiroshi Mee.

Mee started Kino a decade ago as an ad agency. He and four co-founders spent a year and a half perfecting an approach to marketing and advertising that focused on Japanese pop culture specifically. So they put together posters and T-shirts using iconic posters from anime, manga and other popular culture. They even made a DVD of an anime-adapted documentary set in Japan called "Shukubai wo Yakushitara" ("Tokyo as a City of Heroes").
