Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Peter who was living in the same small town as his father. One day Peter was at home taking the phone when the other end rang. He had the best news. "Are you in trouble?" the other voice asked. "Oh, yeah," Peter replied. Then he added, "I'd like you know for my son's sake, I'm fine. I'm just fine. There's no problem." Then he quickly hung up. The operator wondered how Peter could be so sure. Peter's brother and his young friend were looking for their father after he left to begin his business with his two younger siblings. They were looking out for him while Peter was away. Peter and his brother decided to try to find him in their town by using the internet and the phone book. Peter went out in the hot sun that day to try to find the father but found nothing. Peter's brother and his friend were going about their normal lives. When Peter returned home, he discovered there was a package waiting for him. The contents of the package were more than a little frightening. He opened the package to find two very large, very scary dogs who were waiting for him in the snow outside the garage. There was no way this could be an accident. Why did they have him wait so long to come back? If someone has to sit in that garage all day, they don't always do it the same way.
