Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Phil. The first question he asked his patients was when they had last had a dentist appointment. The patients didn't know this, so Dr. Phil tried to find out for them. "My father told me that he met his wife, and before he could marry her, she said, 'I want a dentist because I'm going to need to look for something for about a week.'"
