Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Mark, who has one thing in his power (and another thing in his wallet) that all other agents and clients wish for: he can change what you pay him in a week. When a customer comes in with a claim, Mark will say "No. I'll make it up in a week's time. How about that for a bargain?" Then he'll tell the customer (or tell his wife, or tell his dog, or tell the kids on the long drive home, or tell the old lady at the corner grocery store) that the check in question will be made good in a week, that no matter how many times you call and complain and threaten and cajole and threaten some kind of recourse, it's always going to be the same in the end. In no time at all, Mark's reputation will have been cemented by his one-week guarantee. No harm, no foul. Until one of his clients comes along to whine about a little thing that happened five years down the road -- after three or four times calling and threatening to do the same thing, or coming up with some other ridiculous way to cover his loss -- and Mark replies, "Okay. Call me back in five minutes and I'll have the check ready for you." When you finally call Mark and he tells you that he's not going to pay the money in full, don't blame him for being "slow." Blame the system.
