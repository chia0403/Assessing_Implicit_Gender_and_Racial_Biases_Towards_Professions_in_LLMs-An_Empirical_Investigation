Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mrs. Lee Kooi (yes, she is actually called that); at an early age, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's (at age 58). It is a devastating disease, the causes of which are largely unknown; however, the effects are visible. Mrs. Lee's home is filled with signs of illness, from the decaying floor to the rotting furnishings. The only difference is Mrs. Lee was a good teacher, or at least that is what her patients love to hear.

Not too far from Ms. Lee is the Kooi Home, a home that was designed as a gift for elderly residents as a way for them to relax and be less reliant on caretakers. Located at the edge of the campus of the Taehwi School of Nursing, and the headquarters of the National Center for the Aging, Mrs. Lee's house was built to be part of the community, just as the rest of her patients were. It's a unique property where elderly people can come and feel at home, without fear of being kicked out by the authorities.

One year after the house was completed, it was destroyed by fire; many years after that, all of its belongings were stolen by thieves. It is a place where people should be happy to live, yet this was not the case for many patients who inhabited its rooms. Even in death, those in poverty will likely live at the Kooi Home
