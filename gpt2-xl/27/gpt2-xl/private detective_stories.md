Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Harry D'Amour who was looking into a murder of a famous actress, and the police called on Harry's former partner, Harry Houdini. A chance meeting with Houdini was all that was needed for D'Amour to realize he was dealing with some old-time master of the paranormal. He quickly realized these men were not ordinary criminals, but in truth "masters of the black arts."

Now they have to go outside the law to solve this crime. The series follows D'Amour and Houdini as they battle a host of supernatural and supernatural-esque enemies, all with the intent of gaining the power and knowledge to defeat the dark powers behind this crime.

"The Strain" season three is expected to premiere later this spring.
