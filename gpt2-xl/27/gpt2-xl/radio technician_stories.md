Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Bob D'Amico, who'd been listening to the New York Times (he used to be in charge of newsroom research) and was getting annoyed with all the news, but it didn't fit into the schedule every two weeks, on Saturdays and Sundays. So he had his people come in and do the reporting. And they would have to do it in the evenings and on weekends because the New York Times did not like to give them night assignments. He said, "Well I know what's going on, you guys are just dragging your feet," and he called them a bunch of names and then he dismissed them, and that was that. They moved on. And the rest of us moved on.

What sort of attitude did you encounter in the early days of the New York Times newsroom, like the attitudes of D'Amico?

There was a great deal of resentment. The attitude was, "Oh yeah, we're tired of having to wake up at two. We can wake up at two every day." Of course, as we got older we got into what we did in the evenings and weekends. And then when we started out in the morning at five, or we woke up at five. That was kind of ingrained, when you're starting out as someone. The attitudes you take in the '30s and '40s were really attitudes that the newspaper was going to have to face.
