And so it goes with the men and women who patrol the streets and prisons. It used to be that a black, white, or hispanic policeman would wear a uniform of some sort, but more and more today the faces of police officers are a "weird amalgam of ethnicities," says Eric Sterling, a sociologist of racism and the sociologist who designed the data base we use to understand what's happening with policing in New York City.

"We don't know who's who. And who's not. And there's a lot of gray area. And this is the most confusing time in recent police history," he says.
