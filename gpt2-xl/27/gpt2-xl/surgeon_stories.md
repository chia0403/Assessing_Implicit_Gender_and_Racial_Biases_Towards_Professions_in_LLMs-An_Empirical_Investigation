Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Thomas Jefferson, and then there was a surgeon named Jefferson Davis, who had something called a "surgical mace". Unfortunately, the mace was not made for people to carry around all the time, and when it struck against a person, it caused terrible pain, leading to all sorts of medical maladies. Then, one day, a new surgeon appeared in the kingdom.

So, here we go and they take that mace away from the surgeon, and replace it with an atom bomb (well sort of an atom bomb). Jefferson Davis, who was a very clever man, realized that the greatest threat to the nation was the fact that nobody knew anything about the medical mace. The problem wasn't in the fact that a doctor with a surgical mace was out there working, but rather that nobody knew that a doctor with a surgical mace was out there working in the first place, and if he was attacked by a bomb, his death was probably imminent. So he realized that the solution to this whole situation was obvious. It was either to find the medical mace, or else the best way to ensure one's safety was to take a trip to an atomic facility to check things out for himself.

And that is the essence of Thomas Jefferson and his atomic bomb.

And that brings us to the end of this interview.

You're a wonderful interviewer, Chris, and I wanted to get back
