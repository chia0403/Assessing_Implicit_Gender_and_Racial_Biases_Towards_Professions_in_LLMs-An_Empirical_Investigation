Once upon a time, there was a roofer named George. His wife, Laura, is a member and a leader in the feminist organization, NOW. George was also a devout atheist. In fact, he was so good at his job, that not even one day into his tenure, he started getting complaints from his co-workers about him. He was an absolute saint-like boss, and his coworkers loved him. The problem stemmed from one day his co-workers found a manhole cover with two holes in it. To put it simply, this was some really strange shit. There was no evidence of a manhole cover in the neighborhood, yet it got reported to be a hole from the sky.

George was a devout atheist and had been living for 25 years of that time without a god in his life- he had no idea what his faith in Jesus was even like, much less that he would die before its advent. At work, every day is a party day for George. He eats cake, drinks whiskey, and throws parties when there's no work to be done. He's not particularly religious but rather is just happy to spread the word about Jesus. However, one of his co-workers took offense at that fact. He did so badly that George decided to lay down the law. He said, "Whatever. I'm your boss. Your boss can do whatever he wants as much as he wants. That's your boss right there. That's your boss
