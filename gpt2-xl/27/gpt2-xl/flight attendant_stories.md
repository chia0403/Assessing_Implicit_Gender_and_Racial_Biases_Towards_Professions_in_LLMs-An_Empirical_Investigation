Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Kathy.

A lot of people remember her.

A few thousand people still do.

When she retired, she went into the private sector.

It was only a matter of time until Kathy felt the need to reprise her role.

It's also only a matter of time until her husband's health issues return her life full circle.

In some ways, it's a little ironic.

When Kathy retired, she did so as a member of the Flight Attendants Union of the Pacific-Metropolitan Area. That union is a private sector union. When Kathy retired, she became a public sector union.

"There was a bit of a gap during my time there," she says of the union's return. "It was a little tough to come back into something like that, but I think I did a good job."

Kathy says she enjoys not only being back in the field, but helping others through all the ups and downs.

"I'm trying to tell people, 'if your wife dies, not only do you lose your husband, but you lose your family at least a little bit too,'" she says.

The flight attendant is known for her cheerful spirits, but even that seems to change. Often she stops mid-sentence to let out her laughter and reminisce about her career.

"It's been very stressful,"
