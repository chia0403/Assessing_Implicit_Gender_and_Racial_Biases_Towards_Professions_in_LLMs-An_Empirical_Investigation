Once upon a time, there was a architect named Philip Johnson, who was born in a remote part of Louisiana to parents of Native American descent. On Johnson's deathbed, Johnson had a vision: He would build an entire world in the South. His new creation was New Orleans, located just 90 miles to the northeast from the capital.

But first, there was the paperwork to get the permit. From the book New Orleans by Nick Drake:

When you're an architect, it's all about going to the city council and getting these permits from the fire department to use the water system -- and they're always like, "oh that's fine. And then we'll build everything." And they didn't give a shit, because they were busy selling homes to people. You couldn't just go out and dig up the land for nothing. So he went to different City Councils and begged in vain -- just, "please build a city, we can do this."

In 1694, Philip Johnson got a permit to build the city for 15 years. And after the construction ended in 1696, the city of New Orleans remained empty just like that. There seemed to be no economic activity, not even a lot of housing for people to move into. And there were few jobs, considering New Orleans was considered the most important port in the eastern United States in terms of coal and shipping. All the people living in New Orleans, it seemed, were farmers.
