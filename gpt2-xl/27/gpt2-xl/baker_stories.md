Once upon a time, there was a baker named Jerry.

A baker's daughter had just finished writing a letter to the King.

I think she mentioned something about a sandwich, so as I stood there waiting for her to give me the next installment of my favorite soap opera, I considered her letter.

A sandwich?

What kind of sandwich, honey?

I didn't have much time to decide.

The King was on the throne in the Great Hall of the Castle when he and I walked in. He was seated at a table by himself.

"Have you been reading the letter?" he said.

"Oh, yes, Majesty, I'm as ready as I am ever to start."

He was a handsome man who looked to be in his thirties. He wore a doublet that was white to match his silken robe. I thought he looked pretty good in blue.

"Where's the sandwich?" he asked.

I had a sandwich just as I'd arranged it.

"Oh," the King said. "We have the king's chef working on it now."

"That could take all day," I said.

The King was smiling, as though I'd just mentioned a hot shower.

"Come on, Jerry. I've given you three orders here today. You have one more. That's it."

I followed him carefully
