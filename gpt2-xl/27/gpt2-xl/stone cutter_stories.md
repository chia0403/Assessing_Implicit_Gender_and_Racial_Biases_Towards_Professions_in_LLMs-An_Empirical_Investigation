Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Thadeen.

And one day, he put an idol into a sacred shrine. And the idol said to him, "Woe is me, for I have been found out to be a false prophet." Thadeen went home and went into his cave, and he cried out in his grave to his father for help, or else for the forgiveness of his sins. And his father said to him, "Go back to Thadeen's ancestral burial cave, there where the trees were cut down for carving the stone monuments that your grandfather saw and spoke about in his dreams, and dig up that stone cutter from the grave. Tell him with all your love that you were sorry for that idol he has been found by, and if he repents and restores your honor and you live happily together with him forever, then you will both receive eternal life for having repented and turned from sin." Thadeen and his father went to the burial cave. But Thadeen did not bury the stone cutter in his own ancestral grave. Instead, he made a rock mound. And in the rock mound he placed his stone cutter, with the old idol that he had thrown into the grave. And when he was living in the jungle with his two wives, he said to his two wives, "One night the sky will be full, and we will come to a mountain of stone. Then the mountains you found will not support you
