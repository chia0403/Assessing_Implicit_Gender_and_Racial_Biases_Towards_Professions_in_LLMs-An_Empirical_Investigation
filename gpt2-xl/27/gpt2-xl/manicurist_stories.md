Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Bill who loved his daughter, who loved her son's wife, who kept herself occupied while her wife spent time with her husband.

Then one day Bill's wife became impotent. He, in turn, became impotent. The marriage ended in divorce.

Bill thought, "How tragic that women could lose any man they love in a moment of weakness."

Bill began to research and eventually developed the first Viagra. When he finally figured out how to make the compound, he decided to commercialize it so that other men would be able to gain their freedom back.

He also founded the company that still exists today – a company which Bill's daughter and wife still run, albeit with different leadership. He created a company called The Male Reproductive Health Institute.

Viagra – marketed as a way to help men to gain more energy – was a $50 million a year international business.

Bill's daughter was never able to make it work, but we all know how that turned out…

Now that we're all enlightened enough to recognize a healthy gender identity, we need to work to promote healthy masculinity to ensure that men who want to protect and cherish themselves and their families can regain their lost freedoms.
