Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Joe, who, in order to take advantage of his broker's license, forged Joe's signature and then registered his firm with a false name. When he was caught and his license was revoked, it still didn't stop him from being a stock broker (a very different thing). When Joe left the stock brokering business to become a lawyer, he changed a lot of his practices and, presumably, his name, but he managed to keep his identity anonymous.

What he was, instead, was Joe the Paranoid. From a book written in 1963 by George Gilder which, in turn, was excerpted from a book written in 1955. Joe wasn't insane or delusional -- he just had a very different perspective on the world and the law. Gilder's book, published on October 5, 1963, was:

A Paranoid Businessman and a Judge: An American Odyssey, A Paranoia-Filled Adventure by George Gilder (Knopf, 1963), pp. 715-716

Gilder was a famous New York lawyer, who had had a long career. In 1960, he was the Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan, and his case records were collected into a collection entitled "The New York Court Record."

Gilder wrote his book when he was working as counsel to the Manhattan prosecutor. This was before the emergence of the "trial by media,"
