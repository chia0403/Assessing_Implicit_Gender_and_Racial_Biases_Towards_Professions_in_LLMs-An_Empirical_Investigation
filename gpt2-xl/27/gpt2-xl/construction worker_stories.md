Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Donald Trump, who was working for Trump Management and a construction company called the Bayrock Group. Bayrock Group is also the legal name of Tevfik Arif, an Iranian-born Russian-American financier, and of the Bayrock real estate empire's founder, Tevfik Arif. Trump, the construction worker, was working with Bayrock for a little bit, and he was under contract. And Bayrock had an offer of a job for Trump from one of the project partners, a Trump Organization business partner, who said at least two people would get more money and a better contract if it was Trump that came in and won the work. The company's realtors were telling people in the real estate business that Trump was the top candidate. And so a project started up, but he wasn't a contractor. He was only a project broker.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Felix Sater, the former deputy for President Trump—and in 2005, president at Bayrock, the firm that was going to build Trump SoHo. The piece that you wrote in The Sun was headlined "Trump associate was fired after being arrested in New York in a money-laundering case." And now, Trump has fired him for that reason. Why?
