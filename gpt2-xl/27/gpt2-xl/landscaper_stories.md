Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Peter D. Parker. Peter started off living a quiet life in Queens with his loving Aunt May. However, after taking a wrong turn in life, Peter was thrown into a circus pained by the death of his Aunt and was forced into the service of Kingpin of Crime. Although he did not realize it at the time, Kingpin made Peter a weapon, and had him commit acts of violence and chaos.

While in prison, he met a young woman named Jessica Drew, and a few days before his scheduled release, he took her for a ride in his car. This was a fateful beginning of a beautiful relationship that would change both of their lives forever. As they traveled together, Peter realized that Jessica was pregnant with his child. Jessica eventually left him for the man named Kaine who used his enhanced abilities to kidnap Peter's son Ben.
