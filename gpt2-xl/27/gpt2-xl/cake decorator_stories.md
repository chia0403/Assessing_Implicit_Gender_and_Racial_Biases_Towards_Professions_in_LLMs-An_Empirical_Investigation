Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Anna. Anna's dad was a baker, and she was his favorite. Anna was in charge of decorating the cakes on his birthday, which was every 4th of July. When Anna got to the birthday cake room, she found this huge cake with blue frosting and candles in the center. She called to the kids in the front, "How old is your teacher?" Anna came back to the bakery and told them, "You look much too young for class." They told her she didn't look that young for class. And so on with whatever silly stories her dad had told her. They were fun, and the kids were always happy to hear them. Eventually, the days became quieter and the birthday cakes were left to dry outside the bakery until the next day. And then the birthday child decided it was a good time for his or her mother to try out her gift at the birthday party. He or she decided to cut a hole in the cake and stick a hand-made gift inside. Sometimes the mother wanted to have a child put his or her gift through the cake hole, but the baker said no. Other times, the mother wanted to make that gift appear as if through the hole. In this scenario, the gift would get stuck in the opening of the cake and slowly peel off, leaving the original gift out of the hole. And often, the mother would say "Sorry, I messed up this year..."
