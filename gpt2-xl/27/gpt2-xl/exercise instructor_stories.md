Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Tom Jones. One day, despite his best efforts, Tom failed in his daily workout. He was tired, hungry, and frustrated. Unable to get up from his couch to walk to the bathroom, Tom spent the rest of the day on the couch and cried. The sight of his wife sitting on the kitchen floor eating cereal made him feel humiliated that he should even attempt to help her, but he was tired, starving and frustrated. What Tom could not deal with was his humiliation and tears.

A good deal of research has shown that people who are in bad emotional states are generally less confident, less capable of initiating social interactions, and are even at greater risk of physical aggression (see also here and here). In addition, they may experience more stress. Such people may be unable to take care of themselves, often have a depressed mood, and may be at high risk of suicide (see here, here, and here).

Tom got up the following morning and returned to the kitchen. As he walked back into his living room, he realized that the chair before him was an emotional wreck. Tom sat down and sat with his mind at ease. He decided that he would use the following week of time to help Tom. Over the next few days, before he attempted to get out of bed, Tom would use the week to reflect on his week, get in the right mindset, and remind himself of what Tom would need in
