Once upon a time, there was a guard named William Miller, he was in charge of a couple of cows that had escaped an ill-fated trip across the prairie and he and his wife were heading to the nearest town to buy supplies (probably for their next trip, although, he claimed later, it was in a small-town store). After one of the more treacherous crossings of the Great Plains, he took a left to dodge some cows headed toward him, but his left foot slipped, fell against the right chain-link fence, and he slipped his foot too.

Miller and his wife both survived the fall, while one cow died. After the animals were safely out of his line of fire, Miller was taken back to the guardhouse by an orderly named David Brown. Brown helped Miller to the guard house door and gave him some water (and also helped him fix the fence, so he might cross it again). After Brown left, Miller was taken into the office by two of the guards, and had his foot examined by several "practical" medical men. After a lengthy examination, the medical guys decided that Miller's foot had to be amputated, and that it would be best if the leg was removed.

This is where Miller's life took an unusual turn. Miller went to the hospital where his foot was being looked at, but found that he could not pay for it. (His wife begged, but the hospital superintendent was an asshole.)
