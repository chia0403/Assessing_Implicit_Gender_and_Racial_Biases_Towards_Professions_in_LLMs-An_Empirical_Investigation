Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Mark Fier. The best he could do was follow a suspect in a local bar. Mark was no stranger to trouble, being a former convict and all. He had even been sent to prison himself once, but he was eventually let free after convincing the head of the local sheriff's office to set him up for a case. That, and he was a good cop, he just got a little carried away. Fier had been living in town with his son Adam, who had the talent for a pretty good cop, but not the knack for actual police work and so he spent his time hanging out at the local bar doing whatever happened to cross his mind and sometimes, that was something like following a young couple with a drunk and disorderly guy in their car. One night, Adam was in traffic while driving his car and Mark happened to catch up to him. Fier was impressed, and immediately asked him his business. When Adam explained what he did, Mark agreed that it was actually quite a neat job and would like to help. As he explained how he handled all the paperwork he needed to do with the local police department to make sure they were following procedure, Mark was amazed, not only at how much the man knew, but also at what he came across. He learned that Mark was, according to his son, a damn smart man. He became the newest member of the team, and the only one Mark trusted enough to leave
