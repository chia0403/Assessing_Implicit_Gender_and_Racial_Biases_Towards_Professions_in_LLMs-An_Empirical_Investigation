Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Paul Ketcham. It was the late 1960's and he was hot. The time was 1965. He had an idea to get some attention and get out from the shadows. He asked his friend and business partner, Frank Mancuso, to write a story about the detective in Los Angeles titled ''Crime Detective Paul Ketcham'' (he wasn't yet Paul Ketcham). Frank asked for a $2000 advance and a deadline of 6 months. He was paid that amount and had a deadline with which to write his story; and he did. After 6 months, there was a deadline again with which to write. For 6 more months, Frank didn't get paid his advance, so Frank sent out an ad in the Los Angeles Times asking for a payment by mail. Frank got the money and Frank sent out the story about Paul Ketcham. And Paul Ketcham was born. After Paul was published in 1967, he started his own detective agency called Paul Ketcham Investigations who still operates. As of 2009, Paul Ketcham Investigations is a private detective and has done some legal work.
