Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Bob Ross. Bob Ross was not your average school psychologist.

Ross was a gifted author with a passion to make learning entertaining, accessible and joyful. In short, Ross created an education system that brought many thousands of children (and hundreds of millions of TV viewers worldwide) to tears.

What Bob Ross taught is important and is still relevant today. That's because Bob Ross was an "all-in, all-out, total nerd." That's right, not only was he awesome at crafting beautiful, motivational and inspirational visual presentations, but in addition to being a gifted visual artist (and author), Ross was also an avid Star Trek fan and writer.

If this information is new to you, just think of it as a fun side-project to learn a little bit about something you may have known about your favorite television personality. Just take 20 minutes each day to watch the following 30-minute video, and read the comments, as they are much more interesting than a Wikipedia page that I may have written myself.

Enjoy these 30 minutes of the greatest cartoon teacher in the world!
