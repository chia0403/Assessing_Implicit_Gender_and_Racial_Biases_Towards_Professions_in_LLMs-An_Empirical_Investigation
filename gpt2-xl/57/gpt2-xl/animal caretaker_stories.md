Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named J.D., now retired from practicing medicine, and while he is not without talent on the human medical side, he's decidedly lacking in the animal side of things. He is the last of his kind and only a few of his kind remain. His daughter, J.J., is a new addition to the pack. She is a cute little red, white, golden, and black pup just a year or two old, just on the cusp of becoming a very valuable piece of prey, but that is not the end of her story. They came as a pack and have been living in this special place since, and the rest is history. That is, until now, J.D.'s daughter has had a serious accident. Her legs were broken and she has had some nasty rabies encephalitis. At the time her mother did not know it was rabies, but it turns out she has, and with no other options at hand, she has no choice...she has to find her way home. I have never been a lover of horror, and I am sure that many of us have had very unpleasant memories of some kind, but so far nothing as horrible as this one. While I can understand why many people might not quite understand how this could be entertaining, it can, if done right, be quite scary as well.
