Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Judy. She worked at the Burger King in the middle of a busy intersection, where many drivers were already looking for a parking spot.

I had ordered a hamburger, which took ten minutes to arrive through three drive-through windows. When I arrived, a blonde woman was already there with my meal.

"Thanks very much," I said.

"No problem," she said.

I noticed a small, rectangular metal box sitting on a table. The front side was covered with a simple sticker that read "Tasty!" On the back of the box was a similar sticker, covered by a sheet of bubble wrap.

After we had finished eating our respective meals, I asked:

"How long has that been there?"

"About five months."

"You're going to ask for a refund later?"

"Yes, we have the policy to give a refund if the product is not up to our standards." The customer smiled.

"I'm sorry, what is that policy?"

"Our policy," she said. "So don't be surprised when the refund comes."

Later that same day, when I got home from work, I opened the "Tasty!" box. Inside, I found a card telling me that I needed to return it because the burger was not up to the Burger King standards.

I was furious.
