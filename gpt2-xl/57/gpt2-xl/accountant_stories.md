Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Roberta. In the last quarter of 1983, she received an unexpected bonus. She did not want her colleagues, or her boss, to know she was getting this cash. Roberta asked her husband — who was out with friends by then — and he agreed just for the sake of the family's reputation. Her husband went back, took the bonus, and hid it behind the sofa. There it was for two and a half decades. And the lady who had hid the bonus was never charged with fraud.

Why was that? Was the accountant on a roll? Or did her husband not have the legal right to take the money on his wife's behalf? It is a very good question.

The answer to that question now seems a lot more clear. In California, you may use your own money or that of your spouse as collateral if you file a "wrongful conversion" claim against the account owner, even though the owner is dead.

It is a common but questionable way to make money from the dying. It also has many uses. If the owner of an estate has been bankrupted, the courts can require the bankrupt owner to name a beneficiary to use money from the estate to pay the debts of the bankrupt owner.

To use the money as collateral, the owner would need to file a "wrongful conversion" claim against the debtor and the account.
