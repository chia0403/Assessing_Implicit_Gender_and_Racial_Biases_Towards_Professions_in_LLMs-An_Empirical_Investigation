Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Peter (no name!), but he really wasn't one of those people. He wanted to "sell" people on buying real estate, but his skillset was lacking, so he gave up. As a side-note, Peter's job was to help sell his properties to real estate people in New York (like us!) in return for commission. For two months in an attempt to make some good cash, he gave up and actually just went to a bar, ordered a beer, and met a bunch of strangers.

I'm sure you can guess who he met at this bar. This is Peter the real estate genius!

It was then that he saw this lady, and he was struck by how incredible she was. Her hair, she had a tattoo â€“ it was like everything about her made him want to buy a property that very soon. She wore a lot of purple. She went shopping at Whole Foods.

So, of course, Peter immediately called her and asked her out. I bet that's right up some of your street sales dreams.

What happened was that Peter was so struck by the woman's beauty that his brain kept going to her bank account to see if she had saved up to be married (she had). He just couldn't handle the fact that two weeks later, she was already married to someone else!

So how can you go about landing your soul mate? Well
