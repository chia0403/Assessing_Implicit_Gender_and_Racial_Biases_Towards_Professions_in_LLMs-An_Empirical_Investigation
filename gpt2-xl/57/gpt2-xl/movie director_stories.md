Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Robert Altman who had a screenplay entitled "Memphis Belle." The screenplay was about a young woman named Memphis Belle and her journey away from the small town in which she grew up. She wanted to leave town and never return to her quiet life in Blue Ash, Kentucky, but some forces would stop her in her tracks.

Memphis Belle was named after a small city in Tennessee known as the "Mecca of the South." It was the most populated of the southern towns in the nineteenth century. Memphis is the third most populous city in Tennessee, and it is one of the state's original industrial centers. It was built around the turn of the twentieth century by a company called the National Park Service. During its heyday, the park Service operated several factories, including one that manufactured steel. It also had a railroad station that connected workers north and south of town. In the 1970s, when most factory employment had disappeared, the National Park Service pulled out of Memphis and leased its property and property easements to a few private companies.

Memphis Belle was a young girl who grew up in a small, rural Southwestern town called Blue Ash. She was raised in the Methodist Bible college that was right outside of town. But the Bible college was under federal investigation around 1976. Its accreditation was under investigation as well. The Bible college lost accreditation and was about to be closed. Memphis Belle decided to leave Blue Ash
