Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Martha. She used to wear beautiful dresses. They looked so lovely, so wonderful, that everyone wanted one as a Christmas present. Nobody cared who she was. As the years passed, the dresses kept going into the bargain bin." - Hedda Hopper.

And so, without any comment whatsoever, this little gem ended up on my screen, for that's exactly what happens when you use the "send to a file" command:

I went for a run at the beginning of the day. When, after walking in the rain for quite a while and having a really bad time, we arrived at my favourite place, I put my clothes on the table and took off the warm-ups. I went to my dressmaker's, where I paid 15 dollars for a beautiful dress. It was the only dress I owned, and so you knew what it meant. I asked her several questions. She said, "I don't make dresses. I make clothes for people." And I said, "What's this?" And she said, "When you're finished," and I'm like, "What do you mean, make?" "I don't make dresses," she said. "I make clothes for people."

And then my mind went blank. Suddenly, I understood who she was: Martha Stewart. I had no idea she was anybody special, because I was so busy looking for something new to buy
