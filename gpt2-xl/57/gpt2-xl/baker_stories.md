Once upon a time, there was a baker named Thomas the Bold, who served as the royal baker for King Henry VIII. Thomas made cakes shaped like women and gave them to Henry as gifts, according to Thomas Hardy, the celebrated author (and father of James). James created one of the best known cakes, called the Black Princess, which remains one of the most popular cakes in the world. James later wrote, "My daughter's sweet confection was so famous that it was made into a miniature doll and placed in a window near her window when she was five or six years old, where it remained for nine years or more."
