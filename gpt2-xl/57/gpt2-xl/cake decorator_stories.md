Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Steve Pfeiffer. On the day he came to my house for work, Steve was busy decorating the cake. We had a long chat and he then asked me if my sister knew any cake decorators and how they do their job. "Who cares." I said. "Oh, I'm quite good, actually." I had heard some great quotes but Steve was still impressed with my knowledge of the cake decorating job. I showed him a few photos and he was a bit surprised by the results. He gave me a job and I was to be his personal assistant for a week or so until he called me back. For the next five days, I did whatever he had to do with my sister's wedding in a really short time. I did as he asked, I put the wedding cake together and I decorated things I could see. I put a couple of extra steps in my job including taking photos of the cake for the online gallery and I also helped with the photos for people entering in competitions that Steve ran. For five days, I worked twelve hours every day from ten to four. My first day was ten hours and the last day was two hours. The only thing that could have made my five days so much longer would have been if the only thing I had to do this whole time was to help Steve finish his day job. But I was able to do it and I didn't mind the extra time
