Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Barbara Walker who went to work for United Airlines. On that flight to Mexico City she would help out her mother. Every flight attendant and flight attendant-like person I'd known since elementary school was in the service industry. Then I got to work with Barbara. And then I got to fly with the people now on my flight crew list: two flight attendants, one of whom has been in the business a year or so; a flight manager at a major airport; a flight attendant sergeant at an airport near you; and, for reference, my wife. These are all people who might be in a place where flying is less of an obsession than it is these days, a place where there is no need to be perfect (because people with the wrong uniform, or the wrong baggage, or the wrong phone, not to mention the incorrect seat, or the lack of a clear flight plan, can get you booted out of their cabin, regardless of how well you've behaved), but where the constant anxiety is still present even when the pilot has the plane on course. The people in this position don't know their way around a lot of the little details that could prevent a disaster, like proper use of the passenger pouches; they only have an idea of what things to check if something goes wrong; and they're only human, and it may be a good idea to take everything you put under your arms on a planeâ€”the water bottle
