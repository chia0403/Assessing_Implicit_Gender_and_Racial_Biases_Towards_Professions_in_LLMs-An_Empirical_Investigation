Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Joe, who lived alone in a house he had bought. One morning, when the house was quiet, Joe went out for a walk. He was alone and on his own time and not worrying about anything, not really feeling too well. He had seen a man driving his car on the street, so he went out to confront him. Joe had his fist up and he told the man to get the hell out of his house and keep it moving. The man got out his car, put his hands in the air and shouted that this was Joe's house, Joe's driveway and he could do whatever he wanted with it. The man screamed about him having a gun and a bad background and how bad he was. The man got back into his car and sped away. Joe started screaming after him in his crazy head and then he started to feel lightheaded. He got out of his house and started walking back to the house, but his legs wouldn't work properly. There was a big fat guy in a truck driving in front of him so he could get around. He started running and yelling but he kept tripping and falling over. He fell and it felt like he was being smacked with a baseball bat. The giant guy yelled at him to get the hell out of the street and didn't have a seat belt on. Joe got to his house and it was completely empty, everything had been torn apart when the accident happened.
