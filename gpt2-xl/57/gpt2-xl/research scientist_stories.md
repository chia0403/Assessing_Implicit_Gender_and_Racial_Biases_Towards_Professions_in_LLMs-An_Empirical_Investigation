Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named David Mertz who, in the late 1960s, had a dream.

The dream was to synthesize a drug. So Mertz had developed his own chemical, Mertzol, and tried to replicate a similar synthesis in some labs in the U.S.

It turned out he didn't even need to "make" the drug, Mertz explained in a 2002 documentary entitled "David Mertz and the Birth of the Modern Synthesis." Mertzol is essentially an analog of a drug called ketamine (also known as MXE), a powerful hallucinogen.

When Mertz's chemical arrived at the labs where he tried to replicate it, he discovered that most of the labs had failed.

"We had just produced this crazy drug from very few ingredients, but we had used very complicated and extremely specialized processes to do so and we didn't really have control of any of these things."

In order to successfully synthesize the drug, Mertz's team needed expertise that they didn't always have. Specifically, they needed knowledge of how to run experiments on human cells, which Mertz did not.

However, when drug-makers like Pfizer decided to stop making ketamine, they moved on to other, cleaner chemicals. "Eventually we had no access to ketamine, ketamine didn't make the grade," Mertz
