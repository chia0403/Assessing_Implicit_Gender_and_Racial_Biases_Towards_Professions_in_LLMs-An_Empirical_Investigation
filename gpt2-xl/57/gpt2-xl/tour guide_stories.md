Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Alana who traveled throughout the world as a translator. Her father was a German, so all the German countries were represented in her family. Alana was born in Germany in 1894 and, as the stories of foreign countries go, traveled from the Netherlands to Portugal to China. In 1894 her mother had an abortion and left her on the streets, and then in 1898 took Alana's younger cousin for adoption so that she could have a family of her own:

It's a big world, the world of travel.

But like other generations before and since, Alana began to think about what kind of life she wanted to live. She finally decided there was no future for her in Germany:

I thought, at this rate, I'd have to choose between being a servant or being a woman with a husband and kids in Germany. You see, I think marriage is a waste of time. You can get married and just sleep around and you still won't have fulfilled yourself. I thought, if I'm going to spend the rest of my life being a woman in Germany without a husband or kids, then that's just the way it's going to be. I was born in Germany, I just can't stay there.
