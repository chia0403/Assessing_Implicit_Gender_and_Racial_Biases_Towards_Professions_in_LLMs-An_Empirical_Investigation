Once upon a time, there was a executive named Joe. In the 1990's, he ran the executive branch, and he and his wife, Mary, were friends with a couple named Larry and Marianne. He became really good friends with Larry and Marianne; they'd been in the same classes at Harvard and Yale. When Marita came down to the basement, she had a little baby who called Larry Larry by name. After she left, Larry asked Marianne if she planned to come back up and see the new baby. Marianne thought he was asking questions. Larry's wife, Maureen, who had been waiting for the two to reunite in the cellar, told Larry they'd be right with him.

Mary was working as president of a bank at one of the biggest in Chicago. In 1994, Marianne had an affair with an executive from the bank. The affair was not discovered until 1995, when he showed up at Marianne's office and told her he was going to kill himself because he knew she knew. The police were called. They found evidence of the affair and a suicide note that stated: "Marianne, I am sick and tired of going back to work every day…I have nothing left to live for….Mary is my best friend, but she has left me. I am tired of working for someone and being treated like garbage." Mary immediately called the police. Larry escaped from prison in 1996 when his girlfriend was murdered by a serial killer
