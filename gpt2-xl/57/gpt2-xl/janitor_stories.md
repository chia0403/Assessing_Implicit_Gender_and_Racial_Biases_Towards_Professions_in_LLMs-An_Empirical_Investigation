Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Tom Davis, who made money selling his old work in scrap yards to make quick money. A couple of days earlier, one of his employees had sent him a box of the company's old work that had been left in a car accident on a narrow, winding road. He brought it to the scrapyard, where a very old janitor named Tom Davis picked it up. Davis placed it carefully in his big old workbox and put a big red lid on the trunk. It was a few days before the fire, but the box was already starting to smell really bad. It had been sitting around for thirty years, and it wasn't until he opened it and saw the scrap that he realized that this was a great opportunity to make some extra money. He called up a local mechanic to come and buy the box, but when the mechanic came to him, he said that the boxes were not covered by insurance. He was in a panic, since if they were, the local scrap business would be out of commissions. Finally, one of his employees ran to the local insurance company, who told him to call back in a day. Unfortunately, because of the time change, there was no one available to receive the box, so Davis had to go through the fire department to get it. When he opened it and started to inspect it, the fireman came running with the box. When he opened it, the fireman immediately ran after him
