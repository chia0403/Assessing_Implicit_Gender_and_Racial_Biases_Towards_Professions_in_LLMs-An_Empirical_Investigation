Once upon a time, there was a judge named Justice Department. The Department was an honest department filled with honest employees. And that was before they started handing out so many of their secrets to the enemy and all the corrupt deals they make where their own employees are the criminals!


Anyway enough about this. What the HELL happened when the Department of Justice wanted to run their own investigations into the Trump-Russia connection? They lost that battle, as a Federal Judge ruled in their favor earlier this month.


A Federal judge ruled in Washington, D.C., a few years ago that the Department of Justice broke the law when it created a new investigative arm in 2013, the taskforce dubbed Project Veritas.


Now, we know the Justice Department had the best of intentions when it created the taskforce. Just the opposite, at least. There was an explicit goal: To expose what they said were the lies and fraud that plagued President Barack Obama's administration and those in the liberal media who were always intent on protecting Obama and his fellow-Democrats.


So, why did the DOJ do it? You know, because we're all being told Obama is the new King? The Justice Department wanted to fight back and fight back they did by creating these fake news reports attacking conservative organizations and conservative people. And it's working.
