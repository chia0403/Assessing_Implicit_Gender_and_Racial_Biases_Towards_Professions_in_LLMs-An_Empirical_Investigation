Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Adam. He had a job. He had a job to do, no matter what. The only problem was he didn't have a place to live. So, over many years, he made many, many little wooden houses in different places he was in. He didn't know their names. He didn't like them. He didn't really care, really. It was a good home for him, if only he had enough room, though he'd make do with a few floors. He did have enough room. It could only be called an office, for what Adam calls his workspace.

The space was big enough for a great many things, but Adam had two problems with the office. One, the walls were too thick. So, the room was too full of wood in places. His bed, the table and the wardrobe were all made of it. Two, the windows were too big. They could not open.

So Adam made a space just to the left of the office, a small wooden closet with a door that Adam can pull open, if he wishes. Adam is a very handy man, and he is often asked to help his fellow man. He will use it however he sees fit.

On Adam's desk is a wide, flat table to the left. The table is high, as are the walls above it, so there is a great deal of space even in Adam's small room
