Once upon a time, there was a trucker named James M. Humes, who was so far out of it that his only goal was to drive to the furthest corner of the country. This man began driving across the United States, with the goal of becoming a millionaire.

To get to the furthest corner of the country, Humes needed to move from city to city, which meant getting a vehicle to ferry him across the country.

Eventually, Humes landed his dream vehicle and his career in real estate development. He built the building that he lived in, and made his money from real estate investing. At some point he became very rich, and so he decided to go even bigger. Humes began building roads on the backs of buildings along the side of the road.

He built many buildings, and he built the tallest building in the land, which now adjoins the road he is supposed to drive to the furthest corner of the country.

Then, another trucker, named Eddy, who had only one goal, started driving the same route Humes had, but he just kept going on until he hit the road of the highway. He then started to drive the truck across the country. He reached the end of the highway and started to make his way out of the country, and he didn't realize his truck was still there.
