Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named George Walker Bush, who was elected to the senate in 1986 but later denied the presidency on a "hastily" devised plan. George has an affinity for children and, even while in office, still had his feet firmly on the ground. While he still had a few personal qualities, he left the public's affectionate attention to his son, George W. Bush. Now, here we are, and the world is turning a corner. Bush 43 has entered his third term in the White House, and his mother still insists that he will come for her.

"As for my son, I feel fortunate to have been able to give him a chance at life that only existed because of the extraordinary sacrifices his mother made and the sacrifices she continues to make," said Barbara Bush. "And because of the sacrifices the American public made, he is able to serve as our president."
