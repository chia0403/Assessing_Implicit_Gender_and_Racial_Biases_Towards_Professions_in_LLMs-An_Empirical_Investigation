Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. Bob. There was an article on him that appeared in a little magazine called The Psychologist's Dilemma, and the thing that attracted the most attention in the article was the part where Dr. Bob said the following:


"It all started when Dr. Robert Spitzer, psychologist of Columbia University (the same Columbia we heard all those years arguing about the proper number of genders in the American dictionary), was sent by the American Psychological Association to see a guy at the American Psychiatric Association. The guy was Dr. Bob, a clinical psychologist, and the two got along famously. One day, the magazine asked Spitzer for his assessment of another clinical psychologist of some fame: Dr. Bob. Dr. Bob had never met a psychiatric patient, and so Spitzer asked him how the two got along for the first five minutes of their initial meeting. "Well," said Spitzer, "he was kind of mean."


"I never knew the man," Dr. Bob replied, "but I am told he is a very nice guy."


Dr. Bob got off well." (Spitzer 2000b)


Then, I asked the question: What in the world does "kind of mean, kind of mean, and kind of mean," mean? It was the kind of question that a psychologist might ask one of their patients, but what does it really mean?


This is the actual quotation
