Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Bill. She was the first woman to be a fulltime staff member of the hospital, and to give birth alone. She was also one of the very few women in America to have ever made it into a position in a hospital administration team, where she was ultimately promoted to hospital manager, in 1946. For Bill, the hospital was a sanctuary, a place to work to provide for many of her children.

With the passage of time, Bill's health declined and she gradually became confined to her bed. She had a few more children, but was unable to care for them all, resulting in the eventual death of all but one. In 2008, Bill's youngest son, Dennis, a retired physician's assistant, and his wife Karen went to the funeral home where she had lived for over 40 years with her partner. At the wake, it was learned that Bill had died only a few weeks before, with only Dennis with her around to see her off to eternal rest.

It may be a place where the hospital staff, operating under the supervision of a physician, cares for patients and delivers the most fundamental components of healthcareâ€”to heal; for comfort; and to comfort the dying. But, the question still remains, why? Why is medical care a service that is not only freely and widely available to all, but is also required by law
