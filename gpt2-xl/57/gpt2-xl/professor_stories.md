Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. R.C. Finkelstein, who had the bright idea of writing the largest scientific experiment ever undertaken. And over the course of ten years, a group of scientists, including Dr. Finkelstein, studied how many different types of cancer were present in various parts of the U.S., and how likely people were to get them. After finding that people in the South were more likely to get lung cancer, they then checked that against the prevalence of smoking in that region. If it was true that lung cancer was more likely to occur in Southern people, then it would certainly be worth the environmental cost to fight it. When the study was finally published in 2003, the results were extremely surprising: the odds of getting lung cancer decreased in that region, but only by ten yearsâ€”a huge drop. Finkelstein argued that since smoking is a risk factor for many cancers and cancers of the lungs accounted for only 9 percent of deaths, smoking's benefit was likely exaggerated and the environmental cost extremely small. "My impression is that Dr. Finkelstein was fairly objective and had a sense of the data," Ramez Naam, who has published several books in which he proposes solutions to environmental problems, said. "He was just looking for a story that made his case. He was not looking for a clear-cut message that was true. But there were enough pieces of data that were there to make an overall impression,
