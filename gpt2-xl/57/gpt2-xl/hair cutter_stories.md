Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Lillian Hellman who was also an African American mother. Her job was to make a wig for a lady she had been hired to take care of when the lady would travel to Atlanta. In this case the lady was Mrs. B.R. Martin, a black woman who would go to Georgia to visit her family. Mrs. Martin came across Mr. Hellman's shop when she went to visit her family in Atlanta and she fell in love with how much work she could get in doing the hair she had bought.

Ms. Hellman began helping Mrs. Martin in this job and slowly she became more and more successful and had more and more customers who also wanted Ms. Hellman's services. Eventually the name of the company changed to HELLMAN BROS. & CO. This name eventually became the Hellmans.

Today when an African American woman starts her business, many may argue whether it is worth it to go for it. The answer can certainly be found in the story of Lillian Hellman, who started what would grow into a billion dollar company called HELLMAN BROS. & CO. As is the case with many businesses and professions, the success was the result of a good deal of hard work and it paid back the investment made. Hellman's hair services continued to grow until the company became the Hellmans Bros. & Coffeeshop.
