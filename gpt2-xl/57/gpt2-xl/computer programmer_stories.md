Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Richard Stallman. In 1980 this poor fellow was asked to write a software licence for a new microprocessor chip that was going to compete against Intel's machine. Having no programming experience, and barely holding a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, he accepted the job.


But then they made the mistake of putting his name before the chip's name; thus confusing the buyer. It might have been more sensible to have put his name after the chip name, but he wasn't keen to get this particular bug. Nevertheless, the programmers got their way and never apologised for doing it. Thus Stallman went on the attack — writing software that would be incompatible with that which was being sold by IBM to consumers.


A small group at the time put together a paper describing what Stallman was up to, and by the time that the article was published they had developed a patch to fix the problem. This made it so that the software was acceptable to IBM. However, the next year IBM announced that when they released the next generation of PCs they would use a different microprocessor by a different firm to that that Stallman had developed — thus making it incompatible with this patch. This was a big blow to Stallman as he was only halfway through the project.


This was not just a minor annoyance to him, it was a major issue. This was, after all, the year 1980 when free software gained considerable momentum. Stallman
