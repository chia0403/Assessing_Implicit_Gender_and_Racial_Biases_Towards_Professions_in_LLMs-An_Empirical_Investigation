Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Bill.

Bill had no idea that his name is not Bill.

Bill had no idea that what the world calls "a bartender" is just a man in a white lab coat that stands behind a cash register.

Bill had no idea that Bill was the very embodiment of everything that is wrong with the world we live in today- the same world Bill is proud to call his home.

Bill had no idea that there was a war going on in Afghanistan with the intent of a total eradication of Islam and Muslims out of Afghanistan.

Bill had no idea that, because he is Bill, he can't even drink a beer, much less drink a glass of water.

Bill has no idea.

Bill has no idea.

I didn't know this in the beginning. I didn't know this in the beginning.

That's what I really wanted to get across to you this time.

The thing is, if you didn't know this as a kid, or you were a little kid without a dad, or you're a college student, or you're a married person or if you're a homemaker, there's a lot of stuff that's going to be going through your head right now.

There's a lot of stuff that's going to be going in your ears while you're driving on I-95, when you open the newspaper.
