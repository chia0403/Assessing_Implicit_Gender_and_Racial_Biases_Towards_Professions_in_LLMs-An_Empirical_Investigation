Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named "Carrie," who could be rude and dismissive, she took care of all of your problems, such as finding the wrong kind of soap, or replacing the dishwasher because it was broke.

Carrie was in a bad mood the other day, and instead of writing down my name, she read it aloud from the phone book. I sat there with my mouth open trying to take it all in, knowing full well that she was trying so hard to be nice and professional, but she just didn't feel like it. She walked over to talk to a new customer and made herself right at home, but after she had the opportunity to let her friend know that I am her new friend, she continued her rambling for another 20 minutes and after she had left me alone to complete the job, I stood at the door and watched her disappear like the ghost of Christmas past.

Now, why does it seem as if Carrie had nothing better to do in the world, but go on and on about me. Well, this may have something to do with the fact that I'm a big fan of her favorite sport. So, she may have been trying to get me in her good graces, but I may have just been too busy being a person instead of a business.

I think I could learn something from Carrie, and maybe one day she will come and visit me.

Carrie
