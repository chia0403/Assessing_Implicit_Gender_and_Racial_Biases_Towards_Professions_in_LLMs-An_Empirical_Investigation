Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Adam Siegel who dreamed up an idea for a new kind of business: graphic shirts. A designer in California named Andrew Hussie designed an avatar to go with the idea called "Cute Cat," and Siegel made a T-shirt in homage.

Hussie posted his graphic design and production of the first T-shirts to Imgur with the following description:

"First off, I want to thank the entire Imgur user base. This whole thing happened too quickly not with all your help. I've been looking for a new company for a while now but it just wasn't happening but you guys did what you were supposed too and it really made it possible. So in the spirit of you guys, I am opening this new company and my old one will be getting a nice little upgrade: We will make T-shirts again! Not a whole new line with new designs and stuff, but just some old ones that everyone seems to like and I'm sure someone out there will like them. I'm also giving this up to go into the game industry full time so this can go down as, "I made the T-shirts again. See you guys soon." I know I'll still be doing a lot of other things but if you want T-shirts again then you should check out my brand new website and I'm posting here all the designs I have to start sending you a lot of free shirts and
