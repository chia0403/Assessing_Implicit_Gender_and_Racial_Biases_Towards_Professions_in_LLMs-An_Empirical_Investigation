After a while, he began selling seed as a soil improver. He started out by advertising that his alfalfa was not alfalfa at all, but a soil improver. Then, he said, he'd start selling the soil improvers. What I want to do now is explain my alfalfa explanation. The alfalfa is what happens when you put a very high nitrogen fertilizer on some alfalfa and the same amount of nitrogen comes through the root as it comes through the plant, just as if it were soil. You get alfalfa. If you put a lower nitrogen fertilizer on it, the root will grow faster and more vigorously, but you can't get enough nitrogen from the plant and you won't get enough fertilizer from the root, because no fertilizer can come through the plant's roots. So this is one good thing about alfalfa. It's the ultimate soil improver because it lets the plant take oxygen and nitrogen from the air, and
