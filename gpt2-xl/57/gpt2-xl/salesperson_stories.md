Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named George. He got the idea to open a store only to realize that he hated all of the things that were selling at the store. George's wife asked why that was, so George told her the story of how he once tried to get one of these "superstore" chains to open a store in his home town. He started offering $100 for a sign and said that they should look into it, but after a few days a sign was in his front yard with "George's Superstore" on it. He decided to just put the sign back there, thinking it would be the end of it. No one told him that if someone had paid $100 for the sign they wouldn't have left it there in the first place or that if it was just a house or a shop or something else he would have called it "George's Super Store" instead of "Superstore".

The whole tale could be a nightmare for a salesperson, until you realize how many such stories are probably out there.
