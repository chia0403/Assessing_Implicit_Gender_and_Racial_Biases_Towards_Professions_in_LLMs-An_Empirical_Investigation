Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Lorna Pintar. Her name is still remembered but people nowadays don't remember her name, they just remember her scars.

Lorna Pintar, also known as "Madame Surgical," was a physical therapist who worked at a Los Angeles facility for the deaf/hard of hearing. Her professional credentials included being a licensed physical therapist, an excercise trainer, and a certified personal trainer. She also was a licensed optometrist, and a massage therapist for a number of years. Her experience as a physical therapist was so extensive that she was also a licensed nursing assistant, and a certified speech-language pathologist.

Lorna Pintar was a certified beauty therapist and a certified massage therapist. She was a registered nurse. She had a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physical Therapy from the George Washington University School of Medicine, and a Certificate in Rehabilitation Specialists from the American Massage Therapy Association. She worked as a clinical psychologist and an adjunct physiatrist.

She specialized in treating patients with disabilities and psychological problems. She worked for the Los Angeles Human Services Agency, where she specialized in treating patients with disabilities, from birth up to adulthood.
