Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Jim Koehler. In his time, he was an expert on "recovery from traumatic experience." His techniques were used on people who'd been traumatized in the military. Like Koehler, I once worked with the survivors. I wrote about my experience in How I Helped a Trauma-Prone Veteran Regain His Self-Esteem, after trying to help many of them. Then Koehler and I took a trip together to visit the soldiers Koehler had been treating. I told them about all the things I'd heard about. They'd had their own memories to share, along with the horrors they'd experienced.

But Koehler was a bit more reluctant to tell the soldiers how to find help. As it turned out, there wasn't a lot in it. Koehler himself never used the phrases I remembered his clients using. Instead, he told them they could feel better by taking up some recreational recreational activity. As we headed for the door, Koehler paused. "I feel like there are other ways to help people."

I didn't share the soldiers' story with anyone else as it helped them, and I felt bad that I had not shared it more widely. It was a lesson I've learned today: For some people, words and facts and examples are insufficient to provide information that could help in their recovery.
