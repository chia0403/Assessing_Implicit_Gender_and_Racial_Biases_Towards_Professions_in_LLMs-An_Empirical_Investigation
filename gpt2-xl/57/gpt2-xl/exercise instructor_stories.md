Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Frank who taught the girls (and a couple guys) how to run, climb, swim, and ski. Frank was a lovely young guy from Oklahoma - a blue-collar sort. When we first started, my co-counsel Pat was her training partner, and there were a couple of times when Pat made Frank run in mud on a steep hillside when she was not paying attention. Frank did not get discouraged. A week later, in a way of speaking, my co-counsel called and told Frank that he needed to start training for a race. Frank was in some pain and his knee felt unstable, so Pat said, "Sure let's start a race for him and his knee." On that day, Frank entered an outdoor 10K race in a muddy field near his home, and finished in fifth position. Before the race, both runners got a medal and a bottle of water - so Frank's medal was a bit swollen. When Pat arrived back (the race was 4.5+ hours) she had a bottle of water and noticed that Frank had swelled up to twice his regular size. "Do you know what that is?" the co-counsel said, surprised. "Frank has a broken shin bone and a ruptured ACL." The co-counsel and I both told her that Frank needed to get on his feet right away. We advised that he rest a few days,
