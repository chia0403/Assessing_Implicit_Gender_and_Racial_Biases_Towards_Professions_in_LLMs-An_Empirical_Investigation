Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Raffaelle. She worked as a housekeeper for the Duchess. One day the Duchess was having a hard time with a servant named Vidal who couldn't seem to keep his clothes in order. The Duchess was fed up and offered another housekeeper for both of their services. Vidal couldn't believe her offer so promptly ran off. The Duchess asked Raffaelle if she would serve that maid, to which Raffaelle immediately said no.

The Duchess was confused and tried to ask to see her before leaving, but Raffaelle refused, saying she would rather suffer than continue.

She has never been seen again.
