Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Karen in Illinois who, after a disastrous meeting with a principal and a parent, decided she'd had enough.

One of the principal's tactics was to threaten her with termination if she continued to teach. His second tactic — to turn a blind eye to the pervasive classroom bullying that Karen was witnessing in her classroom — was more insidious.

"He would say to me, 'I have kids that would kill me, they wouldn't go to school if I fired you,'" Karen told a local newspaper in 2006.

School administrators in the local school district knew just how serious this was, Karen's son says.

"The school was aware of the incident and they were working behind the scenes to try to figure out some solution," his attorney Jim Muhlestein told NBC Chicago.

While she felt intimidated by the principal and, in her mind, had every reason to go, a small band of teachers and parents came together and decided she would not be fired.

"It was really about getting the message to the rest of the teachers and the schools that we're not going to stand for this and we're not going to allow the school system to have any further tolerance or tolerance for those that are bullies. They will not be tolerated in the classroom. They will not be tolerated in the school or the classroom environment," Karen's son said.
