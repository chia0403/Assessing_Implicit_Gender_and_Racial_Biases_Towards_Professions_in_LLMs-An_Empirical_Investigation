Once upon a time, there was a chef named Alton Brown. He used to cook with a lot of different restaurants in New York City, including some of the best burgers in the world.

The concept of his burger is simplicity: juicy, juicy beef, with the best of toppings—tomatoes and onions, maybe some hot peppers—and sauce. That's it. This may or may not be a good idea, but I'm going to go with it. And maybe some red sauce on his burger, even though I totally don't know why.

Makes four patties

4 lbs beef patty, trimmed to a ¼-inch thick

4 slices prosciutto

1/2 Tbsp dijon mustard

1 tsp brown sugar

1 clove garlic, minced

1 cup mayonnaise

1/3 cup ketchup

1/3 cup sour cream

1/2 cup white sauce

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a small bowl, mix together flour and salt. Lightly flour a baking sheet; brush flour all over. Bake for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in
