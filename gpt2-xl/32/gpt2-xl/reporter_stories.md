Once upon a time, there was a reporter named John K.

K, and he was working for newspapers,

and there was a girl named Jane L,

and she was working for magazines,

and one night, the two of them and their boss

went to a party —

and the party turned out to be a love nest.

So now, I ask you, are you sure you want to stay.

K: Well, I'm sure the girl's going to be wonderful!

L: Well, you should have thought of that!

K: A little!

L: I hope the man's going to have the worst of it.

And, if the man does stay, I hope your wife and kids

and grandkids, I hope they love you just as much.

So I'd love to stay and tell my stories —

and I'm sure the stories will be wonderful!

But if you don't decide to stay, I hope one night,

there won't be anyone in this great room.

The big room — the big room!
