This fire fighter had been on the rig for 30 years and while he hated the job (too much for the big man of the crew of fire apparatus of which he was a part) he loved everything about his job. Robert loved his wife, his daughter, his sister, his father, his brother, his friends, his old life and all the parts around it. He had had many happy, fulfilling careers, but none had really taken care of him. So much time had passed that he had given up the habit of wearing a pocket watch and thought nothing of the day of the week or even the date. Most days were spent alone in his office working out a large number of small tasks. The only other time Robert took part in the daily activities of the station was when it was essential for the safety of the station. The job had come a long way from the days when the station was just a group of small holes set close together on the platform of the train station where people had to climb down into the street and climb back up before riding again on the same railroad. The old station was filled with piles of debris, twisted iron and twisted copper cables. It was an old building with lots of rooms, and many, many men and women had worked hard so that it could have stood just then
