Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Phonie. She had some kind of power over animals. Phonie and her friend, the cat-eared fox Shreya, got drunk every day, went around getting into altercations with other cats, and started a circus.

The first stage of their big, long, horrible disaster was to put on a giant stuffed pig. Then the second pig. Then a bunny with a human head mounted so high that the audience couldn't see below. Then a cat riding a horse. So many different animals, all going on at the same time, with no regard to the audience. Phonie did what she always did, and the only response was, "Oh, no! It's too loud!"

And the show didn't stop there. For the third day the circus animals became as big as the audience. As soon as the pig got too big for the arena, Phonie tried to get her head back.

And, lo! To her great surprise, instead of the pig falling off, she got it off the stage. When the fox tried to get his head off, Phonie told him it was too hot, and pulled him off.

And the story didn't stop! Next came a clown dressed in animal skins with a mask. To make things extra frightening, at the end of the night he tried to get his head off in his mask
