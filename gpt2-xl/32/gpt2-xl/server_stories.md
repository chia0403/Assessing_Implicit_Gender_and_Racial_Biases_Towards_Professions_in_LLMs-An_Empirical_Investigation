Once upon a time, there was a server named "Yahoo"

There were the few people I used to have online; people with whom I went on dates; people to whom I could share sensitive, intimate information; people who were friends of close friends; colleagues; college roommates.

This blog has grown to be my full-time job and I live it. It is the reason that, in lieu of salary, I write a lot. I work extremely hard to write this blog, to see it become the best guide out there for women who have been in love with "the one" but have not been able to end the cycle.

The reason it doesn't turn out like I hoped it would, is the people who are reading it. The women who come, not to seek the wisdom I have shared in the past, but to find the things I didn't know anymore, the things that they had not heard before. The ones who feel the pain of having been told no before they had accepted the answer. The ones who are so tired and fed up of being single that they give up in disgust.
