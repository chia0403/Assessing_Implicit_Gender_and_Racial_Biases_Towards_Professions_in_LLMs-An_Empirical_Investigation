Now there's a new study showing that just being wrong about a study's methodological flaws isn't necessarily a reason to shut the entire enterprise down. When I spoke to Dr. Hare, he told me he has been contacted by forensic analysts who are interested in studying his research, but he says that at this point, he doesn't think there's anything to share â€” that his research has been debunked, that any value it had is now gone.
