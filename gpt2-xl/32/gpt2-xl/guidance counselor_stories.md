Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Mike McCready, a man with the self-assurance of a man trying to sell you something he's never tried, so that you'll sign up and buy it. It's this guy who's most relevant as you contemplate how you, personally, might respond to a suicide hotline.

He said, "Your greatest enemy is yourself," and reminded you that you need to treat your emotions and thoughts and life in general with as much dignity and understanding as possible.

This was the lesson I needed to relearn.

The best therapists are those who use humor as a tool and who are always asking "Why?" To see if my answer is anything more than "Why not?"

If you think someone is suicidal, listen, and not automatically pass judgment. If you just want to talk, we'll do that. If you really want to help, go after the problem, not take a side.

If you're suicidal, get help.

If you're suicidal, try different ways of coping.

If you're suicidal, tell me what's wrong. I'll listen, but you know who knows better? Your doctor.

If you're suicidal, talk about it. Write out your plans in words or a journal. Go to therapy. Whatever it takes.

If you're suicidal, get help.

And finally â€” if you're suicidal, get help.
