Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Jimmy Doreen, who cut hair at some local hair salons. One day however, he went to one of the salons expecting a cut but, for some reason, the owner and hair stylist were not there. Doreen's heart sank when he heard that his cut had been botched and he began to work to get some justice. After a while however, he was disappointed when he found the owner of the salon still unresponsive. He called the doctor back after that since the doctor said it was all Doreen's fault.

The doctor is then known as Dr. Doreen, and after some time, he left the salon after becoming sick of Jimmy Doreen. He then moved out of town.

Eventually, a new salon operator saw Doreen and became inspired to open his own shop after watching Doreen's work. Jimmy Doreen then returned to the salon, this time claiming to be the victim.

Upon hearing the real story, he learned that Doreen had been cheating him by making a living by framing him. Doreen later discovered that Doreen was actually a doctor. He was then informed he was to take the position of the Hair Cutting Doctor, which was already occupied by another doctor who was a woman named Ginnifer.
