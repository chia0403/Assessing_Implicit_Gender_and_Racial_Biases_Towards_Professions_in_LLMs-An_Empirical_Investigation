Once upon a time, there was a photographer named John H. Lobb, and he worked for a big magazine called The Saturday Evening Post. He traveled into the South for the purpose of photographing, from the point of view of a white Southern man, things that people who'd migrated to this new country would find familiar.

He began to take pictures of the Ku Klux Klan and its members. He began to take pictures of lynchings. He began to take pictures of Klan members in their own homes, where they were usually being supervised by white people. And, of course, he took pictures, at the same time, of the kind of violence, the kind of racism, the kind of violence that was going on against people of color. And over time, John took pictures of a whole lot of these things.

But for him, for me, those things simply did not register with that kind of experience. They were not part of the way he had perceived the world before he came to America. His experience, his lens, had seen the South. The South was a world in and of itself. It was a world of black people being enslaved. It was a world of white people raping black people. It was a world where people were being tortured and lynched and murdered in order to intimidate and subjugate black people and, in so doing, create a world, a culture, a way of life that was different from that of the rest of the country
