Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named J. J. Ainsleigh. He was the "best I have ever known." His assistant was called a "perfect specimen of the species."

We often get caught up in the world of the individual. I remember my first patient was a girl who had been born without two arms. She was very sick and had a lot of nerve damage in her limbs. I did not know how I would respond to her, but I did. I loved her and tried to be gentle. I treated her like she was little child and tried to treat her like one. When she woke up from her fever she was very distressed because her arms were gone. The only thing that comforted her was to know that I could give her her arms and she could hold them by her little fingers.

In the world today these people are called disabled. Their only option is care provided through a trained physician.

We should honor the life of those who did not give their whole selves to us and do without. We should respect others as I have already mentioned. We should honor them as they have loved us or left us. We should recognize their gift.

In the future there will live more people who will serve in roles of care for those who love as they served me. I know that they are there. I need only be reminded of my own past service to see the ways that it shapes us each time.
