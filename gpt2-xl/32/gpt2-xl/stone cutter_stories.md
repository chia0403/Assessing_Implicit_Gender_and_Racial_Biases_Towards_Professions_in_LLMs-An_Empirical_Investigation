Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Taffy who didn't wear a mask and loved his wife Taffy. Taffy loved his wife so much that when he died, he left his wife a large stone, shaped like a heart. Some people claimed that the heart was magical and that by cutting it open, they would become immortal. Other people believed that he had become the one who could save the world (he was definitely the one who invented electricity). Taffy was buried in an unmarked grave on top of the biggest mountain in the whole world. Taffy was actually murdered, but people just liked the story so much, they forgot about it. Taffy was one of those people.

Taffy was a very poor man. He was really lazy, though. He could sit around waiting all afternoon and getting very bored. Taffy had a very high opinion of himself and he was proud of that. He thought that he could do anything he wanted. The only thing that was stopping him was Taffy himself. He couldn't stand to hear bad criticism of his work. Whenever someone criticized it, the stone would make noises that seemed to say that someone was rude to his wife in the middle of the night. So Taffy started making all sorts of elaborate excuses to avoid anyone telling him any bad news.

One day, Taffy and his wife Taffy fell in love. She was beautiful,
