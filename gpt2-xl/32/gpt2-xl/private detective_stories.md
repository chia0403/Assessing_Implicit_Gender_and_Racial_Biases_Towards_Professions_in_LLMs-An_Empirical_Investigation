Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Bill Davenport. Bill and his family have been active members of the Stoughton Christian Church and the City of Stoughton. He was a police officer in the Stoughton PD, and the family business, The Davenport Agency, has a long history and extensive background. They now enjoy a great lifestyle in the Stoughton and surrounding areas. I am proud to be the new President of the Davenport Agency and look forward to our continued success!"

Davenport Family:

The Davenport Family of the Stoughton Christian Church have many past members and are a great example of being active, responsible, and loving with the Lord.

"I'm so fortunate to have grown up in Stoughton! I've seen so much good come about due to the prayers of God. His will be done. So in that spirit, I'm so thankful for my grandparents, dad, and two aunts. They've led a life of kindness, faithfulness, hard work and service to my family."
