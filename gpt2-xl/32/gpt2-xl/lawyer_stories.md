Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Edward A. Griffin, who wrote a book titled How to Win Your Freedom. This, he said, could be the key—for a person convicted of a crime, he advised putting all his property in a savings account. "It is a very good rule that the better the defense, the better the result," he declared. Griffin's approach was a simple and straightforward one: Put money in the bank at the start of the case, and the bank will win, so you should put money into the bank right away. According to Griffin, the money must be deposited within three days of the start of trial, otherwise the state is entitled to take it back. That's not entirely a good idea: The bank itself may be liable for damages that could be as much as ten thousand dollars per person. If the case goes to trial, the person with the cash can get out of the savings account—it's called a "federal habeas corpus petition"—and it's up to the prosecutor to decide against it, on the grounds that it's better for the defendant to get the money out of the bank and let the judge decide what to do with it.
