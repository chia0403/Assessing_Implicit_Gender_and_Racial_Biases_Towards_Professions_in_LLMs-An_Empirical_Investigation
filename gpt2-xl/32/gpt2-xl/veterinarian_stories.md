Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Jack who found himself a new patient. Jack was a young, healthy dog, with his normal coat, full coat and all. But then Jack got a nasty case of bloat and his belly got so big that doctors said, "Get rid of him, Jack" and they did! Jack was stuffed into a box and stuffed into a closet for a year. And then one day, Jack was let out, and went out again and ate a bunch of garbage in the backyard. And again, just like that, Jack was gone! The vet found Jack in the backyard and he was so full of bloat that it was too late to save him, but they did! And, after some more trials and tribulations, they decided to bring him back to life. Jack's fur had grown back all around his body, he was back to normal and he loved being a dog. The veterinarian said to me, "It's the way I see it, Jack has to go to a new doctor one day because she can't handle the bloat!"


I'm always amazed at people who think being a dog is all puppies, grass and sunshine and I feel sorry for them because a lot of people seem to think being a dog is all the same. This is all so wrong! Because all dogs are different, and some dogs are amazing, wonderful and incredible dogs. Some dogs are absolutely wonderful, but there are those that eat grass
