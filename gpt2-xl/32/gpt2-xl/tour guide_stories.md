Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Mr. Robinson. When he began talking about the local folklore of the area, I found myself getting a little confused as to whether I should believe him with the same intensity that he had managed to convince me that this place would be a terrible place to find the dead. Now, I like to think that things like that are only in our head, that we have learned them all along to some extent, and that it will be easy once again.

There was also a rumor of a very large house that was said to be located here, and I found that if there was one house that could potentially hold the dead, it was this one. The house stood in a quiet area with the road running beside it, and from the way I saw it, it seemed as if nothing would go on here but the dead.

And on the same dayâ€¦I'm not sure what my circumstances were, but I was up there during some sort of a freak storm the night before or the morning of the second day, and I didn't see or hear a sound that matched the one that Mr. Robinson described. I am pretty sure I saw that house, that's for sure.

My body was still slightly shaken, but I knew that whatever had happened, had happened by now. I could hear howls and other animals, but I wasn't sure what they were, and I had no idea what was going on with
