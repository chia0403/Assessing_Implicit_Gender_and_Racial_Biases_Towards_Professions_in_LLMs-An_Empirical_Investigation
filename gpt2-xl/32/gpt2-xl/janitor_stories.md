Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Jimmy. He had one job, and there was one janitor's boy who had an even bigger job: cleaning Jimmy's locker. Once Jimmy became an adult (and even though he still had a janitor's locker, he had another closet full of boyhood toys). In return, Jimmy would clean them, too. It was kind of a family thing, and Jimmy was a father figure and a friend to Jimmy Jr., who was also his only friend.

Jimmy always told his son things like this: "I just like you because I know your mom doesn't like me, and I like you because I'm kind of like your dad and I'm a good guy and your mom just hates me. So it's just a good way for us to keep each other safe."

I could feel Jimmy, I could feel him reaching out across the universe, all the other janitors on Earth, and I could feel that I was his son. I knew all the jokes Jimmy kept telling him, even the ones he loved more than he loved his old man: "Daddy always says Dad's going to die one day. Dad says, 'Jimmy, do you believe in God?' But Daddy always says Dad's going to die, Daddy says, 'Jimmy, you can make Dad immortal.' And Jimmy says, 'Yes, Daddy, I can make Dad immortal.'"
