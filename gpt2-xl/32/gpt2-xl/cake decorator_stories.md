Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Alice. She went to make a red velvet cake for Mother's day. When she found out it was pink, she realized she should make it a rose. So she put on roses, and then added a little candy cane in the middle. However, after Mother's day day she didn't get the roses and ended up with a plain, boring cake. Then she noticed the pink color and remembered the red velvet! Alice made a pink cake for Mother's day, and it looked so pretty she bought a couple more pans and it just kept getting better and better! Alice went to school one day and she heard the story again! "Oh, you can make the color red and your cake will look great!" she thought to herself!" Why not?" So that is how pink cake is made, with roses and candies! So you can also make a red velvet cake, just use some candies for those pesky colors!
