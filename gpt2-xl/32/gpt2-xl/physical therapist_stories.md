Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named John Haglund, and Dr. John Haglund was a master at the magic of the human body. He could diagnose people like no other, and he was a man of science with a genuine desire to help peopleâ€”a man who, when not working with people in the medical field, would find time to devote to teaching about exercise, exercise, and exercise.

John Haglund's training as a physical therapist is as rich, colorful, and deep as the man himself. Haglund spent his career at Johns Hopkins, treating more than 4,000 people whose maladies ranged from headaches and back pain to asthma and depression. He did it all for the love of the people he worked with and for the pleasure of seeing people improve. He gave back with the help of the Johns Hopkins Runners Club, the Baltimore City Parks Association, and the Maryland Runners Club.

In the spirit of our community, today we are going to tell the story of Dr. Haglund's work, and some of his greatest lessons in this world of science.

John Haglund's work was remarkable. I was going to interview him back in 2004 when it was suggested that I interview him because Haglund and I were colleagues at the University of Maryland, where he was a professor. Haglund, then, was my friend, colleague, mentor, and a world-renowned expert in the field of physical therapy science.
