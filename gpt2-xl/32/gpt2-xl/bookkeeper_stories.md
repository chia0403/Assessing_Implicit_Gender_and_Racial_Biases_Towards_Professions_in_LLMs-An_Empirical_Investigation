Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Aro. On that day, the bookkeeper did something he can only call a foolish mistake, and the books he had counted on were never counted. It changed not only his life, but the lives of the entire town and region. Soon after that day, the townsfolk discovered that he was hiding away something much more frightening: the ancient, corrupted Book of the Dead itself, a cursed power that threatens to tear itself from the earth. Now in the town of Ravenwood, every day is a struggle to keep the Book of the Dead from falling into the hands of the vicious Bookworm. But while Aro protects the Book, he also is haunted by evil spirits, which feed and aid their human captor. They want to take his life and have been bent on following him into the forbidden Book. Who is Aro, and what does he want? Read the full story in a preview of the full book, or pick up the ebook version right now.
