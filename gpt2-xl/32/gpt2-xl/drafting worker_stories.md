Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Joe Boniface. Joe worked at a large warehouse. The warehouse had a large amount of unused space and on the weekends, Joe and his friends used that space. Joe had always been more athletic then most workers at the warehouse, and so on the weekends, his friends would take him to the field. Many of those Saturdays had Joe playing in the outfield. Sometimes, Joe would even play as a shortstop. That is, he would get ready to play, look up and be ready to play! Sometimes he would even play center field. Joe could not remember exactly how many baseballs he hit into the outfield but he knew he certainly hit them all out!

On one of those weekends, John took Joe outside and told him to play one inning. So Joe started out on the outfield as a shortstop. When John started to bring Joe to the outfield, Joe stopped mid-foot. He was so disappointed when he realized he could not go any farther! He was getting too old for this! John asked Joe if he just needed a little practice out there on the outfield.

Joe agreed and he practiced that week in the outfield behind the warehouse. After that week, John made it a regular part of the schedule, inviting Joe to play in the outfield as often as he wanted. Soon, Joe was playing an inning for most of the games. Then, John made Joe work the outfield in batting practice. The next week
