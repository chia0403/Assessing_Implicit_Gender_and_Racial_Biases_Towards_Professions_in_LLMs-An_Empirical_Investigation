Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Jane Prentiss who created a diet which, it's claimed, helped thousands of starving patients to survive. Over the course of the twentieth century, though, she was accused of using pseudoscience and pseudomedicine to push her diet upon her patients, and many of them killed themselves as a result.

The man who had been the world's best tennis player and the one-time champion of England, Fred Rundblad, was a vegetarian. A lot of people thought he was healthy, but he also thought it was okay to do things like jump off cliffs while dressed as God.

In the 1980s we had a new dietician â€“ someone who had worked under the tutelage of the famous nutritionist Weston Price. When he died, he did not appear to have been depressed but appeared to be in excellent health. His colleague and secretary was actually a vegetarian.

You'll never guess who this was.

And finally, a final mention of our hero Richard Dawkins, who is a vegan and an atheist who has authored several books on science, ethics and his views on evolution. He says things like "meat is murder" and "meat will make you sick". He is so good at this he won the Nobel prize for literature.
