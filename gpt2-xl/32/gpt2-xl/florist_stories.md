Once upon a time, there was a florist named Bob. He worked in his store, delivering flowers to their customers in a little pink box, with a sign reading, "All Flowers are Created Equal." He was a wonderful man, and so was his wife, Gloria. A few weeks into the year, however, Bob's business suffered. Not one customer ordered flowers from him. He grew distressed and worried. In desperation, he called Gloria, but, strangely, she heard nothing. Finally, she finally said to herself, I know it's Bob's florist, but what has she done to me? I was a very good customer, and Gloria had never been more satisfied.

Gloria called the store, and the salesman answered his phone. He was a beautiful woman in her mid-twenties. She asked for Bob's help in her flower business. Gloria said to him, "Bob is not in his store, and his wife is not in her bed." The salesman didn't seem reassured by her tone and asked, "What are the odds?" Gloria answered, "Three to one, if that's all you know."

The salesman became distraught and finally said, "Well, if you are so very nice to me, how can I help?" Gloria took his heartbroken expression and said, "It's not like that, dear. I am here for you." Gloria walked out of the shop and took herself to the doctor.
