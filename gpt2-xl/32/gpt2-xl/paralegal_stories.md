Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Linda Rondini, who, like many of her peers, spent her days at her desk, typing away for the United States Marshals Service, where she was assigned to work under the name Linda Sue Rondini. Rondini was part of the "Special Administrative Task Force" in North Carolina, and was assigned to work in Washington, D.C., where she would help to build and oversee the government's case against four young men accused of planning to carry out the 1995 attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people. One of the men, Omar Abdel-Rahman, helped set up the attack. He was convicted and is presently serving a life sentence.

It was a thankless and often frustrating process, involving lots of hand-holding from the federal agents assigned to help her and in which she'd be subjected to insults and verbal assaults on a frequent basis. One agent once said to her bluntly and angrily, "You can't understand the nature of the investigation to which you are assigned." Another said, "You come in here with nothing but an empty résumé. That is what you are." At least a half-dozen times, Rondini told me, she was the subject of crude sexual comments
