Once upon a time, there was a cook named Mike. He was a bit off, a bit rude and didn't do much of a job with the food he served. Eventually, some good things happened and soon a team in the kitchen named Chef. He was the same, no real talent or anything, just a jolly guy who was always happy to serve people lunch. He also never did any housework. The only thing I could compare to this guy is to a cat. At one point he was so proud of himself that he made it clear that he wanted to help the entire kitchen cook staff to be famous cooks of renown. He then proceeded to say, "Well everyone, I hope you know what a jerk this is! This is not the way to do it. And to be honest, I don't really get what this cook is doing! So, come work here and have fun, we'll make great food together," and the crew of the kitchen looked around in utter confusion. The cat had just destroyed the kitchen staff to the point where he had no one left in control. Chef had been the only one to make it in this mess, and he now wished he said something different.

I am in love with the food and the people. The dishes I make are always the simplest, the most simple. The food is not fancy but it is delicious and the people are always genuinely nice.
