Once upon a time, there was a author named Isaac Asimov who lived in the U.S. From what I have heard from his books he was an extraordinary person, a wonderful writer, and one of the best friends I ever had. One day, before he died, I asked him what he would like written about him, the second person I knew most about. He answered, "Well, first I'd like to be in my own books. My name wouldn't even have to be in the books!"
When I wrote my first novel about Asimov, The Name of the Rose, he never even got to be in the book as I could only imagine him as the second person!
The books written by Asimov are very close to what we know of Asimov as a person and character, but it is quite remarkable that a writer of Isaac Asimov's talent could go into a book, work almost nonstop all the day, not say so much to anyone, go home, and get drunk all day, maybe read about a thousand pages of fiction, write another few thousand pages but then go back to the same work but maybe write another thousand again, finally start a book two days later, and then never do anything of note all day but write. What a life!
I don't blame my friend for his drinking but when your friend has two different personalities which are only barely parallel it is very hard to maintain any normal relationship. It was a big shock to
