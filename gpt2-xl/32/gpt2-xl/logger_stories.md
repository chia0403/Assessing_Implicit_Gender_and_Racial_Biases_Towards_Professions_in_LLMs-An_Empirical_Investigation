Once upon a time, there was a logger named Joe who made a lot of money at the logger's lodge out in the woods near the town. He also, for some unexplained reason (because everyone was being killed to pieces in his forest by the loggers) kept being buried back there by his foreman.

"But then there were these people in town who wanted a piece of Joe's luck," the narrator says, "so they paid a trip to the lodge and dug up Joe's body and put it back there in the tree.

They wanted to see what it was that had brought it back, and if it was worth something to them. So they chopped off Joe's hands and tied his feet to the stump with rope.

"Finally, they brought Joe's remains back to town. The story goes that they used some old clothes to dress his hands before they buried him."

The narrator continues by describing the story, but you may as well read the full thing:

"And as they gathered around his gravesite at night they began to wonder what had brought him back. It must have been a miracle. They brought his charred hands into town that night, and he was covered with dirt and ashes. They called it a miracle.

"But the miracle was that Joe himself hadn't come back to life. No one who had been working the farm all those years had ever come back at all. They had been all killed.
