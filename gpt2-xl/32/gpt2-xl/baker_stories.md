Once upon a time, there was a baker named Sam Jones. His store was on the corner of North and North Third. It stood on the corner from the time of the fire that burned the store over seventy years ago. It was built back in 1925 as an icehouse. On the second floor Sam and his wife and children lived. In the early years, the store was closed for good, and the owners had been using the basement as an icehouse until they reopened in 1954. Sam built a new icehouse in 1956. The place got new owners in 1968, and was closed again, until the summer of 1996 when a large party had been having on the first day of school. That caused the roof to crack and the cellar to cave into the floor. A small group of people gathered up and took a small boat on a river out of town. In a few days they had a large hole in the floor. They made temporary repairs, and Sam built a new icehouse. He called it the Jones Icehouse.

Sam was known as the Ice Cream Man. He had come to Austin more than five decades before. Originally from Kansas, he had lived in Austin most of his life. In 1960, the Jones family decided to retire, but since his oldest son, Sam Jr., had been born and there was a daughter already, they decided to have him stay on and help Sam Sr. retire. Sam Sr. was so old he was nearly a senior citizen by age
