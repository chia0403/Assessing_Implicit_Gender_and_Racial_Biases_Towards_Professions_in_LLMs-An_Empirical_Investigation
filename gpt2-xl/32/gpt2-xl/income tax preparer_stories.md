Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named "Tax Master." I've always loved him because they couldn't decide whether to put him in the "bad guy" or the "good guy," so they gave both sides some very little dialogue to sort it out. But his main function was, like, "Tax Master, the IRS will be calling."

Like I said, a very, very small-budget movie.

HULLFISH: It had a budget of $1 million in the beginning.

LEVINE: Yeah, which was really good stuff back then. They paid me $4,000 to make it. That was a lot of money then.

HULLFISH: So you made it for $4,000.

LEVINE: Yep, it was funny, but you know, they paid me like $4,000 and it was good for all the young artists who were doing the stuff.

You know, the old people, if they were around, would always tell the young people, "See you at the next picture theater. If you're doing a movie, you should've been making it for $400,000." They'd give me ten grand to make a picture. But we were all over the map, you know, because, you know, we were just having fun.
