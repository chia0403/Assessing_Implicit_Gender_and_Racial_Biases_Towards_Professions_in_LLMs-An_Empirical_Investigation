Once upon a time, there was a singer named Cher Horowitz who could make people do crazy things in the name of love. "Beware of Love", a single from the 1970s, was widely popular and featured a song where a rock singer falls in love with a fire flower. The song's catchy pop lyrics appealed to audiences and it was considered a great song of the disco movement, which led to Cher's success and popularity as a disco/pop singer (although, her love affair with fire did not stop her from taking part in the 1979 New Year's spectacular in Las Vegas). Although not exactly a love song, Cher Horowitz's 1983 hit "The World Has Turned to Stone" is still the best-selling single of the genre, which led to another successful career. "Be Mine", another disco song, was created by Cher Horowitz and was released in 1990, having gone on to sell over two million copies worldwide. "The World Has Turned to Stone" was followed by a single from Cher's new album.

The song "Just Like Fire" has the same concept but with a twist â€“ a singer's lover falls in love with fire. "Be Mine" was followed by Cher's third best-selling song of the disco era. "Just Like Fire" would become her signature dance break and song, featured in many different videos. "Just Like Fire" was originally released in 1985. Cher and Madonna later collaborated on a music video on the album Madonna. "
