Ramirez hadn't taken a medical exam and her body was so badly decomposed that she couldn't be positively identified.

The woman, who was reportedly well-known and loved by many in the area, had killed herself at her home in Orange County.

The shocking discovery came to light after the Orange County Coroner's Office received a report of a body found and notified the Sheriff's Department. According to an Orange County Sheriff's spokeswoman, it took a "very good" coroner to determine she was Ramirez's.

During Ramirez's private burial, a detective from the Sheriff's Department attended. Ramirez was wearing the same clothes she had on when she was found. According to sheriff's department detectives, there were no signs of injuries. Their report, however, has been heavily redacted by the Sheriff's Department.
