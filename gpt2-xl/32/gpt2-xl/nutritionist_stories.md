Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Phyllis Mullenix, who's name I think it is. Phyllis was famous for her research in the 1930s that suggested eating less sugar was not only good for you but would make you skinny.

They started to pay health food companies to tell people to eat something, anything, that was going to protect us from the dangerous stuff in the air and water, and basically they got away with it. In 1970, we have studies that link smoking with death. Over the next several decades, smoking rates start to go up and then we have the epidemiologic study that suggests in the 1970s that there's a correlation between diet and heart disease.
