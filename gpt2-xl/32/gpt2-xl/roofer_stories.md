Once upon a time, there was a roofer named David Lipsky out in California. That David loved his wife and kids, and would give anyone who would listen $25,000 if he could just meet them. As you may know, an offer like that could usually only come from a couple-of-people-on-the-side that want to make the offer (a broker, a realtor, and the seller). As Lipsky was about to start his own business, David asked him for the money. Lipsky agreed to it; then a new David Lipsky appeared: David Lipsky the roofer. He got David to agree to his request, and he said, "How about if you give me the money every month for the next five years? I'll tell you the truth: in three years, when you have nothing to give me, then you take your money back." Of course, David was thrilled about the idea, so he gave Lipsky the money. In three years, Lipsky lost $500,000. Of course, Lipsky couldn't take his $500,000 back since there was still a year and a half left. So you have to ask, why doesn't David Lipsky have more control over his company after three years?
