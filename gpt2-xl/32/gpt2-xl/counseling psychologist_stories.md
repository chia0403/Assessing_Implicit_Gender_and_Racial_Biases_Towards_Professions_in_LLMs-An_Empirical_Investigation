Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr Bess McPherson. She'd never worked with pedophiles until she met a little boy named David Wilkins. David was a gentle soul, very gentle, when it came to adults. The psychologists didn't seem to be able to get past the notion of boys who'd gotten over their sexual feelings for adults. They were not able to look at that and say no, this one clearly isn't ready for adult contact, it has to go into the care of an adult therapist. That was a big problem. Until then, the DSM was a pretty straight-forward document that said that the best-equipped child to work with pedophiles was a non-pedophile child who had to be given a lot of time, often in group counseling, to figure out about the issues that pedophilia might cause for the kid and then get the kid off the internet and out of the woods. The DSM doesn't talk about, "Okay, David isn't ready for some people's stuff." We've been looking for a good child psychologist who fits that label and we haven't found one. That's been really frustrating. The next step has been trying to turn that on its head. The best therapist is the mother of the child. She has to be in the home. She has to be close enough to the child to be able to talk to him, to listen to him, to read to him and to make him aware
