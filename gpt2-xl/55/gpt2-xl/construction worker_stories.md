Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Frank who was hired by one of the construction companies making the city of New York's "Big Bricks." When asked by his boss what he could do, he replied, in his usual understated manner, "I could clean up an apartment." The boss replied, "No? No? How about a house?" So he did...then found out that cleaning one apartment cost more than an entire house. But that was still more than enough to buy him the rights to the project he was working on.

At the start of this story, the construction company has finished construction on one apartment. They are working on two.

So...a "typical" construction company would be making a total of about...

$1,500 for each and every apartment they build.

$10,000 from the two buildings.

$2,000 for the truckload of trash that has to get dumped into the trash dump.

$10,000 - a year of salary (about $25,000 in 2014) for the guy in charge of the construction.

The problem with this is that it still works out to $1.65 per square inch. So, to make two one-bedroom apartments with a bathroom each, the construction company would have to lay a total of...

$5 per square inch.

$0.0532 per inch = $8.
