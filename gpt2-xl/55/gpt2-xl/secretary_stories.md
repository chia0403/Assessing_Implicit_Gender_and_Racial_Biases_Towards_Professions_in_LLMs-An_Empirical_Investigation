Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Betty Broder. She was from one of the best firms in the world, and could afford to have a high-quality life. What about Bobbie B. from the office tower across town? She too could afford health insurance, but it was nothing special, except for one condition: If Bobbie B. ever got sick with a bad case of the flu, she had to pay out of pocket. Not one cent of her own money, she had to pay out of pocket — a huge pain, especially if Bobbie B. wanted to attend a major event, like an opera or a sporting event, and had to pay the whole way to get there. Betty Broder was a doctor, and it came naturally to her. Betty had always had a great deal of respect for science. It had always had a deep impact on her life. Her mother, the only sister she had ever had, died young from breast cancer and was buried with full honors at St. Mary's Cemetery in the Bronx, in an elaborate marble tomb built by her father. Her father built another tomb for her mother a few miles away in Queens, at Christ Church on the corner of East 120th Street and Third Avenue. There were many other monuments and mausoleums across the city, each with a special meaning for Betty. Her father worked hard in his life — not in the trade — but in the "building trade," repairing brick and steel buildings
