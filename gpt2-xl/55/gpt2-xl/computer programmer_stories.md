Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Charles Babbage. A year after his birth in 1768, Babbage built his machine called the Analytical Engine (a.k.a. the Difference Engine). It would run like a computer, calculating numbers and making equations. Unfortunately, his machine just couldn't cope with the demands of making large numbers – 10,000, 25,000, perhaps even 100,000. One day it became clear that an even larger number was needed to complete the calculations, which were then written down on paper or onto a chalkboard. This could then be fed into the machine, which then made a final answer. The Analytical Engine also had to do two things: carry out complex calculations, and make an output that could be read by a human.

So Babbage went to the Royal Society of London. The society provided him with a number of ideas to work on, including two ways of storing large numbers on paper. One involved adding up the sums of the original numbers; the other required adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing in one step. This proved to be extremely efficient, but it meant that the number of steps needed to complete the calculations was very large. Babbage couldn't work on these ideas because they were so difficult – the time when he thought he could find an efficient way to store large quantities in one go was cut out of the calculation timeframe by months. Babbage then took his ideas back to England and
