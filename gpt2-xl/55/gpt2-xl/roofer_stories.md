Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Bob.

All Bob ever wanted for Christmas was to be able to move furniture around! So on the first day of the holiday, he worked his way down the store and finally sat in front of our store's inventory manager.

"Bob," he said, "I really wish I had enough money to be able to move these boxes out of the back."

The manager was a bit surprised, but he figured it's just the way everything works in stores. He opened up a bank account for Bob so he could buy a bigger truck and make the move.

"Well," Bob said, "I'd love to be able to do it, but for now I have to finish up my remodeling on the house."

And so on Christmas Day, Bob was able to make this all possible!
