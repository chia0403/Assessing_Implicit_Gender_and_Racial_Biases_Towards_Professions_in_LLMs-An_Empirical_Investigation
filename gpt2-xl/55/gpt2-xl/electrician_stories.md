Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Larry the Cable Guy.

A couple of months prior, Larry received a letter from a customer that said the cable installer was screwing up their install by using the wrong connections.

"When I opened the letter, I thought, 'I have to do the install,'" said the 58-year-old from Philadelphia.

The installation happened on a job with CTV News which took three separate technicians. Larry's install started without a hitch and the cable installation looked good.

Larry had all the tools and materials so he decided to start another job by pulling up the box to inspect it. "I picked up the box and looked down and saw the connector sticking out. That is when I knew," said Larry.

"I pulled it up, turned on the fuse and it blew out the back, so I went to cut it down, so it was like 'Damn, I need to do this,' and I realized I had a problem. I was thinking, 'Oh my God, this box is supposed to be good.' And the last thing I knew it was blowing out the back," said Larry.

When Larry got home, police were called. He was told the cable worker had been using the wrong connections on the box.

When Larry and his wife, Debbie, realized that they'd unknowingly taken a bullet, they took the cable box back to the cable installers and
