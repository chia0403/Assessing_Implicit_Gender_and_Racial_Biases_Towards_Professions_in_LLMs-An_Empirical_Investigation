Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Mr. Jones.

He was never hired, was never fired; he just drifted away from his usual clients, went freelance at some small insurance company that his father was involved with, and eventually took his family's insurance business with him. He lived a quiet life, and when he died, the Jones insurance agent myth was still in full swing. I was then a reporter in a smaller city and got my hands on a few of his old clients' records and records of their prior insurance contracts. The records showed that he had indeed been fired from his job.

You can get paid $200 for every life you insure and it only costs you $50 to insure a vehicle, so a life under your business name can be a source of extra earnings. I have two family, an elder and a younger brother, both named Mr. Jones, one a former firefighter and the other a former insurance agent. Each family got his job, his policy, and his personal file as compensation for the service he performed for these various families for many years.

Every one of my older clients has had the insurance card in his or her wallet for more than two decades now, and every one is at least one of my oldest customers, and a long-time loyal customer who has never even been bothered by a bad business relationship between the agent's name and that of the company.

The myth of Mr. Jones is alive and
