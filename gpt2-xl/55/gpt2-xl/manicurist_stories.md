Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Marnie and her son, Josh.

They'd decided to get married because they wanted to have a family. Josh had just been introduced to a new job at home and Marnie felt she needed to prepare for the arrival of their first child.

So her husband got her a book on how to start a family.

"My husband and I read the book and sat down to write a letter to the world saying, 'This is our wedding,'" Marnie said. "That was pretty much our first day of marriage."

A love story, from the beginning

The letter was addressed to "all the world" and said: "We need to be parents so that we may better share our lives with a world without us."
