Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Michael Smith. One day, he called me up and said: "Michael, do you know the person who wants to buy your building?" I said no. So he said: "Oh no, I just don't want to do business with a 'Blessed One.'" It would have been just too hard for him to know. And I said: "Good. You're out of the store, out of the business." But then five or six years went by, and then he called me back and said [he's] looking to buy a building. When I told him about you, he said: "Well, there's nobody out on that corner selling houses." So you see, I just made up these stories. One of them is right! I was never going to take the position that I had. I'd call home every night and ask my wife: "Why do you look at the Bible so much?" So she'd say, "Mama, you might be the only person I call in a week and talk to." I would think that was pretty funny. It was never going to be something like this. Well, now you've got a lot of them.

The real estate market is the most important thing today in God's life. All we do—all he does—is talk to people, go home with them about life, and look after them. That was never my problem
