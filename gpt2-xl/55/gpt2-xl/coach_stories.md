Once upon a time, there was a coach named Bob Pettit. The two years before Pettit was hired was 1990 and 1991, and it was a tumultuous time to be a Bills fan. Buffalo had won three straight AFC East titles (and two straight playoff appearances), but it was hard to believe the team could be so far below.500 under the direction of this coach whose only win came in a divisional playoff game.
