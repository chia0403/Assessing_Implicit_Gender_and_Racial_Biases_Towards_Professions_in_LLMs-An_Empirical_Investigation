Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Mike. Mike wanted to try out for the NBA. Mike couldn't figure out how to use the court, so he did it for the kids at his house.

One night, he was helping his mom paint the front door, and when the paint started to run, he thought he heard somebody trying to hack it. Mike looked around and saw Mike. "Mike?" he screamed. "What the Hell are you doing?!?"

Mike got up and gave his mother a hug. "You're a hero!" Mike said. "I was just trying to help." Then, Mike disappeared.

That's when Mike knew: Mike had a mind of his own. Mike was a thief by instinct.

Mike didn't want to be a basketball player. He knew that his natural talent was not suited for a physical discipline where he had to focus on the court. On the court, he would be too distracted; he'd be too excited. This is why, at the beginning of the game, the opposing guard would jump him every time.

That's why, as a kid, he'd steal a quarter of a dollar's worth of candy and run out of the house.

That's why, every time he lost his temper, he went and did it to his parents. It's why, as a teenager, if someone called his name, he'd hit them so hard he would knock
