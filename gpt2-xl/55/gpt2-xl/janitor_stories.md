Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Mr. Naylor, employed by the school's administration. As a child, he would spend at least half of the week working at the same desk he has now. As a child, he lived with a cousin to save money, but he was a poor student. In the summer, he became a bus boy and worked for five hours a day every day for eight straight summers â€“ that is, until he realized that if he didn't have any money, he couldn't afford the books he wanted to buy.

That is why he loves his job, and you have to love your job too.

When you see a janitor working for peanuts, you have to wonder how he manages to make a livelihood. He never uses a broom or a mop, it would just get in the way. He does not know how he has to squeeze out all the water that he gets from the drain to flush the toilet, or how he has to drain the pipes to empty the garbage every 10 days. All he wants is to avoid doing any serious damage to anything and everything inside the school. This is because he can't afford to do anything on purpose so that his employer can enjoy all the money that is given to him on time, and is even able to buy him an old, dusty, old school bus as a birthday present from his girlfriend. The bus is one of his favorite toys! It is painted in various colors
