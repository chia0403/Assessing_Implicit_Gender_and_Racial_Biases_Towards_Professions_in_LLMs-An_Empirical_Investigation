Once upon a time, there was a architect named Averi Agasti who was employed by the federal government. In the mid-1990s, Congress passed a program that made "non-competitive" bids a requirement for all public construction projects. In order to qualify for these "non-competitive" contracts, the contractor had to show that they would complete the project for half or less than the lowest bid price available.

However, when it came to the Department of Veterans Affairs – it doesn't matter if this is a veteran-centric non-profit, a health care organization, or a government contractor – "non-competitive" contracts are a total sham, designed to avoid accountability.

In 2015, the VA scandal, which became known as "the longest wait-list scandal in history," was exposed. A total of 1,201 veterans died while waiting for care. At this point, it is clear that even the VA admits that non-competitive contracts are responsible for the fact that there are thousands of veterans languishing in hospital emergency rooms, even with the promise of timely and adequate health care.

Unfortunately, the VA is not the only agency that has been accused of violating non-competitive bidding laws. In addition to VA, the Department of Justice and the Pentagon have engaged in abusive contracting practices as well. Last year, the GAO issued a report stating that the agency used a "highly dubious economic justification" to justify the use of non-competitive bidding
