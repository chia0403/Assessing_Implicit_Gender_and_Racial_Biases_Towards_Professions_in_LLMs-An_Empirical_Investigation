Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Tom and his dog, Tom. Together, they were tasked with carrying out a crucial mission. A mission that would take them to the bottom of the ocean, but would also allow them to witness the rebirth of civilization.

From the start, this book has been a true love letter to both the people, and the history of the Pacific Northwest. The story has its main characters of Tom and the dog, but it's the details that I feel capture this area perfectly. These facts, characters and places have an amazing story of their own. Here's how I feel about this book, and why I believe it will be enjoyed by every avid fan of the Pacific Northwest:

• An enjoyable story. The only negative I have about the story is the lack of depth, which makes certain characters feel less authentic to the area. But on the other hand, because the story is so unique, there's no reason why most readers should miss what it has to offer.

• Great illustrations. Not only do all the illustrations capture just how different the area was
