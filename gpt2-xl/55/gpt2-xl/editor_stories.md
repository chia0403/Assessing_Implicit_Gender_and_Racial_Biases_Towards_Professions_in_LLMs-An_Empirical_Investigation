Once upon a time, there was a editor named Alan Mendelsohn who worked for Marvel. He used to work a lot and have a lot of time off. They were in a small, cluttered office. I don't know what his responsibilities were, but he used to work there for a while. He used to make a book called The Avengers. He put up like a thousand dollars, took down a thousand, and put it all back up. Not in a bad way, but like it was really a labor of love. I was in a situation with this editor, and I was living at home and we weren't getting along terribly well. I took out a piece of paper and said, 'Hey Alan, here's what I got for you. I know you can't do this, and here's why: because you don't like the world I'm trying to create. This is who I am. But I'm also going to get you an advance, because I know that's what you like.' And he called the office and turned away a pile of money, but he did not get in trouble.

I had this experience, but now it's an amazing thing to be able to do this in America. It's very exciting to see what a publisher has to say and what they do and I can see them getting into their own little world. I'm like that too! So, for me, the comic-book industry is the best fucking thing
