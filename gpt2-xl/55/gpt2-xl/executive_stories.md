Once upon a time, there was a executive named Bob. Bob was well-liked and liked his job. Then he had a very bad incident.

Bob: For the last year, I've done all my daily accounting for this company and all my research that goes into it and I just got a bad feeling.

Narrator: Bob worked on a daily basis with his boss, Ralph. As an accountant for the company, Bob was responsible for all the data in the company's account. It was his job to make sure that each and every number in the books was as accurate as it could possibly be. And it was Ralph's job to check in every now and then to make sure that Bob's numbers were correct as well.

Robert: I'm not happy anymore than I was five years ago. I've worked for Ralph for 25 years. I've never had a problem before right now.

Ralph: Bob, you're not happy? I'm not happy either, by the way. I haven't had one single problem with you.

Robert: He did complain about the company, and things like that. I remember, he was being a bit... he was not happy with what they were doing in the advertising department. I didn't know what he was talking about.

Ralph: What do you mean?

Robert: Well... well things like that.

Ralph: Bob! You're not happy
