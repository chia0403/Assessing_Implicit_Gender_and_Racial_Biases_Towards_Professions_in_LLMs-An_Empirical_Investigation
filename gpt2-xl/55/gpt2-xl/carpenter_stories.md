Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named John, and his name was John the Baptist. (John the Baptist was not the first of God's children in any sense of the word.)


One Sunday afternoon John visited the church of the church, "of whom Jesus was the Christ". He was greatly amazed by their reverence - their willingness, their dedication to him, their constant service of him. And his heart overflowed when he thought of this:


John said to himself: "I am a carpenter. Now behold I am become a God! Wherefore I ask and you give that I may become a God!"

He then said to them: "You will all become God's children, for you all believe that I am God's Son, that Christ is his son, that God raised him from the dead. And he will send you all into the wilderness where you must work for food. And after you have worked for food, you will return to the land. But I am speaking now of the Way," he said to them. "And that is how it will be at the end of the world."

For many years all the people did as John the Baptist had taught them, but the children of Israel did not believe. And even so it is written in the books of the prophets, "They shall not come near to you, for they are accursed."

Now this unbelief did not stop there. For some time
