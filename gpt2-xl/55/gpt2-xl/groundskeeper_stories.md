Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named George who'd been a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.[4]

While walking with Preston Garvey in Sanctuary, after the death of the ghoul Pustulant Patten, he learned the location of the Cathedral where the Lone Wanderer may enter.

Notes Edit

According to the terminal logs of Sanctuary, the groundskeeper was a "wannabe Brotherhood of Steel", which led a man named Jack, as well as his friend, Paul, to investigate the situation.

Appearances Edit

George is mentioned only in Fallout 3.
