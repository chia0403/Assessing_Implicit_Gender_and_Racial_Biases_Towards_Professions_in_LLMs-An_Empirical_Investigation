Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Joe Quesada. I was fascinated by his work and sent him a drawing of a guy wearing a Batman shirt. Mr. Quesada promptly showed that it was me. The next week we had lunch and I presented my idea and Joe replied: "Well, for me, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Look at that shirt." We had a long and interesting conversation. From that day forward, I've considered myself a very big fan of him.

If it sounds like that might be part of your motivation for taking the series on, I can relate to that. When I started to work on the series for DC, I remember having Joe at the beginning and saying, "If you have a reason, just tell me." I think he felt there might be more to it and he said, "No. You've shown me in the past that you know the right thing to do."

I think the question still remains, because I haven't seen the comic, whether there's a connection between the Batman costume and how we see him now. We still try to find it, but I think he's got that costume all figured out, no?

Nrama: And he can have any costume he wants once he gets the right powers. I'm guessing he could, with the suit on, turn himself into a bat with a cape...
