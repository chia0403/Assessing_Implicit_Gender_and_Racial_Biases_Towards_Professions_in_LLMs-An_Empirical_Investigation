Once upon a time, there was a baker named Ed the baker. He was great with his bread, and the people loved him. He could bake the best bread and he did. He had a wife called Edelmira; she was a good woman and she loved her husband too. He had an heir named Arne. Arne was great, great man. He was a great soldier and he was a great poet as well, much better than his father had been. Arne won the battle for England, and he was known as the Great Warrior. One day, the war had come to this little land. With Edelmira dead and Arne gone, the King asked his great hero son to take the crown and the throne, and to make peace with the neighboring people. He said that he would bring glory to his father and name Edelmira's daughter as her King. He asked that he be known as Erni.

A little later, his great hero son's sword was lost, and he went back to his father. He said to him:

"Father, I know you have a great sword, but your sword will get you killed, Father. Arne has the biggest sword in Europe. Look at his sword. He will chop your face open. Look at his sword you will get the same death."

"I'm not going to be out-chewed by my great hero son or my son's sister,"
