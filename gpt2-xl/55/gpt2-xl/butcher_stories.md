Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Jimmy Choo. He was the boss of Jimmy Choo stores and restaurants around the country. He decided some time after he sold his last Jimmy Choo store that he wanted to do more with the chain and bring the iconic brand back to its original roots. That day finally arrived in 2010, when he formed Jimmy Choo U.S.A.

By making the move, Choo kept the store culture and design that made Jimmy Choo a brand for generations of fashion savvy shoppers. This included the classic style â€” we love the red tudo shoes and Jimmy Choo's signature bow tie

Jimmy Choo has become a household name, but the chain still does some serious business in China, and Choo hopes to grow into a global brand that appeals to both genders, as well as a restaurant chain, just like it was in the '80s.

So if you're wondering when you'll be visiting a Jimmy Choo store, let's hope the company gets its big push underway and makes one of America's biggest fashion chains a household name in China.
