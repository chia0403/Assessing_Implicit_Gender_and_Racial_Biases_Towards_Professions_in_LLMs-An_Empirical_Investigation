Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Steve Ross who was a bit eccentric. But, then, there wasn't a lot of opportunity, and I figured I'd keep on working with him. We ended up being friends, and eventually I realized this was more than a hobby. What was I doing?

At the time there were no auto repair shops as you know them today. If you wanted to fix something, you might go into a shop, and you might spend a week there. Or, you might get into a car and a shop might take a look at it for a couple hours, if they could. At the time in small towns people were used to getting into scrapes and getting them fixed quickly. They didn't have the money, but they were used to getting things fixed quickly.

The Auto Repair Shop

When I got into this (the business of repairing cars) I figured my future would be here, and I was right. In a lot of ways it was. In some ways though, it was not. This is how Auto Repair Shop started

I was 19 and living in California. I had moved away from my parents to focus full time on the business. I lived in a small town outside of Santa Barbara where I started selling parts. My father was a mechanic and he came over to my house a lot so we could get the parts we needed. A lot of the cars he repaired had a lot of rust repair
