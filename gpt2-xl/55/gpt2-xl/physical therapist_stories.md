Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. James Davenport. He used to walk down the halls, taking patients to the bedside, just like the doctor in House, except that this guy actually knew what to do with people. He knew what it was like to have a person in a room who seemed to know what to do, who could tell you what you needed to do and what not to do.

Now, we can't wait for Davenport to come back to our lives. We can't wait for Dr. House to come back to make us feel even less in control of our lives. Dr. House is one of us. Dr. Davenport is not. So for the time being, we will suffer. But if we're lucky, we may just come out on the other side with something like the power of empathy.
