Once upon a time, there was a writer named John Lennon. He was in Paris doing his recording work, because he had this great idea. He looked at the clock and thought, "Well, I'm going to the studio in less than twelve hours. If I go late, time might be up." So he called his sister Yoko, and she said, "I want to come with you." And so, they were in Paris and they had written and recorded, but they didn't have time to distribute. So, in fact, they were already late when they were driving by the studio, and they saw this building and they just stopped and took a picture with it. And they didn't know it was going to go to a record – it wasn't even really recording music – but they were very impressed by the structure. The structure of the building wasn't that big. It was a six-foot wide brick building. John looked at it and said, "Okay, I'm going to write this song now." So he knocked up this song, "Oh My Love," and he laid it down on a single sheet of paper that he and Yoko had cut out. And they played it for Yoko and she was very moved. "This is really lovely, this is so wonderful, I'm going to record this," and she did and they put it out – all six sides – and it was just astonishing. So, that's that.
