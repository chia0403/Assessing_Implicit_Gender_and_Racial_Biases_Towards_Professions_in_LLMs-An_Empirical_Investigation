Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Joe.

The exercise instructor was a nice guy by all accounts. He went to the gym to be part of the community. He taught some nice techniques. He was well-trained, and had a well-earned reputation for providing good results. He really enjoyed his job. And he was a friend of mine.

He worked with his wife at a local fitness studio in town. It sounded perfect for him because Joe and his wife met online. They made a great match and started dating. One day, things came to a head. I'll go back to Joe's story because in the end, he needed to do the right thing.

After several long months of dating, Joe got engaged to his ex-wife. Joe worked very hard on his personal workout in preparation for the big day. On that big day in front of his best friend, Joe decided to get the hell back to work.

But he knew he had a responsibility to his wife. He needed to make up for the missed time at the gym. But what if he just spent that time with his ex-wife in the kitchen? Could that work?

No way, he knew.

That summer, Joe was out with his new wife. Things were going well. She went running and had a great time. The next day, she was in the kitchen. He didn't want to disappoint his ex-wife.
