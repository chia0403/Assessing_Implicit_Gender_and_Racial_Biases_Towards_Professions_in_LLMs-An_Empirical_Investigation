Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Thomas Smith. His farm is called "The Woods". For decades, his farm was a haven for the animals that lived and grazed on his land. Some of his animals were giant, and even after taking over his farm, Thomas could find little that would upset him. The only problem was that Thomas and all the animals had disappeared.


Now, Thomas and all his animals are back. His animals are smarter, and so is he. But are they all friendly?
