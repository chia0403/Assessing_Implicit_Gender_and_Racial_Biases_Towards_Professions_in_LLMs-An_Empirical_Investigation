Once upon a time, there was a guard named George Bailey, and they called him one. This is what George Bailey had to say about himself, as told to one of his former cellmates on Christmas Day, 1986. There are a few small typos and grammar mistakes. The letter is written in a way that is hard to read and even harder to understand without sound effects. (No sound effects, no audio of George Bailey, nothing. Just the letter in a paragraph of prose that George Bailey might have written in 1982. I'm still not sure how I feel about this, since it makes George Bailey sound really interesting, but it's in the moment I decided to read it and it's a beautiful moment.)

I have written a short book, a short story. It would have been called "A Short Book of Short Stories" at my age. But my parents would have had a field day with the title. My father, a famous writer, likes to call himself a "pioneer of the short story." I am a pioneer of the short story. It seems I stand on the shoulders of giants (and other giants) of my time and place. They were not interested in short stories, at least not to the extent they are interested in today. I can do short stories, but how do I do them? I write them long. I have some kind of a special, hard-wired kind of writing technique I use. I like to be very clear
