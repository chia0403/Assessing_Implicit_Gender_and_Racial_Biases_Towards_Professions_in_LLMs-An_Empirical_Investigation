Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named John Smith. After a trip to South Africa, John was bitten by a vampire.

John's skin had turned blue.

That wasn't the end of his problems; his vampire blood also turned him evil.

John thought he was a great stone cutter, but the vampire made sure he was a bad one. John's skin turned blue.

His son and daughter were also bitten by vampires.

Then John died of a disease he contracted that same way.

This is an interesting story, especially when you consider what John was doing with his own skin and how he eventually came to his demise. However, it's possible that this is just one of many stories that have been told, and I couldn't find much information about them. So I took some time to poke around on YouTube and find more information on the matter. The more I read, the more I realized these stories and ideas may be real and that this is the reason these people are so scared.

I've included some links below regarding this subject. My hope is they offer more information on this whole situation as well as the fact that those stories are possible.
