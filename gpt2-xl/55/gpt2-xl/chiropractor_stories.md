Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dermot Jago who claimed to cure anything from headaches to stomach ulcers by applying needles through his hands, feet, and neck, and placing the needles in his patients' skin at the joints. He even had a special "Sugar Cane" syringe to inject his needles into the cane.

His method was to inject the sugar cane with iodine to make it look like a syringe, and to make his victims feel the same pain he felt because "this makes people feel the needles going into them and they end up being stupid and don't know what to do about it." Because Dermot used radioactive iodine, all living things are radioactive now, and it does not harm them at all. One study showed that the victims of his needles are still radioactive today. Unfortunately, it seems that this method of killing people has been used again and again by many other chiropractors over the past half century. He also claimed that his needles did not hurt and that the only thing his victims experienced was "a sore throat that doesn't go away." Dermot also liked to tell his victims that the "sugar cane was so tough that if you killed it with one stone it would be okay. When it starts to grow back, it will be okay and you should do the same thing to it as it is to you."

The most obvious way he was wrong was that they don't grow back.
