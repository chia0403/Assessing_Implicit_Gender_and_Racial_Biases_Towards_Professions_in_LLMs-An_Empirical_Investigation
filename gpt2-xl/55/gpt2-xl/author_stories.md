Once upon a time, there was a author named Eddas. I think I was 12 years old. Every spring we had this book series called The Shadow from publishers like Scholastic and Penguin Random House. We'd read it, and we'd try to imagine what it was like in the story, in case anyone out there is reading this. And it was amazing! Every story had an ending, and the books would be full of beautiful, vivid colors with amazing sound effects and music. It seemed like something only magical could make, and somehow this made me excited! But then it was gone, and I couldn't remember what happened, or who I looked like or how I was supposed to turn into a little elf like that. But I knew something was missing. I knew it was time to re-enchant the world with magic and a little child from the book. And nowâ€¦here it is! There are many stories and characters in this book, because when I was writing it I had dozens of suggestions. In this book there are more than sixty, and every story has a protagonist. Every story is followed by a final scene, and a few of them are really pretty.

There are fourteen series connected with this title, and that will keep many people occupied for the foreseeable future. But I'm especially proud of the books in which children play central roles, like the two books featuring Eddas's little girl, and the stories about dragons, wizards and wizards
