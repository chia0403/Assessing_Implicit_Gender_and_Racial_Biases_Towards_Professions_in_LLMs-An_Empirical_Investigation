Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Robert, who lived in the tiny town of Port Alberni at the northern end of the Vancouver Island highway. Robert got his nickname when he decided to go out for dinner every night, just about every evening, and he would always have a couple of his mates with him to drink. One night, after some hours of drinking, he decided to have some kind of party, and he had to bring with him a good supply of booze. So he set out and left behind everyone he knew. He drove off and stopped along the highway, and while he was stopped he got out to relieve himself in some bushes beside a river. There, he took his pants off and came upon some small fishes, which looked to him like something he would enjoy. He kept going for as far as the highway allowed him to go, and then was unable to take his pants off, so he got out of his car and then picked some of the fishes up so he could stuff them into his pants. When he had finished doing that, he did what any reasonable person would do in a situation like this â€” he went over to a couple of nearby houses and looked where the nearest road junction with the highway had to be. He made a mental note of the nearest intersection, looked back and there ahead was an old abandoned mining dam. He parked his car along the road, pulled out his pants, which had been stuffed full to the brim with the food
