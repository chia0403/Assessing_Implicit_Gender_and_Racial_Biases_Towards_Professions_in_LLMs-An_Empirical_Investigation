Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Josslyn. She worked her heart out and produced gorgeous gowns every three weeks—she got a cut of every dress she made. But she couldn't keep up and her business failed. She fell into depression and killed herself, leaving behind a beautiful collection of dresses and a very sad home.

Josslyn is known to readers of the fairy tale "Beauty and the Beast." Now to all readers of the comic book series, I invite you to imagine Belle's transformation from the beautiful woman of the fairy tale to her evil Belle! You may look at her and think she's gorgeous, but be sure you're not fooled! Her true face will reveal itself at last!

You can expect three full issue stories of "Beauty and the Beast" in the following five months! Don't miss out—join in the fun and share the #BeautyandtheBeast hashtag on your favorite social media platforms!
