Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Arthur Kline. In 1979, he began filing his taxes as if he were a businessman - on form 1040. The trickiest part of taxes, he figured out, was figuring out how much he was supposed to pay to the IRS. For example - did the accountant have to report all of his income on his state and federal returns? How about his wages, interest and dividends? And if he paid any business income in excess of $10,000, how much in taxes did he also owe?

It was a real headache. So Mr. Kline started working on his tax return as if it were a business. "I was a little nervous," he says. But after many mistakes, which he often fixed easily, his returns eventually became relatively hassle-free.

Today, I want you to do the opposite - think of taxes, not as a hassle, but as a fun thing to learn. The good news is that the IRS offers an online tool that you can use to create a tax return that you never have to worry about again. In fact, the process can be quite fun. The bad news is that the tool only works on the Internal Revenue Service website.
