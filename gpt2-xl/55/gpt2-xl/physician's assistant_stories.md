Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Margaret Brown who was kind and gentle but had no patience with the nonsense of doctors. After doing a good day's work for her, she said she wished she could sit down and stay for the evening to rest. A woman named Dorothy Gish came to help. Dorothy Gish was the only other female physician's assistant there at the time. Margaret Brown gave instructions to Dorothy Gish to fetch tea for Margaret in the bathroom. When that was finished, Margaret was to help Dorothy Gish with dinner.

Margaret Brown didn't say she was tired. Not at all. She stood in the bathroom doing nothing. And for the entire time Dorothy Gish went to work, she never once got up to take the dinner she was supposed to take, or drink the water she was supposed to drink. Every time she went to her little table in the kitchen and sat down, Margaret Brown stood there watching her. And she continued to look right through Dorothy Gish all the time. A woman who never cared if she was seen or not.

Dorothy Gish said to her, "Miss Brown, I have made the best dinner you have ever tasted." Margaret Brown said, "Truly to you, I shall never forget what you have said. But I do wish I could sit down and rest."
