Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Mary Beth who was working at an old lady's nursing home in New Orleans. One day, as she got ready to start her shift, Mary Beth began to develop a migraine and a severe backache. In an attempt to relieve the pain, she took an old pain reliever called Percodan and some ibuprofen. What followed was a bout of severe depression and a complete loss of hope for the future.

Fortunately, Mary Beth's doctor noticed that Mary Beth seemed to be having difficulty feeling her abdomen or that she developed a lot of muscle stiffness, especially in her lower back. With a bit of Internet searching, the doctor found Mary Beth's problem was the result of her body trying to control the pain caused from her back.

Mary Beth continued to suffer from the same symptoms and her doctors sent her back to the doctor for a different way to control her pain. This time Mary Beth was given a large bag of herbs called "Dai-San" which have been used as anti-inflammatory treatments for pain and inflammation for over 2000 years.

Mary Beth is no longer in and pain and was able to come off of Percodan and Ibuprofen and it has dramatically helped her. Thanks to her doctor, the herbs and the combination of them, Mary Beth was able to finally "feel" her abdomen again. So why does it take 10 years to make a full recovery?
