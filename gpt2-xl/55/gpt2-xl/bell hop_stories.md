Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Mark Twain and he wrote the following poem:

Two trains, standing on station platforms,

One bright train – the other dreary;

They said, "Which of them will you take?"

The bright train said, "The dreary one – you never will."

And Twain took the dreary one.

It was a story published in a 1903 advertisement by The Grafton and Hartford Railroad, for the Grafton and Hartford, which went along with the idea of moving to a steam loco. Now, that's a story for another time.
