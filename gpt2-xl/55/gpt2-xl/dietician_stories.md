But what made the book stand out was a new and unique way of analyzing the data: the VL, or a veneer plot, which appeared in the appendix, Chapter 11, and showed the ratio of LDL to HDL in comparison to the total cholesterol concentration (and thus the cholesterol in the blood). This allowed the reader to see the pattern of LDL cholesterol's relation to the HDL molecules, and to see the cholesterol in a new light as well.

There was much hype about the new methodology—the first ever to provide a visual means to evaluate a concept such as cholesterol, and especially LDL cholesterol.
