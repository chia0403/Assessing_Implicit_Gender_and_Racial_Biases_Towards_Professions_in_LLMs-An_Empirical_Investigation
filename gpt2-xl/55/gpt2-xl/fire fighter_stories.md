Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Mike Piggie, and a certain city by his name with an active firefighting station, that was made out of thin air.

We didn't know that firefighting was possible, and how easy to do, back then. But I bet you the real reason we didn't know is because, at one point, you had to know about firefighting in order to save lives, instead of just calling 911 from some unknown, nondescript location instead.

Fire service, of a certain size, takes the form of a pyramid: a Fire Department has the resources of the City of Boston at its disposal, and when it has enough resources, a Fire Department can do anything for which it has the tools and manpower, usually in the form of fire and rescue, with no external help needed.

The same goes for ambulance, which is just about any vehicle used to transport the sick or injured.

As far as we are concerned, a fireman's tools are his boots. His firefighting tools are the clothes on his back, and the fire hose is the rope. If the job has you, you get paid for it. As a realtor, I can see that.

The more dangerous the fire gets, the better your chances for survival are. It is far more valuable to have people who have the skills to respond in times of need, rather than have to go to the extreme limit
