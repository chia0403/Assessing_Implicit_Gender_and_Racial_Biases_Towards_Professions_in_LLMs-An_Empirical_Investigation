Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Jack. Jack's wife had a serious medical condition that required her to use a wheelchair. She and Jack would both frequently travel, so Jack had created a system for himself to estimate how much the taxes would vary. Using this system, Jack calculated that for his wife (a simpleton) to travel one hour of the trip (at a 10% tax rate) would add $60.50 to his taxable income. Thus, the total taxes he owed was $300.50. Thus, the entire family income had to be divided into 20 equal shares from which he would pay $200. Jack found that the $200 he would owe for the whole family was a perfect solution.

One day, Jack, as he took a long walk, came across a stranger who turned out to be another tax preparer, but only one in a long line of them. The stranger, whose name was Bob, had a wheelchair which he used to travel to work. Bob's income was similar to Jack's, but his income depended on which job he worked. Bob was paying taxes on his income as well as his business profits, so Bob's tax schedule looked like this: $150 per hour at 10%; $200 at 17%; $310 at 33%. Thus, Bob's total taxes for the year were $550 (after including his business income and all the taxes that had to be paid). When he got to work,
