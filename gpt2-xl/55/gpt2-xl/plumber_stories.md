Once upon a time, there was a plumber named William Henry Harrison who lived in Williamsburg, Virginia and became a champion slave-trader. Harrison was a member of the Whig party, and his son, William Henry Harrison II, was later elected vice-president of the United States." Harrison was president from 1800-1801, during which time he was responsible for the war, the Louisiana Purchase, and the Louisiana Purchase.

Harrison had been a Republican for most of his adult life. In 1832, he ran for President as the Whig candidate, with his father and grandson becoming part of his vice-presidential ticket. His son became the first black President of the United States. Of course, the Republicans didn't like having a black man in their cabinet and made it very clear that Harrison would never become President, so they made him Vice-President. One of Harrison's first appointments was to be Solicitor General, where he was to handle the case of John Brown â€“ the infamous American abolitionist.

John Brown's goal was to start a black war in America with the help of the British. He began his "army" on June 3, 1859 in Harper's Ferry, WV by killing the sheriff, then he proceeded to steal 40 black men to form his "army." One of the black men was a 17-year old boy, who was the reason for his murder, even though others testified in his defense.
