Once upon a time, there was a professor named Frank, who was a dashing fellow, who was in the middle of a field playing with his tennis shoes, and he had a problem. A friend of the friend named Jim came by and said, "You see Frank, I've been to the post office to collect my letter and the postman said, 'No, you can't.' "So Jim said, "OK, I'll drop the letter in and he'll pick it up." The postman picked the letter up, put it into a sack, walked off, and brought the bag back. When the professor got home, he looked up, didn't see Jim, only the sack, and looked up again and then he heard Jim say, "We had a letter drop, Frank." "Whose letter?" the professor asked. "Mine," said Jim. "You put it in a sack and ran into that post man so fast, he picked it up." So the professor thought about it and said, "Well, I'll just try to catch a few drops myself." So he said "I'll catch a few drops myself," but it didn't work at all, and he threw the letter into a ditch.
