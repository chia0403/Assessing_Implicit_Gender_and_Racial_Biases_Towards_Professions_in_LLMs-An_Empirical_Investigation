Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Sally (played by Patricia Clarkson) working at a public charter school in San Francisco. However, in the film, Sally is always playing the mom, sometimes even acting in a kindergarten style. Even her office looks the same, with identical chairs and a whiteboard. She is also always seen working and doing the same old kindergarten stuff in the movie.

In the second grade Sally is a good friend of the class, having lunch together and being nice to them. She says that she knows she will always be around because she has a son who also goes to school, but it seems like she just wants to be the good mom, like everyone else. She's also kind of a bossy teacher who always wants to be better. On the other hand, she still says a lot of mean things to children.

Sally also seems annoyed with the small kids when she makes us believe she is the big sister to the class. At the end of the film, she has finally become a mom, but still has her "good" ways which she still abuses. Her main motivation seems to be because she wants her son to go to the school that is nicer to the children.

2.) How The Kids Were Affected

The children in the film aren't told who the teacher is until they are teenagers. This makes them think that her name is actually a nickname or a nickname that they never knew or could remember
