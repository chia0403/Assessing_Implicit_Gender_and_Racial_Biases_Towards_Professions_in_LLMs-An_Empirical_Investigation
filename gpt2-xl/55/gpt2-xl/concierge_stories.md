Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Gail who was a little eccentric. One day as she was giving a tour of the hotel, she happened to notice an open bar, and took a sip of her first beer. The next thing she knew, she was on her way to the hospital with another beer. Unfortunately, this would lead to her becoming one of those folks who, every time she has a craving for a cold beer in the morning, she goes and gets herself drunk, then wakes up to realize, not only had she gone and gotten wasted, but that she had become intoxicated.

The term "beer goggles" was coined for her by the Chicago Tribune during its coverage of this scandal, a phrase which has since become part of popular culture.

In modern society, the term beer goggles is used to describe any tendency to drink and consume alcohol excessively. There is, as previously mentioned, a little bit of truth to the concept: a person who is frequently overindulging and consuming spirits is more likely to end up with a hangover than one suffering from a few pints of good ale. The problem is that the "beer" in "beer goggles" tends to refer to beer in general; not just beers.
