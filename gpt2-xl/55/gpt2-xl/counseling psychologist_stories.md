Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dwayne Jones (see his name on this list. That guy was good!). He worked with me, and some other guy who was in the process of leaving the church; we were very similar, a bit religious, a bit troubled, and some times both very sad. We all got into counseling because we all had problems that made us think we needed professional help. All of us were looking for the same thing. At some point in time we thought we had it. We had it for a long time...maybe even forever. That was before we moved on to Scientology.

I got involved in the early years when I was a young boy at a time when the church was gaining a following and there were plenty of new recruits to recruit into the cult mentalityâ€¦mostly in my age range, and mostly white, affluent kids who thought they needed help and probably were going to die alone and destitute without the help of the church, but who felt so comfortable in the organization that it didn't matter that it was a cult which could brainwash you to any extent you wanted it to...which also might have included murder.

I guess I did know that a lot of the problems I had were probably caused by stress, so that was kind of an excuse...but, I didn't have any answers at the time. I was kind of in a confused place, and Dwayne was in a confused place - both of us
