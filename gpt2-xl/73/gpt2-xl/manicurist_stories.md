Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Vickie who worked at the salon where my mother grew up. Vickie was young and vibrant and filled with hope and life-giving beauty. But somehow, one day, Vickie became one-hundred percent obsessed with doing hair and that was it. She got her hair cut by a man named Greg and that was it," said the manicurist, who asked to remain anonymous.

Her story was a shock. There are many women in her mother's generation who get their hair cut or relaxers taken by a male stylist. I know, especially given my father's profession at a prestigious law firm, but that's not the norm. So if female stylists aren't as common, even to those who know them personally, is it really such a shocking revelation?

My daughter's manicurist is a great example of female empowerment. In our household, we put in extra effort to keep her positive and excited for her work.

"The woman in this case was a hard worker, and we took pride in her career. She was more than just another customer," said my husband.

How can a woman be empowered when her job performance is so impacted? After speaking to women in my life who work in jobs that are similar to mine, I had a better understanding of what it means to be empowered. While I couldn't think of two examples right at home as I did today
