Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named James. He was quite good at it, and for a time he enjoyed the attention and respect of the League of Gods for his work. After he was hired as a teacher, he became the teacher of his former student, Jaden. Jaden was a talented fighter, and he enjoyed challenging James for the honor of "Master."

In a fit of anger, James found new forms of violence to challenge Jaden in, and he became a "mad man." After this, even his best and bravest friends grew less patient with James - he had become an outcast who could not be trusted or relied on.

One day, the League of Gods called a meeting, but they were too disgusted to show up. However, they had found James while searching the forest for the League's leader. Jaden heard the voice of the League before he heard the voice of James. He was overcome by confusion, so that he did not recognize the League. The League asked James what possessed him to think of doing this, but James would only say that he couldn't stop now, and so he did the best he could to stop. In so doing, Jaden lost his faith in the League of Gods (he thought he was just being stubborn). James tried to kill him, but he was able to escape. James made arrangements, but he got a new apartment, and that was why Jaden left to look for him
