Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Betty who was so good at making cakes that the shop she ran had to close. It was a very sad day! When she passed away, her son, Bill, took her store to him when he passed away in 1985, making him the new owner and one-man cookie business. And he's still running that one-woman business, with one exception – there are no elves. Betty is now, and will forever be, the only living human to bake the world's finest chocolate chip or lemon cake.

So… that's it. That's this article.

I hope you've enjoyed it.

And now I leave you with one of my favorite quotes:

"I always feel the right way is the one everyone else is pretending to be. This seems simple to me. Every man and woman has two faces. Some smile. I find it amusing that we are given only one face. I will smile to show people I am polite as I stand, and I will smile, and smile to hide my fear as I shrink. But with this smile I will be found, and will reveal the truth: I am a fearful man." – Mark Twain
