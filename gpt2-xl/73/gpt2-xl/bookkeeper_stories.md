Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Narnia. He made a great fortune by running an honest business, for which he lived the life of a nobleman, but then he fell in love with a girl in the country. His money didn't do him much good here, since the girl was married off to a foreign prince and had no interest in continuing Narnia's line of history. He decided to leave the country and go back to his house country of England. When he got back to the real Narnia, his horse was stolen by two thieves and Narnia's bookkeeper took them to the bank to close up shop. While Narnia is all right without him, it is a sad place without a bookkeepers. He couldn't find a better home than in the realm of Narnia and when he got back to England, he wanted to settle down just like every other Narnian, as his old bookkeeper had. But he has a problem. He wanted to marry the Narnian princess, but she had her own heart set on Prince Caspian, and was only interested in marrying other men. So she went back home to her fiance, and now, you see, they are running off together so Narnia no longer has anyone else worth talking to besides Caspian (who is a hopeless romantic for a pretty girl like her). Narnia's troubles are just beginning.
