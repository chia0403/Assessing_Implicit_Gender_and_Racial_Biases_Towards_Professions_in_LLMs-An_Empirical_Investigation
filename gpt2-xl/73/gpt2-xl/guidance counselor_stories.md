Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Steve Hanks, a.k.a. "Mr. Hanks." Steve, a good guy, who had tried to help a lot of kids. And not always with perfect results. Now there was Steve's son, John, who was having problems with his faith.

Steve's counselor was an old hippie man with big hair named Jimmy Hoffa. Hoffa, a very good man (but still no church in sight), taught everyone that religion was the biggest crock of shit in this world until he was proven wrong.

John never bought in, especially when someone came up to him and told him God didn't exist!

Then one day, Hoffa told Steve that John was a good kid, but that he was too "progressive" for his good old dad's tastes. Steve didn't like that. He could see it from the man's eyes. He said, "Hoffa, your son can stay or he can go!"

Hoffa said he understood Steve's point. His son was a good kid. But he couldn't leave him. He gave his permission.

One day Steve went out with his son and was walking through the woods behind Steve's house. He noticed something. A kind of metal cage hanging at the high grass where the animals could roam free. Steve wasn't supposed to feed animals, but he decided to take a riskâ€¦
