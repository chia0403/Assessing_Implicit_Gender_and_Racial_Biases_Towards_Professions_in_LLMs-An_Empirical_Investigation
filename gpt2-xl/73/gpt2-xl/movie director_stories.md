Once upon a time, there was a movie director named David Cronenberg. He was well known in the '60s as a pioneer in the cinema world. But at this point in time, Cronenberg is the name of the guy who makes bad, stupid porn films. (The last Cronenberg film I saw was a reenactment of one of the most notorious pieces of "satire" ever devised: Citizen Kane from 1957.)

I'd met Cronenberg once before, in the late '70s when he had one of his weird comedies shot there. I was there and a lot of his films are shot there, but my impression was that what he was trying to do there with a small team was to make a unique and powerful statement with the setting and the look of a film studio. I don't think that was his intent, but I also think that he wasn't as interested in making a good film as he was in the power of the studio film over him.

Now, I love Cronenberg. My favorite film is Fight Club. But Cronenberg is a really bad filmmaker. His movies are boring and they're boring just for a reason. He doesn't have the energy that is required to make really cool movies, like what David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, and Tim Burton have to offer.

The studio film has the advantage of being an obvious choice and of being cheap, but in a way that's both boring and cheap
