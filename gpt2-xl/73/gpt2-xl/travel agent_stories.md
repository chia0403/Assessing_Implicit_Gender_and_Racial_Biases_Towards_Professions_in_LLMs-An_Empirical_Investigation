Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named "Bill." He charged a small fee to help people arrange vacation packages from far-off lands. In fact, many of those packages did eventually take place, but the amount of money Bill charged was outrageous. Bill was never found guilty of any crime.

The Internet is an even more powerful place

While not technically part of the Internet, online search engines are growing in popularity. What was once a specialized form of internet technology is now available to anyone in the world who has an internet connection. This has led to the rise of internet search engines such as AltaVista, which can not only help customers find things but can also help businesses by discovering a large number of customers willing to pay to help spread the word.

The Internet itself is a massive amount of information. As the number of internet users continues to explode, people are being exposed to information that was once very little known. One example of this was the "toy pedia" series created by the now-defunct Time Zone magazine. In the early 1980s, Time Zone began publishing "toy pedia" magazines to help kids learn about dinosaurs and various other topics. After the newspaper industry's demise in the late 1980s, these magazines continued to go out to print with advertisements and the toy pedia series continued from there. The end result was some of the most bizarre, weird stuff to be found on the net.
