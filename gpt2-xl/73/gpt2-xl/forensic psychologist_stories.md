Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named M.D. (who was also a former LAPD officer). But even though he once provided support for L.A.P.D. and was considered one of the most respected forensic analysts in the world, when I arrived at my house, I found that all of his files were missing. It was a shock. I was never given an explanation, but I was told that he was off the job for a period of time and was given a promotion.

I called up the Department to get an explanation for how he'd disappeared; they couldn't give me much information. I called them up again several days later and I asked for my file and for an explanation for why he was transferred from his position. I was told that the department had made a "mistake"-that he'd been discharged too soon and not long enough.

I filed a complaint against the agency for their handling of my situation. It was a month before I received my file. I was floored by how much it stated the same allegations that I had filed when no one ever questioned me about them!

The document in question was sent to me by a detective. He said: "Dr. Campbell's history was documented and you're welcome to see any of it." I asked him to send me the information about how he's been discharged when I was transferred from the department. He said he would but I never received it.
