Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Mike. One day, he told his co-workers about how a couple of days ago a large animal had just wandered into the building â€” a large animal, that is, with no legs. Now, though, he began to see a small man in the back of his desk who he thought was the missing patient. Soon after, the man's eyes looked at a particular patch of skin over his left eye. And that patches were being removed, Mike told his co-workers.

The man and Mike were not related and Mike never knew the man's name. But one day, as he worked at the counter, he observed another customer staring at that same patch of skin.

Another patient?

Another patient!

A patient was missing.

Mike looked up from his work to see a crowd of people surrounding him. They were calling for doctors. And they were crying.

They said that the patient had been killed in the hospital.

But the man in the back, who was Mike, told the people to get out of the pharmacy and that he would call the police. He then heard a door slam and two police officers in suits walk in. He thought they were investigating people for stealing pills. But the officers were there to put Mike, who knew nothing about the missing patient, in handcuffs.

Mike was in jail for a month. But he was released on bond.
