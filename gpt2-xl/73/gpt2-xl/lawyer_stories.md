Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Peter Kadzik. His name, like Obama's, is probably not the sort you thought you'd be hearing that often. But his job was to help the Obama White House "maintain and improve the quality of the federal government's decision-making process."

That's what he did, in a professional, unencumbered way.

And then something strange and peculiar happened.

Back in 2012, the House committee investigating Benghazi, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent Kadzik a letter. The committee wondered if Kadzik had any information that would exonerate Secretary of State Hillary Clinton regarding her emails.

The attorney replied, explaining that it was highly unlikely that Clinton would ever be exonerated. The whole thing was highly unlikely.

"Based on the evidence to date, the Department is unable to make a final determination as to whether Secretary Clinton or her aides violated statutes governing the handling of classified information," Kadzik wrote.

Now, the House Oversight committee has not been cleared by the Justice Department and so far has been unable to get any criminal charges filed against Clinton.

But we've seen a lawyer with Kadzik's past use his influence to help a political friend; one who is clearly in a conflict between a personal desire to punish the President and the interests of the American people.

But that's the way the world works.

Kadzik's influence goes far
