Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Jules Faber. He worked in a small town in France. He had one big ambition: to design a jacket for an athlete as handsome as him.

He did so by studying a photograph from an athlete he had been impressed by, a professional boxer named Claude Tischenko.

When Tischenko took a look at the jacket Faber designed for him, he liked it so much he decided to wear it on the day he retired from the ring.

The picture Tischenko took of the jacket is amazing. It shows Tischenko looking directly into the lens, his brow furrowed as if he were debating what was more important, his victory over an elite fighter or the fact that that big jacket was sitting right on his back.

You see that photo floating around the Internet? Yeah, that's Faber, trying to look handsome as he sits on his tiled floor in an otherwise drab bar.

And in another part of the internet there was a similar image of Faber posing in similar attire, standing next to someone he assumed was an athletic trainer. (Note to self: Take Tischenko's advice and do a great jacket for an athlete too.)

Well, Faber got the picture and the gym attendant who took it is the same person who put him up for a job with the same company as Tischenko at the end of the day.
