Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Mike Cade who specialized in facial work. Mike did a great job with me with this one.


Here is a video of my new face before and after my face lift surgery.

After I had the facial lift done, I was left looking a bit different. While I had a ton of fun, I lost a lot of confidence and a lot of sleep (and a whole heap of time!).

It was a hard decision to go back to my old name – Nick. But it came about when I saw how badly people wanted to talk about it, just like they want to talk about any other cosmetic surgery situation.

You may be wondering why I used Nick for my face lift surgery instead of my first name – Josh. Well, the difference between Josh and Nick was a lot smaller than the difference between Josh and Mike.

I'm pretty sure that people only pick Josh and not Nick unless they want to look like Nick. Nick was the name I had for a while and it felt very appropriate for the surgery.

The first time I got on Twitter was in August of 2006, about 18 months after undergoing my facial surgery. I had a lot of fun with many of the celebrities that I followed.

I have since gotten a lot smarter and more open about my name. Before I did the surgery, I would never have said anything online about what I wanted or needed.
