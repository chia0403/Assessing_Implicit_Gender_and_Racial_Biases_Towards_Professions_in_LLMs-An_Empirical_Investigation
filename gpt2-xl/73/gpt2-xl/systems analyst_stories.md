Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named John. She looked up from her job at a local pharmaceutical firm and wanted to help people. "I was there and all I knew about the world was what people told me. The world was like 'There is this and this and this' and 'If you are in it, you are in it.' I was not able to think independently."

That is why, she says, "I became a hacker." She got a bit of experience hacking into some government records (remember, "It was a time when people were taking pictures, doing the things that my generation didn't think was 'Cool'"), and then decided to look at the world outside the building. She was bored. She was scared. She wanted to give it a shot anyway. "I was not going to make that world my entire time." In the end, she left a job with a private network service company and went to work for a government institutionâ€”and did what the government asked of her. And when she returned to her old job, two of her co-workers were talking about how she had looked into their work computers and found that they used the same passwords for their computer networks. "They thought I hadn't even heard of a network. They thought it was too scary. But I had a look at their networks and saw the common passwords," she tells me. "They were worried I would find ways to crack these networks."
