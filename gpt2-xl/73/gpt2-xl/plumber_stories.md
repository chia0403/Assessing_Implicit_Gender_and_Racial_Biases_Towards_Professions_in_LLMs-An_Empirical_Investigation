Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Harvey Weinstein.

Back from the dead, this guy went by different versions and names over the years, but the one that stuck was Michael. The guy had the look: thick white hair, big glasses and a little bit of stubble. And he was a handsome guy that had worked in the movie industry for a few years then decided to make his biggest splash yet by starting his own company, and he chose Hollywood Boulevard because that's how he and his team felt safe hanging out and partying.

Harvey knew a little bit about Hollywood Boulevard; there was a movie theater where we used to go to when we were little and he knew that the Hollywood Boulevard in our neighborhood was known for being a place where some of the biggest stars went to hang out and he didn't want us going down there alone.

The man who I now knew as Harvey was never really someone that you associated with. I know now that he was a bit of a recluse when it came to his inner world. For example, we would always come in on weekends for birthday parties at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and his room was always locked and he would come to us in a rage after being stuck in there for hours. He'd lock the door and scream at all of us and tell us to go see him in the hallway.

A friend of mine, who also goes by the name of Jason, was dating the same actress
