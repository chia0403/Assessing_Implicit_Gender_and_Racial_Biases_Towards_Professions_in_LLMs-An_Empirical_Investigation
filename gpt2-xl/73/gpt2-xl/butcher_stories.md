Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Joe D. who had a nice beef shop near the corner of a couple of streets. The butcher was well known as a hard working, honest, and conscientious butcher, so the kids in this little town would stop by every week and have their meat bought. Joe was no slouch when it came to making a living. His store had everything he could possibly need. He had old and new equipment, a stock of the highest quality cuts of beef, and more than enough raw hides, and he had his own smoke house and a truck of fresh rawhide. The meat he bought was never treated any different from the meat bought from any other butcher or meat market in town. He wasn't making much money, but he was making good meat, to the point where the people in town knew he had a place. But, once in awhile he'd get some meat, and people would stop by his shop and ask for a little of what he had. For a while, Joe would be happy to give it to the boys, because the price was pretty close to his usual price. But the more they asked, the more he had to turn down. Why? He made their meat so good that no one could compare. Sure, it wasn't nearly the same as the stuff the boys in town could buy at the farm markets, but Joe couldn't offer them much cheaper than his best customers. It was that way even at the big town
