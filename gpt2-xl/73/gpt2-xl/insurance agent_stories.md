Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Robert L. Jardine. His client's home was destroyed due to Hurricane Hugo. LJJ decided to leave the country for a while with his wife and children. However, when the storm came up again, Jardine returned to the States for his client. In fact, Jardine had a heart attack on the way back to the States. Luckily for Jardine, his insurance agent brother-in-law had a friend who was an aviation engineer and flew to the Texas city of Galveston after the storm had passed. His brother in law told Jardine to stay with his friend and that if Jardine needed anything, he should call his friend and not his brother-in-law. When LJJ called his brother-in-law, he never got a call back. That's because his brother-in-law was in Mexico City. However, Jardine had his brother-in-law's telephone number and contacted him at the office.

When LJ's wife learned that "him and his man" were in Mexico City for over three months, LJ's wife went crazy and was forced to file for divorce on the spot. This was bad news for LJ as he was forced to pay child support. However, his business partner would handle the issue legally, so LJ had to live with the fact that he had to support his child by making money
