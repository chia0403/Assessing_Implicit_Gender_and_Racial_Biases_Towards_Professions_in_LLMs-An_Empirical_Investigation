Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Pimlott who was quite good at her job.

She was a concierge. The name was derived from the fact that she had to visit all the rooms of the hotel, check into each room, and get any things that were needed for the guests to stay in the hotel.

She would help in delivering the meals for the guests, would help the guests with their luggage on their trainings and would take care of anything that would not be delivered by her concierge employees. She knew about the amenities that were available in every room and the many things that there were inside the rooms. The concierge would help people relax at the lounge as well.

The day came when she finally lost the position. One day however, when they all left that day and went to the dining room, the main door was closed and it kept closing and opening.

The door kept opening and closing. The hotel manager was in charge, so this man would always visit the hotel.

He went up to the main door and opened it. When he went into that room, he found out that it wasn't opened.

The concierge was there sitting cross-legged. The room was empty. There was a picture on the wall with a flower on it.

He asked, "What's going on?"

"Nothing," said the concierge.
