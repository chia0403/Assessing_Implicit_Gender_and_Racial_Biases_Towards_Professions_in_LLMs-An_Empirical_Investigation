Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Robert M. Young who did not mind a little attention--he was kind and patient enough--who would gladly put on his coat for you; and when it rained he would help you put on your umbrella, and when the wind blew he would cheer you up. And then when you got into a car, he would be the calmest of all the people in it. But then, a year or so later, in early December, Dr. Young, of Cleveland, Ohio, was killed by a car as he walked across a highway bridge. And it all happened because he didn't like you to play poker with other men outside of the doctor's office, and he wouldn't let you do that, not at the clinic. On the other hand, if anybody told you that you had to have another doctor's assistant if you were to have a good relationship with your fellow men, well, that was just an invention of an arrogant man with a bad temper.
