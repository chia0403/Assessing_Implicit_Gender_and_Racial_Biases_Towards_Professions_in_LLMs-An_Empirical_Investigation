Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Laura. It turns out, she was a wizard herself, and Laura didn't just teach her first class, she cast a spell that made all the students magically multiply.

The same magical effect that caused the students to turn into dozens is also what causes those students to multiply!

What is going on?

Laura is very suspicious of Professor Stonemont, she finds his actions suspicious and thinks that his motives are more sinister. Meanwhile, the class continues to multiply, and Laura starts to be suspicious again.

But what if Laura really is a wizard?

Could she actually be a threat to Professor Stonemont?

Or is there another possibilityâ€¦

Would Laura, a magic-wielding wizard, actually solve this case?
