Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Bill Allen, and his big breakthrough came at a bar known as the Electric Boat. A drunken young engineer named William Goudy was sitting next to him. For an hour that night, they talked. The next day, Allen was called into Bill's office for a formal, job interview. Goudy, for his part, was told of a new, all-solid-state design that would revolutionize all types of electric machinery, an all-new, revolutionary machine which he could do the design work on! The electrician was not impressed. He told Allen, "I don't like what we are doing, we are just a gimmick for you." But Allen had heard of Goudy's brilliant innovation, and he wanted to learn more about how this new creation would revolutionize manufacturing. Goudy agreed to introduce his friend and fellow inventor James Watt to Allen. Watt was an Englishman who had been working for his father in the textile industry of the city of Bristol, England. James had seen an immediate and promising impact that his inventions with cotton had had on the industry over the previous decade. His father had seen a huge influx of money and new jobs, both manual and electrical, that his new and improved power tools were bringing to his industry. His work had made the work force more productive, and his designs, although highly advanced, were not revolutionary as were the electric engines. Watt was an innovative young man
