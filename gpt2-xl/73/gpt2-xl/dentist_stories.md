Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Jack, and he used to put his patients' lips to his drills, to give them an extra bit of pizazz. And what was the last thing he did for someone with bad breath? He blew on them. But it turns out that this is a pretty bad look in dentistry. And, he's been charged with misdemeanor assault and battery of a patient, charges which he may have to plead up to a felony.

Jack hasn't commented on the case much, but he told the Daily Mail:

I didn't really know a lot about it…it's the same thing I did to my patients anyway – I just use my mouth. That's how I made my living back home. I guess the guy just came over and bit my lip on purpose.

On the other hand, this looks more like an ordinary case of a dentist bitching about not getting paid.
