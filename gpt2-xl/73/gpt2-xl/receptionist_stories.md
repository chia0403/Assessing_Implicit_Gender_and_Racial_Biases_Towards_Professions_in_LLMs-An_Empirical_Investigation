Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Lucy for the United States Air Force.

Her job required her to greet the Air Force's most important guests, with her trademark red and white polka-dot dress and a wide smile. Lucy worked in a spacious building in the heart of San Diego's downtown – the "Museum of Government," otherwise known as the old headquarters of the United States Air Force in the post-World War II era.

Lucy met some of the service people, the leaders of the Air Force, the presidents and the people who made this country's defense and its interests safe for future generations. Lucy worked her butt off to make everyone happy and remember all those old times she was in such an amazing place with so many cool people around her. This was the time when that woman in the red dress still worked there, Lucy.

When we look back at Lucy's memories, it is the smile on her face, the smile about her, that will always stay with us. In time, Lucy's job went to another American woman from the United States Air Force and her name was Peggy. She was in charge of everything related to the "People's Party" at the museum and the people who she met every day. She was a sweet nurse who often brought a glass of wine in her jacket.

And this is what we still remember – the people who make everything so happy all the time.
