Once upon a time, there was a editor named Mike McManus. I will always remember him from the days of his writing for The Simpsons, as his voice made his writing sound way cooler. When the studio that had made some of his best work, Fox, finally came around to bringing him aboard they insisted he was no longer in charge of the Simpsons, but as the voice of his character "Homer." One of the things I was doing for Fox was writing fanzines, and one happened to be titled the "The Simpsons Fanzine Book," (of which I am not proud because I thought it would give me some kind of exclusive access to the show). Mike McManus got wind of my fanzine, and he was so impressed he wrote to the publisher, asking if they would send him a copy of the paperback, which they did not. When I asked him why he wrote to them? because he was "Homer," for many years. He was also one of the editors of the fanzine. Mike wrote me a letter back saying that he did not see himself as "Homer" anymore, and I was to use that fact to sell my fanzine to other publications. In my letters to Fox I referred to Mike as "Mike W.," because he had hired me as the new voice of The Simpsons. I was not happy about that, but they never gave me the time to explain myself.
