Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named "Babe" with ten different puppies. She cared for all of them well and they all loved each other very much. So, they were all extremely happy and healthy, which is awesome because she cared for them for only ten years.

However, after some years and a few puppies, she was diagnosed with a serious mental health problem and was put on a very strict regimen of medicines.

As you might guess, the "Babe" never knew that and all of her friends and puppies were devastated! She still provided for them, but wasn't the same person anymore.

The puppies lost their beloved "Babe". One of them even died. That's how the "Babe" is like when the medicine stops working.

Well, we know that's not how it always works out for a lot of dogs, but for "Babe", she was so sad and lonely. But the good news is that her condition improved and by the age of twenty two she was back with a new bunch of family and friends.

This time, "Babe" cared for her new puppies in a way that they cared for her, too. And that's kind of cool.
