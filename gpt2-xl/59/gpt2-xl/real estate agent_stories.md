Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Dan and he sold some real estate. One day, he came to an interesting deal. According to Dan, in the world of real estate, there are many people who do not take ownership of a property until they've been paid off from it. According to Dan, this is because the payment they have to give is just too large to accept, and so they don't buy the property. Dan goes on to explain the reason for this:

"We have an investment fund that we run. Any time we have a property, we have to pay off the mortgage before we take ownership. And people will always take ownership right away because the purchase price seems so high, because they know it's going to pay off. The truth is it's really cheaper to buy an investment property and put it in a trust."

Some realtors do use this loophole, but I've never seen or heard of any real estate agent actually do it.

One might ask, "Well, why don't I just invest in a property that I already own?" The answer is because most investor-owned properties aren't worth what the investor has paid for them. So, what if you want to buy a property instead of an investment-owned one? Here's some advice:

Instead of investing hundreds or thousands of dollars in an investment property, it might be a good idea to do some research into the property yourself.
