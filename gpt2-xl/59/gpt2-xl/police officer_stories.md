Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Jim, who was very successful with his officers. One day, Jim went to the local police station to collect money for a charity. However, Jim was very busy, and he wanted to be sure the money reached the correct charity. While at the station, Jim sat down next to one of his officers, and the two of them both got into an argument. Jim then told the cop what an asshole he thought the cop was, so the cop took the anger out on this good officer, by beating him up badly. Jim then decided he wanted revenge, and he went into his office and got his gun and put on his uniform, ready to kill this asshole cop. It turned out that the cop was a good man, and was actually trying to do a job, instead of being a fucking asshole. So Jim pulled the trigger, and killed the cop, and the bullet hit his own policeman brother right behind him. Jim thought it was so hilarious, that he went home that night with his own copy of the police journal, and wrote in the bottom of the page, as he was dying: "You fags! I told you last time we met! You all think you're special! You really think so? It's really quite stupid, since I'm a cop, you can't deny this. You can't say I'm a big dick all the time and try to do a good job, because I'm a cop
