Once upon a time, there was a barber named Peter. He never asked his customers for a dime but on Christmas Day, he gave each of them one. Peter, the barber, believed that God has a special gift for each of his customers. Peter never asks for a dime. For him, giving is a way of giving.

The "God Gift" is the gift of God to you. The Gift you have been longing for and trying to find all of your life. The Gift your grandmother always told you to buy at the fair, but never could afford. The Gift you've never had.

The gift God gives you is a heart full of love. You are now free to give joy and love freely to the world while receiving a life free of unhappiness.

How To Give God The Gift of Joy

When God began giving us the God Gift, he gave us a method. The method is simple. Let your heart be filled with joy all day, every day. Every single day.

The key to giving God the God Gift is giving what God wants you to give. God expects a great deal from you â€” more than you can imagine.

As a way to help you give God the God Gift more often (and with greater joy), I gave together with Dr. David A. Paredes how to give God the gift of joy.
