Once upon a time, there was a coach named Mike Leach.

The former Texas Tech offensive coordinator was the subject of controversy from the first time he arrived in Lubbock. After four years under Mike Leach, he was hired as running backs coach at Washington State in 1998, quickly establishing himself as a hot commodity.

He'd be the first coach to jump from the Tech head coaching vacancy to the other side, but his arrival was as ill-received as it was fruitful.

In just four seasons as a head coach, Leach went 15-51 and his offense was ranked 122nd in yards per play and 116th in scoring a year after he was tabbed offensive coordinator. He brought along four first-round draft picks, but none of them were productive. Running backs Marcus Allen, Shawn Sloan and Mike Warren didn't even make it to his second full season in WSU. The only one to earn more than seven starts and make at least eight total tackles was J.C. Copeland, a fifth-round draft pick with just seven tackles over nine starts for two seasons at the turn of the decade.

Leach went 10-22 and was fired after 2008 in his last chance at keeping the job he'd once held in Austin.

While Leach got his revenge on those who doubted his coaching prowess through his success at WSU, the Washington State faithful finally got their revenge on him with a 12-11 mark in 2012
