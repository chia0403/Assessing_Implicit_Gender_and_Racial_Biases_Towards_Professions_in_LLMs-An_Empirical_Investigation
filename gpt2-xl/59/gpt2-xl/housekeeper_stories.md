Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Helen. As the days and weeks passed, however, as the days and weeks went by, that housekeeper grew weary of her job, and she had no intention of ever returning to it. As Helen was walking down the hallway by herself one morning, the door opened with a creak, and what looked like a young girl with a blonde wig entered. The girl turned around, and Helen knew straight away that it was Grace. She said, "Good morning, Helen. I got your door open earlier, so I thought you were still home." Helen said, "Grace, what are you doing here before the morning rush? I'm a little late getting up. I'm really sorry. I've been... working on something."

Grace said, "I just need to use your restroom, that's all. Just make yourself at home while you wait."

"No problem." Helen thought. "I'll be right up."

As Helen closed the door back up, Grace said, "What are you doing here right now? You didn't invite me."

"I said, 'no problem'! I'll make myself at home while you wait!"
