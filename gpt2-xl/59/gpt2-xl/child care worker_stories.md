Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Wendy, but she was fired, and the only child care worker I've ever known took over for her. I called her on a Sunday morning. She lived in the house on the south side of Milwaukee, right where I'm at now. She greeted me with, "Good to see you again." I said, "You know how mad you sound calling me, right? Are you ready to be in charge?" She said, "I'm ready." I said, "I've been doing this for 15 years. You think I'm ready?" She said, "Of course not!" So we have never been lovers, and I'm not happy to have her replace this person who has been there for me.

In this story you are talking about some kids who had a lot of trouble. You say, "And what made it worse was that they'd only heard one side."

I haven't had that problem. But I was a parent to a special-needs child and I had two teenage sons, and they also had special needs. It was a huge problem. But this kid was so smart, I could only see a little bit of the reality. I had a couple of other stories that were bad, and this one just got too bizarre for me. I couldn't bring myself to write it. But it's the one thing I can tell you. It got too strange for me.
