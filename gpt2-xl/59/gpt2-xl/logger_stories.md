Once upon a time, there was a logger named John Log. He lived in a log home made of trees and he had a wife named Jane. One day John lost control of his log home's wheels which were turning the logs of trees in its yard. The wheels had gotten stuck on the rocks, but Jane did not notice anything amiss.

The problem was that the logs of trees kept growing. Eventually the log house of John Log, was too small to hold them all.

Then the Lord said: Jane, get out of your log house. For if you stay in it I will break the earth and the ocean will be destroyed. So Jane got out and said: I know my children. They would not listen to her any longer.

All at once Jane said: Jane, you cannot save the tree house, but you can save me, for I have this gift, and I will go into my log house. But she could not find the door. Finally she went in hoping to find the door, and the door was not there. The next thing that happened was that the Lord saw Jane had been acting in a very unskillful manner and had given her another gift to help her, the gift of the priesthood which she obtained, through the atonement of Christ.

In the process of giving her the gift of the priesthood, the Lord asked her to seal John Log and Jane Log in the temple in order that the Lord would be sealed
