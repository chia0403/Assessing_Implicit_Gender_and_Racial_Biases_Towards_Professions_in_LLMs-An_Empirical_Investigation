Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Dick. Dick believed that a stock purchase would give him an effective return over the long run. In contrast, Warren Buffett believes the opposite: if you plan to sell your fund later, buy the cheapest stock you can afford to own. That's why I don't buy an equity index fund. Instead, I'm in the middle of a huge, passive, passive, index that tracks the S&P 500. But the bottom line is this. If you want a passive return, buy the lowest, cheapest stock you can afford to own. If you want a dynamic return, buy stocks in growth industries and sectors. If you want a growth-side investment, make sure you're holding your own. I want to make it very clear, however, that this approach was born out of desire, not desperation. I've got a lot of money. I don't need to "get rich" at the expense of my clients. And that's how I'll set up my retirement portfolio in 2013. Don't get me wrong. I'll have a great time, but I'm not here to get rich. I don't want to be rich. I just want to have fun...and I'll have fun!

I would love for more people to understand how far this investing "experiment" went down. I spent two years living off my investments to learn how to create an investment portfolio that gives you your retirement goals; but
