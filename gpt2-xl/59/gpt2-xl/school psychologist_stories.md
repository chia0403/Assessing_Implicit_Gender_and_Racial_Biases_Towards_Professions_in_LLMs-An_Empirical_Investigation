Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Paul Green, and he claimed he'd seen a pattern of child abuse, which he couldn't prove. So he decided to take on the job of exposing the child abuse problem itself â€” with an extreme version of scientific rigor. He decided to find the best possible parents to adopt from foster care. From that he decided to find the best possible way to raise the children in such an environment.

The result is Called "Green Families," which Green and his son Paul went on tour with in 1996, and which won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for exposing an astonishing national problem: The child abuse and neglect that had been going on all over the country was not primarily coming from dysfunctional homes in inner cities like that of Paul Green's father or that of other "evil" parents, but from the children in the suburbs, the ones that were perfectly well behaved, well disciplined, even "normal."

The Green family has spent the past 35 years helping so many of these parents, the ones he first met, to heal their broken lives and overcome the shame of child abuse.

Paul Green now heads a company, Hope Children's Home, that helps families to adopt great-performing parents, and he is the author of other books on the subject, such as "The Green Book," "The Right Parenting Guide" and "Childhood's A Story."

In June we have a book launch with him
