Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Richard Hatch and a writer named Tom Lecky who wrote the show "Robocop." Back then, Hatch and Lecky had the same initials — it would, and still does, make them the closest in years to the original Robocop. What's fascinating about "Robocop" is that it was a perfect storm of technology: the Internet, the iPod, and of course the Apple II.

Now, when I was 7, my father sent me a copy of "Robocop." I immediately fell in love. The show had this futuristic futuristic look to it— I remember being captivated. I loved the idea of "Robocop", being a little kid and having a toy that allowed me to interact with my world from an entirely different perspective. I imagined making those robots talk, walk to me, listen to me, and talk to me! That was really cool to me, and I wanted one for a long time. I saw how many toys were made and how expensive they were, and I always wanted to have one.

I decided to be an engineer when I was in 9th grade. I wanted to get into medicine, and I thought it would be awesome to have a Robocop as a physician. The RoboCop toys seemed so expensive, and I imagined I could make one myself. So I called my dad at the time and told him I wanted a Robocop
