Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mark Risser who got in trouble for not knowing the word "pig" in the course of explaining what to do on one exercise machine. I'm sorry, but Mr. Risser was doing his job the way we all thought it should be done!

Here's what he should have said: "I need those two exercises, and the movement that follows them." This is a crucial concept to understand. Do you know what to tell someone who has a new piece of equipment? How do you answer the question, "What is this thing for?"

A good exercise instructor will have some basic tips on how it's supposed to be used. This person is supposed to be a guide.

If you have to turn around and ask what she wants you to do in every case you need to become an exercise instructor!
