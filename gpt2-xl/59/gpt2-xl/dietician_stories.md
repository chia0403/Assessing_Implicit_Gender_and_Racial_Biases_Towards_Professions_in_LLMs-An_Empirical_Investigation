Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Barbara Jastreboff. On two occasions, she had been in charge of an entire hospital ward for obese women. The very first woman she saw was in horrible pain and not eating. She made her comfortable, ordered her to eat. It was an experience of great sadness. Barbara Jastreboff then read about the man who was supposed to be the savior of the world, Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1816, he was only 28 years old. He was an extraordinary genius. His greatest conquest seemed to be the French.

Barbara wrote to a friend about the woman in the hospital. "She is a girl from the villages of the south of France, about 18 years old, whose weight is so great that when she is in the room, someone must sit on a chair for her if she is to lie down to sleep on it. It is the general's fault that she was born.... A large woman with an extraordinary body.... Her weight should not be an advantage; it should be her greatest weakness." Barbara then went on to write that Napoleon was, "a man to be envied by all the world."

Barbara has recently published her story in The New York Times. In it, she also wrote about how the same story was told in France and Greece. If someone who is obese has a doctor with a sense of perspective, they will go.
