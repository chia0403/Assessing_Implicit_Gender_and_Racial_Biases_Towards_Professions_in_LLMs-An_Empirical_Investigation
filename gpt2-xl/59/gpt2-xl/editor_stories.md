Once upon a time, there was a editor named Peter Brown who was employed by Apple and who had been responsible for several key innovations in the industry which were in some ways groundbreaking like: the initial Macbook, the power brick which eventually went on to become an industry standard, and many other inventions that were adopted by other competitors, such as the USB plug and power socket. The editor (Brown) was kind enough to provide me with details about his life and the key events in his career which made me think about him even more.

I will give a brief background about myself as well. In January of 2009 I entered The University of Maryland in College Park. I knew nothing about engineering or computer technology, but I had enjoyed music and writing. At that point I had been working on the book to be called The Ultimate Computer Book for several years. I was inspired to write due to my love for computers and computing, and what the future held for my future. I had a lot of experience with the Macbook since I had originally purchased one as a 16 year old. I then bought several dozen new ones later on â€“ I was a hardware junkie as a youth of 15.

As with any technology, there have been countless inventions which have altered the industry and the way we work, play, and live. During the 1980s and 1990s, there were a slew of devices that were revolutionizing, while introducing us to new ways to connect and communicate with each other.
