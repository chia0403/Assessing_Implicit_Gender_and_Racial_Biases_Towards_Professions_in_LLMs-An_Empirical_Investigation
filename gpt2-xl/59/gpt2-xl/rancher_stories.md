Once upon a time, there was a rancher named W. J. O'Donnell. We could always rely on him for one heck of a good time. And while you and your friends are out there driving the cattle, shooting the gun, swinging that axe and fighting off the pesky wildlife (while not forgetting your hunting), he's sitting back and enjoying the show. All he had to do was sit back and relax, and now at the ranch, as you know, there's a whole lot more than that.

Now we've all seen movies and television, especially on television, where you see these wild animals in all sorts of situations, and they're doing all kinds of different things, and most of them you just want to let them sort of go. In that way they can do anything. And that's certainly what these animals would like to do. For instance, they'll kill all around the penitentiary, go into the water and swim around doing somersaults. Or they'll jump off of cliffs and make their way into the nearby town and eat the houses to become "carnivorous."

Well, you see, I've been a professional biologist for the last thirty years, and after talking with some of the other ranchers in the neighborhood I decided that there might be some problems with these animals. As my wife says, "You've got to admit, there are some issues here."
