Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Sarah. But since the birth of her third child, Sarah decided to change careersâ€”and, as a result, found herself in over her head. She tried doing it all herself, but that wasn't really her style; she wanted someone to help her bring new life to her clients. Now she works at a salon called The Spa to cater to cosmetology professionals. Cosmina wants to join the staff and prove she deserves to be there. She's the only candidate, and after months of hard work, Sarah just might get to keep her dream job at The Spa.
