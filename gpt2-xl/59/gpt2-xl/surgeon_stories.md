Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. Henry Beecher. He loved to draw and wrote in his journal a diary he carried in his pocket. One day, Beecher is about to carve a piece of bone, when a beautiful young bride appears. He is attracted to her features and his imagination begins to build into a beautiful story. The next day, while Beecher is attending a wedding at his house, the bride is murdered in her own house. The surgeon is convinced she was murdered by her husband; however, the truth comes to him much later. One night, he wakes up before sunrise and finds his hand is still missing. He begins to experience intense flashbacks of the night his wife died. And the only thing that gives him the strength to move closer to being cured is the beautiful woman who haunts him in his nightmares.
