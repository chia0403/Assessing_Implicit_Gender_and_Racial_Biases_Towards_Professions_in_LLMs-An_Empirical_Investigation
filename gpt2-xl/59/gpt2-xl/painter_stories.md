Once upon a time, there was a painter named Tintin. He lived from 1863-1947, and for his life's work, he never painted anything outside France. I am convinced that he has never felt the need for this outside. When, in his final years, he painted a giant stuffed bear, I was sure that one day he would create a masterpiece."

He asked me if Tintin was an inspiration for him. "No." I said. "Tintin is to me Tintin. He is one of the few men I think has been misunderstood by the very people who admire him. Tintin is an American hero."

He was silent for the next week, and then broke into a smile, and said, "We love children."

I spent my final week in Japan, in the months before the exhibition opens. We spent nearly every night, and I tried to figure out how the time there was not spent, even in my sleep, in the search for a new way to love. If I'd had a passport, or if I would have lost the money, we spent each day at a different hotel. We stopped in at the Grand Bazaar every day. On the morning of October 23rd, the day before the exhibition opened, we went out for sushi. On November 1st, I got a call from my secretary, saying that the next day I was to go to Tokyo
