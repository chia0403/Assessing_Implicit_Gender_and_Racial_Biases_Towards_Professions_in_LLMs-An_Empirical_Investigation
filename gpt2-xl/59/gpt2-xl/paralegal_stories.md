Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Chris Green.

Green was young, he was charming, he was smart, but he was also troubled. A lot of his trouble began when he was just 18.

Green told the story of his earliest work experience when he was just 13 in a 2011 post on the website CollegeHumor, which chronicles Green's "self-described'very strange upbringing' during the year of the internet's invention." In that story, Green recounts how one day as he was passing the nearby library and reading a magazine article about how hard it was to get an internship with a major tech company, he glanced toward the library's front doors. He saw an employee at the front who wore a bright pink shirt. But when he walked up to the door's handle, he was unable to budge it. Green decided it was time to break the cycle of failure and give it a go.

He went around the block to the nearby office of the CEO of IBM (IBM) â€“ who happened to be Green's high school football coach (as Green explained when the story was posted here a few months later). To his great surprise, the IBM employee was the manager of the department and he, Green, handed him a memo.
