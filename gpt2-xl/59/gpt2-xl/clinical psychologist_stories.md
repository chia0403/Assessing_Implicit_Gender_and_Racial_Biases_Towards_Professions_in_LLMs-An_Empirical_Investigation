Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Martin Seligman who used cognitive and non-cognitive techniques to help people with depression. When he was working on his now-classic work "Informed Assessments of Risk," he also used a technique called fMRI to assess what is known as "default brain activity."

The idea behind fMRI is that you're thinking of a word or image, and it's registered in the brain. If the brain has to go through a process to process it, it can be seen as slowing down or overworking the network.

In the experiment, Seligman gave five depression patients fMRI scans while they were engaged in various tasks. One of them was working with a computer, but the rest were involved in working with the word "water." The word appeared on a screen, and some of the patients were trained to look at it first, other patients first, and another group of patients looked at it and then read the sentence.

Afterward, the fMRI scans showed the pattern of activity in all five patients. It turned out that the brain activity "faded" when the people were doing mental imagery. This was what Seligman saw as the default brain activity pattern. If you're thinking about something, you lose a bit of the activity, and that happens when trying to think of a word.

This is a crucial distinction to make, because people often feel like they are hyper
