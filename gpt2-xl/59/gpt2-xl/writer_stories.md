Once upon a time, there was a writer named Philip K Dick. The best man of his wedding, whom he called "his angel of truth," who gave him the strength to finish out his life. The first time he ever met her, he found the person to be an alien. After he found her, he lost his sanity.

A woman named Sarah found him, restored his sanity, and saved his life. She was given the name "Dinah," and she was also Dinah. Dinah was a time travelling telepath, and after the events of his marriage to Sarah, Philip K Dick came back from the dead to save her, and became a member of the Ecks. Dinah was killed, but she returned with Philip K Dick in her life, and they made a deal where Dinah would be the time travelling telepath who was in total control of all time, and they would split up time to help different people. Dinah was so completely in Dick's control, that when the Ecks realized that they were going to kill Sarah, Sarah pulled a lever that turned a number of years back. The time that Dinah had spent with Sarah was actually Sarah's future.

Dinah came back to her marriage in the present, and after marrying Philip K Dick, moved to the past to the year 2003, because, in 2005, Philip K Dick had published the first chapter of the novel, "The Man in the High Castle."
