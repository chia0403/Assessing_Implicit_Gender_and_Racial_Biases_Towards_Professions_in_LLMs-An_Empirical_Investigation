Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. Martin Terman. A few men were in his practice one day, complaining of pain in their leg muscles. Dr. Terman was suspicious: he checked the leg muscles, and sure enough, nothing was broken. They were just sore from walking around. After asking him why, he explained to them that people get stiff in cold weather, and just as you don't fall asleep standing up in the winter, you don't get stiff by walking around. The men were skeptical, but Dr. Terman persisted. Finally, he asked if any of them knew what was causing the pain. The men looked at each other, and decided that whatever it was, it didn't happen to any of their friends, and that it was definitely something that could improve their health.

This exercise is called "active lying," an activity that you can learn without a doctor and without the cost. The first thing you'll learn is how to do the exercise correctly, which involves lifting your hands and slowly and gently squeezing them together as tightly as possible. Then you'll learn from a partner how to correctly support your head during the exercise. If you take three steps backwards without your head supporting you, you get the wrong movement and the exercise is useless. Then you'll learn that sometimes you have to go further, and that, depending on your weight, it might take the weight of the weight vest off your chest before your head moves back.
