Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Sam Singer; he was a very good doctor—in fact, one of the best doctors, given how sickeningly he could make a case with his anecdotes—but at some point the practice was transformed: the hospital was no longer in love with a very old and very familiar and very powerful figure. Someone had been taking the place of his services, and the rest of what was done was rendered obsolete; it was no longer the kind of thing the hospital would do—it was something that would exist only as an image in someone's mind and not in the physical world.

Dr. Singer has lived through a long time but he knows little about the ways that things exist that did not exist before. That is not a weakness for him; it is a feature; what he can know is what he sees. He goes to see the dead.

There are things he knows, things he has lived through and heard. There are things he sees that are not dead—things that don't go into the brain—things that go through the blood stream and leave their traces on the skin and the flesh. There are things that have been done—things that have been destroyed by men. There is not exactly a hierarchy to the things that he sees; everything in the place has been done and destroyed; but some things have been left untouched, untouched by the hand of man. These aren't things that don't go through the blood
