Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named David.

David's job was to comb David's hair at each appointment. As the hairdresser was a very busy person she always called upon David and asked him if he needs any more help.

David explained to her that it wasn't that bad and that the woman called on him daily so he felt she was only looking out for her.

When David's mother was told that, her face turned from a neutral one back to pure rage.

"I am calling it "worse than the time my cat died" to her. You can have my son – any time you want."

"I can't hear the language you're using. Just say that again." (David)

"David, I don't need help from YOU!"

"My wife and daughter will be very happy."

"You ARE the only thing that's going to make them happy. You're the reason David has had to live with you!" Mrs. Barlow said.

"I don't know what you call that – "

"That was David's mom talking! You just laughed because you knew he couldn't understand her. Just listen!"

"She just told you to get out of my house just because she feels better that way! I just think you're making it worse! I told you I've been a bad housekeeper! YOU
