Once upon a time, there was a guard named Kriegling who, when not getting drunk or spending time on a pub crawl, enjoyed wandering around the city and listening to stories from the citizens. Kriegling is one of the main characters of Deus Ex: Human Revolution and played a major role in the plot of the game. It has been speculated that he probably died at some point, but as of Deus Ex: Human Revolution 2, there is even stronger evidence to suggest his death was not caused by the ED-209 and Adam Jensen.
