Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Robert D. Thiele... He was a very pleasant old gentleman who thought he had cured himself of paralysis, as he knew of some ancient cure which was to cure anything. Dr. Thiele was in earnest as he spoke fervently and sincerely of his discoveries and in explaining his discovery told me I must never tell anybody about it or I might get very ill. Dr. Thiele treated me with this cure but once a year for only one year, and that time only, because he had a great deal to say to everybody and he knew it would be a great comfort to all of us to know of his great discovery, but he did not want to give my father the great pleasure. I was then thirteen years old when I obtained the cure. All I told Mr. Spaulding was what he had told Dr. Thiele, and he thought it was all very interesting. He was always in a crowd and always had people around him who wanted to talk and he was extremely polite and talkative. He was a very likable man and I shall always think of him and of his cure, with respect and admiration. He died a few years ago and was so much in the habit of his own thoughts that I never was able to get to see him. Some of his friends told me that he had been dead for years and I have had a feeling of some kind that I had seen him,
