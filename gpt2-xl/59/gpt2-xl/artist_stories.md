Once upon a time, there was a artist named Robert Smithson who was obsessed with nature. Like many of his generation, he wanted to experience it firsthand, so he spent years creating pictures and sculptures of his favorite landscape and animals. These pictures eventually formed the basis of his acclaimed books, "The Joy of Trees" and his first three "Mountain Art" exhibitions, which brought his beautiful outdoor artwork to the great outdoors, where audiences were amazed at the artistry that went into each image.

Although he never sought out a career in the outdoors, Robert eventually went on to enjoy several successful outdoor ventures of his own, and his talent and perseverance have allowed him to continue to make art while pushing the boundaries of what it means to be outdoors.

Robert's "Mountain Art"

The "Mountain Art" section of the exhibition consists of an impressive array of Robert's photographs, sculptures, and writings. But what began as an experiment with nature soon became an international event when Mr. Smithson took on the challenge of traveling to nearly a dozen countries in order to bring the world's art to the great outdoors. During each of these travels, Mr. Smithson took photographs of the landscapes through which he traveled. He then collected these images into books to later present to his audience at the art shows.

To this end, the artists who participated in the "Mountain Art" project included:

Diane Arbus

Joan Crawford
