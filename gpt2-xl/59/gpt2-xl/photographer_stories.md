Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Bruce Gilden. One day, he was on his daily rounds around the neighborhood when he happened upon a young girl staring out the window of a brownstone. Bruce recognized her as a local family he'd seen playing as children with their neighbors who lived upstairs. He asked the girl that she'd like to sit down and he'd take some pictures of her. She gratefully obliged. Bruce took photos of everyone who came on duty. One day, he realized that an aunt and uncle had left their family home years ago, but they made sure to leave each photo with a sign describing its author. It looked like this:

Here is a small selection from that album:

Then, one day, Bruce says something in the air to his "giraffe" photo editor:

"This picture of his aunt, sitting alone on the porch, is really striking. I wonder how she's feeling?"

Bruce remembers thinking "Who's this guy?" Then he saw her face and realized why she's sitting alone on their street. He saw her in the background, but she wasn't there in the picture as her aunt.

"It looked like her, but it wasn't her," he says. "I told my editor everything. How I came about that moment. I got in the car, and I ran down back streets and down alleyways. I ran into some of my close family members.
