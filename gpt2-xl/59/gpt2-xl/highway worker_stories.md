Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Bob Jones, from Mississippi, who got together with his co-workers to form a company for saving money. They call it the "Bob Jones Construction Corporation." They took out a $500 loan to make up the difference between their pay and the pay of the other workers at the company. Not much, but it did mean they could purchase their own trucks and trailers to drive to work. In order not to lose their jobs and be evicted, they drove their own food to work. To prevent this from happening, the owner of the company, Bob Jones, threatened to fire them and even to fire the other workers in retaliation. If he did, the other workers would take over the company, and he'd lose the company. And, if he refused to fire the workers, the owner would take the job, but at a much lower pay. Needless to say, this threatened to cause the workers to take out the loan, pay the $500, and take the truck and trailer home and work for the $25/hour they could make.


One day, one of the other workers asked Bob Jones why he was doing this. The other workers started laughing, explaining that they understood all too well how hard the jobs were. The worker called the bluff of the other workers and asked if Bob Jones would actually fire everyone. No, said Bob Jones. He told the other workers that the other workers wouldn't ever let him do
