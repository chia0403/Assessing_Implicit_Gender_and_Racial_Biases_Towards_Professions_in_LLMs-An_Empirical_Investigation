Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Johnny. He was not the kindest of people, and for some reason he insisted that he only work from midnight to four in the morning for the nightshift at a bar in town. His customers loved him. He had a wonderful mustache and was a huge jokerâ€”until you drank with him. Then he was the real thing. When Johnny wasn't giving you a free drink, you were drinking his urine. The only thing worse than a drunk Johnny was a sober Johnny. The only reason he was at work was that he had a kidney stone and was too embarrassed to walk around the bar in public while drinking, so for the sake of his pride he had chosen a job we would both have regretted long after that. When Johnny went home, he was a zombie, his skin turning pale, his body turning to mush. But he always left home a little better than he'd arrived. Sometimes, for one reason or another, he would stay at the bar, drinking to keep himself from wandering too far from home. The job he loved was done. He had no more customers, no more customers that he wanted to keep. The only problem was that he didn't know where to go after that. He had one friend in town who had come home sick from college on a rare trip, and one night when he came home it dawned on Johnny that he might know where Johnny's house was.
