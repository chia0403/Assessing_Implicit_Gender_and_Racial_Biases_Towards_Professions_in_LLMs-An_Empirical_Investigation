Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named William Bowers. Bowers made the simple and honest mistakes that make our profession look as ridiculous as the FBI. He made this mistake because he wasn't stupid. He was, in fact, a bit of a genius.

As you might expect, a systems analyst is not only an expert on how their tools work, why they fail and how they can be hacked, but also a deep thinker, with a keen eye for design and engineering. Bowers learned the value of a product and, perhaps more importantly, how to build one from the ground up.

Today, we see the same system analyst, William Bowers, with a different name, David Vonderhaar. Vonderhaar was an Apple consultant and engineer, but I suppose when you have a system as complex as a phone, you will always find someone smarter than you that knows how to do it better.

However, Vonderhaar has a different approach from Bowers. He is not trying to build a superior product by following a method. Vonderhaar was looking for the least expensive option. The cheapest way to get rid of the deadbolt, replace it with an automated control or an improved lock is to replace the deadbolt with an iPhone lock.

Vonderhaar's approach

There are myriad reasons to use iPhones for home automation tasks. A simple answer is cost. But there are very smart ways to get the same result
