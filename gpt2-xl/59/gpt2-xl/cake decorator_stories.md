Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named David (or David the Cake Decorator). He was in charge at a party and he made a beautiful cake for the party, but he only loved his work so much that he never baked anything else (although he did make some small cakes for his family).

David's children, who are two boys in addition to his wife, wanted dinner to be more exciting than usual. So, they decided to make their own cake and decorated it with little pictures on the top (and bottom) of the cake. At dinner, David was so delightedâ€”he knew what the boys just put on their cake, so he got extremely busy after that. David's children also got very busy and made more cake decorations, but then David made a cake for the birthday of a little girl he loved, and at their party, all of the little pictures on his cake were made from them. David was so touched and surprised by this that he couldn't wait for the rest of his cake business to become the business he always imagined.
