Once upon a time, there was a server named "The One."


It had a reputation.


The One was a very quiet server.


But, for the longest time, nothing could be done about it. Eventually, the people that played the game could get too much and it had to shut down on its own, but even then, it would pop up for a small amount of weeks before it would go offline again.


So, there are two things you can do to have the servers closed. You can do it yourself, in the manner described here, called "manual shutdown." Or you can use a program and script that will shutdown, automatically.


Both procedures are completely dependent on how well your client can handle the extra resource, bandwidth, and CPU it will require for the server to shut down.


If you want to manually shut down a server, you'll need to open the Properties menu in your client and select the "Services" radio button.


From there, uncheck "Hosting" and check "Disabling on server start." Next on the list, scroll down and check the box for "Allow" to "Prevent clients from connecting." Click "OK."


When complete, the server should no longer appear in the Connections section of your client. If not, double-check your client's resources configuration.


However, in this case, you have already found the only fix.
