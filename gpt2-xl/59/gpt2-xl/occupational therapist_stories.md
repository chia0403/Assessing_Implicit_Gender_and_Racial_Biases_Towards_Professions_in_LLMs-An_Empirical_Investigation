Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Linda Smith. A few years ago, the name became synonymous with something else. "Linda Smith: The Professional Parapsychologist" has just been released by a Los Angeles-based producer, but its star power didn't change: Smith is described here as a "medical psi, psychic healer, and psychic guide [who] helps people to become more alive, more conscious, and more optimistic." Smith has, like most of the films she has starred in, a certain ring of truth to it—she does, after all, use "psychic" and "spiritual" in the same sentence. But the reason why the film's star has suddenly found itself at the center of a controversy involving the New World Order is that even though she apparently has no idea we are talking about her, she is part of one movie—the film that shows us how much her field has changed, and will never truly change.

Smith isn't new to the scene, even as a performer, and it is true that, in the earlier years of her career, she had a reputation for treating people in a very real way. In the film, she calls them "the victims [she sees] every day." Her main line in the film comes when she is about two thirds of the way into this exchange: "We're going to go out of business if this keeps going on. I can't do it any longer."
