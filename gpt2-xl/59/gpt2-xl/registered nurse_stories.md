Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Nancy, who used to write books about helping women through her work as a nurse. She has since passed away. Nancy's work is a great example of how people can love another's work, even more so if you can work through the process yourself. This book is a good source for you to start the process. If you're thinking about starting your own business, or if you already started an online business, I would highly recommend learning a lot from Nancy's books, and the steps she would have taken.

Nancy went around the US talking to companies, trying to get them to pay a monthly fee, to keep the business going and to create a plan for continued growth. You won't believe some of the results of how companies just didn't seem to care that Nancy was talking to them. Here is a sample of a phone conversation Nancy had recently:

Nancy: Hiya. I'm Nancy. I want to talk to you about your business plan, maybe get some ideas.

Company CEO: Hello? What are youâ€¦

Nancy: I want to talk, I do not care if I am at your house or not.

Company CEO: No, I don't care, I have a baby!
