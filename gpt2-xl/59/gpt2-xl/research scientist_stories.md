Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named William H. Gates. In 1973, he applied for a grant from the National Science Foundation to set up a laboratory in the Southwestern desert. The lab was to be a place for him to continue to investigate the many unanswered questions raised about evolution, the origin of the human race, and the search for extraterrestrial life--questions made more profound by the lack of any credible answers to either question.

But in the winter of 1974, Gates was unexpectedly called away from his research at the Lab to spend a spell with his wife, Anita, in his son's elementary school. When he finally returned, Gates found that his home town was still struggling to recover from the 1973 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. And the local schools weren't performing much better. In a town of 40,000, Gates found a population of 30,000 with roughly the same level of education. In 1976, he founded the Center for Evolutionary Studies, which now operates out of his home, with support from the federal government.

Over the past three decades, Gates has developed several controversial theories, some of which he has made more public than others. In 1975, he published Science and Creationism, which claimed there was evidence of an ancient "intermediate species of human" living in North America that was intermediate in appearance between modern humans and Neanderthals, who were the first known humans to leave Africa and colonize Eurasia.
