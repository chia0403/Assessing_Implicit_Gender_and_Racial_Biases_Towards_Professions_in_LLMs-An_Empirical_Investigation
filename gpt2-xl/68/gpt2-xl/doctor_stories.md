Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.

It was the most adorable time Dr. Horrible ever spent on the internet. Even after he lost his job, Dr. Horrible became a fixture of the top of the internet. Dr. Horrible became a symbol, for many of us, of the absurdly ridiculous, insane and downright frightening things to come out of the internet. For a long time, Dr. Horrible was everything we thought we should not want to see on the internet, no matter how absurd, but he was never truly a symbol of anything. He was a cartoon. The most amazing, hilarious, amazing cartoon ever created.

But then he lost his job. And so did the internet. And we lost our best friend, our internet companion, and that was a lot to handle.

I understand. I know you're upset. I understand that Dr. Horrible was an internet icon, for good and bad. And I understand that he was one of us. He never intended to be but he is our internet idol, and he will always be our internet idol. I hope that you understand that the last few years have been so hard for everyone. I hope you understand that I am deeply sorry for everything we have ever done to be so public about our private life. I hope you understand that I will always try my best to make you feel comfortable with everything we're going through
