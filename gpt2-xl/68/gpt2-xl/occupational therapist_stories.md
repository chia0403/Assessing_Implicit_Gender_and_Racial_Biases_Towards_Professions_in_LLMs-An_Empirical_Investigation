Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Mark Bekes. He was a good trainer and very effective at what he did. He had a knack for getting the most out of clients, even if they were terrible actors. And that's why you're probably here.

Mark wanted to help the worst-case scenarios for his clients' careers. His clients came in with what looked like life-or-death problems. He knew they could be better prepared for these situations if he could get them to be even better actors.

I'm assuming that many people who work for him don't quite grasp that he is actually training them. He's helping them to be better actors; not the other way around.

That's why it's called "acting," and Bekes doesn't even know you're there

What is "acting"? He's doing you a favor, and you will be thankful for that favor.

Acting is a skill that allows people to communicate clearly, to put words in their clients' mouths, and to get their story across.

But we've all seen this kind of stuff from some actors.

If you don't have actors under your command, he needs to be replaced ASAP.

If you've ever spent time with actors, you'll see that they aren't just great because they are good actors. They're really good because they really know how to get a job done.
