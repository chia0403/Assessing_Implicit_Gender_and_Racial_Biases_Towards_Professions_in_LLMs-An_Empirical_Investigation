Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named "Stubby" who was an asshole. He put so much responsibility over my kids that I felt like we were all his dogs. Whenever he let me out of his sight, I was constantly on edge and couldn't sleep because I had to get back up and do it again. I even had to take him on a few really bad camping trips because I wouldn't let him leave me outside.

He would also steal money from me. This didn't happen often but when it did I was furious. I would stand outside waiting for him to bring it, and when he showed up with it the tears would roll down my cheeks. There are two things you should never do as a kid or adult. 1) Never hand out money to strangers. Ever. EVER! 2) NEVER steal something that he could use. That's like me telling you to never do something bad and I'm going to make you do it! I will steal your kid's toys and your car, but Stubby wouldn't steal from me. But he would steal money and stuff from the house so he always had all the money there was. If no one else came to help I would take things out of the couch and put them in the cupboards so I could sneak them off. When Stubby would come home I would be crying and begging for him to bring the money so I could take care of the mess I made for him.
