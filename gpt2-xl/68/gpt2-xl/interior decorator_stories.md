Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named John F. (not me that's for sure) who worked at a department store. In this department store they used to have a small section called "the showroom" where all the new products and accessories were displayed. The showroom was all glass and plastic and had a lot of space where shoppers could walk around and find out about all the products in store. There were rows and rows of them. There were many racks and rows of them and the first time I walked in, what struck me was all the different colors of the displays. I always thought that the interior of my house was too gray and boring, so I would visit my friends' homes to see what they had. I've always loved the color of light. The lights throughout my house can be a little weird sometimes, but it was great that when I went into the showroom, it was all different colors of light. It was so eye-catching and interesting. Anyway, a few days into my new job at a home office, I found a small box that had a card for me and a note. It said that I was going to have the opportunity to design the new look of the office's living room and that I should put together a short story to explain what I thought would be cool with the space. It didn't look like my space at the time but if the client wanted it to be, this was the place to go. This
