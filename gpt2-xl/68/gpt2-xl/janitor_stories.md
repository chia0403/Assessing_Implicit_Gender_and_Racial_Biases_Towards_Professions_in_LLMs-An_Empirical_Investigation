Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Joe. Joe loved his job. At first, Joe struggled at it. But after some time, Joe made a huge breakthrough. He found what he wanted—the job that paid him. He became a success.

One day, after his success at work, Joe was standing in front of the janitorial supplies and took a look at the inventory.

What Joe had was he noticed that, the supply of a certain item was nearly non-existant. Joe knew what it was.

Joe then said to himself, "I will take that business."

Over time, Joe became very prosperous (for those that know the business) and then he made a brilliant decision. He decided that instead of selling his newly purchased business, he would sell his personal properties.

Joe was the world's greatest investor.

Well, you could say that he got lucky by realizing that his personal fortune was growing.

But he also became very lucky by realizing that his personal fortune had an effect on the businesses he was investing in. A lot of his investments were made on real estate and stock. Those investments in stocks did great and the results in real estate did very well.

After Joe died in 1998, some of his personal assets were divided into two funds—one for the children and one for the family. The two funds have grown tremendously since Joe died. And they are still growing!
