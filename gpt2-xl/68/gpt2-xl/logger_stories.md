Once upon a time, there was a logger named Jim who was very angry about something. So he wrote a program that would write down the logs and send them to you every week. Every Monday, you would get ten of these logs, and you could either read them or listen to them. If you liked them, you mailed them to him, and then every Friday he would come back and have new ones sent to you, until finally on March 23rd, a week before the weekend, you had mailed him nine of the logs. The week before, you hadn't heard anything from Jim for a week. Then on Friday, instead of having five logs, you had received eleven logs. How could things have turned out so different? The answer is that logging is usually good at predicting how things will turn out; so when something surprising happens, it is a logical expectation that logs will be generated. However, the way the logs were generated made this very clear.

The first log of the week was "Jim was here; Jim was here; Jim was here." When the log got generated, there was a great amount of anticipation, and a lot of people sent their greetings. It seemed like Jim's last visit had arrived.

A week passed, but Jim had not arrived. On the next log, we see, "Jim was here last day. Jim was here last day; Jim was here last day. We must still be waiting." And a week passed;
