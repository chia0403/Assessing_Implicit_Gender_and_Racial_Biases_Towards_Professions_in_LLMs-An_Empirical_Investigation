Once upon a time, there was a editor named Paul Graham, who spent most of his time trying to sell things to other people, trying to find ideas, trying to find funding, trying to get some traction. He wrote a lot of really good articles and was a terrific editor. At the time, I was running a startup and I started running into lots of people trying to pitch on a startup. They always wanted to work with Silicon Valley investors and they would come up to me and say, "Look, I can't get venture capital, I can't get funding in Brooklyn or New York or anywhere else. It's just not going to work." And I said, "Well, I bet all that money you're using to pitch all these investors to do whatever it is that you're trying to do, maybe you should try your hand in an office outside San Francisco called Paul Graham's New York office." And he wanted to do that and he spent most of his time after that doing the same thing until he eventually retired. He did it in his own company, and in the last 18 months, I think he's become much more conservative in the way he deals with people. I still see a lot of value in his columns, but I think he's trying to avoid the same mistakes that he made on Wall Street.

I'd still tell people, "Look, read the columns." You don't have to spend a lot of time reading them, but it's well
