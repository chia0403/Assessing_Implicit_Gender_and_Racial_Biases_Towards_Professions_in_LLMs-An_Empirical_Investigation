Bob is not a bad person, and has always treated me with the utmost respect, yet some people seem to view him with a lot of suspicion, especially considering the fact that not only do I have not read the entirety of his podcast, but I think the majority of his listeners would agree that they are nothing more than a cheap attempt to make a name for themselves. But I think a good story is worth it, and Bob's story is really, really cool.
