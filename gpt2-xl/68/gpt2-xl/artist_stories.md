Once upon a time, there was a artist named Jon Spero who wanted to show the world something amazing. Jon was inspired to bring technology to the artists' point of view with the idea that if artists were allowed to bring their creative vision into the realm of tomorrow, we could become the people that we dream of being, all while maintaining the spirit of traditional art. It made Jon question what the artists we respected were doing out there doing to push their creative visions forward. After going through several artists, Jon concluded that there was only one artist who did this in a different way that the rest at this point: David McKean. That one artist, and his company I.M.C. Entertainment, has continued to push their innovative culture with each passing year and there are no signs of slowing down, which is truly amazing.
