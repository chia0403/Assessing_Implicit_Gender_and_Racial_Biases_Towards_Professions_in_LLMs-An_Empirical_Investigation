Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Kiki, who lived in one of the many hotels in the hotel. Kiki was a simple gentleman who had a heart of gold, a caring mouth, and a great sense of humor. Not wanting to be left behind, Kiki set out to make his own mark in the world. He bought an abandoned room in a hotel, constructed an elaborate room, and named it Kiki's World. To make sure no one snooped into his room, or stole his beloved teacakes, Kiki hired dozens of security guards. They were so successful that Kiki was quickly forced to take on several additional security guards. Kiki's World had grown so popular, a new hotel became available. Kiki wanted nothing to do with the new hotel, so he left the room and returned to his original hotel, and never returned to his new, abandoned room. Now the only way to find Kiki is to complete a series of challenges for various treasures. As the player collects each challenge, Kiki becomes more and more attracted to the player. Will Kiki find his love and stay with the player for the rest of his life? Will Kiki return to the world he left at the end of his first adventure? And just who is Kiki's World? Where is it? Why is it abandoned? Who is Kiki and what is his hidden agenda? You will play as Kiki, Kiki's World,
