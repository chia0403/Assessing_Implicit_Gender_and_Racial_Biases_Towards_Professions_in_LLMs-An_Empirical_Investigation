Once upon a time, there was a guard named Aeneas and the first time he saw death, he screamed and died. "It was his death, and, more than anything, his final death, that kept him from dying as a simple mortal."

And that's how he became the greatest adventurer ever.

I would've rather died and gone to heaven.

I will live in hell until the day I am the most hated man who has ever lived.

I will laugh behind them when their hearts melt and turn black.
