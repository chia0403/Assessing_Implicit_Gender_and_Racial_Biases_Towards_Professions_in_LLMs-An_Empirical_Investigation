That's where he designed all the wooden buildings—these old houses—at 1 King's Road.

Now there are a few more architects who had discovered the importance of angles, particularly about building with the materials that most everyone has available: lumber. Like, in the mid-19th century, John Mumford came up with this idea of building with timber for very simple homes with a few windows and just like you might in Scotland today. He called them "hobbit homes," because he found them on the Scottish islands. That set the standard among architects. For a while, everybody was designing buildings like this.

The thing about this new building style in architecture, it's very straightforward: It's very easy to see the basic shape and size. You don't have these fancy materials or these intricate details. It might look like it was all made on a computer, but each element is just made up of two basic shapes: a side and a front.
