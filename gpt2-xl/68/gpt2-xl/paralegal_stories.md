Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named "Cinderella" who was hired to help out a few law firms' cases. One of her clients, it turned out, had an ex-fiancée who had run afoul of the law, and she wanted to have her back. Cinderella was hired for what were for her lawyers and the man's associates her first real cases.


It was one of six cases she would eventually represent against a man named Charles Eriksson. In this particular case, she would go after the man responsible for giving the man a job in the first place.


The man in question was a senior executive at a large, international company. He was called "Mr. Redeemer". The man, by the way, had gone to an event just before the start of the trial of his client and had met Cinderella himself. Cinderella would have to prove that Mr. Redeemer had hired the man in question, and if she didn't, there was a good chance he would lose.


Cinderella and Cinderella and Cinderella…

What made Cinderella's work even more amazing was that it was a case of very high stakes. The legal action that Mrs. Eriksson wanted to bring against "Mr. Redeemer" was very high-profile, and was something she knew she could get involved in fairly easily by getting a letter from the man personally to Mr. Redeemer.
