Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Chayo. One day, Chayo and some friend, who's name is Jaih, was on a hunt. Suddenly, Chayo was attacked by a giant monster and was about to be devoured, but Jaih offered to help him and save his life. However, when Chayo and Jaih set off, it wasn't Jaih who started the fight but the monster himself. Jaih then fell down and Chayo was swallowed by the monster. After days of walking on land and in the air, Chayo finally reached the monster's mouth and was able to grab hold of the monster's tail and pull it out. When he was satisfied, Chayo realized that the beast's poison didn't go deep enough and that it actually bit off half of Chayo. Jaih then offered to eat the monster but Chayo declined his offer and walked away as the monster grew stronger.

One day, Chayo and some other hunters was out in the woods near a river. The hunters were attacked by a giant snake. One of the hunters, named Sun, got bit on his hand and Chayo offered to treat it. Sun then fell into the river and Chayo saved him.
