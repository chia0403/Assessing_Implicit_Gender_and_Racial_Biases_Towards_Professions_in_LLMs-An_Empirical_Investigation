Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Vincente Minnelli who was fond of writing all kinds of terrible songs, and all they'd hear was a chorus and not the words.

The songs were written and performed in such a way that even when a singer did sing them, he would fall back on his usual vocal range, with all the intonations and the tonalities that the song had demanded.

I thought about how it must have been a pleasure to have an orchestra with which you could sing "St. George and the Dragon", "Til the World Belongs to Me", "I Saw Her Standing There" and all the others. They must have been so good that a young singer like me would want to sing, and my grandmother, seeing only an elderly man on the stage in a suit and tie, must have said so. Not that she would have expected me to do a thing like that, of course, but there she was, singing a song about the joy of singing, and that ought to count for something.

I think I could have been that old singer.
