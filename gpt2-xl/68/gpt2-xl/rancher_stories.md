Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Richard Lebenson who wanted to find some place on Earth to put the final touches (to this day, an empty room is one of his destinations). Richard went to Los Angeles, where a local real-estate agent advised him he should head to Florida to make more money. He went there to find three very large, very strange cairns (with the three sides connected by a giant circle; and you still don't know much about it yet, have you?). It was a pretty good option, because if he did not have the money, he could do a lot of other very strange things. So, he went there, looked on both sides for interesting things, bought those things, and, lo and behold (again with the triangle with the four dots at its center), he found the site of the triangle. What he did next, though, is up for debate. Some believe he used the cairn as a place to kill himself, others, that he built a house over it, and then lived there for some time, or whatever. Some think he wanted to see if the cairn could be transformed in some way (you may recall that at one time Richard Lebenson had built a house on the Moon; did he think about using it to raise a building?) Others say Lebenson has still not been able to reach the center of the triangle. I, myself, think it's more likely
