Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named David. David was a beautiful man that loved his job and wanted to give back to the community. David worked for the town of Pangburn in the years since the great floods of 2010. David would use his own money to give back to the community and other people in need. What would happen is David's wife left him and the people of Pangburn. His town came together and adopted a new name. Pangburn has come together to give back to others now it seems the person who was adopted has left town. David's mother now has to take care of a son that is now at an age where David had no involvement in raising. Pangburn in turn is now looking for his or her son or husband and David will no longer be with the town any more. David will be missed but he loved his job and it wasn't very long ago that he had earned another round of respect from other employees just because of his dedication. David will go to a better place and in the end for David, that is all that matters.
