Once upon a time, there was a barber named Bob. He was a real nice guy but he was in no way a great or even all that good at his job. However, when he heard about one of his good customer's being cut, he decided to become a barber and to make the most of the opportunity. He decided to have a haircut he would call The 'Pineapple-Free' Cut, where he kept the pineapple fruit completely out of the process. He became known as The 'Pineapple-Free'-Barber for his remarkable and bizarre performance, but the real fun was playing with his customers' emotions. If you think that 'Pineapple-Free' is a silly term, you think wrong. People were not always a laughing fit. He never cut a single customer straightaway. Rather, his waitstaff would wait outside for a 'dummy customer' (a dead body, no less), before delivering the'real' client to their waiting spot. Bob's employees would take the dummy customer's photo, run a background check on him like you would do any person (with a fake ID), and place him in place at the barber chair as a result of which, 'pineapple-free' would eventually come to mean being 'cut off' from any pineapple-based beverages during the cut.
