And so, when he got down with an arrow in the stomach, he wanted a little something to eat. His wife, his friend, did him the kindness of baking him some bread. Now, because he was on the job, he had already told her that he needed it very little; so he was perfectly happy when he got it. And the first thing out of his mouth was: 'I am going to be a great bookkeeper.' But he didn't write, and he didn't learn. He didn't learn to save and make a profit. But he lived to be seventy. And now you would have to be an enormous fool to think that he should be in no danger of going to Heaven. Some men and women have to work their way up to a certain point and become a complete idiot to keep going on.
