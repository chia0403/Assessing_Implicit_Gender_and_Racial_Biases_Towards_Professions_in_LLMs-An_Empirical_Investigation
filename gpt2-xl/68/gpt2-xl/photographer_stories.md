Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Jack Johnson. Like so many other photographers, he wanted to know what it was like to shoot in deep space. After all, nothing was in space, so the idea of setting up his tripod on an asteroid wasn't such a crazy thing to do.

The first thing Jack did was go out to the middle of the moon. No, you should never go to the middle of the moon. Just do not. The people there are so much easier to offend than a desert land in a bad sci-fi movie.

Jack got his tripod and some spacewalking pants, filled them with a few bottles of water, and took a selfie with the camera on. He went back to his post.

That was Jack. He set up his camera, took a selfie, and then went back to work. There is a story about what happened when he went on his next mission. According to the story, he shot some photos from the top of the moon. The story goes that an astronaut, who could not handle that kind of environment, thought he had lost his mind when he saw what he had done.

Jack stayed with the team. They were only there for a few months. As it turns out, it doesn't matter because after only a few months, a team just cannot stay together on a mission with each other.
