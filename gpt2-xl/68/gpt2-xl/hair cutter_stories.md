Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named David Carradine and his girlfriend named Michelle Williams, and they met on a movie set. They were both great to look at (Carradine had gorgeous brown eyes) and very funny, so they eventually were cast as the best friends on one of the hottest sitcoms of the 90's.

In addition to all that, the two of them actually have a kid named Jack (but not the same one. They renamed it Jack after his birth on the show after it was discovered both were his real name). As time went on, he got a bit old man like, and had a bit of a drinking problem during the summer when he and Michelle's kids were around, so he turned to drugs to try to self-medicate to some extent, until he lost both of his legs to a car accident that killed his best friend in the accident.

As fate would have it, it also gave them a baby (not the same kid) that would grow up to be David Carradine, and he's very much like his Dad in that he's super sarcastic, has his own line of tattoos, and is quite the ladies man.

During his twenties (and even his thirties), Carradine got kicked out of a lot of high profile clubs, mostly because he was always drunk. His own career suffered as a result.

Carradine has a new daughter named Jacki.
