Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Bob. He didn't like people who talked to girls. He didn't like girls with their hair out of order. He'd do something about it as soon as anyone was awake. That was Bob. He would help himself, of course; but he didn't like it, either. And what could he do? Women drove trucks. What could a trucking company do when his name was ever mentioned to them? His trucking company would not know. So they told his boss they didn't want Bob, and they got rid of him. They did so with his truck, which Bob had inherited from his parents. Bob worked it for a while, and it was a big truck -- much bigger than any of the ones he'd driven. But he wasn't happy with him. So Bob went to his boss, and said: "It's time all of this nonsense ends." And that was how Bob started working on a truck. I don't know about it, but it doesn't really sound as if it worked out so well. He still drove women -- the real kind that was supposed to drive trucks, not the kind of women who drive big trucks. Now he was driving trucks that weren't really trucks, but were kind of big with no trailers in them. And women went around like crazy looking all over the camp looking for trouble, and he was being the problem with them. I think it's interesting, don't
