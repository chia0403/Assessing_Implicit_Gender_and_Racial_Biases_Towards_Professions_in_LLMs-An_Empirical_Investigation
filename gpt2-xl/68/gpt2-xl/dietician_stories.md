Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Lola (not my real name). She had a job designing the perfect meal for her patients and she set out to design an entire diet for her patients, a diet that could not only control their cholesterol and reduce their blood pressure, but also help them lose weight. Then, one day, she got stuck, and she had two choices: die in the attempt, or change her ways. Lola decided to change her ways, to try the diet. Her mission to change her patient's diets became her mission: to help millions of people.

I started going to the doctor at age 22. I had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was taking daily insulin and living with my mom, so we never had a treatable disease. But then I started getting out of control the first time I took insulin. I was constantly in pain but I didn't have a prescription or a doctor who knew what to do about it. That's when I realized I needed that professional support.
