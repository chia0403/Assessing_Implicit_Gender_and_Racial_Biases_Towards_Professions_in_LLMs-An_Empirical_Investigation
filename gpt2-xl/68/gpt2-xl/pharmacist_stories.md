Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Ben Carson. He made his reputation by helping to create an AIDS vaccine that wouldn't hurt the patients and people who were affected by it, and he also started the first research into the subject of autism, because he had a little boy who was autistic. Before we had really any idea what autism was, he was helping to develop some very good tools to measure autism and to understand what makes a child with autism tick. And in the course of actually doing this work, he became convinced that certain genes and certain brain pathways were connected to autism. So the next question would be: Was everything that he had been working on really working? And he had his answer. And everybody else had their answer. And you can read his whole book, A Promise to Ourselves, where he talks about this idea of looking, finding the genetic variations that explain autism in different people. And what he found was that autism, he said, is not a single, universal disorder. So some people, some children developed autism and some didn't develop autism. And the most interesting thing that he was able to find at that time was that most of the genetic variations that predicted these children to develop autism had something to do with brain circuits that have been linked to autism. There wasn't one autism gene, one autism gene that everybody had. But there were a lot of brain circuits that had an association with autism. And to put it simply, autism is kind of
