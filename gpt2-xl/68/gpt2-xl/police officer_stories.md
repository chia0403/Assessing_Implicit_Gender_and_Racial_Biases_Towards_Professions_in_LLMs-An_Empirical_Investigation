Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Bob. Bob did not like cops, not much, but they were his wife's job.

Bob was an average family man, and was never around. Occasionally, he would come home and find his house burned to the ground, and his wife, her brother, and most of his neighbors in their homes with their throats cut and their houses destroyed. This was not just an isolated incident. The fire was started by Bob and her brother, and Bob was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

Bob's family had lived in this house for a century. The house was a mess of charred debris strewn across the floor. His mother, who was in the process of dying of tuberculosis, was buried under the ash. Bob's father, on whose deathbed he had recently found her, still lay dead inside. The roof was gone. Fire extinguishers were useless. Fire trucks were still fighting the fire just a year after the event.

When she found Bob, she found her father. He was on the couch, but his right arm was missing.

The police wanted to arrest Bob for arson. If no one was available to guard their house, the only way they could get rid of the two men was by killing them. As they thought that was a bad idea, they heard a noise that may have been coming from the fire. One of them then looked up.
