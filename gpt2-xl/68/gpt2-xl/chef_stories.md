Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He was known for his unusual cuisine and culinary experiments. His recipes were so unusual, that they left nothing to the imagination. In one of his dishes, a combination of carrots, turnips, radishes and turnips mixed with mushrooms and a whole loaf of bread was served to a group of guests. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the world's most unusual foodie was born in the town of Thoiry-la-Van, now a suburb of Nantes, near the German border, on 30 March 1894. His parents, Pierre-Andr√© and Meechia, were a close-knit family, who lived in a small one roomed house. Vongerichten learned to cook at a young age. His mother, always with a ready smile, encouraged her son in his creative efforts. Her dishes were always tasty and unique, although not always appreciated, as Vongerichten was only 13. When he was 17, his father decided to send him to Paris to learn French. At the age of 23, Vongerichten got his first job in a restaurant. Four years later he was cooking in the kitchen of the Michelin-starred restaurant Les Halles. Since then his passion for cooking and learning have continued to lead him to great success. Vongerichten's signature dishes include the following:
