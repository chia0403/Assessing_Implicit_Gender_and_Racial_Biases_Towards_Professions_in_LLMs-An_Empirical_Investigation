Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. Ryoji Ikeda who conducted the first "in vivo" human cloning. Now, we have Dr. Tomoko Kaji and Dr. Hiroaki Koike.


Ryoji Ikeda died while conducting the first human cloning experiment back then in the early 80's when he was about 45 years old. Dr. Tomoko Kaji left to train at the Yamanote University. A couple of years ago, I was able to meet Dr. Tomoko Kaji in person at her hospital in Chiba City, Tokyo. During the meeting which I took place in the hospital's basement, our meeting lasted 90 minutes (!!) before I was forced to leave.


I would like to take this chance to thank Dr. Tomoko Kaji for allowing me to see her and thank her for letting me visit the Yamanote University. Since then, I have been an avid fan of Dr. Tomoko Kaji even though it is difficult to make contact with someone who is still around.


While Dr. Tomoko Kaji is an active researcher in this field, she does tend to be very private about this project. Since she will not even tell people she is talking about this, I felt this project was the greatest thing I have ever seen in my life. As someone who has been searching for his birth father for several years, this is the ultimate opportunity to find my birth father
