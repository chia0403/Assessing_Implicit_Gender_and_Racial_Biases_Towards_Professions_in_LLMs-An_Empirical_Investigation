Once upon a time, there was a painter named John William Waterhouse. He had a painting of himself that he often, though not always, showed to friends and lovers; it had been done, like all Waterhouse's works, in a single-color, watercolor style. It was a portrait of a young gentleman in a well-trimmed mink coat with his hand behind his head, a hand he used to hold his dog, which he used to poke between his legs to be petted, just like in the painting. It was probably done in the late forties or early fifties. I recall that John Waterhouse, while walking with me in the summer of 1988, commented that a man should not hang a dog on the wall, but a cat could have its portrait on the wall; a mink coat was a very appropriate coat that one could cover with a cat and have a cat portrait. It would have taken someone who knew so little about Waterhouse's art history and had no intention in the least to look up everything in the museum's collection to write that sentence, and it did not happen.
