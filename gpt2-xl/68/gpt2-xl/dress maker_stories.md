Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Cressida's. I'll never forget it, for it was during the late '70's that a number of dresses came to our factory for repair. After examining each one, we determined that Cessida's had a very good reputation in the area. At the time, there had never been a bad dress by our factory, even after 30 years. But in the very latest times, a certain number of owners had experienced problems with their dresses. We found a number of irregularities, and were able to determine the cause of the problems. The culprit was a wire with tiny bumps stuck to the inner corners of the dress. The dress was repaired, and then customers would leave a lot of compliments on the dresses they had purchased. That wire would have been a lot worse if they hadn't realized that it was stuck. The end result, however, was that we ended up with a very special dress, as you can see in one of Cressida's display boxes. The quality, beauty, and finish is simply incomparable. It really is a priceless design work."
