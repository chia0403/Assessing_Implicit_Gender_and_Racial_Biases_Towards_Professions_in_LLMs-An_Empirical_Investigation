Once upon a time, there was a coach named Dave Cawsey. (Oh, Cawsey? I thought he had gone all the way to the edge of a moon! Where was he then, and the next coach after him?) When Cawsey's team played the first round of the NCAA basketball tournament, he had the following to say:

"We need to practice a lot, you guys. We're in the National Championship. I know there are no big dogs in college basketball, but we're supposed to be at the top. I know it might sound silly to you guys, but we need to get you men ready to play. All the teams in the Midwest are on a very similar roll with a lot of players, and I don't know why. I really have no idea, but we've got to prepare you like I'm going to play with you for a really long time. I want you guys to think of me as your mentor. I want to show you how to play. And don't just play, practice, practice. This is not a game. This is your life."

I'm not exactly sure that Cawsey had the name of his "big dog" on his back, but I'm pretty sure that he had the idea that he and everyone else on his team needed to do something about it. Now, I'm guessing that he was thinking about being head coach of a real, live college basketball team in 2008
