Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Mark. One day he gave this very informative presentation about how he was going to be a sales manager as well as a teacher for the day, including his "gimme" sales skills. And then one day, he was just like, "Mark, I don't have anything else planned for today. Could you please just get started at the end of the day? Thanks! Mark."

The salesperson was confused and then proceeded to do the most incredibly boring job ever, which was to move the paper around in front of Mark's face and ask Mark how much he was willing to pay for the product. Of course, Mark was confused. He could see right through the salesperson. Mark was, after all, just like the rest of us. He couldn't understand the salesperson.

But then something really weird and wonderful happened. Mark felt a strange pressure pushing inside of him.

He could feel energy flow through him, a strange type of pressure like he got when drinking his coffee.

And then he realized he hadn't bought anything today.

And then he felt the pressure go away.

But that's not what Mark experienced. What happened was what he would later call 'the feeling of my inner child crying'.

Mark felt his inner child was crying inside of him, telling him he wasn't going to be a salesperson. That he was never going to sell
