Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Dr. Seuss who came into contact with a group of boys who were on a certain type of drug with the following effect. Seuss could not contain his enthusiasm. As a result of this, his book "The Cat in the Hat" was a huge publishing success. If there is any way of using Seuss and his book in the treatment of ADHD and ADD, the best way would be to have the children on a medication given by the doctor/researcher to the children. When I said medication, I did not mean pharmaceutical drugs with side effects of being addictive or giving off a bad mood on top of having to take the medicine. The only way to use this work in the treatment of ADHD & ADD would be to have the children take that medication from a doctor/scholar, who is not involved in drug production. Since you are thinking well that would leave out the drug producers and manufacturers who in turn would have a monopoly on the pills... and also, all drug drugs of any type are manufactured by corporations, whether it be from pharmaceutical or agricultural seed/products, there are no shortage of suppliers.
