Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Tony and a plumber named Bob. They made a living fixing things. Sometimes the work went really well; when you're plumbering under the Big Red Button, it's not a bad thing. But sometimes things didn't go so well. So they turned to Tony's friend Robert for help.

A guy named Bob had made a fortune fixing things. All the customers, it turned out, were faking the good news. Tony wanted a bigger cut of it, so he bought the place and made Bob work for him. That worked pretty well. But things weren't going so well for Tony. One day, Tony was out buying a drill kit. Bob, still working at his job, told him that Bob's new, high-end gas company was doing some new drilling just outside town. One of the drillers was a real showoff, Tony thought, so he made the mistake of chatting with him in the shop. The work was getting boring, and to blow his mind more, the guy turned to Tony and told him the drill was working great. But then he told Tony everything that he needed to know. All his trouble with the town had been a misunderstanding. When one of the gas wells drilled out, it had leaked chemicals into the water supply and the town couldn't afford to pump water anymore. It was a huge accident. A lot of poor people lost their jobs. So it was decided.
