Once upon a time, there was a coach named Barry Briscoe. Barry Briscoe was the head coach of the Buffalo Braves and part of the legendary 1972-73 Bills team that reached back to back Super Bowls and helped put Buffalo back on the football map.

On September 28, 2011, the Bills were set to take on their arch rival in Philadelphia. Philadelphia would be fresh off their bye week and their season was going great, while Buffalo was struggling. That game was set to be a battle of two teams that were in the bottom ten of the league.

On October 2nd, Buffalo scored in the fourth quarter to take the lead and stay in the game. Buffalo was on the doorstep and it looked like they were going to win the game. All of a sudden, something went wrong. Buffalo lost seven of those last eight minutes and never managed to finish off the Steelers until the final seconds of the game. In the end, the Bills lost their 31-28 defeat.

The game started rough as Pittsburgh's defense held Buffalo's two best players of the game in James Lofton and Fred Taylor to just 24 yards on three receptions. The offense was running hard and Fred Taylor and Bruce Smith combined for eight catches for 80 yards. The defense held the Steelers offense to a yard or less on six of the seven drives. The two teams traded field goals at the end of the first quarter and Buffalo led 7-3 at the break.
