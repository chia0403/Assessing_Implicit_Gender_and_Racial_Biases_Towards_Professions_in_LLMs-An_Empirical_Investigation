Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Elma who used to leave her dogs outside for her clients. They would come for a haircut, and when they finished cleaning up, the dogs would return the way they came.

The clients were amazed by her ability to keep her dogs from escaping (she called all the other ones "sausages"), and the salon owners gave her a lot of attention. Elma lived with her family, in an old neighborhood that was still there, and she still kept an eye out for the clients who came in. But the salon owners stopped calling her.

Elma started losing customers and eventually, her mother stepped in and tried to help her out. Elma was sad, because she wasn't able to do it anymore, but she had to think of the other guys who worked that day, and so she gave them the dogs and told them to keep them warm. And they were very happy.

Elma always felt a sort of regret in giving away the dogs. But she felt a sort of duty to get the attention that so many people didn't give her. That was the real problem with society. We have this feeling, "I don't need these things that the people around me have. I don't need that kind of attention." We feel that people are selfish and don't need me and I don't need them.

I think we feel this way because we don't understand what happened
