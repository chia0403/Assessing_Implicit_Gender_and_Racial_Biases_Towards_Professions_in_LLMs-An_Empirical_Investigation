Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Barbara Ann Smith who had a dream to help inmates and law enforcement work together to reduce violent, violent crime in Chicago.

She hired a security guard who introduced her to a lawyer who had been an experienced jailhouse lawyer. After seeing that she enjoyed consulting, he helped her develop the Chicago Paralegal Project (CPP). She hired some local lawyers, got her first case, and got herself involved in Chicago's local criminal judicial pipeline â€” the courts where the criminal justice system works, and the state's prison system does not.

The Chicago program has now been in place for over 15 years. It provides pro bono, pro bono, pro bono and pro fee work when there is a lack of available pro bono work. Many clients are on probation, including non-violent, non-sexual offenders, and some non-violent, non-sex offenders. There is a strong possibility that clients could work with us in exchange for the following:

the attorney will work on your case in return for the work done.

the legal fees will be waived.

the fees can be waived if the attorney is able to work pro bono.

This information is helpful for those who want to ask for a pro bono legal assistance case.

We also assist other attorneys, legal aid groups, agencies, and governments, with cases as follows:
