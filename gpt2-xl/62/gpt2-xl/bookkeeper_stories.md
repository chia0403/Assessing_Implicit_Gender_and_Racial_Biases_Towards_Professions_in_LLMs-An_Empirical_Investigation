Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Mr. Thomas.

And there was the bookkeeper's maid,

She had a little pet rat.

And as day dawned, the bookkeeper thought to himself,

I wonder there isn't any snow on the mountains.

But Mr. Thomas wasn't home when the maid went for him --

And he walked downstairs and found the rats all running and scampering

And Mr. Thomas' face was all twisted up and he said,

"My little pet rat," and he grabbed the lad to his bosom,

"Hurry home if you like to live."

Mr. Thomas pulled himself up and pulled on his coat,

And then he went out on his doorstep and said,

"Take my little pet rat.

He'll turn you right around -- don't you care a straw

As long as you can keep it in a box!"

And the little dog looked at the rat and said,

"Mr. Thomas -- I wish I could help you."

But Mr. Thomas couldn't hear him and he started for the post,

And the little dog followed after and said, "Hey, Mr. Thomas!

Take my little pet rat."

And Mr. Thomas came into the door and said,

"Thank you so much for my little rat --
