Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Bob. He used to work at two big-box retail stores downtown, on the busy main street. He'd go in after lunch to take care of the lights. But not a day passed by where the lights themselves were out. Sometimes the store owner would call the electrician by name -- say, "Bob, they're out, we have all the lights." Occasionally, he would ask him to come in and fix the problem. "Well, Bob," said the store owner, "don't you know that you're never gonna get more work?" And Bob would say "Oh yes, I know. I know that. I'm working here now."

In a few short years, Bob forgot everything he knew. He didn't hear from his colleagues. They never called him. He hadn't seen his own children in years. And he never took his son to work. Then one day -- with the help of his wife, Donna -- he opened a newspaper, and he began reading the headlines. "The Great Recession is Over!" it read, and the story said he could get work as an electrician back in Seattle. "Bob, this is impossible! I'm sure you need some form of insurance."

So he called his insurance company. There were lots of things he could take out, the people on the phone pointed out. But his insurance was worthless. The city of Seattle does not insure your salary
