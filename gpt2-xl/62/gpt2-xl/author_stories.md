Once upon a time, there was a author named Davenport. I think of Davenport not as an author but as a kind of writer, or maybe a character in the story of a writer, or maybe he's a kind of narrator who's telling us the story as it happened in his mind: I don't know. I don't even really care. I just want to read Davenport's stories… (The story of Davenport's life, if you were so inclined, would be as long as a novel… The story's in my head. It's too long to fit in this column…but I think I found the best way to share this one.)
