Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Paul Smith who loved old cinema and the chance for people to be there with him at the end of their journey. He was in favour of taking portraits of those he was photographing as the subjects of his work were not interested in getting their portraits published.

In those days, the industry was quite small and photography was pretty much a niche activity. To make a living out of photography, you needed to be a very, very good photographer who was very, very good at showing the finished product to the public! Paul was quite ambitious and had his own studio. He was a bit of a celebrity in his own right.

Paul was the very first photographer to use a point and shoot camera, and he was able to get his own studio because he wasn't very big on advertising and was quite independent in terms of where he took his own pictures.

He also liked to be able to use his own camera, so he was quite picky about what cameras he used.

He loved to go fishing and was able to go to the seaside for several weeks a year and spend a lot of time photographing the sea.

One day, he took a photograph of a great white shark, and after taking the shot, he was surprised to see the shark actually get up and feed on his shot. It had a wonderful expression on its face and was clearly enjoying his meal.
