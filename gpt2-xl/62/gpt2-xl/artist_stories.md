Once upon a time, there was a artist named David Chippindale. When he was in college at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, he developed an interest in graphic design, and with the help of his parents he started getting freelance work. The work he saw was incredibly diverse, but at its heart it all revolved around a desire to create works that would have a meaning to the people within their work. This led him to create a series of posters, mostly commissioned by other artist, which he would then sell. He would use a variety of means to connect with his audience, from mail-order catalogues to the creation of custom-printed t-shirts. They were all for the benefit of his patrons, who would be the fans of his work.

In 2001, David opened a shop in the city he grew up in, and in 2002 the shop opened up a second location in Los Angeles. It is here that Chippindale began to move away from creating work for fans and fans in return began to produce original art, mostly for his own artworks. Eventually people began to learn about his unique brand of design and began searching for their own David Chippindale. He began to see an increase in clients and, in 2003, opened a new shop just outside of San Diego, where his work is still created.

Chippindale has come a long way since the days when he was a college student and student at UCLA,
