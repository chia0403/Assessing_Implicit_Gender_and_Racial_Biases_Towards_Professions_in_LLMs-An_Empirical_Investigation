Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Lyle Mays (I mean, Lyle Mays, not Lyle Mays). Lyle Mays was just a normal person who had some problems with his life. I don't want to go on a full history of how Lyle Mays got his problems, because I don't ever want to do that. What I will say is Lyle came to the realization that he could not live "as usual". So he started putting in the time and effort to become a better groundskeeper. He started doing all the odd jobs they needed done on their property but was not allowed to do himself, including mowing the lawn and sweeping up afterwards. I won't even try to explain how great he was. Lyle did all the work his dad wanted him to, when they wanted him to. Lyle did not get into any trouble. Lyle came to the same realization. So one day Lyle thought that he'd try to take care of his lawn like his dad would have wanted. But he would not let him. It was just like every other time with Lyle. He had the same problem, and so Lyle came at it a little differently. Lyle thought, "Oh, that's it! This is the problem. I'm going to get even with my dad just by being himself!" and this time, what happened was the other lawnmower got upset at him and drove into the house
