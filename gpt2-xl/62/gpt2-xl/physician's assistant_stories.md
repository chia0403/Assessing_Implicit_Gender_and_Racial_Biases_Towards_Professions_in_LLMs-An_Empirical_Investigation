Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Elizabeth. She was working for Dr. William Thompson, an old army general – one who had once headed the US Army medical division in Germany. He had been in England during World War I; his wife was Japanese, his father was Jewish, and his mother-in-law was Italian. But it was his work with sick and injured US soldiers that landed him a position with Dr. Thompson.

A very odd combination, but on one occasion, an American soldier named Bill Simpson arrived and Thompson asked Elizabeth to administer an injection, and then they waited while the soldier recovered. But as the two men spoke, they noticed something very strange – the injection had caused a slight twitching of the man's hand, causing the hand to become a small dark stain. The needle had entered his hand (he was on the way to a hospital but he got there by walking) and not only had the gun gone off but it also killed the patient. Thompson and Elizabeth were in disbelief.

"I'd never seen anything like it. If you had asked me then what those two men had done, I don't know that it would have made sense. But a few years later, with the benefit of hindsight, it all makes perfect sense. I think the lesson here is not to get involved with needlework – it's certainly not the best course of action if there is a chance something can go wrong." – William Thompson,
