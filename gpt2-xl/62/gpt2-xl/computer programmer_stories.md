Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named John Smith, and his company's computer was capable of performing a variety of useful tricks that had never been accomplished before. The first of these was adding an item to a stack of items that it already had. The items in that stack consisted of numbers and some letters, and the computer could then add one to each of the numbers in order to produce the desired number, but whenever it wanted to add a new number, the computer first had to remove an item that it didn't need, and then it had to add the right number to the stack of items. If the computer had an extra number in its stack, it would remove this number, and then look at the items to see if it had a number in each one, and see that the number could not be subtracted from the stack. If so, it would remove this item from the stack as well; finally, if all the numbers could be subtracted from the stack without any numbers being left behind, it would know that it should stop looking at the stack, add the number to the stack, and then start to add the items. It is important to note that this computer never got confused about which item was going to be added to which item, or which number was added first. It had a specific way of looking at things and following these rules, with zero exceptions.

To understand the next trick, say that John Smith's computer is running on a system
