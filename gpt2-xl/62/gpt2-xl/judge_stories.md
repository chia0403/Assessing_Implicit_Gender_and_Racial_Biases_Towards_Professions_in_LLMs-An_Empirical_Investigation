Once upon a time, there was a judge named William H. Thompson.

His last name was different than most of his colleagues on the 11-judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C., Circuit Court—the court that upheld the Affordable Care Act—because William and his second wife and son weren't white. But to some observers, William Thompson might have become an accidental superstar.

William Thompson was a good judge. But he also happened to be a racial minority, a fact that might have been overlooked. Thompson was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit—one of the federal appeals circuits, and perhaps the most powerful—by President George W. Bush in 2001. By the time he left in 2010, he had become a hero to African-American lawyers and advocacy groups, praised as a symbol of the importance of minority input in the federal bench. In an opinion that Thompson wrote in 2006 regarding the case he ultimately won, he was described on the bench as the "king of the hill" and "an inspiration to all of us."

It was as powerful and celebrated an omen as one might expect from a judge who had recently succeeded in a lawsuit to make a black student's graduation ceremony a final "Oversign" at the school where he had been a student.

But in the course of that 2006 case, Thompson never explicitly noted his race.
