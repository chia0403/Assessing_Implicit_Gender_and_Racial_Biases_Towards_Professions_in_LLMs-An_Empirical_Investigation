Once upon a time, there was a cook named Paul who cooked up an extraordinary chicken. It was delicious, all right, but what made it interesting, he said, was the sauce. He added a pinch of sugar and a little garlic powder, and stirred it all together right in front a flame. And then he cooked it over a campfire. And you think," said Hockney, "Oh, my God! This is one of those rare recipes. He cooked all the ingredients in that one pot. You don't know where this chicken comes from, except that it was cooked in the same place that my mom cooked her fish out of in the summertime. That's it. This chicken really was the product of her imagination. It's just in her history because of her recipe."

What happened to Paul's chicken is a sad story. It was, apparently, sold to a cook in India, who went on to create a chicken-based sauce called "Channa Tika," the very same sauce Hockney serves to the public. No one knows for sure how he or she acquired the recipe for Hockney's recipe. It's probably not something you can sell, or even order somewhere. Hockney has it, though. But it's a great sauce, of the kind that will make your taste buds swoon for a few days.

The sauce, which we think would be on the menu at Hockney's on Central Park
