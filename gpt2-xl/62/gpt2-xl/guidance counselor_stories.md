Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Bill who met me one night when I was doing a tour of the campus building for the College of Engineering. He asked me where I was going next and if I wanted to go to the engineering library. I said I'd like to get some work done for some people and to tell me where to find some stuff I could use. He said some of the other students were looking for books about the engineering department. Of course, this was before anyone on the staff knew about the books. In any event, he led me inside the library and showed me the books he was giving away. Those were old and old-fashioned. To keep them I had to bring them to the library for him to use, then I would take them home and put them away for the other students. The ones he was giving away had long since run out of pages to use so I went to the lab and picked up a few more to put in my pack. When I got to the door to leave, I asked him if it was possible to go through the rest of the books on my own. He said, "Let's wait until you get through with the ones you have to put away when you are finished." That was his way of saying, "You are about halfway through."

When I got back to the dorms a little while later, Bill was waiting for me and said, "I have something to show you." He said
