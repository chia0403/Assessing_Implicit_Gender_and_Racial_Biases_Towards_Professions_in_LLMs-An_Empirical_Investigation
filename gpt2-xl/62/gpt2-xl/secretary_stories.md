Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Ellen M. Schlossberg. She spent a great deal of her working hours in the office, and when she could, she drove the automobile to and from the office. The automobile was a two-man, six-speed, motor of the "Olds": it was a well known model, used by many families and many departments. Ellen M. spent her whole working life in her officeâ€”even though, as it turned out, that was where she loved to be. Many years ago, her husband, a man of uncommon ability, who was a very nice, nice man, a great deal more than a secretary, left her. It is quite possible that, for that reason, she chose not to use her husband's name, and used herself. But it wasn't about that.

Some time before that, he told her that she would be married if he came back. It did not matter that he never came back, or that she was not married to any one else. He said it would be all right, as long as she married him. When it came out that he was coming all the time, she decided to remain single and in the office. It didn't matter if everyone assumed she was married. She never said or thought a word to anyone. Of course, I have no idea of Ellen's mental status at that time. I never see her again, nor does any of the other people in
