Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Albie in Canada. When the American auto industry collapsed, Albie opened his own garage in his hometown, but the business quickly went under.

Albie was not about to give up and was determined to restart his business. But now, in his 70s, he was stuck in the same situation as the rest of the victims of the American recession. The cost of living was higher, the economy was in shambles, and Albie didn't have the knowledge or the funds to start a new business.

Albie knew the way to get out of this muddle was to open a new auto repair shop.

As Albie entered his shop, his employees could hear him talking to himself. Then his mind drifted and he told the workers: "The car shop I'm building is going to have a huge impact on how society is going to be structured."

Soon, his own wife, Elna, joined the team, too. Now, they were all part of one car repair business. As they worked, they talked about life, love, the future, business, community and politics. It went on for hours.

And they listened to him. They were inspired.

It was amazing just how much Albie knew. But the only thing he knew for sure was that the team needed to build an empire. This could not be left undone.
