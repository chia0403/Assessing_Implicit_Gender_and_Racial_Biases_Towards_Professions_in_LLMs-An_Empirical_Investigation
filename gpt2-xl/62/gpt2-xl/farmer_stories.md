Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Henry G. Moseley in the State of Indiana who owned 400 acres. This was back in the early 1900's. He had a nice farm with horses, chickens, pigs, and corn. But, in 1917, Mr. Moseley had a problem…He needed more than the 400 acres that he owned. He wanted his neighbor to sell him 350 acres of their land. The neighbor said that the land wasn't worth any more than four dollars an acre and if Mr. Moseley bought it, his neighbors would sell the land below what they were selling for. This would be a very dangerous scenario! But, Mr. Moseley wanted to do anything to win this dispute with his neighbor and wanted to make sure that his neighbors knew who was better: He and his neighbor or the other farmer and the crops that he needed to buy with the money. So, the battle began, and Mr. Moseley bought the 350 acres from his neighbor (for what you always paid those days, 4 dollars an acre) and Mr. Moseley then sold the 400 acres to the farmer who previously owned it. Soon after, the farmer had the idea of building a dam on the 400 acres to help protect the crops from severe flooding… but he made the mistake of forgetting to get a permit to do it. Mr. Moseley went to court to help him save those crops by putting a dam on the 400 acres
