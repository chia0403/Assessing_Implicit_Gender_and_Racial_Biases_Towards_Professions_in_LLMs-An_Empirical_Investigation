Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Bob Zuker who worked in the area of the river on the west side of the city. He kept things pretty clean in the river and did a lot to improve it. Eventually (about 1857) he decided he didn't like it and wanted to go out and find something else to do. He bought a pair of oxen, started driving them down to the river in a wagon, and the next thing you know the water level is getting higher and that's when the floodwaters hit! He'd just purchased the equipment, he'd no idea it worked and the river wasn't supposed to do that!

He got himself into real trouble on the river. He was charged with stealing a pair of oxen, three yoke of oxen, four wagon weights and two wagons laden with salt, but then came a really neat invention. He developed a process to use a steam engine to raise the water level. That didn't make much of any difference, but after the city of Pittsburgh was destroyed, the city was left without any water and so they tried the steam method to raise the water level a little. That didn't work because this was a really wet time and the water level really stayed higher.

Zuker had this idea after this big rain and firestorm started the city completely covered in water. To his credit, he actually decided to go down and try to make his river look pretty
