Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Lilla Jethro Bode who knew all of your favorite songs and knew a surprising amount about you. She'd read about us in that school paper, and I still can remember writing a letter to her.


Songs:

The Band Played On

The Red Sox SerenADE

Carry On Wayward Son

This Could Be the One

What You've Done to Lola

The Star-Spangled Banner

It's a Boy

The Ballad of Laura and Laura

How Soon Is Now


In a letter which I wrote to Lilla Jethro Bode and sent her way, I gave my opinions of her. I talked about my little sister and how much my life and dreams have changed since my father was in the Air Force. I talked about how she was a beautiful librarian and not a singer. I wanted to say how much I loved her, and how much I hated those who called her a singer. I talked about how much I trusted her.


When she sent me a picture of a librarian and some notes, I was in love -- in love with these beautiful people, and with the love they gave to others.


She was a sweet person who liked to make friends. She was so nice and so kind and smart. She was smart because her father, who was a librarian, went to university
