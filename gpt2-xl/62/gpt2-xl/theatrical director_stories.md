Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Michael Cohan. He was a wonderful guy, whose dream job was to take his son to Broadway, and make him become a Broadway actor — but when Michael Cohan took his son there for his first public performance, the director pulled him aside and tried to get him to reconsider. He said it was too hard to deal with, having a character like that around all the time.


And Michael Cohan decided to not take his son, despite all the good fortune and the great opportunities that would have awaited him if he had.


And Michael Cohan didn't think it would be too hard, either. He had seen it before — but he'd also seen the same thing happen to other people in different ways. I believe Michael Cohan's son, at the point where he was starting to get an insight into his father's world, thought it might not be just a job — but actually something he would be quite proud of, and something good he could work on. And when he didn't get the role that he had wanted, he couldn't do anything about it; so he moved on, and eventually, got a better job.


And, as that director who helped mold this young actor who needed a change, who needed something to aspire to, something better, was now gone, Michael Cohan was left alone, and a little older, and a little wiser, and with a lot to live up
