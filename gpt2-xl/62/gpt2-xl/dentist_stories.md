Once upon a time, there was a dentist named John Doe. You see, he was an average guy with a few quirks, but he was also a good friend and partner of a girl named Jane Doe. But at some point, things started to change in their relationship and now John and Jane were no longer partners but were sleeping in separate rooms at the same house. However, John still loved Jane, and so he decided to pay her the ultimate compliment and let her stay with him in his bedroomâ€”which was completely bare.


Well, John and Jane didn't want people to know that they were living like this, however, they found that it became quite popular among the male population. They started to realize that people were checking it out, and thus they went out with a bang by hiring a photographer named Jameson and showing off his pictures of John and Jane's home to all the men who passed by. The photos got so popular that the next day, it spread to the womenfolk as well. Soon the whole city wanted to see what John and Jane's bedroom looked like.


Then things got a little awkward though.


After four months of living like this, John and Jane decided to just make ends meet and move again. After that, they began a new life and the room which they used in their house became one of their favorite places to stay.


We will always be grateful to our dear friends from the DOUBLE LIFE! and all the
