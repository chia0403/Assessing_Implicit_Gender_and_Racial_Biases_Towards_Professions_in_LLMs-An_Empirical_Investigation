Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Cicely Saunders that was known for her creative flair. She was talented but she was also fussy. She hated embroidery and felt all lace was awful and unromantic. She insisted on keeping her work simple and keeping her studio in a small room in a dark room. Her work was often based on a traditional pattern with a contemporary twist. While it was easy to appreciate the beautiful designs, Cicely refused to let the traditional dress business bleed into her more personal businesses. Her "traditional" business is still ongoing but she has made some modern-day additions to her business that include a shop, a boutique, a clothing line and also a new venture where she will be creating custom knitwear.

If you're a fashionista, you probably have the basic knowledge of lace. If you're not sure where to start, Cicely Saunders' beautiful hand-beaded and hand-woven lace sets are a wonderful place to start and there is a whole collection of lace sets available on Etsy. Also, it makes great gifts and a dress can be custom made, so there is something else you can make for everyone!
