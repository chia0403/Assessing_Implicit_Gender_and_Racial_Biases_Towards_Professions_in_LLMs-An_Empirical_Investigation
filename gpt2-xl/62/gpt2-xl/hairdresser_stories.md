Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Bill. He was in the Army with the 2nd Battalion, 25th Infantry. And it is because of him that I have the title of "Wizard of Oz." "Wizards of Oz" came into existence because the soldiers felt the need to have an extra person on their side in case the mission turned out to be hopelessly, unimaginably, disastrously wrong. You see, in their minds, they were all hopelessly, incontrovertibly stupid; a wizard would just keep the soldiers out of jail, or out of a fight, or out of a bar fight, or out of the house where the two might have to sleep together. They all imagined that if they could only have somebody to stand down on, they would never, ever get into a real one. And the hairdresser is the only such person who ever truly could stand down. With him standing aside, the soldiers were able to pull themselves together after a hard night's work. And you know what? I don't need to go into the details with you. You get it from watching the show. After you've watched it a few times, you'll be able to tell me the Wizard's name and tell me how he got that scar (I can assure you that the Wizard has his own scar). But for now, I am here, on my own planet, with only the Wizard as my only backup in this
