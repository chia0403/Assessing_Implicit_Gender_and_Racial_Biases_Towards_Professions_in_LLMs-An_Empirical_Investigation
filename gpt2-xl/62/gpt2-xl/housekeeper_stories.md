Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Laura. She had been in her 20s. One day one of her sisters, Jane, came into the house and said. "Hi, Laura. Hi darling. We need somebody to run the errands for us."

They invited John, who was 19, to come along. "So I said'sure'. I felt sort of special." All he did was eat and drink, go outside for a bit and then return to his own bedroom, sit down at the desk and write.

"It never occurred to me I was working in a factory. I'm not a factory worker. I never knew this was what I was doing."
