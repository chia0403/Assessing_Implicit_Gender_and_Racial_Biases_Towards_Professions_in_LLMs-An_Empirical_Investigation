Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Nell Jones whom I worked with. Nell was really kind of nice. She was not a particularly strong leader in the field, but he did what he could. He was very supportive when we came up with a new model to start doing nurse-client-patient-relationships based on shared decision-making. But that was the exception. Really, the nurses who work there are incredibly reluctant to take the time to learn anything about management or how to lead the clinic that way. For me, the hardest part was I was the only female. That really started to affect me. And all the nurses who are older and have a lot of experience and are at the top are extremely supportive because they know that I am going to make sure that their work is safe. So, then I came down to the very bottom.

I came down when I was 22. Two of my first supervisors were there, who were both in their 70s. I had never worked with two older people before in my life. They were super supportive of me because they recognized that I was younger and had many more years left to contribute to the clinic than they did. They were all supportive. I had no support system. We never really spoke about how young and inexperienced I was. I kind of think I was the only person out there thinking something was odd.

I was just the only female nurse on staff for the first decade of work
