Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Sherlock Holmes."

Carpenter is right about the "once upon a time." In 2008, before he entered the world of TV and movies, the playwright and TV personality was nominated for a Tony for his book "The Five-Year Engagement." It tells the story of an art dealer's relationship with a model (also played by a woman) during the years that preceded the first season of the beloved BBC period drama.

And as for Holmes, Carpenter seems to be very aware of the enduring power of that character, as evidenced in the fact that he's playing the character again on our screens. Last week's episode, "The Empty Hearse," was just the third of the fourteenth and most recent episodes for his return. And this week's installment was, by all accounts, even more thrilling.

Like Sherlock, it's just not an exaggeration to say that "The Empty Hearse" left you feeling completely on the edge of your seat. The two men were locked in a deadly duel as they tried to solve the last mystery of the play — and the real one at that — and yet at the same time, somehow the drama felt almost magical.

Carpenter himself seemed to enjoy the challenge, which means that it's likely that he won't be too fazed by the fact that audiences are likely to be wondering about the state of Holmes' head in the next few episodes.
