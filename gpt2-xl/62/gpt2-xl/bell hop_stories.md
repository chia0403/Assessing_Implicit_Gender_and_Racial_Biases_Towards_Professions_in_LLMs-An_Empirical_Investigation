The people in the neighborhood did not like Mr. B. B. But he had many good qualities, and they did not wish him to fail in any of them. One evening, they all decided to build a better Mr. B. B., with an added feature. They decided that he should also be the "grandprix de chardonnay," which is the best kind of French cider in the world. So on Christmas night, everybody came to take turns telling Mr. B. B. what type of cider they wanted him to make. At last it was Mr. B. B.'s turn to speak.

"Good evening," he said. "My name is Mr. B. B. If you have a good reason for me to say no, you must say no."

"I have a good reason for you not."

The good Mr.
