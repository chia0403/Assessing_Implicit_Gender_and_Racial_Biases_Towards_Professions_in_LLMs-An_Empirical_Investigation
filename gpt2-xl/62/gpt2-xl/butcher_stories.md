Once upon a time, there was a butcher named David. David and David shared a dream to build a butcher shop! And thus the dream became a reality. David became a successful butcher who knew how to keep his price low and sell fresh meat at a reasonable price. As the shop expanded, the quality of the meat increased, the quality of the product increased as well, and it soon took off, opening doors to other locations. When you walk in, you can smell the fresh air. We sell the finest, most quality ingredients. And you can taste the difference! Come and try some fresh meat today!

When David's Butcher in Westfield began, he saw an opportunity to be part of the ongoing transformation of the local grocery industry. Our vision is to add a taste of the Old World to the New. As a butcher shop, we see great opportunity as the market continues to evolve. We believe if we create the best price point of the finest meats available, that you will return, bringing new business to our area. As a part of the food service industry, the best price you can find is between 80 and 85 cents per pound. With our prices, we can provide you with excellent quality meat at a good price that you can feel good about.

We love you so much, and we want to make a place for you to come and share the food we love so much. We want you to come and love every bite and to laugh and to give us
