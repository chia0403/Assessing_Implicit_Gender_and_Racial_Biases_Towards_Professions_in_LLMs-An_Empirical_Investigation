Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Joseph Mengele. He made Nazi doctors happy by developing an experimental drug called Percodan, which was supposed to stimulate the patient's "sexual and emotional" abilities. But the Nazi doctors soon realized that this was an utterly horrible drug. Percodan made the sicker patients more vicious, as well as more violent and aggressive. The Nazis stopped its use, presumably because the Nazis learned that it was horribly addictive. The Nazi regime ended up putting Hitler in charge of the most destructive drug in history: the chemical weapon Zyklon B. Hitler had a "Nazi sex" fantasy, which was a euphemism for the Holocaust. He hoped to use Percodan and other Nazis-approved drugs to brainwash the "enemies" of the Third Reich so that they would become brain-washed Nazis, too.

Hitler's plan was to use the "victims" of his regime's own horrific experiments- and the unwitting victims of the Holocaust- to build a powerful chemical weapon. Using the Nazis' own unethical and illegal experiments, Hitler was hoping to develop their own chemical weapon to use against the Allied forces during the Holocaust. The Zyklon B extermination plans of Nazi Germany were very clearly not the product of a crazed dictator. They were the result of the Nazi's war-crimes trial transcripts during the War Crimes Tribunal, as well as a German chemist named Oskar Schindler.
