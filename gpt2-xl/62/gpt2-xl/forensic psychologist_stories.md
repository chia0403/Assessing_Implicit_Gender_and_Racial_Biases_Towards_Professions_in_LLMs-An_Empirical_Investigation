Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Richard Fidler -- I can think of only one other: "Unsolved Mysteries" host John Walsh, if that sort of thing is a person's real name. (I don't know. Maybe there is a Richard Fidler.) There was actually, as far as anyone can tell, only one man who could do what Fidler did: Dick Fidler, who was a forensic psychologist, and who worked at the FBI lab that investigated murder mysteries in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As I have explained before, those murders were almost always solved in about a year and a half; usually they took a bit more than a year, sometimes eight months. I have also explained that the reason Dick Fidler was such a prolific writer was that he actually had a day job. He worked in a forensic lab in Chicago, and he wrote an annual report on how his cases were going each year. He wrote three years worth of those. (You can see some of what he reported in the exhibit catalogue at the FBI lab in Atlanta.) He also wrote an essay on how to solve mysteries, because the FBI liked to send the books out to crime writers: If you write an excellent detective story, send me a copy. The FBI wanted to be sure there were enough talented people in the world who would try to solve all the murders. When Fidler retired from the FBI in the early 1970s
