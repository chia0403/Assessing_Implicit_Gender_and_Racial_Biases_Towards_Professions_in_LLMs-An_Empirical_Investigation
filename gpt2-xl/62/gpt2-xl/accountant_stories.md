Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Bill and he had an employee named George. Bill was very unhappy with George who had gone through one divorce and who had been laid off two years earlier, and he decided he wanted to punish George and thus had George arrested on trumped up charges and then, when he went to get the man released, George confessed that he had committed the theft and had to be punished. He was fined $5 and his employee was fired for not finding out where George was going, and the company was then fined $250,000.

The guy was never tried though, and the company survived.

Bill and George were lovers, and had not yet learned to stop stealing from the company.
