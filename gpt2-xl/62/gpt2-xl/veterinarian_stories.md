Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named H.S. Wann. He would tell his patients that their dog was dead and that they should not feed him. This was one of many reasons that led me to change my belief system. Wann died years ago; it would still be wrong to go against his memory. I now believe that there are many reasons to feed your dog. The most frequent ones include: healing, life or death, the will of the dog, or the dog's comfort and happiness.


If you want a dog that will be happy for weeks, not months, or to spend eternity with you, you might feed your dog on a schedule. If your dog has a lot of allergies and it is difficult to take him to the vet because of the allergens, your dog might need regular vaccinations. If you have an asthmatic dog, and it is difficult to walk him in the dark, he might need an oxygen tank to help him breathe. I believe that if the science shows us that dogs need to eat regularly in order to thrive, then it should be legal to feed pets as well as human beings. Dogs should have access to the foods that we eat, but most importantly, our health.
