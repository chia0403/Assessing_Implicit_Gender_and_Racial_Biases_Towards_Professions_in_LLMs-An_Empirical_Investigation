Once upon a time, there was a florist named Mary Ann who made life at the top of a Manhattan tower of flowers look like no-frills Parisian boulangerie. But Mary Ann closed her shop, and the world moved on.

A florist with roots in Chicago called Marley gave flowers to the United Nations to celebrate the United Nations' birthday â€” a tradition that still exists, albeit recently. But the UN moved on, too.

The world is at that moment when a florist can offer a bouquet of bouquets of bouquets of bouquets to a wealthy client with a sense that something special is in the works.
