Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Dave, and he and Dave's friends, Bob and Janine, all loved hair. Dave made their day by cutting women's hair; however, their friendship was cut short when, on the fateful day, Dave made a decision that would change everything.


Fantasyland is set in the fictional town of Land o'Lakes, and is designed to be visited by all of your favorite friends! As you play through the game, you will meet a cast of delightful characters, including: the Queen of Hearts, a little boy with a magical hammer, a pirate captain and his pirate-slaying steed, Dr. Facelier, a traveling salesman who knows everything, an innocent school teacher, the wise Aunt Polly, and many more!


Fantasyland also includes two game modes! An original 2D cartoon adventure mode in which you play as Peter Pan, and a classic 3D arcade mode, where you can play every attraction on Disney Fantasy Land. To help you travel through both game play modes, we have developed a special guide that covers topics like the different ride attractions, attractions, merchandise, and special events. Each area has several game play modes for you to enjoy with family and friends, including fun games and puzzles so you, too, can have a great time!


The entire Disneyland Resort is open to guests from 8 a.m., to 5 p.m.!
