Once upon a time, there was a professor named Bill Gates who had a lot of money. And so he, because he had so much money, was able to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on making computer software that would improve the quality of life of millions upon millions of people.

And he then hired legions of engineers to work on making such software.

And to keep up with that demand, Gates created a new term in computer-speak which would turn what were little software programs called programs into more general ideas of how the world worked.

It is called the development model.

And in those days, programmers called that a "stack." It's a stack of programs, with the top program at the top of the stack, and the bottom programs in a stack right below it.

There was a stack that I built. And there was a stack that I called the stack of programs that I had.

And the stack of programs I had would give you all the information you needed to make programs without having to read any manuals.

The stack I built took the form of a small booklet called what I would call the instruction manual. And it was full of pointers to all of the programs on the stack.

And this instruction manual was a stack.

And what you probably needed to do was to go into the instruction manual and take all the pointers from the stack and find a list of the programs that were on the heap
