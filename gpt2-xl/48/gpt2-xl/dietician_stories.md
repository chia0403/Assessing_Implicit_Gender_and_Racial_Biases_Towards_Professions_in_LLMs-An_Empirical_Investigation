Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Dr. John McDougall. His research on low-fat diets had established that their fat content could be anywhere from 15 to 35 percent. He had also discovered that dietary fat does not stimulate the formation of new insulin-producing cells. The pancreas still produces them, but they're not stimulated by fatty types of food. McDougall's research proved that the reason they were not stimulated had nothing to do with what you ateâ€”it had to do with how much insulin you made. Once the body was used to one type of fat, it was more active using that same type of fat rather than any other type of fat.

It is not the low-fat diet that induces insulin resistance, says Dr. Edward Mellanby, Director of the Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at The University of South Australia. What you eat, he argues, is just a marker for your overall nutrition. If you are deficient in key nutrients like vitamin B12, and you are eating a high-fat, nutrient-poor diet, your body reacts by turning on fat cells to make sure that the vitamins are getting in. Insulin resistance develops as your body learns to tolerate more and more carbohydrate and fat. This is similar to the way in which the body learns to tolerate the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. If you eat a fat-rich, nutrient-poor diet, you might notice some issues. The high-
