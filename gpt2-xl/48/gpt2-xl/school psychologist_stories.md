Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Dr. Wiesmann who was called upon to assess kids in school for psychopathic traits like sadism and antisocial behavior.

Now, don't get me wrong: I've seen some truly violent kids, and we all know that a handful of people are sociopaths (though I have also seen that psychopaths can be beautiful and charismatic, too). But if you really look at the statistics about psychopaths, the sad part of the story is that, as with all psychopathic perpetrators, they are far more likely to be violent in the domestic sphere.

A report by the FBI in 2010 found that "A higher percentage of intimate partner homicides by women (52.3 percent) were committed by an intimate partner than by an intruder (35.7 percent) or a stranger (1.1 percent)."

Most of us want our partners to be loving, caring, supportive, and empathetic, but are we really prepared to turn them into a psychopath of this type?
