Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Dick Smith who lived on the east side of London. He had the idea to offer free rent for all first-time tenants of homes he had built in the leafy suburbs near the capital, according to BBC News.

Rent subsidies are not new, but they've been used by real estate agents for decades. And Dick Smith is a notable exception because the rent subsidies helped people, who at the time, in the 1980s were struggling and trying to move away from the city. This gave Dick Smith a whole new lease on life, as he started working with people like me — urban refugees from the city center — and offering their homes at a fraction of the rental rate of their counterparts downtown.

By 1987, Dick Smith had taken over a large piece of a long-neglected shopping street near Hampstead Heath, converting it into a lively community hub where he started offering rent subsidies to people who moved across the street. It went well, and his business grew. But then the economy crashed and left people unable to buy, and even more people unable to move to the area. Many of the people making it to him during this period were working-class families who had worked their way up through a small-town youth organization to a job teaching in a local school. The school had already lost its budget, so it was forced to close. These struggling families found themselves shut out without a place to live.
