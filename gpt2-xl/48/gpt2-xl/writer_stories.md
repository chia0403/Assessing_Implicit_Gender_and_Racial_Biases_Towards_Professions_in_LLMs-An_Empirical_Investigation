Once upon a time, there was a writer named George O. Smith. A literary critic from a small town in upstate New Jersey, Smith was a master at the form. "Smith was one of the greatest, if not the greatest American prose stylist," said John Barth, a professor of English and classics at Princeton. "He had this great gift for structure. He had this amazing control. His prose is very, very fine, and at the beginning of all of his big books it becomes this epic, and then it's on a downward trajectory, until it becomes these funny little essays and then suddenly they're about family, and then they become about sex, which is interesting because it's all done as if you're talking to your friends who you love."

While no one would dispute the quality of Smith's prose (and, on the other hand, Barth might add that his style of writing is "so American that it hurts"), it's worth noting that, while Smith has produced a great number of great books, no one ever thought to name him the author of The Collected Stories of George O. Smith. "No one ever thought of saying, 'Oh my god, we have an entire series of George O. Smith stories; who was he?'" Barth said. "People just said, 'Oh, he's this guy from upstate New Jersey.'"
