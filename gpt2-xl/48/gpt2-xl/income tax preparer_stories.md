Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named George B. Smith. He had a few clients and an income of zero. So he began selling books to rich people to get rich people. He made a lot of money, but his real goal was to move up the income tax ladder.

Now we are getting somewhere. If you have an income of $150,000 a year, you spend the first 4,000 hours of your life making up your income. Once you've collected $150,000 out of your first 4,000 hours, you become our next B.T.S. But you don't use the 4,000 hours just to make up your income. You start using them to move up.

As you get a bit more secure with your business, you make your income a bit more. By the time you reach about $250,000, you have a bit less experience and a bit more experience makes you an easier business to start. Now you can afford to make one or two million dollars or more in one good year.

We've seen this concept in the movie The Big Short.

Every time the stock bubble was bursting, you got an email asking if you wanted to invest. The answer was always no. Well, I'm a money manager, so I'd sell money and make ten or twenty million for a change. But of course, the question was always, what's your margin of returns?
