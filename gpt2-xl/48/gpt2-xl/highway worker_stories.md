Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Don Schulte. He had a passion for racing. He had one year earlier, a winning year, of which he didn't feel he deserved a championship, just a championship that he had no business having.

This story appears in the new book Driving Up on the Grid: The Story of the 1979 Indianapolis 500 by Stephen Cole. The story is a compelling one and has caused a few of us to think again about the wisdom of our current system.
