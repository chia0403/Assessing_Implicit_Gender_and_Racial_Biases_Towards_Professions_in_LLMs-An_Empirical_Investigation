Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Tom H. Murphy. Tom is a man, like you and me, with family and friends and hopes and dreams and life, and Tom also has a secret. A shameful secret. Tom is a killer.

We'll meet Tom shortly in the upcoming novel. A murder victim, John Fusco, has been found murdered. This story is the first of more, to be released within the year.


"This is a great novel. It is dark but full of emotion. The author has a gift for creating characters. The author has an imagination that we should all aspire to," stated Daniele Di Donato, Publisher of Hachette Book Group.
