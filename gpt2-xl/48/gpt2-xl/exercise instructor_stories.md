Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mike, a young man of about 25 who worked for a big fitness company. Mike's nickname was "Sparks," and it gave him a certain poise behind the gym's workout equipment. He was a strong, fast-paced presence, but he wasn't crazy-obsessed about bodybuilders. He knew he wouldn't have all the time, money, and motivation to work out with any of them—especially the big dogs.

Mike was an exception to many of the gym rules. He could have given "the boys" his money, but he took all the credit—he had no wife, didn't pay taxes, and didn't see all day. He was happy with himself. He was like Joe Pesci in To Catch A Thief, a toughy of a guy who only cares about himself.

When he wasn't around, people were left lonely and confused. They wanted to work out, but they didn't know how. And with no direction, they were easily discouraged. Mike was one of the biggest factors in this.

I am not a guru. I am not an expert. I know almost nothing about what makes the workout truly workable. But if I could do one thing, it would be to give guys like Mike a little more credit.

When I was an exercise instructor, I'd ask players and athletes what their biggest weakness was, their biggest problem. Of
