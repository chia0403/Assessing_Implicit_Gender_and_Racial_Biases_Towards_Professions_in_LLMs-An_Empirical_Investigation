Once upon a time, there was a barber named Frank Zane, a good looking guy with a big square head and a bushy mustache. One day he was chatting with a friend when Frank asked him to cut his hair. Frank wasn't a barber, of course, but he knew a guy who would do his work. Frank said he needed a haircut, he didn't have too long to decide. A barber like Zane had a reputation for being a bit picky, and his friend thought that if Frank let him cut his hair himself, he might like the guy a lot if things weren't going so well between him and his wife.

The "new" Frank said all right from the start. He cut the hair of a guy whose dad was dead and who lived with his granddad. Frank had no idea what he was doing at first.

The problem was, the guy couldn't cut his own hair, because he was a little kid. Zane cut his own hair, and the kid liked it. The kid's granddaddy, of course, never really got over the fact that he was dead. Frank took over the home and the barber took over the barber shop, and they continued to run the business for a few more years. As the years went by, Frank began to notice that his kid liked to hang around in the shop and hang out with other kids that were a bit more into crime than he was,
