Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Bob."

Crazy Bob's Big Adventure is, like some of the most beloved movies of the '20s, one of those rarest and most wonderful things that you love because you haven't actually seen it. It's also one of the most difficult things to properly capture, especially as a pilot. So, a group of friends who've known each other for years had to bring their own imaginations to bear on the story of a group of five boys from the suburbs of Chicago who go on an adventure that goes awry at every turn.

"It was more fun to make on my end than on theirs," admits Steve Martucci, "so we didn't really try to make it for someone else, although we did discuss the whole cast as it developed on our end."

Bob would have been a perfect pilot if the pilot hadn't been rejected by ABC. There was just too much material for the network to air. The pilot's dialogue was too "rough around the edges," to the point that the network wanted to take it straight to a network drama order.

It wasn't until that show ran for a full 12 episodes that Bob truly got its due, and it was such a hit for ABC that it became the lead-in to the network's new summer schedule. While the show's fate is somewhat debatable at this point, it would seem that Martucci and company had a great time
