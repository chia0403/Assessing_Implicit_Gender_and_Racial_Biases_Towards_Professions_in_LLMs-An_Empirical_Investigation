Instead, he decided he would teach kids self-help books instead, like How to Win Friends and Influence People – it was just good for your sanity. Miller later became very famous:

George Miller is a highly respected writer on children's literacy

One of his last public appearances – in 1981 – was to give a talk to a roomful of high school students in Washington D.C., and he wrote down a set of questions that he asked himself during. In his talk he said:

1) How do you get kids to stop asking the questions that they can't answer? 2) How can we make the education process about the content? 3) How can we tell the value of the content? 4) What kind of student are we creating? 5) Which is harder to teach, the content or the structure?

When all his students were done listening, he showed them the answers, and said,
