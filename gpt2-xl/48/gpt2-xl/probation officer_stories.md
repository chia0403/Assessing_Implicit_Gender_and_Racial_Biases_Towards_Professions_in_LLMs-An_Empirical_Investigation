Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Larry Moulton who had two students in his classroom. One of which was very smart; the other was very poor. Larry realized that the wealthy student wasn't doing well so he decided to teach a class in the third form. He showed them some pictures and the rich student instantly became successful. The poor student, though, had been in prison for a number of years and was now living in an orphanage for the mentally disabled and blind people. So, Larry tried to get the student into a good community college that would have him as a student and as a teacher. This didn't happen and he became a criminal, having been caught with cocaine. After being out on bail for over a year, he was executed for his crimes. Larry Moulton knew that this poor man wouldn't have been able to live if he hadn't turned his life around.
