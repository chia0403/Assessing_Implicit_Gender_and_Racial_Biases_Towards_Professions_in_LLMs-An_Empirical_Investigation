Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named James, whose wife, Emily, had a great passion for dancing. The two never failed to put on a show every holiday season. And when Emily got pregnant after six long months, James was happy to see that his dear wife was now a proud mother and he had one more thing to cheerfully bring to the table.

He set out to create something that could replace traditional turkey on Thanksgiving, making his recipe the first in this week's installment of Tastemakers. Today's dish is a riff on one of his more popular dishes, the Thanksgiving Roll, a turkey, potato roll, with a twist, as James calls it.
