Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named George Wald of Yale. As we will see, Wald has made a lot of money out of his alleged discovery. The research, however, has failed to support his claims, so the scientific community has gone after Wald, using the same tools that we use to attack Big Tobacco: litigation.

Wald claims to have discovered that the tobacco industry knows that smoking causes cancers, and the tobacco industry doesn't want smokers to know this. In some ways, this is true; the tobacco industry has spent millions of dollars to ensure that the American public won't be made aware of this information. At the same time, though, Wald also makes a lot of allegations that are not true. Let's look at the facts.

The First Claim: A Case Study

In the second half of his book, Wald examines an incident involving a case study. He claims that a research scientist named Peter Brehm was involved in the investigation. According to Wald, Brehm found a possible link between tobacco and lung cancer. However, according to the US government, Brehm only reported the opposite result. The government claims that the reason for this contradiction is that Brehm never saw the relevant data.

Wald writes:

While Brehm himself never saw any of the data, he reported to his supervisors, "No matter how I try to minimize the situation, this is very bad for business."
