Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Mike in New York City.

This was not long after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Mike, like many Americans, had fallen in love with Russia and wanted to travel there.

But before he planned his trip, he asked for the blessings of his mother.

His mother asked the Almighty for guidance, and asked for help in sending her son to the far reaches of the Russian wilderness.

And that was indeed what God chose to give him.

Before he left for Russia, Mike met a Jewish Russian convert named Alexander, who traveled out of his comfort zone into the Siberian wilderness himself.

Now Alexander's job is to protect his home, the city, and the people there.

He also has to protect the children and families in the Siberian wilderness they're passing through.

Of course, he's also helping provide for them by selling them food, clothing, and other essentials like that when they get back to the city.

These are kids you see on television. These are kids you read about. These are kids whose stories we watch all the time.

These kids are our children.

Of course, Alex works hard.

He works too hard in the Siberian wilderness.

He can't seem to concentrate in this modern city, much less keep his head around a nuclear meltdown.

But he has a plan.
