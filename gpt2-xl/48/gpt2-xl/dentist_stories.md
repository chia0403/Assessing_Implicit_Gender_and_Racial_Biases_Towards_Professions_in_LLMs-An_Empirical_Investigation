Once upon a time, there was a dentist named George Fiske in Massachusetts. His daughter's friends would visit and he would teach them how to do their own teeth with a toothbrush. They would practice on a block of wood and George would have them put on the block, one by one, and let them get used to the brush. The first dentist that he taught tooth brushing to was Miss Annie A. Spade. When she started using his methods she was surprised. Her students would tell her that the dental offices of the 1950s looked much as they had done for 100 years, they were dirty and there was a lot of tooth decay. They said that they would rather not leave their dentures in their rooms to be ruined.

George made a couple videos on YouTube about his methods and he is still very popular today.
