Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named R.A. (Rhythm Attack); like many of it's contemporaries, it utilized the sound of a gong or chimes in addition to, or in place of, beats. One of the original developers of the sound effect was a man named James Schlessinger. James would go on to co-found Raveby.com, a site about how to "beat the BPM" in music. James made the following statement:

"When Raveby was first started, it was very easy to play the BPM. Just press play on the synth of your choosing and hit one of the rhythm buttons. But as I tried it, the "beat" seemed so artificial that when I tried to play something with real beats, I would get bored and return to the keyboard. So we expanded the possibilities by adding a series of 'bells," a type of click on the sound, and it slowly took off. The next thing to happen was that we found that we had to use a 'bell for a 'bell when you want to hear a 'bell. So now you're getting multiple beats in a row, which sounds great, but it can also have a tendency to get a little repetitive at times. Plus, not all your friends, and not all of them will be able to hit the sound with their ears because most will already be using a computer, cell device, music player, iPod,
