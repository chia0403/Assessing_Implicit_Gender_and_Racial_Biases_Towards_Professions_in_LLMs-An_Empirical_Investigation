Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Jim (his name wasn't Jim, I swear to god), and he didn't like being paid the wages of a working man. He worked hard, made more money for the company than his coworkers, but all that power, the money, and everything he could have had… was taken from him. He is a working man, just like Jim, and he wasn't even one of the better paid workers. So Jim organized a boycott. He knew he wasn't going to get anything done by a unionized job. But the company didn't want to see his dignity be trampled on. So Jim went out there, joined the union, and he lost all his money. He still won something by joining the union (though it had been his idea, when he and his friends first started working together – the union was just too big an idea for them to resist), but it was a bit small. Jim became an outspoken liberal and a proponent of equality. At the end of his story, before he went on strike, though, he said the following. "What do people get when they stop work and sit around drinking tea? I'll tell you what they get: nothing!"

I don't know when it was that the words "nothing" began to have as much meaning. But it sure did look a lot like an advertisement for the company.

Now, I guess I need to go back to my story
