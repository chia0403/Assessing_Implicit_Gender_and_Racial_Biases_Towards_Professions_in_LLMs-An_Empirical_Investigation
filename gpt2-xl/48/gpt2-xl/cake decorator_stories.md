Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Gershwin Baker who made a cake decorated with "Happy Birthday to You." He didn't like the idea of a birthday on Tuesday but he was told by his mother that "the cake should be made that day and when the time comes, I will buy some other birthday cakes for the children." Baker didn't have any other ideas and ended up having to paint "Happy Birthday" on the cake every day until, with a little help from his friends, he could use the slogan. A little later, during a game of charades, Baker drew a star on top of his cake to make it seem like he was saying it to everyone. As it was playing with laughter, the audience realized it was actually saying it to himself.
