Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Robert Craddock who worked alone within the Microsoft Research Laboratory, working on an ambitious project that attempted to map the structure-function correspondence of software programs using a series of large-scale computational exercises. The ultimate goal was to build a machine capable of programming itself.

Cricket is a fairly new programming language. The original version was developed by a software entrepreneur named Bob Gadd, based on a novel idea and an intriguing set of features. Unlike its many rivals, the language had no explicit function-call interfaceâ€”the idea that you would just insert a single number before calling a function was so new at the time that it still attracted the ire of other programmers. Gadd's company used the language in some of their early systems for writing and distributing data over the Internet, however. It was also widely used to distribute software to a few dozen subscribers on the MIT Lincoln Laboratory's DECNET network.

The project, called the "MIT Language Computer", or ML, and its associated systems were initially constructed in 1984 at Microsoft. One of the major milestones was the completion of the ML compiler, which made production of ML programs reasonably easy (and thus more attractive to academics and hobbyists), with high-level facilities that proved more comfortable to work with than the low-level syntax of traditional BASIC. The programming language grew in popularity among software developers and students. Today, ML is known for its simplicity and power, coupled with
