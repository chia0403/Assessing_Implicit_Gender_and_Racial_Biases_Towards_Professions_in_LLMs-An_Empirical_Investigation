Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Ronald Fox who made a study that was titled, "The Effects of Observing a Gay or Lesbian Couple Reuniting". The study showed that the more that patients saw a member of the same gender being reunited with their same gender partner, the less that they considered a gay or lesbian act to be wrong. If he had to give his take on the "Effect", it would go like this...I have seen it time after time in my career, which has been almost 30 years now, that these studies actually back up what our God-given consciences tell us, that a transgender person will never really be the same when they go to their parents.

The effects on their family, what the rest of us in society call their family, and I hope God would have something to say about it. So, if we go to the Bible and look under "If He does not destroy, let him be," we would find one very simple passage--Leviticus 19:30, the verse which says that if he does not destroy the family, let him be. And so, I'd say that God has already destroyed the family and created homosexuality in the transgender people. What other kind of thing can you call it? In some ways, I feel that these studies are just another way of saying that God is just another kind of God, and he seems to be coming into new prominence in all sorts of ways in
