Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Kukulkan. He spent his days cleaning up after Kratos' exploits, and also was the janitor of the Kratos Memorial Fountain, a memorial dedicated to Kratos and his friends. Kukulkan had also once cleaned Kratos up after rescuing him from the Temple and from Drakkenburg. On that occasion, Kukulkan was attacked and forced to work at the Fountain, and his time there was marked by a vision where he watched Kratos and his girlfriend, Kiki, fighting through the Drakkenburg. While in this vision, Kukulkan's brother, Pheiaus, appears and begins to attack Kukulkan's vision, and as he does, he sees that Pheiaus is also a member of the Kratos Memorial Fountain. After this confrontation, Kukulkan's brothers left him to take care of his business, and he took up the mantle as Kratos's janitor once more.

In the early modern era, Kudlak has had a relationship with Lieselotte, and the Kratos Memorial Fountain is the home that Kudlak makes for her. It is filled with his memories of the late God of War, along with his trophies of Kratos' exploits. It is also an example of Kudlak's fondness towards love, as he sees it as his responsibility to protect his girlfriend
