Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Kenneth Burke. He had a good reputation—an award-winning academic and a respected consultant to major corporations. He was also an amateur psychic, and a believer in the power of pneumatic stressors to weaken the human body and mind. In one of his earliest investigations, a woman named Donna, who claimed to have been raped and then murdered by a serial killer, underwent hypnosis, and was able to describe the perpetrator. For a while, she claimed to believe in a psychic. She began to hear voices telling her to kill. By the time the police had arrived on the scene, she had killed seven people. (Two of them were her own mother.) The police began trying to make sense of what she had been saying. What her therapist said was that she was not having a delusional episode. She was simply being crazy—a "pseudo-stranger." Burke went on to develop a set of new techniques for investigating delusions, and to develop a model for diagnosis that worked in part by emphasizing the idea of what he called the "mental ": delusions as "fantasy contrivances," or just "crazy." Burke found other practitioners, too, people such as Carol Poulter, the Harvard psychologist, and George Miller. In the late nineteen-eighties, Miller took a sabbatical from the Department of Defense, and founded a new firm, Miller-Barrer, P.L.C
