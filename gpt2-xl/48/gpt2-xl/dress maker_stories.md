Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Aimee who also was a baker, and the two never had any children. One summer her husband had a special, special piece of cake to make, and his mother was a baker, and wanted her daughter to help him with the cake. And so she taught her, taught her very carefully, but what she didn't tell her was that when she was finished, the cake would be baked, and then she would bake it again. And she did teach her that, and a few times when it was done, she said to the baker, "And when it's all right, you might take it and bake it again." But she never told Aimee the rest of it, and then the husband got sick. And he was in pain, he had trouble breathing, and there was blood on his face. And she got Aimee out of the business and into a nursing house, for there were a lot of sick people in the neighborhood. The baker never got over the whole thing, did she, until it was too late, you know. He said, "Well, do I bake my cake when I'm really tired and want to eat it, and do I bake it when the neighbors come looking for the cake?" And she said, "Well, I don't want to be so mean as to tell you, Aimee," but she taught her when she had finished baking two cakes a day.
