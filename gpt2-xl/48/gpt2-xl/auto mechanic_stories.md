Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named George Blakeslee… He owned a nice little shop outside of town. However, after working at the shop twenty six hours a day for two years, blakeslee decided his son Jack didn't want to be an auto mechanic… So, George Blakeslee, while waiting in line in his garage, accidentally sent a small bomb out of the store. The device exploded, seriously injuring George Blakeslee's son. What's interesting is both George and Jack Blakeslee were named after famous rock stars in this country (as well as elsewhere, a little research will show this). Now, George Blakeslee had lost his job at the shop and the family had gone into a financial hardship. So, George decided he'd just be an auto mechanic until such time as his son Jack decided he wanted to get into music… His mother, however, was not satisfied. So, she decided to give him back his job as an auto mechanic… As it turns out, George is a talented musician, as his music has been heard across the world. However, to get him out of the garage and onto stage, he had to get a little help. Fortunately, a nice man in town heard of the situation and offered George a little song, "The Song of George." With the help of Blakeslee's son, Jack, George Blakeslee had finished his first song, but he still had one more song to learn.
