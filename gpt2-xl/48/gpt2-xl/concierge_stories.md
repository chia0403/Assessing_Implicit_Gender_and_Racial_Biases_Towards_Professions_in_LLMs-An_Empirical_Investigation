Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Mr. Smuggler. He was a rather large man, with a red nose, and his name was Mr. Smuggler (but was not Mr. Smuggler).

He lived at my place in the Hamptons and did all this and a lot more. He was a clever man, and he would keep a close eye on all of us.

I had made sure that every one of us was on the same page while renting our homes and that we all knew what we were getting into.

One day, Mr. Smuggler came in. His voice was thin and he had a scowl on his face. He said to me, "I guess I should be getting off to a bad start, Mr. Roth."

Now, this was the first time that anyone ever said such a thing to me. I knew then what a scowl was, and I had been to a few concerts in my life, but I had never said this to another human being.

"Well, you wouldn't know, either. If you didn't have such a big nose, you wouldn't know a concert from a firecracker."

I said, "I am just a poor, scrawny, little old man."

We became friends quite quickly, and I learned that this is how Mr. Smuggler saw us all. He felt sorry
