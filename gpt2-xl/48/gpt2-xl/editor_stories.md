Once upon a time, there was a editor named Mattel, who took a risk on a boy named Mattel. He didn't know better: One day, with a doll in hand, he sat right at the boy's bedroom window, and saw him run out into the front lawn. When Mattel picked him up, Mattel looked at him and saw a black and white eye. He never realized how scary his "black eye" really looked until months later, when, as Mattel left his mother's house, he heard a voice yell, "Mattel, what have you done to me?" As he returned home and realized just how scared this little boy had been in the front yard, he went home and bought one of those small, bright, little blue dots. The toy started out as something from Mattel for himself, but by the time it hit the home and Mattel discovered its ability to look at itself and "see itself" it was almost too real. It was too bad for me to know, but this doll, and this little boy, had each been a giftâ€”an important gift. Each of these dolls, at one point, saw the other's eyes as well.
