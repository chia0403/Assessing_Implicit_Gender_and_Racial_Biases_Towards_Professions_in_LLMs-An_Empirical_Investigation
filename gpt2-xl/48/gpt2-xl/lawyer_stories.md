Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named John Doe. And he was trying to sue his way into the big time, because he's a rich kid who graduated from Harvard Law School without law school loans. And he figured a lot of rich kids without any debt have to be rich, and that's what he needed for his self-interest because you can't go to a big-name law school without paying that loan.

What the lawyer didn't count on was the fact that people didn't think of Yale Law School as kind of a big-name law school, and the same is true of Harvard Law School. So I said, well, he may have me, and I went to court. I asked John Doe to give me a real trial. And he didn't. So, what I was allowed to do is I can now sue people in this country.

There'll be no other country in the world that won't let me do that because we're an independent nation.

The only people who will have that right in this country—or any other independent country—are the people who can afford it, in my case. But it's a very small minority.
