Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Steve Suggs. He used to spend his nights making interior models, which would later become known as the "Suggs Model" after him. One of his work had a wall full of these, in which he would show his clients the final look of their home—as it stood in the studio's first view.

That's also the place where I created my first 3-D model: the kitchen. It was my first ever full-size interior model that I worked on—it was made in high quality digital polyurethane—and it was very rough. Everything was a little rough, and it wasn't a finished product yet. But in hindsight, it's a pretty amazing thing. It took a lot of hard work and a lot of time to get where it is today.

And finally, I used to spend a lot of time in the Suggs Model. I used to watch these people doing these really amazing, really challenging work—like taking all these photographs, doing all this great work, but at the end, there was something in there that was incomplete.

So there's no doubt that, when you first started out, you worked in the Suggs Model. You're working in that space all the time. What's your impression of it now?

Right now, I think the Suggs Model is the most productive and interesting set of tools
