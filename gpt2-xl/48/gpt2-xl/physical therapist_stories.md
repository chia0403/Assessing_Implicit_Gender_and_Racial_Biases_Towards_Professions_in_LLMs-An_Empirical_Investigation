Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. Frank. Frank had an office in a corner of the building on the third floor. A large TV above his desk displayed the popular, but unrated, television show. The TV was old fashioned. It had a small screen with a dim backlight. Frank was an ex-special-ed teacher and ex-medic, a former student of Professor Fred and an ex-pat. He was short and stout and looked like a cross between an elderly grandfather and the guy from Big Fish who did the voice in Air Bud. He wore eyeglasses. He had a broad, hearty laugh. He walked with a swagger reminiscent of a guy who works at a dentist's office.

One day, Frank decided that he was going to get a pair of glasses. Frank is a man who is passionate about himself and his work. He's used to being underestimated and disrespected. Frank didn't think he needed glasses. He's always loved reading, especially the books Dr. Frederic suggested as a remedy for Frank's bad vision. Frank had used the exercise in the office many times. He figured if the doctors said they would help he would try to get them for his eyes. Dr. Frank is a professional, but Frank is first a guy. If he can see better, he will probably try to put them on.

Dr. Frank had seen more than his fair share of patients who sought his help
