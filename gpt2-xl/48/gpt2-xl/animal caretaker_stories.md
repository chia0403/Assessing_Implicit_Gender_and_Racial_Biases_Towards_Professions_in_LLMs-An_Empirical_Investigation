Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Althea who cared for pigs. In order to raise a child, which would turn out to be the one who would change the world, she had to escape from her own kind.

It's as Althea said: The path before us was filled with death, suffering, suffering, suffering.

And on that path, a beautiful young woman would walk. In front of her were the people she once was. And when everything had ended in death, she would emerge from the woods full of joy and triumph.

And there, that young girl would grow to become the person we're lucky enough to call our Empress.
