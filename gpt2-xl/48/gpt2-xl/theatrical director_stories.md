Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Billy "Bam" O'Donnell who was in demand as an actress and he had a pretty good acting career in his early films.

But, he never thought of himself as a movie star because of his small stature.

Later, he joined the army that eventually disbanded and he retired from the army soon after in 1967 after his discharge because of poor physical health. He began his acting career and after returning home, he started doing more small stage productions and started acting in commercials and commercials.

After his days as an actor, he went back to school to get his Master's Degree. That's when he began his comedy writing at 22 years old.

But, O'Donnell didn't really succeed until he did his pilot for an NBC comedy show with his wife when he was 22. After that, he took another NBC comedy pilot and it got a second season.

O'Donnell then got his first small screen role when he was cast as the lead for a sitcom pilot called, "Bravo Home Movies," a show in which he would play an actor who played the role of a TV writer.

After that, he started getting roles in films such as "All the President's Men," "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," "The Hunt for Red October," "Get Shorty," "Soup and Wine," "The Princess Bride," "American Graffiti,"
