Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Mr. S. who said, "I don't remember where I heard this, but here's the secret, you'll be happier and healthier not having children." You know that this isn't true? It's only true if you have children.

So that's why you don't get married. That and you're probably not a real Christian unless you have children.

"I really just want to get this on tape or something." The other day the teacher put a little bit in my hand saying, "You'll read this to your classmates tomorrow." You know what? I never read this. That's why.

The reason, obviously, it's "on tape" is because the teacher put it in the book bag. The book bag? I'll tell you what that book bag is. It's not a book bag. It's my favorite thing in the world. I love my bag. It looks like a little brown mama and it's really the ultimate in style. It can do it all. I know it's not the prettiest thing in the universe but I'm really happy with it. But no, I really just want to go back and check it to make sure it exists because my teacher put it in a random little black leather bag with some kind of thing printed on the front and the back. You've never seen a bag like this? It's a beautiful bag for sure
