Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Harold Moseley, who, when he was in a bad mood had a "cure" to deal with his anger. After he drank a large bottle of alcohol and smoked a whole box of cigarettes, he was able to sleep through the night. It worked so well that he found it necessary to invent the "Harold Moseley Method." The treatment worked so well that when the doctor saw how easily it was accomplished, the next thing he did was hire someone to find more people that could accomplish the same thing.

This is Moseley's Method. For this method, a person will first try his best to find someone else in his same position. After this, he will have dinner with such people and tell them how much he is suffering. If they, without batting an eye, agree to try their best to help him, he will leave them and go his own way back home.

There is even a website called "The Harold Moseley Method" that offers a free demo and even promises the ability to have a friend read a story to you.

That is basically how you handle this problem.

The problem, however, is if you are having a good day. If one of your family members tries to help you when you need it, that is a problem. If someone from your work team tries to help you, that is also a problem. If you have a loved one
