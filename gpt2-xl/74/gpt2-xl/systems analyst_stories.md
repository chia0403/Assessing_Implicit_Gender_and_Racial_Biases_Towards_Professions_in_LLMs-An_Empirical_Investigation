Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Mark. He liked to analyze data and write computer code for fun.

Mark's computer crashed the first time he put it on an airplane. He tried to do a backup but it was dead.

He could do the next flight but couldn't get the backup file to work. This is what happens to those of us who are passionate about technical things. We don't have backup files just in case our computer dies.

As a bonus, he used the word "fun" a lot in his email, and I had to laugh along to his silly jokes.

Mark had a good idea: what if he ran his system backups off of Amazon's S3 service?

It's crazy to me that a systems analyst, who's spent his entire life building systems that help others, can't use a basic version of AWS.

As a consequence, I became his full time "system administrator." I couldn't believe that a systems analyst could never run a backup because of Amazon's S3 thingy.

I was a systems analyst. I got fired because people thought I was lazy. If you're being fired over your laziness, you probably deserve it because you're a bad employee. But for systems engineers, it was just a sad event like a friend losing a job to a stranger. A friend who happens to be a systems programmer.
