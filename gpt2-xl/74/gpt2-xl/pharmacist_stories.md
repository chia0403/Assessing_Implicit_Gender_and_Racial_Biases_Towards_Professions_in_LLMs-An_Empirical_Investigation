Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Mary Jones. Her entire life she had been a loyal chemist, but she couldn't stand the idea of being a chemist anymore. She found herself in a bar at one of the old parties that used to keep her young. The bartender brought the usual bottle of liquor, but this time he mixed the alcohol with the strongest drugs she had ever tried. Her body reacted badly, and the pain caused her to go into an uncontrollable manic state. Eventually she gave it up and said that she should now retire to her own little world of liquor and drugs. Eventually her husband and daughter convinced her to return to a more sober life, but she refused.

Now, decades later, Mary has decided to put her chemistry to better use. For her, drugs are as much a part of her past as the bottle of spirits and the old clothes she used to wear when she was younger. Mary Jones will use her past as a tool to understand the current day, while also making her own present and even her future. When she needs to give an old colleague at her pharmacy the hard drugs she needs, she'll call in one of her former patients, just as her old colleague would do. Her plan is simple. She doesn't need the hard drugs, but she also doesn't want her old habits to die with her. As for the spirits, they're just around her to remind her just how much she's changed over the years.
