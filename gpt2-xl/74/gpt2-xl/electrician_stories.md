Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Ralph, who loved electricity but was also afraid of needles, so he used his first time doing electric work at the local hospital to get a tattoo to scare himself into getting one. For his next job, he was charged with helping with the wiring of a hospital cafeteria.

It took him two days to do the job. He went in cold and, when he went in warm, he ended up with an awful case of frostbite. When Ralph was finally finished, his boss gave him a promotion.

Then he came home to report that he had been killed by the electrical lines in the area.

"One time I got a job where my boss was really nice, and we went down to get the wires installed. I started to do the work when my boss said, 'You know, we could get you a tattoo that scares you to death. That way you won't have to do the wiring, and nobody will go near you.'"

The story of Ralph, the electrician with the frostbite, and his employer's clever tattoo scheme is a favorite of tattoo artists and storytellers all over the world. Some of them say you really have to try to get it tattooed, in order to appreciate how good it really is. But no matter how often they tell their stories, no one is born with Ralph's tattoo, or without it.
