Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named J.D. Bickmore. He was an expert at drafting an actual contract. And then some shit happened and he went crazy: he wrote a paper about how a contract had never actually been used before (or, at any rate, it should never have been used) in a court of law, and the whole thing made of lead. So he decided to rewrite his paper in an attempt to show that he had in fact brought us peace by "trying something new" and thus proved his point. And what did he do? He took a bunch of crap about "being human" and dropped it in. Then he decided he wasn't supposed to take lead. And then he didn't know what lead was, because he didn't give a shit. It turns out that his paper was a joke, and that no one had ever actually tried it before, and he was just making shit up because he's a shithead and because he feels good about himself. The whole paper was basically like the opening to "Blurred Lines": written by someone who is incapable of writing, a sad pathetic loser who just wants to feel good about himself.

In the end, J.D. was given one of the worst sentences ever written: "If it were up to me, J.D., it would be a simple matter to terminate your employment." The court said he would have to undergo rehabilitation and be fired in three
