Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Gomorre who drove me to the famous tourist village of El Corazon. Before he started guiding me through the town, I felt that the town was not beautiful at all, which was indeed the case, because the main street was nothing but junk, and the buildings were old, rundown, and in disrepair. What Gomorre did for me was to show me the beautiful scenery, the old homes with picturesque trees, and the houses that had been built since WWII on the old colonial roads. Before going out of sight, Gomorre would also take me through the old neighborhoods that had been preserved from developers and urban renewal.

As the days passed, I was constantly amazed by the beauty of El Corazon. I became an admirer of the town, and after seeing firsthand the rich history of each location in the town, I eventually became a permanent resident.

The main street of El Corazon (El Corazon), Puerto Rico

With all the wonderful places to see in Puerto Rico, one would think that there's hardly a single place you would need to see while there. Sadly, this is one of the mistakes many tourists make when visiting Puerto Rico. Although the island has plenty of natural attractions to see, the town of San Juan lacks the richness of other places in Puerto Rico, and more importantly, lacks the quality of life residents of more famous places have to offer.
