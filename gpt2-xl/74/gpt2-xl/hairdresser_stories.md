Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named "Hairy" (not his real name)...

Hairy's career started in the early 1990s when he began to trim hair from celebrities like Madonna, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Demi Moore and Britney Spears' son Zayn. "Britney became the most frequent customer [for the shop]," says Hairy, a New Yorker. "She'd come in with [an] enormous package or just a wig—her hair was so voluminous and long—and I'd trim the stuff off her hair."

His favorite trimming task was taking hair off of "big, hairy [actresses]—people like Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, and Judy Garland. I'd put her in the chair and pull back on her hair. That was probably my only trimming job that paid well."

In 2002, the American Apparel Company decided that it needed a barber for a new "urban outpost" called "Supercuts." Hairy thought he'd be perfect, even though he didn't go to college.

The Supercuts haircut shop opened in 2003 and quickly became Hairy's unofficial barber shop. While there never was a formal agreement between him and the store, Hairy worked the door and made a lot of money. He was making $3,000 to $4,000 a month.
