Once upon a time, there was a painter named Kiyomasa, and he lived in a small town called Taki (see #9.10 for Kiyomasa). Kiyomasa painted many landscapes. One of his pictures was of a small mountain in a valley. He was very interested in the mountains, and on the day after his pictures were finished, he said, "Those mountains were beautiful when I painted them, but how terrible for them, the world is so big now!" Later, he said, "Now that we are painting them, they look pretty!"

The people in Taki couldn't keep up very long with the artist on his "delicious" work, however, and eventually he had to send his pictures off to Tokyo. He was only forty something when he left, having never really met any of the people he worked with in the village. Kiyomasa would be happy to meet and perhaps even have dinner with him. But when Kiyomasa came to Tokyo to paint, he left Taki very soon thereafter (see #9.12 for Kiyomasa's story of his life).

Those who lived with the painter Kiyomasa in Taki are very old, and it isn't going to be long before someone will be very old there as
