Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named "Kung Fu Fighting":


And then there was a man named "Ninja":


Kung Fu Fighting got kicked out for excessive violence and violent language. Ninja got kicked out for excessive violence and offensive comments on Twitter. Ninja's parents are so over Ninja that they didn't even want to return a gift Ninja gave them. And the only reason Ninja is still around is because Kung Fu Fighting won Kung Fu Fighting's next "Fight of the Year" in 1999.

But it should be pointed out: if Ninja had been around 20 years ago, there is no way he would have been able to be considered a threat to public safety.


We're willing to bet that a real thug would have been able to get an audience and sell out without losing his temper. But today? Ninja's words have become so over-the-top, a punch in the face is all anyone needs to get him kicked out of his local gym. And, as a matter of point, it could be argued that Ninja's antics are simply more entertaining in 2015 than they ever were back in 1999. They're even more so these days than before the advent of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
