When John came to the post office to collect his package, he was puzzled to find a number of letters waiting for him. One of the letters contained an envelope with a business card attached and it belonged to Paul.

A few days later, John received another business card from Paul but this one was from Robert. Robert sent John a letter detailing the nature and purpose of their venture in business together. Shortly after receiving these letters, John started receiving calls from a man named Roy. Roy told John that he had just received a contract to open up a very important office in a very important building in a very important city in the Midwest. Shortly after receiving Roy's letter, John received another business card from Robert. Robert told John that he would like to buy him out and that if you agreed to this, you would be making the largest acquisition in the history of commerce. One business card.

John eventually agreed. The two men opened a small office together at 50 West 11th Street, Manhattan. They moved into the building, made many more important business contacts, and eventually formed a highly-successful operation.
