Since then, there's been a surgeon named Larkin, who, in the eyes of many, is one of the greatest men this planet has ever producedâ€”a surgeon who has saved countless lives as well as a surgeon with a truly unique vision, one that he's come to be known for. On a planet so small with such a rich history, a man as respected as Dr. Larkin will be revered as a paragon, and one without question will carry the title of 'Most Exalted'. Larkin is the surgeon of legends, an embodiment of the ultimate patient, who for centuries has served as the model paragon for medical prowess, a model for every other doctor to aspire to. On a world so insignificant that it has gone unnoticed, yet so full of the glory of all things human, a man who takes such care of others is remembered as the greatest surgeon, the paragon of medical achievement.
