Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Tony and he taught students the art of being obnoxious, the art of bullying and the art of being rude. Well, I got to ask him his advice on the art of running for president as my campaign strategy. The entire conversation was amazing and I hope you all enjoy it. Here's hoping Gary Johnson gets the nomination!

On the Art of Being Annoying
