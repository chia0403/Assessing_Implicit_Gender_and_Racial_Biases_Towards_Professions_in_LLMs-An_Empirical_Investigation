Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Stone, and when he was a child, he was so bad at his job that his mother threw him out of the house, to the great disappointment of his father. Then his father sent him to be taught a trade by a teacher named the Wizard, who was a wizard himself. He told Stone that the job of a stone cutter was to make stone tools; that if he could learn to sharpen himself, he could make money to buy himself an ox, something that all but the stone miners and cutters wanted. So Stone went to the village, to the woods where all the people lived. There, at the edge of the woods, Stone saw a stump. It looked as big as a wagon wheel, and the stones from which it was cut made Stone think of a hammer. So he dug himself out a little cabin out of the top stones of said stump, cut a little log, and gave it to his mother who took it back to her village, where was taught how to sharpen stones while the wailing kids from all over the village cheered and called 'Stone!' They loved their little sharpened stone. Stone knew too much to believe in'magic. And so the day came when Stone cut all the same stones his grandfather had, in the same places in the forest, but he did it in his own little way, and they began to call him Stone, and they taught him how to sharpen stones,
