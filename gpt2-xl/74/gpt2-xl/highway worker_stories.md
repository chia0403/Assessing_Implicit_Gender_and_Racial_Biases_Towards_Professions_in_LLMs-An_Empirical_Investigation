Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Mike who took pride in getting to work at 4 a.m., and he decided to do something fun along the way, something that would have lasting impact. He began making signs and signs were made before he got to the office, but by the time he left, he had made and delivered around 1,500 signs to area libraries. That took a lot of energy and effort, so later, when he had some free time, Mike would drive around the streets of St. Louis, reading names and signatures in different cities and driving the signs to them. That's why in 2013 he changed the name (from sign-making to signature-gathering) and made the signs at the library's St. Louis hub.

This all came about when Mike needed a new hobby to fill the time between his current career as an electrician and after-hours work at the library. He was frustrated that nothing fit his needs that was fun and rewarding. Eventually, Mike realized that he really enjoyed signing people's names on their paper cards, he decided to give signing a shot, and he's been doing it since.
