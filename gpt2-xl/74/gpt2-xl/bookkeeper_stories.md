Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named James Whore; they'd been lovers for some time.

And one night, while James slept in the middle of a big hotel in downtown Los Angeles, it did all suddenly disappear—there were no receipts or receipts at all. The police didn't need records; the company he'd worked for, the one for which he'd worked for more than a decade, was just down the street from his hotel.

James and this mysterious bookkeeper had been "friends" for so long that he'd always taken care to make sure his boss was always up and about. Whore even took him out to eat at fancy restaurants whenever he went to Vegas—and James still couldn't forget him.

The strange feeling hadn't gone away; it still gnawed at him, like a long-buried secret. It was so much like the feeling he'd had when he was 18 or 19. Back then, when he'd first started dating the longhaired, tattooed waitress from the restaurant, the secret was still as deep as ever. Still, he'd kept his mouth shut—even from his family, until now. And yet, with those papers, everything changed and for the worst.

He took the papers out of his desk drawer, but nothing happened; it wouldn't budge. Even now, with his body still shaking, he still couldn't bring himself to touch the papers.
