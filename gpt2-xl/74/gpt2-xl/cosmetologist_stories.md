Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named "Nancy," or "Newton" if you were a lady, who wanted to be a nurse at a nursing home named "Newton Memorial Home." One of the owners, a man named Robert, wanted to get it through the local code enforcement division that the salon/bed and breakfast was "too close to residential areas." The cosmetologist sued her, in an attempt to get the home shut down. She won the case, in part because they made up the claim that the salon became a "commercial activity" on her own property. She lost her home. Now, she has a home on another property. The home she and Robert are occupying now, which has the same "commercial activity" designation.

But the argument can go both ways. There's the old version, "if the place looks too much like another person's house, it doesn't belong there." But then there's the version where you could say, "We have lots of different properties in the neighborhood, and we need to create a certain sense of identity for each one. So if someone wanted to make a different name for a home, they could sell the one they are not currently living in. For example, they can name it 'The Smiths' or 'The Smiths & Chivers' or 'The Chivers' or whatever, and we'll call that the current ownership. Then that buyer can decide to go on
