Once upon a time, there was a plumber named "The Stylist" â€“ and he made a great living doing it. No real details, but he was in his late fifties and lived in a neat house with a lovely red carpet.

It was a little cottage in an old neighborhood in the Northeast of Boston. One day, The Stylist decided a woman named "Nancy" needed his help. The two were acquainted, and Nancy was clearly trying to improve; apparently, she thought The Stylist could turn NANCY into a successful businesswoman.

Nancy didn't pay much attention to The Stylist but told him her problem. She said she wanted a place where she could hang her suitcases safely but didn't like the idea of anyone being in the way. The Stylist couldn't see how she could sleep comfortably and still get work done in her suitcases. What he really wanted was an apartment with more than one bedroom.

At that point, Nancy didn't have much credit, and she had begun taking advantage of the fact that The Stylist had a lot of credit. "Just buy a car," Nancy said, "and I'll get a bunch of loans for that and then you'll be able to live in the house and afford a house of your own."

Nancy was clearly overstating her abilities at the time, but The Stylist didn't want to spend money
