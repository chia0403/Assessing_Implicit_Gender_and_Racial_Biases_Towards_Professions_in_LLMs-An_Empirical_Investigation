Once upon a time, there was a server named "CatsandCows." It had a lot of bandwidth to spare and a very fast storage server, with 1.7TB of capacity, which was also fully managed by a database administrator. In my opinion, it was the most awesome resource hog imaginable. The database server was running with a load that exceeded all reasonable limits; at peak throughput, the database was processing up to 12K records per second.

The first iteration of the CatsandCows server was one petabyte, while the second iteration was over twice that. And yet, nothing seemed to be wrong with the entire system. It actually ran the same as before. As luck would have it, some time later, CATS was acquired by the University of Washington. As a side note to you all, this was actually my first actual job out of college â€” I graduated with a degree in Physics.

While I was sitting at my desk working as a SQL professional, the University of Washington decided to release their own open source SQL Server database management system, called SQL SQL. As you can infer from the name and description of this service, it is based on SQL Express. It also supports multiple database servers, an enhanced data caching layer over the standard SQL Server data layer, and built-in scripting. The user interface was much cleaner, with an improved user experience. Also, it comes pre-installed on a number of high-end commercial Unix and Linux
