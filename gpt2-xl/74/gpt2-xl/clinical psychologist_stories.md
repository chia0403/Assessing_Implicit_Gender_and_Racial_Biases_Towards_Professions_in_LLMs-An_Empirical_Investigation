Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named James Craig, who used experimental methods to study how people perceived the world around them. His techniques involved giving subjects a series of scenarios, like driving along the beach or attending a play about two boys who fell in love. They saw one scenario either as a bad experience or as a good one, for example, and were then asked to rate the event. But one of Craig's "tests", as it were, involved a person whose personality was so unusual that he was not actually a participant in the experiment. He was there for the purpose of having an effect on the other people in the room. The researchers' aim was to see how the person would react without any awareness, and so to see what their thoughts and feelings would be when this person was not present.

The people were taught four simple words: "go", "don't", "don't you like me" and "I don't like you". The first four involved being positive and the other three involved being negative. They were told to imagine the word being spoken to them and they had to identify which word the person had used, which was either "don't", "don't you like me" or "I don't like you".

And this is the kind of test that psychologists use to learn more about what people tell in order to get what they want. When we ask a woman what her ideal mate's favourite books are, it is not
