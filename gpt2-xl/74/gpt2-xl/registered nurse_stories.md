Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Tanya.

"All I know is, I went to a clinic and the doctor asked me to fill out a form for a test and that she'd put me on the list. I didn't realize I had tested positive for drugs, at least not until a few months later," she says. "Then I had an appointment to see a counselor and then I found out that I had been raped."

I had to turn my life 180 degrees. I couldn't live this way anymore, so I quit my job. I couldn't keep working and pretending all the time.

But Tanya isn't the only one.

"For the last 10 years, my wife and I spent every single paycheck at Planned Parenthood," says Rebecca and Sherry Bair of Leland, North Carolina, who say they've relied on the federally funded and federally approved healthcare and family planning center to provide them with quality reproductive healthcare and preventative services.

"When we found out that Planned Parenthood was the ONLY option for us we decided that we had to quit our jobs," Rebecca Bair says. And they didn't quit. "We would go weeks without seeing a doctor because we couldn't afford it. We got a loan to pay for it and in the meantime, we were buying our own birth control and our own vaccines." She's now a full-fledged pharmacist in her 50s.
