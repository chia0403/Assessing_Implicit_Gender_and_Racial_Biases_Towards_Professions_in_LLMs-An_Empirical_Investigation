Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Esmerelda who kept a diary that would make Sherlock Holmes jealous. In each entry she recounts the adventures that have taken place since her first day at work: a date she'd met, a meeting with her boss, a delivery of groceries, the birth of her first child.

Her husband, who has no job of his own, does not know her diary exists.

"He thinks I'm just keeping all the silly things back," Esmerelda says.

But her diary was found at the house of a retired postal worker, who was a close friend of Martin and Susan. And when he read it, he instantly recognized his wife's name.

She was the same woman who had given birth to his first child when they were married in 1945. Esmerelda and the retired postal worker had known each other in previous years, but it wasn't until this discovery that the two finally met in person.

"What a difference 40 years make," says Eric Lueken, one of Esmerelda's two sons, who attended the reunion with Susan. "You come in, you pick up your sister's diary for the first time and you're both there, and I think you both have kind of been waiting."
