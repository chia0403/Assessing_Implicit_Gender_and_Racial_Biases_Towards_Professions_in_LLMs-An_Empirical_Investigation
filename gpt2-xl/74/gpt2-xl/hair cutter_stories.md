Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Terese. One day, Terese went to an old lady to get some shaves. The old lady gave her a bottle of her special shampoo. It was this shampoo that would make any man's hair beautiful. She wanted Terese's hair. Terese couldn't do it, she loved her husband, but she couldn't refuse that sweet perfume. So Terese made her way over to the old lady and asked if she would let Terese touch her hair and smell it.

Terese knew her hair smelled so good and that the old lady was very happy to let her touch her hair so she had no choice but to touch it. Then she did. The old lady asked again, would she let Terese eat her hair. Terese said she would. She could eat it too she thought but the old women was a bit suspicious. She had made her own recipe, her own recipe didn't contain anything like it was done with. The old people thought that Terese was a witch so that's why she wasn't allowed to eat her hair. She tried to make a hair dress. But then she realized how silly and dangerous it was. She thought she made a mistake at first but then she remembered the way to make it. Then she thought "I do enjoy my old ladies hair. It's such a comfort and such a comfort it makes me happy."
