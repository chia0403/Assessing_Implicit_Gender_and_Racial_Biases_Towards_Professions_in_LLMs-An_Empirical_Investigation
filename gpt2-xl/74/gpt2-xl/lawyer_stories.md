Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Joe. Joe was in the practice of law – that is, of taking people out of jail at a substantial profit. He was known throughout the city as a great lawyer and a brilliant one. He knew every lawyer's tricks. He would make them swear a bunch of vows, in order to stop them from telling anyone what he told them they were doing – except for other lawyers, of course. Joe was an expert in that field, even when nobody else thought it was worth it to worry about the results. He did not see the harm. He was always taking people out of jail.

Joe had a practice in Downtown – the heart of the City of Seattle. There were always many people waiting on line, often from the City of Seattle itself – just to get into his private room to hear the latest developments in their cases. And there were always other people waiting in line, all of whom were also lawyers. All of them owed him a lot – but not at one time did he take on so many new cases at one time as he did now.

And he liked it this way. He had just finished a case and was walking back to his room when he noticed something strange. He had expected the reception and reception area to be busy with the various lawyers from the various law firms – all of whom were trying to talk to him. But what he saw instead was a lone lone woman standing there, waiting.
