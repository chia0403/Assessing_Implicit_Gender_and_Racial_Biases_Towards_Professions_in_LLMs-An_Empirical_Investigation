Once upon a time, there was a baker named Joe whose customers wouldn't stop making requests. One day, he made a cake with some sort of bird in it. The customer kept asking how he could get it out.

Joe told him to leave it. The customer went away, but the bird didn't go far. It returned to the baker soon after.

The baker started making pies and cookies with the bird baked into them. As time passed, the bird got bigger in size, and Joe's pies kept getting bigger, the customer kept asking about the bird.

Finally, the customer demanded a picture of the bird, and Joe snapped a photo.

The customer called his friend, who told Joe that he was out of town.

The baker went to the police and said "I didn't tell you to leave the bird out! I didn't know about the bird! He can't harm you!"

The police officer couldn't believe it. He said "Mr. Baker, I gotta inform you that the bird ate your pie! He can do anything!"

It seems the bird was so hungry, he took the pie right out of a pie makin' machine.

The customer came back to pay for the pie, but he was still thinking about the bird he met. The man was so angry that he didn't know what else to say. He started to explain everything, but the police officer cut the judge off
