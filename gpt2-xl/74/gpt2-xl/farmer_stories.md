As a matter of fact, according to his legend, John's father, John Sr., was a famous chef, an extremely well-known chef in a village in France (French villages are famous because they are mostly full of people who love to cook) called Roussillon (it rhymes with "Roughsville"). John grew up his childhood in a big family that was pretty famous, the family owned a restaurant that took care of people's tablecloths and dinnerware for them before they went out. The name of the company was a little joke between the parents, in the French dialect they called the village "Roussillon."

John had always been happy with his farming life, until the year 1864 (John's later father, John Sr., was a railroad worker and was forced to leave the family farm sometime before the year 1866, as all farmers who left their farms to work in the city ended up in the city because of the cheap food that was on sale there). In that year, the farmer John Sr. discovered he had a son named Charles, born in 1853. He later gave the baby up, but John eventually saw him grow up and knew he would be special. Even years later, in 1901, when Charles was an old man, in 1907, he took his own life. No one knows exactly why Charles' suicide
