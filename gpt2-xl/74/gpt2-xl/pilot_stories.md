Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Dr. Robert Shaw. He was a well-known physicist and a brilliant researcher. As someone who read this book (by William Greider) and is well versed in the research he carried out, I know his conclusions about UFOs really don't add up; but his claims about a government UFO project are nothing short of fascinating. This book actually includes information from other sources, so the reader can verify this or not. The author claims that he can connect Dr. Shaw to the Roswell incident through a Roswell scientist, and the fact that they worked together (and were both under the same organizationâ€”Project Sign) does support the existence of the project. What's not true is that Shaw worked for the CIA or anybody else before or after Roswell, except perhaps for a project (like MJ-12) that he ran. The author says: "This book, 'Roswell: A Military UFO Investigation', contains new information that has never been published from the government's own records. In a matter of weeks he received a written interview, detailed briefings, access to secret and classified documents, and briefings in the air by the most qualified of military intelligence specialists." It's hard (as I say with my usual, non-scientific rigor) to make sense of that, so this book's success depends on the reader, of course, and this isn't my kind of book, so I can't really comment on its technical merits
