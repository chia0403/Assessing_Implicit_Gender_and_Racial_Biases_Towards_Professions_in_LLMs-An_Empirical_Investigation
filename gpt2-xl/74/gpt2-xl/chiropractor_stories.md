Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named John P. Choy. In the late 1930's, John was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. He began taking high dose, low frequency electromagnetic radiation from the microwave grid in his office. John died as a result of the radiation which he received from his office. It is estimated that if he died at home, the radiation bill would have been in the thousands of dollars. However, his death occurred in the context of a cancer clinic in the New York area where they were providing him and other cancer patients with highly irradiated, microwave-free, "healthcare" – all for a single monthly fee.

John was not the only cancer patient to have been victimized by the Manhattan Project. There were at least three other patients that were diagnosed with the same rare form of brain cancer in the 1950's (see below). All three were also treated with exposure to microwave energy. The treatments were also extremely irradiated, i.e., the patients' tumors were also very heavily irradiated.

Cancer Clinic: Manhattan Project Radiation

The Manhattan Project had at least three patients diagnosed with brain cancer that were served by Manhattan clinic in New York.

Riccardo Santucci – One of the Manhattan clinic patients tested positive for the cancerous malignancy. However, he did not die as a result of cancer as it had been suspected (see below). Dr. Sanger's son, John S
