Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Harold Prince, who, with good good intention, wanted to create better versions of the classic horror movies.

The "horror" part comes from that. These weren't actual monsters of fear: they were human-looking beings with exaggerated physical features, and were usually wearing black and black clothes. In other words, they were "soulless" (in addition to "cute"). Although the audience knew these grotesque people were evil – and probably deserved to die – and they probably ought to be slaughtered, they were treated on-stage as a joke, a prank. (In the case of one of them, who is the subject of this entry today, it was played with a mannequin as the figurehead.)

As you might guess, the people who saw these movies were largely children, who made up the biggest audience for these films. Although they were also not killed on-screen, in a film-within-a-film, there were a number of scenes like this one:

A woman, and also often a guy, is afoot with a broom, cleaning up the floor. You can see (or feel) the broom sweeping dust and debris in front of her. This is probably the best thing about the scene: the dust! That's right, kids; dust is the real danger to your sanity nowadays!
