Once upon a time, there was a artist named Charles Lachlan Tackett. He did work for Dali, and he did other work for Walt Disney.

I was at the same school as him and did some of the same things. So I guess I was always kind of close-by.

There weren't a lot of artists in the "studio art schools" for children at the time. I think it was a more primitive and traditional form. So at least in my experience, the artists there weren't quite as high end as today's "pro" artists."

You've said that when you first started working, you had no idea what your job would be or where it would lead you. Can you just touch on that a bit here… Were you excited or fearful that you were going to be a painter?

I was afraid – I was afraid that it was going to be a boring job. But that fear was easily swept away by the things that I did to push myself. I think that just by wanting to do the things I was doing then, the more I began to look around and realise that there was talent out there waiting for me and that I could do my own thing. I was very fortunate not to be afraid of what I was about to do. Because if I were…well, I've been very fortunate all my life, but this was one of the few things where I was really afraid to do it
