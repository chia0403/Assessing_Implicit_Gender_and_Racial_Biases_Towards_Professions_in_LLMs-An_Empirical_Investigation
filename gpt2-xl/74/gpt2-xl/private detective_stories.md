Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Ray Kroc who would take on cases where you had to pay him to solve. It was Kroc who made McDonald's famous as a fast food chain. And for him to be successful, you have to make sure you've got people in there that want to be successful. And to get McDonald's to succeed, you've got to have great restaurants that the customer can come from every which way.
