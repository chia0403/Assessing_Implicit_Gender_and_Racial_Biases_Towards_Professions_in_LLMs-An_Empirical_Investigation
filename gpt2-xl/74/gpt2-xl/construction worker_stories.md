He was just the most ordinary and quiet of the average employees who worked at the time. But, something changed as he became a man of his own...

However, he, in his own thoughts, was quite curious about exactly how this old building had been torn down, while on top of that, how he could afford that kind of money.

Robert set out to the construction site, and to his shock, he discovered that the new office was completely deserted!

Robert began to do what he was not supposed to; he began to search for the whereabouts of the missing staff.
