The article claimed "there are no carbohydrate deficiencies in the diet," suggesting that there's been "an overreaction" to the carbohydrate issue, in all likelihood to benefit the corporate interests that have dominated the field, the interests of the processed food industry and, to paraphrase, corporate interests.

Of course, it hasn't gone down well. More recently, a group of nutritional scientists launched a campaign against Pitsiladis for what they see as a "dissent" from the scientific consensus. They've posted an e-mail message that they received on Pitsiladis's work, which says Pitsiladis is "an important nutritional epidemiology pioneer" who "stands on the fundamental and well-established evidence that the consumption of vegetables and fruit lowers blood pressure and heart disease risk." But the scientists see him as anti-nutrition because he hasn't
