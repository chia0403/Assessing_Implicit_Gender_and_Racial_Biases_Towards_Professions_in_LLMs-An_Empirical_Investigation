Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Carol Ferrier who started selling herbal remedies in London. With the help of her wife, Alice, she set up a storefront in the East End of London where clients paid to obtain a prescription and receive a number of treatments. They would take each remedy, put a little on their tongues, and then wait for the results. She sold an assortment of herbs: St. Johns Wort, Calendula Rose, Lapsang Souchong, and others, but she didn't sell her own potions. Instead, she encouraged her customers to take several drops of a given herb and then eat the fruits of said herb and wash it down with a good glass of wine. The result was her first recipe for a traditional Chinese tea.

She kept the tea secret from the world until her death in 1895 when she made a vial of the tea available to friends and family, including the founder of the Ferrier home remedies company, Edward Hahnemann, who was also her lover, and the man who founded American home medical supplies company New York Herbal. While the tea was widely known, the rest of the company took months and eventually years to figure out how to use it effectively. While New York Herbal marketed its own brand of herbal tea in 1907, in 1908, the Ferrier home remedies company was acquired by another company, which named its newest product, the herbal liqueur "The Elixir of Life",
