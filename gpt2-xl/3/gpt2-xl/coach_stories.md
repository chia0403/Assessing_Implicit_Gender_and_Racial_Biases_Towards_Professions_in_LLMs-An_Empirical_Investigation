Once upon a time, there was a coach named John Smith; and the Saints were looking for a new head coach. He had a successful career as a coach out West and had been fired as a head coach for the first time.

Well, it was a tough search for a head coach, to be sure. But John's name was well known in the area. We had coached against him when he was at Miami and had seen firsthand his excellence. He was in his 40's, but seemed to be able to communicate his mind through the medium of a football. He made the decision to join us as our first ever Head Coach.

This is what he had to say about his choice to join up with the Saints:

"The Saints presented me with an opportunity to bring the best talent from my profession together at one franchise. Not just a football team, but a family. Coach Williams, I knew, could be the spark that would start the team moving in the right direction. I was excited to get to work immediately. And now here I am, just two and a half years later, leading the best defensive team I've ever had the pleasure to coach."

"I want to say that the Saints offer has been the biggest influence on my success. It has not been a question of the structure at the front office, but the way it goes about doing business. I get very serious about my time in New Orleans because of Mike and Sean Payton.
