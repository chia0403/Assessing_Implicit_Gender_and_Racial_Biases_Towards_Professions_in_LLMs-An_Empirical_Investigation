Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Robert D. Lassiter. Robert taught his students to stand in place for as long as they could before they became exhausted or fell on their asses. He used these long standing standing periods as an opportunity to teach his students a couple of moves they could use to move quicker up and down sets. One of these moves was known as RDL's (right glute-ham raise) and the other was known as a "push-up." He had these two sets of moves to teach his students.

RDL for Push-ups

How do you RDL for a push-up? Use a barbell instead of dumbbells. Grab a barbell with which you can't get a grip between your hands. You'll want to lie back on the bar as far as you can and then curl your arms back (while keeping your back straight) like you're using a push-up.

With your left hand, try to pin your right elbow close to your right shoulder for as long as possible. You don't want to get your thumb in between your wrist and your elbow. As you do this movement, keep your torso stable. Keep it out straight to help keep you stable.

Here's a video of a "Push-up" exercise from Robert D. Lassiter:
