Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Kuklin. He is said to have been given a mysterious charm and used this to transform himself into a beautiful young woman who could be used as a tool of pleasure for men. The idea of Kuklin, a male object of desire, has been around for centuries and is still practiced to this day in some parts of Asia:

"Kuklin… is a man who, when aroused, enters into his physical form. When he is not aroused, Kuklin does not exist. His physical form is similar to a beautiful female, but when he is aroused, this form becomes erect, and he is transformed into a beautiful female. Kuklin… is a form that men, when aroused, can enter into, and it becomes a form of an attractive female." — Chinese Culture of Ancient China, Volume 1, 1905 (p. 1471).

As per the above, there are at least three possible outcomes when a woman is transformed into a Kuklin woman:

The Kuklin man's relationship with his physical body ends when he leaves for another woman who will use his body, perhaps permanently, for her pleasure.

The Kuklin woman changes into another form of woman entirely and leaves the man for another man who does not reciprocate her advances, thus keeping the dynamic of male/female dominance intact.

The Kuklin man dies and his physical body is destroyed
