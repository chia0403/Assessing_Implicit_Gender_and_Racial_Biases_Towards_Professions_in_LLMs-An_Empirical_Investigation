Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Robert McAvoy. He starred in a movie called "For The Love of Spock," and he's never really made another movie, ever. I think he's lost touch. I think he was actually kind of a big star back in the day.

I can't remember the name of the movie, but Robert McAvoy's character died and his wife and the director of the film, it turns out—they were married, so he got her pregnant. He got married and was like "OK, my character is also the father for all of these children now"—and that was like, that's the end of the movie.

"We've got a good idea that that's the most likely outcome."

So, "Where No Man Has Gone before" doesn't happen at all, because you guys know there's no way McAvoy was a giant star. And there's a lot of other people who are in that part of history that maybe you could have gotten.

So it's "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home."

[Laughs.] And the end of the movie.

You knew that we're going to end the Trek series with the Enterprise landing on a planet with no life. And it's the crew saying goodbye for a little while, then they return. Is that the end of the franchise?

Yeah, we're going to go into that
