This book is the culmination of over 10 years of work!

We've had 2 full-time writers translate what we wrote into our native English and edited the work.

We've spoken with world-renowned architects – many of whom are experts in their own right – to get accurate descriptions of what their buildings would look like.

Some of those architects agreed to be interviewed on camera about their buildings. We've used some of their photos and other data to determine exactly how the world's tallest buildings stack up.

We even have 2 top-class architectural photos to review!

All this and so much more could not be done without you.

With your support, this book could be out, say, a year from now. We have the entire production process planned out from the first draft to the final publication on June, 2016.
