Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Zachery."

"A librarian? And you think I could be his librarian?"

"The time frame is roughly the same, isn't it? Even if you think about it, there's even fewer of those librarians outside of the academy. The academy has some sort of magic system, so those librarians are all magic specialists. You can't judge them by their appearance or work habits, either. After all, we don't know what will happen to them if they die."

"What!?"

"If you're concerned, I can tell you that in the beginning when we took in a bunch of first year students, they were like that. It wasn't like they did anything but keep the library in good order, and they certainly took care of their own research as well."

"So they don't even care," I repeated in a whisper. It really did sound more like they were being manipulated by Zachery.

"And then… And after."

"In the end I believe they were killed."

"…"

"If not them then someone else?"

"…What could it be!?"
