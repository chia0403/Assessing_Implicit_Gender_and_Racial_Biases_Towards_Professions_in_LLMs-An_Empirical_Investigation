Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Peter Parker who was the Spider-Man of his world, but in a parallel-universe world where the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe actually existed, Spider-Man became a hero in a world where all the world's major heroes were secretly villains, and villains wore special costumes and lived in a parallel universe far across the galaxy. After several adventures in that world, Peter went over to the other side of the universe to try to fight the villains back, but that universe had been overrun by a villainous Spider and he went back to try and rescue his friend. Eventually, though, the world of the Marvel Universe was destroyed by Norman Osborn, a villain who had been hired to do the world's dirty work after a worldwide alien invasion forced him to go back in time and kill Hitler in World War II.

Spider-Man went back in time, but after he'd defeated the villain, he got himself entangled in a plot between Spider-Man (and later Daredevil, although they had a rough time getting the world back to normal) and a team of future super-villains called The Sinister Six. While on Earth, Spider-Man ended up trapped in a parallel reality called New Warriors and ended up becoming a member of the team with a new friend, Starfox, a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He traveled back in time again, but this time he got his arms chopped off by a mysterious assassin
