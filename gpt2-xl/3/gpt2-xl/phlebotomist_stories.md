Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Richard. Richard grew lazy, he didn't like working at his desk all day (and if it wasn't clear, I do NOT have a desk! lol), and he felt like having a pet. Because he had a home and he thought maybe he could take care of that pet. He got a big fat ball of fur and named it Bob. They lived together happily for a long period of time. When Bob was three, he ran away. The next year, they were no longer happy, and they married soon after. Richard and Bob had two kids named Paul and Jane. This was all I remember, and it is rather sad to remember. I also remember having a baby girl named Katie. Katie was born on March 8, 2009. Katie grew up to be very like her father â€“ lazy, and in a pet loving family.

In April of 2010, I noticed the ball of fur was growing long hairs. It was taking a long time for the hairs to grow out and I never made a new one for I knew it wouldn't bring Robert back. It bothered me when I thought about the situation. In May of 2010 I decided to let another pet out. I was getting on very well with my neighbor's little dog, but I knew I wasn't going to be able to take her on all the time at my place. The neighbor had always told me her pet had always been so tame
