Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Maggie the Sheep who had been given a goat by a neighbor. She took good care of that goat, but one day, they had to sell it to raise money for school. Maggie asked the neighbor if they could buy her goat from him, of course, she didn't say it was a goat her own goat, but she knew it was going to be a goat so they took her up on the offer and he bought her goat.

Maggie's goat, "Piggy" enjoyed her life, eating all the grass and grazing on it, and all the sheep liked her as well.

It was the year of 1943, and the war had started once more. With the war over, Maggie had to give "Piggy" away back to the neighbor, as it was time for school. Maggie sold herself and a friend to go to school, as she really had no money. After she sold herself and her friend, she was found, raped, beaten, and strangled to death as she was walking home.

The Goat was sentenced to life in prison for the crime of killing Maggie. She made the same choice to do the same kind of thing she did to her own goat.

So the next time the Goat feels like it would rather harm someone, than her own flesh, she should be ashamed of herself for it, she is making the same choice that killed her own
