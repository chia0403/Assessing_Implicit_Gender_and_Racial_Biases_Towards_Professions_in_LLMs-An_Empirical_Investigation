Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Bucky O'Hare and his son. Bucky was a farmer and his son was a farmer's son. Bucky was from a good-natured, easy-going man, who liked to be able to talk about himself with ease. The only people he did not like talking about were those who said bad things about him. Bucky liked to have people who shared his own interests and his own thoughts. People who had a good time at his table. It was so easy coming through his front door on Sundays, and getting into his car with him, that he was very much into the idea of being treated, at all times, as an equal. Especially if you had something he felt strongly about, like beef. Bucky was a great beef consumer, and was always a fan, and had his own beef book store where he would look through the cows to find the best cuts.


On another occasion, the man's wife had complained to their son, "Didn't you say that the butcher did not like his customers in the front."


"All the times I've been here, he gets along fine with us, mother," said the boy. "But in the back is a bit mean."


The story was over; not so long later, that very same man was murdered.
