Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Betty Crocker. I'm not sure where or when my awareness of this fact first surfaced, but sometime in the 1990s I stumbled on a television commercial on the subject of healthy eating, and it prompted me to think about my own nutrition. My mom was a real foodie, so I always wanted to eat what she liked. I spent at least four hours a day in the kitchen studying her recipes. And then I began researching and talking to other foodies like myself. What I found was that they had much the same issues I encountered. It seemed like every time I turned around, I was eating the same foods as everyone else. I began to learn how nutrition is so complicated.

To begin, I had to understand basic calories. It can be very confusing. Calories are the calories in one serving of food, divided by the number of grams of fat. For example, 1 serving of a burger has 240 calories, but it contains 16 grams of fat. Therefore, you would need 4 servings of bacon to make the same amount, or the 2.5 burgers you are looking for.

There is a lot of confusion about what your body really needs. You will need enough calories to meet your daily needs including both total daily energy and protein, but you will quickly learn not to eat more than these so you don't get fat. But what if you eat a lot more than you need? You might get fat
