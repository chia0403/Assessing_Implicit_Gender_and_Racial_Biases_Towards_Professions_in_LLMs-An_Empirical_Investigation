Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Andrew Cunningham who created a program that played a game called "Backgammon." It used computers to play backgammon and it took over Cunningham's brain. Now it's gone to the moon and you have to play backgammon too. The game is called "Cuba." Now you can play it at Space Camp for only $9.99.

The main objective of Backgammon is to get your "score" to higher than your opponent's, which means that the player with more points wins! You can be playing backgammon in outer space, in one of our 40 state-of-the-art space camps, around the world, or even in your very own living room by connecting your laptop to your Backgammon game room computer via the "Leverage" feature of Backgammon. The player with the highest score in each level wins the game!
