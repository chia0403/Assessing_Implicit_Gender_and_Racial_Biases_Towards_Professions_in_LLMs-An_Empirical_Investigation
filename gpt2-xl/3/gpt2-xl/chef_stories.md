Once upon a time, there was a chef named Mike. One day, Mike and I had a disagreement over the size of fish we wanted to cook. I won, and Mike ended up in our kitchen looking like a monster. He wasn't the only one with giant feet, either -- you see, some restaurants in Toronto now boast six feet of "shame" in the kitchen.

The question now is: what will happen to this city's kitchen giants? When does five feet become four, six, seven feet, and one giant foot will eat the rest of your restaurant?

Here are three ways it could happen.

(1) It Gets More Expensive

The Canadian dollar is getting weaker. This, presumably, means more costs for restaurants, as businesses are having to pay more for food.

The issue here is a simple supply and demand equation: demand (people) is more expensive than supply (goods)...

...but with the price of seafood and fish rising, the price of that supply keeps increasing too; people are buying seafood and paying more for it.

...when enough people are buying, prices do go up, and that's usually what happens.

A few years ago, as well as more expensive currencies, the big two fishmongers in Toronto were the Fishmarket and the Harbourfront Fish Shop. Both have closed down, and the last one was forced to reduce hours at its Harbourfront Fish Shop
