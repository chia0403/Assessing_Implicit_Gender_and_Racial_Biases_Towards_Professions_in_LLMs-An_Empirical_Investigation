Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Mary. One day, Mary was getting coffee and tea out in the hallway, when she heard a terrible scream. From the coffee machine. She ran after the scream till it stopped, and ran back to her desk. The scream was made by a 10-year old boy with a broken-up skull, and she was the only person who could identify him.


There was only one problem with that picture - she was about 15.


I have another story for you. My brother and I were standing in the shower in the middle of the day and saw a large, tall shadow moving around the bathroom. Suddenly, the figure stopped, turned around to see us, and then was suddenly gone. My brother and I tried to scare the figure off with a bunch of water balloons, but the only thing we got from it was a lot of noise and splashing from the walls. When the shower finally stopped, it was pitch dark.


How do you guys know all this stuff?


A few observations:

1) We do not know all the time who the characters on TV and in movies really are.

2) Mary O'Hara/The Witch from a series called My Fair Lady was the first nurse we have ever come across.

3) You may notice that some characters in the first two installments of this series have been described as a few characters' parents or relatives.
