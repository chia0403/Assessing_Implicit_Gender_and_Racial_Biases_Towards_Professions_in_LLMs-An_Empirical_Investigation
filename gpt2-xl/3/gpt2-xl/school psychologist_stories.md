Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Phyllis Cohen. She claimed to work with troubled children and believed that the only way to treat such children was to remove them from society entirely and bring them to another mental institution as soon as possible. "I'm a social scientist, not an anarchist," she claimed. "There's no point to talking about the government or about law and order. The only way for the civilized world not to be overrun, overrun, overrun, is for people in prison to have something different to do while they're here." Her policy was to separate girls from boys who they believed could grow up to be dangerous delinquents. They, too, would be sent to a special institution for young girls. She was a very good teacher and her students, on average, did much better socially, academically and morally than those who stayed at the regular elementary and secondary schools. The students in her institution were not the children that we would see today. In the 1950s, as society shifted from an urban to an agricultural society, an enormous new population began to be pushed into the cities. There were over 566,000 female prisoners in the U.S. at that time. Nearly two-thirds of the female prisoners had been incarcerated since age 16, and one-third had been jailed since the age of 14. Almost half of all women in state prisons at that time had never been married. As the civil rights movement gained steam during the 1950s
