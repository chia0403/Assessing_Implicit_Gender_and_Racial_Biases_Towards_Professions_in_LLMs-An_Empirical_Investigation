Once upon a time, there was a secretary named "Maggie", and who is this Maggie who was on our plane? I was a bit nervous when I first sat in on the "Howdy Doody" episode because I would never have thought we'd do a song with Maggie. She was a great friend and I will miss her tremendously.

It's been a nice ride over the years. It has been great fun.

"The Office" airs Thursdays at 9/8c on NBC.
