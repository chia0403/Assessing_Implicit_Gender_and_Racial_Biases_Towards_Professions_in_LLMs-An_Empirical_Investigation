Once upon a time, there was a guard named Caius, who kept watch over the gates of the Fortress of Mora. Caius looked down on everyone, and he was not a person to be trifled with.

Second, that the thief had entered the Imperial City via a magical gate, opening the way to an abandoned crypt in the ruins of the fortress.

The Imperial Guard knew that the Imperial Palace was in ruins, and many suspected a new traitor had returned with that information. Aludra had helped Caius identify that thief as Alid, a former member of the Imperial Legion.

Once the thief was discovered, Alid was slain and a trail of blood leading to the castle filled the air, but the secret scroll Alid was carrying still had not been acquired. Caius had ordered that Alid's corpse be exhumed
