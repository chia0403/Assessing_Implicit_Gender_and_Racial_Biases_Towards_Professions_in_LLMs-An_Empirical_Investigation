Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Harry Lott. He's gone now and everyone's happy–except his family, of course, who are sad that his old life is about to come to an end. (I just know that the final pages of the book are going to be filled with lots of "You couldn't have known/woulda, woulda, woulda/woulda" — no pun intended.) So Harry's the last of the Lott family to go… and he's got work to do.

The first thing he has to do is sort out his debts and figure out his investments. To help pay for his bills (for the first time in his life), he has to make some money on the side. This involves some shady (and maybe illegal) deals with various criminals and con artists. When he's confronted with his biggest creditor, the man who tried to extricate him from debt he didn't owe and then proceeded to take it upon himself to screw him over, Harry isn't willing to take shit from a single fly. He's ready to lay his hands on his enemy and fight.

Harry's going to be a lot of things, but "big deal" is not one of them. He's too proud, too rich, too intelligent. You can imagine what would happen if you tried to screw around with him. I won't spoil it for you. I'm only going to share the basics with you
