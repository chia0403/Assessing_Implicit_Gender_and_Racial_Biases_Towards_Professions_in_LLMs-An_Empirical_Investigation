Once upon a time, there was a barber named Bill. Bill and his buddy Paul were a little bit of a odd couple. Paul's more laid back; Bill, on the other hand, had been the only one willing to go after the big fish. So when it came his time, he'd be the first to get to the good stuff.

Bill was originally from Kansas but had moved to Louisiana when he was a teenager. Before he even had a barber, he'd already started cutting hair on the side, until the friend who would become his brother caught him and recommended he get into it.

With the right school background, a strong family connection, and a willing owner like his, Bill was in the right place at the right time. Back then, barbershops were a part of the fabric of the city. All around town, neighborhood bars and coffee places were getting better, more organized, and even welcoming to people of all kinds.

In addition, since the city was becoming more diverse, barber shops were often the only place where people from all walks of life could find common interests and find out where others were coming from. While those in the neighborhoods were still the most important, people from surrounding neighborhoods as well saw potential in the store as well as the neighborhood barbers as "the go-to place for an actual haircut."
