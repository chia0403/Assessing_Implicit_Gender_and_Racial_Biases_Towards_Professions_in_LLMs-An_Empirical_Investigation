Once upon a time, there was a professor named Bambi Lee. It was said he had an infectious attitude. He was always smiling, always smiling... Bambi Lee taught himself to speak fluent Spanish at the age of twelve. He learned the language and his first language in one evening! He has since learned Spanish, Danish, and other languages. Bambi Lee has a real smile on his face.

On the day of his passing, Bambi Lee was a regular fixture at the D.C. metro station. He even stopped in at the National Zoo, where tourists can catch his attention by flashing their cell phones or other electronics. He'd smile widely, smile often, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile...

The last time you saw Bambi Lee, he was a happy, healthy, happy little man.

The day before he died, he was working out at the gym, and one of the assistants who was in charge came in to tell Bambi that "it's about time". Bambi responded, "Thank god"!

Bambi was a very successful businessman, with multiple interests. He ran a major auto dealership business, and he was very involved in both local politics and fundraising. He was just getting to the age where his business dreams could potentially take off, so he was very, very excited about that for his son.
