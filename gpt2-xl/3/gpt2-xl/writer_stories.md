Once upon a time, there was a writer named Jim Butcher, who was an addict. He was in and out of rehab, he drank, he got high, he wrote. Then he got kicked out in order that he could get sober and write. He wrote in his spare time in the middle of the night, for an hour, by the window. When a woman who would eventually be his wife suggested he had to write about people in a book, he said yes. You will not believe what came of the next book, which is that novel The Dresden Files.

At the center of his story was the Butcher-Smith clan, whose patriarchs all have dark complexions from constant abuse. For me, that character is my mother. When I was a little boy, my mother would talk to me. And she did it again and again. She used to talk, in a way, with words. I don't know what my mother was telling me. I was able to see her—I can always see her—because it was just my experience, what she did. If someone walked into a room, I could hear the words.

My mother had a voice.

But I haven't heard it in years. I can hear it if I listen, but I just haven't heard it in a long, long time. All I do is live my life. It's been a very long time since I have heard a word of my mom's.
