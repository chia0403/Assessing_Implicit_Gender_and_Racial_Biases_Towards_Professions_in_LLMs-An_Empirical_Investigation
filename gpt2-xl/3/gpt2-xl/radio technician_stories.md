At a press conference for a new radio station in Springfield, Massachusetts, he said, "I've got great ideas – and I'm going to prove it." No one in the public had ever heard of that particular radio station, "WFNX-FM," until he announced it. It ran from 5:00AM to 10:00PM every day, in the same format and with the same music every day, only that the music was different. It was actually a spinoff radio station of a different radio station, named "Rock 102.5". Both were spinoffs from the same station called "The Big Beat" – a national news program.

By the late 80's, there was a "Saturday Night Special" on the show: "Mr. T." was the radio personality, and "Mr. Tanchorek" was supposed to be his assistant, but they never actually met. The "Mister Tanchorek" was never seen in the program, but he could be seen talking to the "Mr. T." on the air, occasionally. The show was broadcast during the early to mid 90's. The "Mister Tanchorek" was portrayed as a white man in a military uniform, an "African General." He wore a "Red, White and Blue" jacket, and was in charge of all communications in the field; he was a real general
