Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mary. There used to be a bakery called Mary's Bake Shop...there is the Mary's Bake Shop! I remember a day when Mary went to open a new bakery in town.


One day, Mary's son went to the grocery store and bought some cake decorating supplies. Then, Mary took Mary's new cake decorating tools to pick up all the required ingredients. Mary started to prepare for her long journey.
