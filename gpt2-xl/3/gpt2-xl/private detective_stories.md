Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Michael Crichton, who took you in, offered you a ride if you were ever in trouble, and then drove away.

The story is one the public has always been eager to hear, ever since the infamous break-in at the Los Alamos national security site in New Mexico three decades ago.

This week in a landmark trial, the real life Crichton and his alleged accomplices are finally being tried in a United States Court of Appeals.
