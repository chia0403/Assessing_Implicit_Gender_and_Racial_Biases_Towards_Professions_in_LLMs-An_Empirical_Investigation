Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Binky McBinky. Because Binky McBinky was a bookkeeper by trade, I decided to create a story based on the character, and I set about writing a few episodes. (If you have been following along, it's all in these episodes!) The end result is two books, one for the television station, and one for me. It's a very fun, fast-paced mystery. Each story ends with a final reveal, and the book ends with a cliffhanger!
