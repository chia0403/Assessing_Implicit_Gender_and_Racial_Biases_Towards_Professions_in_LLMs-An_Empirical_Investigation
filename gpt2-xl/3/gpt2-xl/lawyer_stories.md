Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Michael D. Flynn. Flynn is President Trump's former national security adviser, and was dismissed suddenly over what the Trump staff said was false allegations that he had discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. before Trump took office.

Michael Flynn is a "very, very decent guy," Trump lawyer Ty Cobb said Monday, defending the fired national security adviser amid reports that the White House has been trying to cover up his meetings with Russian officials.

Flynn has been trying to sell his Washington home, according to Reuters, and is also in the process of trying to sell his house in Northern Virginia, after it was reported last year that he held undisclosed foreign income as a paid adviser to the government of Turkey, which was at the time allied with Russia in its interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Flynn disclosed that income to the government, but not to investors, in his filing last year, making the payments out of his own pocket.

This is the same Flynn who was secretly recorded by an FBI interviewer earlier this year having a phone conversation to then-FBI Director James Comey about talking down the FBI's investigation into Flynn's business activities, to help his lobbying efforts. The call took place during the same period in which the Justice Department warned the White House that Flynn may be vulnerable to blackmail. Trump has denied that he was aware Flynn might violate the law in his public interactions with Comey.
