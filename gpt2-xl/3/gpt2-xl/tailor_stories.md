Once upon a time, there was a tailor named David Lee, who had one child. And David Lee had a job as a house painter. A woman walked in the door and said she wanted a skirt on the house, but there were no skirts. And that had to be done. So David Lee took to his computer and went online and found some old skirts he could not be arsed to return. He bought some new ones, but now his job as a house painter is now done.

David Lee's story is far from unique (although, sadly, so is his son and daughter). But the difference between them and all the rest is that he is doing what all fathers do.

David Lee is not only the head of the National Association of Tailors and Garment Makers (NATEGM). He also is the Executive Vice President of the National Federation of Tailors and Garment Makers of America (NFTA). I should clarify that both NATEGM and NFTA are the umbrella organizations that are responsible for the lobbying and legal battle to stop employers requiring pregnant workers to take off work.

And as David Lee sees it, it is not his job as a tailor, to make the skirts.

All David Lee has done is tell employees what their job is supposed to be; make clear what their responsibilities are; and help employees make a choice. He is also the head of an organization whose membership is much larger, who has more power
