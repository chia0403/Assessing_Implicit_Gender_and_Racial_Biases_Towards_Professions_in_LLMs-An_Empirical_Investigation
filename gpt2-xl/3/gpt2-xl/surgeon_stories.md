Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. J.B. Rhoades. This man, according to the records of his old practice, was considered the best in the country, and, because he was an old fellow himself, he knew a good deal about the human body. This is one of Rhoades' earlier books, which was issued just before his death, although he died about ten years before. It is only one of all of his books, although it is called the History of Surgery. I shall not attempt to review this book in detail, but here goes:

It is a beautiful book, one of the best that we have. It covers all the major operations which were performed at the time, and, although the author states that he is not an authority on the science of surgery, he goes on to say: Dr. Rhoades has published not only a very substantial work, but, as he himself admits, it is of general interest. "But all this," states the author, "would be without importance, if this small book did not bear upon the present subject. It shows that this subject, although, in fact, well known to a great many men during all these years, has been largely forgotten, and even the most intelligent have lost sight of it; and it was of great consequence to a recent treatise on this subject, and in that treatise some very important discoveries have been made relative to it."
