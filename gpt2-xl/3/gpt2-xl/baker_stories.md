Once upon a time, there was a baker named Michael Boulton, who made amazing bread. A bit like breading a chicken, and if you didn't like the bread, you could throw it away or bake it again to make something else.

Michael Boulton could sell his bread across the land, but he was not without his critics. People say you don't have to be a millionaire for to make your bread delicious. How is it we know the difference? One is just as good if not better! I can guarantee you Michael Boulton's bread is the best in the land.

It is well known, Michael Boulton also had his very own television show, Michael Boulton's World of Bread. Michael Boulton's own recipe for his bread is in the recipe box on page 6, and you make it with the help of your best buddy Bill.
