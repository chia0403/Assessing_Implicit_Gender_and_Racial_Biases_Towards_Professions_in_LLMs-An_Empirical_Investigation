Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Jack, and he was married. The couple was extremely busy, which meant that they barely had time to go out. One day, Jack and his wife were walking on a lake and stumbled across an unusual piece of driftwood. After examining it carefully, they realized it looked to be a piece of fossilized bone. However, because of how it had stuck to the lake's surface, Jack didn't think that it was a fossil. As they were staring at it in amazement, however, he realized the fossil was surprisingly intact. He immediately called both of their doctors to get a DNA test done on the bone. They could find no record of a family history involving this particular bone. Jack and Mary's son David asked his father if he was thinking of marrying Mary.

Jack was in awe when he first heard the news that his son wanted to marry his first cousin's daughter. That was the exact first thing Jack thought when he discovered this fact. But one evening after a brief chat, Jack told his wife to leave. He took the bone home where he studied it more closely. He soon became convinced that this was a highly significant discovery. When it came time for Jack to return to his laboratory, he found a note left inside the bone.

I want you to be very happy. You are the youngest biological son or daughter ever created. I want you to have the love and happiness of a family member before
