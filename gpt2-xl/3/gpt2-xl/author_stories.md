His work became the basis for the birth pangs of the green movement and we owe it to these wonderful ideas, to remember the lessons they teach in order to solve our own problems now.

With a population of seven billion, we are already nearing Malthusian Limits. When we hit this limit, we can do nothing except see our species become extinct. Or, at least, that's what the green movement thinks.

Not to say we should have no children. But we should consider what it would mean if we can only have one.

Consider what it's going to mean for the planet.

We know that the world's population has doubled in the last six decades. We also know that each individual person is responsible for an average of 2.6 pounds of carbon pollution per year. We know that the number of people consuming global resources is rapidly growing. But we
