Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Bruce Barton — with a Ph.D. in computer science — who was searching for something "intelligent" in the computer systems that ran Facebook. It felt like looking at a computer, he would note, "as if it had a mind of its own," and for five years he found what he was looking for. "The'mind' that I found in Facebook," he recalls, "was one of those systems that couldn't learn and had no sense of self...

For example, it had a pretty simple and straightforward rule: You just have to post to a page once every ten minutes or so." Barton had found what was missing. In 2011, he released the code for his Facebook algorithm on the Internet. Barton, who now consults for major corporations, was in the peculiar position of having been at work while his code was being stolen. He was also in the strange position of having published code that showed off the inner workings of a computer system that he had hacked. His code was the source code of an algorithm, or a computer program. Unlike standard software, which you install and use, code that Barton released had been made publicly available, and it could have been copied and deployed anywhere, including within the vast corporate network of Facebook.
