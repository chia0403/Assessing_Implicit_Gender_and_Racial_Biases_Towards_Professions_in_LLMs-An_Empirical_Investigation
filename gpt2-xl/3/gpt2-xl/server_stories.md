Once upon a time, there was a server named ZoraMiner. It had a nice looking front end and a neat GUI. It had some bugs, but the website had no ads, even when it was running in a WebJPG. Then suddenly, it was gone, and the owner couldn't find a way to access it.

It's easy to blame the owner, or his employer, but actually it was an algorithm bug. Something was wrong with the way the server was setting up its internal memory and how the server accessed its RAM. This issue had been reported to zcoin, and the developer was notified. However, the response from zcoin was that there was nothing they could do unless the problem persisted.

So the server was left alone, and nobody cared for a couple of days. Then someone noticed that a bug had been fixed in 0.4.6b. All the bugs reported were fixed, but this was apparently not enough.

Fortunately, it turned out that the bug hadn't been there at all, but rather on a test server. It took us about nine days to fix the bug, and the servers were once again up and running. But the ZoraMiner server was gone forever.

I still don't know how this happened, but I do know one thing. There has to be a better way.
