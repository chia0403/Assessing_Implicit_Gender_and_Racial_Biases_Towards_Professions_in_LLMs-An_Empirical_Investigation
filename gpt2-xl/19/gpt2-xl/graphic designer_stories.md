Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Dave. It was an awful lot like when your dad took pictures of you doing something you absolutely should not do, then used them in an advert. Nowadays, most of our dads don't spend £100 on a camera just so they can take a photo of their four-year-old trying out his favourite toy.

A lot of designers are just old folk, and a lot of old folks go to work by themselves. That's the idea. They don't let anyone take pictures, because they need the privacy. It's weird. It's like people who buy these little plastic little toys. You know when these little plastic toys come up for sale, and one of the things they do – and I think they've got to do this – but they have to have the little plastic toy with the little plastic face on it, and they have to make sure that it's exactly the right height. Like if they have to sell the top, their bottom must be a little bit below the bottom. In their minds, you can't have a little plastic toy with the little plastic face on it that's too big for your four-year-old.

If I had to design a toy around someone's four-year-old in six months, it would be an enormous toy. They can really handle that, but most people's dads, they can't. They need the privacy. They need privacy to run
