Once upon a time, there was a pilot named "Chloe Bennet."

The first scene from this first season of Marvel's "Daredevil" featuring the superhero comes courtesy of FX's "American Horror Story: Freak Show" (10 p.m. May 8), in which a young blonde woman named Chloe (Alison Pill) was introduced in a story that had her living in the now-abandoned farmhouse where the infamous freak show took place.

But how was Chloe in the years she spent in this haunted farmhouse? What was she like at work? How did she interact with the family that lived there? And how did she spend her weekends?

"American Horror Story: Freak Show" takes a peek at Chloe's character in early episodes of Season 1, which will premiere this fall. The series also features "American Horror Story: Coven" (10 p.m. May 15, FX), which sees the original actors of the horror anthology playing two of its most memorable characters â€” the original Lady Gaga and the original Dr. Arden.
