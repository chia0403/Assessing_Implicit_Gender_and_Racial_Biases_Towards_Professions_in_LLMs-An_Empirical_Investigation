Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Lacey.

(Lacey) was a real person who lived a full life in the real world but is now just a part of a world that has had its fair share of alcohol, love, sex and the occasional murder.

Lacey and the staff of The Moth and The Flame are a love letter to good booze, good people and great stories. It's got a great atmosphere with great stories and great drinks. Every story, for the most part, is told with a smile on the server's face.

Lacey, as any bartender knows, would have been an excellent barkeep – but since we all love a good tale, she took her skills around the world. She met her future husband in a bar near Moscow, where they've been living together for the last 18 years. Lacey, at one point, had seven husbands. You've definitely got two women on here with seven men.

If there is a bartender for whom beer is more than just its watery liquid state, Lacey is it. She's been to London, Scotland, London, London, Tokyo, Istanbul, Moscow, Cairo and Bangkok and was recently back in the U.S. where she worked in New York's East Village until recently.


Lacey's stories (and her great bartending skills) aren't just for drinks, though – you can ask her anything about the city she loves to
