Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Bill. Bill was one of the greats. He was so good that he had a whole business solely based on his knowledge of travellers. It was called "Travel Agent."

Travel agents were the best people you could meet. They were the best friends, brothers, sisters, mothers, lovers, friends, lovers, sons, daughters, fathers, sons, daughters, mothers, stepmothers, brothers, sisters, fathers-in-law, stepmothers, sons-in-law, and more. All of this was summed up in one sentence from a travel agent you will meet today.

"When I was young, I was always a fool, always a fool, Always a foolâ€¦"

I have known some of the finest travellers in history. They are the people who have taken the most precious journey of all, those epic adventures across the seas, across the world, out of the village, out of the city, to find the place to be, to be a traveler. They are the people who have seen the best and worst of things, and have always found peace in them.

How lucky we mortals are to share the same Earth, so close and so far. How lucky we are to dream of such things, with all our might and wits, to risk it all for so brief a time.

We are blessed to be the world's greatest travellers.
