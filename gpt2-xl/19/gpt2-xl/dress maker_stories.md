Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Dolly (no, it's not a reference to Dolly Parton ). He had a little shop in an alley behind the house at 28.8 E. 27th St. in NYC. His father, Dr. Dolly, operated a local hair salon, and he had inherited his father's love for dresses, lace, and hand-sewing, and thus he was inspired by the dress making arts. He went to college and got a PhD in dress making.

Dolly liked to make small, feminine-designed dresses which she would take up to the Westport Country Club in Connecticut, where she would have a good dinner and a dance. And once she was up and done dancing, she would often slip into one of her fancy dresses to get back to her home.

Once at the club, she met George Burns and Liza Minnelli.

I was wondering if George could shed anything light on the Dolly Parton connection because it is something my parents mentioned quite often when I was younger. I think it was because George was in the business side of the music industry, so I'm guessing she must have also been an aspiring singer when she met these two singers. Anyway, I was wondering if she had anything to do with the movie. Would love to hear your thoughts.
