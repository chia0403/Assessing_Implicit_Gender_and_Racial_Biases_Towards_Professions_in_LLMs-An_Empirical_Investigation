Once upon a time, there was a chef named Paul Qui. And there, in this episode, Paul Qui was an enigma. But we've known him for years, and that enigma's finally been revealed: Paul Qui is a fraud and a cheat. On my journey through the most controversial chef in the Bay Area, I uncovered the true story of this man and the man behind him. The most influential chef in San Francisco's culinary future left no stone unturned to ensure we would never see him in action – and Paul Qui certainly found them all. The man, the myth, the legend. Today I am grateful to talk to David Chang. But David Chang… isn't he? Is he real?

Today's meal is a collaboration between myself and our very own Chef de Cuisine Adam Richman. This is his first ever episode, and one of the best things about his career has been the authenticity of his cooking. Not only does he serve good food in a very authentic setting, but he has a passion for the food he serves that has led him and his team to work in dozens of kitchens across the United States. This week Adam joins me to talk about food, authenticity, and the importance of community. And I promise it's as good if not better than you've ever had. So sit back, take a deep breather, and allow the magic of Adam Richman to envelop you.
