Once upon a time, there was a coach named Mike Ditka.

Now, the former Bears and Cardinals coach is making the rounds in South Florida speaking to potential NFL executives and talking football.

He told the Miami Herald on a recruiting trip:

"People will say it once, but people will say it a hundred times. Look at it this way: What we have in Chicago, we have in the NFL. I love it. They'll still say everything about Chicago is a beautiful city, but what I feel about it is, here, they're too uptight. This is what makes football so great: That there's no real rules."

Ditka made $19 million in his NFL career, the fifth highest total in the NFL and the most among all coaches.

On what he loves?

He said that one quality everyone should strive for in their lives is "character." I think that's what the NFL craves.

So which is it in his opinion?

Ditka: "You have to have, for me, character. You have to have love for the people around you. And then it's hard to find it. I've found it. … If you have all those things right, you can turn anything into something great."

He also said: "I grew up in the '60s. … It's just a different era. People are really just on separate islands now
