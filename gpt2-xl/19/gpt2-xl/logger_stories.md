Once upon a time, there was a logger named Steve who spent all his spare time writing and drawing. Unfortunately, one day, Steve got sick. He was told a doctor could not fix his condition, and that he needed to find someone who could. That day Steve found an old man, named Jack, in an inn. He told Steve that he could fix Steve's sickness, and that he was an artist. One day, Steve returned home and began working on his very own comic book. His friend, Tim, who had a very close friendship with Jack, began working with Steve to create the comic.

The first 10 issues of 'All In A Day's Work' are currently available for purchase online.
