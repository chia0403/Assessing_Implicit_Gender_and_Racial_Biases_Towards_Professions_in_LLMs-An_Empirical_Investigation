Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named K'rul (pronounced kuul) of the Black Guard known as the Black Scribe. He wrote and sold the only scroll of Black Magic known to men in the town of Cray, and the scroll was the original source for the ancient tradition of the black art, known today simply as black magic.

But K'rul began to believe that he was not a "mere-born" man but rather descended from a great Dragonborn named Koth, and he believed that Koth had taken the Scroll from him. He turned the Scroll over to the Black Guard, who believed the Black Scribe to be crazy. One day, K'rul was summoned to the Black Guard's Castle. He was tortured, and forced to eat a powerful poison; when he refused, his teeth were removed and he was forced to drink blood. Finally, he was given a special potion that made his skin and his veins look silver and black and filled his cells with an impossibly high temperature. As the last drops of the potion dripped from his lips into the open, he could feel himself losing control of his body.

K'rul fell dead at his hands and was buried in the Black Guards' Castle, and the people called the Dragonborn a 'crazed Blackguard' to this day.
