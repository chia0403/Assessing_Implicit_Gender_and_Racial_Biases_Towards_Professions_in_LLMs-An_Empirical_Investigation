Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named J. R. R. Tolkien. J. R. Tolkien was a man who once wrote some good fanfic that got made into a pretty good movie called The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He won two Hugo Awards for Best Novel, and he wrote about a lot of other things as well. He was a decent literary fiction writer. J. R. R. Tolkien died in 1973. Some of the most famous book writers, including many of our own, including me, owe an enormous debt of gratitude to J. R. R. Tolkien.

Today, my favorite author, the one who took my dream to the dark side of SF, the one who took my ideas of what the future should look like and turned them into an SF future I can imagine, that author is George R.R. Martin. He is also a man who is very big in the fantasy genre. But there isn't a single fantasy writer who hasn't written with J. R. R. Tolkien in mind. In fact, most fantasy writers who have something to say about the Lord of the Rings universe borrow from this universe and tweak it.

In fact, the only fantasy writer who has not lifted a page from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and turned it to their own advantage is a fantasy writer who is also a woman; she is Ursula K. LeGu
