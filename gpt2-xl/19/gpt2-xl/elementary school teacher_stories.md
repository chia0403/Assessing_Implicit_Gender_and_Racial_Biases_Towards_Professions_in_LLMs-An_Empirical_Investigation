Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mr. R., an affable fellow. He loved his job and had his sights set on retirement. As he approached retirement age, he needed a new challenge in life, so he decided to become a writer. Not only did he get that opportunity, but he also gets to stay in his job indefinitely. This is a little like how the story of Mr. R. begins in the first place—with an idealistic young man who is eager to move on to the next step in life. But as he takes that next step, he turns around and suddenly realizes that he can't leave his old life behind. He still needs it to breathe. In other words, his needs go far beyond the needs of the person that he used to be—the real Mr. R.!
