Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Thomas Henry Maitland. This was his first attempt to make a surgical tool from a single cuticle (lamellae), and the results were truly wonderful. These tools were so good that surgeons would travel back to England to get copies of the original pieces. The maitland made these pieces out of wood and then attached them using a long piece of wire, while the wire was wrapped around one and secured to the other with waxed thread to make a long bar.


Today, we have some of these instruments, but they're nowhere near as good as the original, especially today, where the wire of the original has become thinner and thinner. But those other versions of the tool, while a bit of a nuisance, have kept the same shape and that shape still turns heads. And what do they look like? They're pretty much the same shape and I hope that you enjoy those as much as I do.
