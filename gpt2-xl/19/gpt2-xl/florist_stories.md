Once upon a time, there was a florist named Mrs. Baskerville, and Mrs. Baskerville's son named Harry. When Harry was eighteen he enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point. He then continued on to the Naval Academy at Annapolis, in the United States Navy, where he graduated in April, 1922. In 1923, with a bachelor's and a master's degree in biology, he became a captain in the United States Navy. For the two years he held this position after graduating, Harry wrote two books, in addition to his numerous scientific and literary publications. In 1930, he accepted a position as the science adviser to the United States Secretary of the Interior, Albert S. Cushing. Soon he published an essay entitled The Natural Environment. One year later he published a book called The Great Mistake: The Causes of the Great Depression in 1929, entitled The Nature of the Problem and the Solution. For his work on the natural environment, Harry received the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1933, for the book "A Naturalist on the Interior World". In 1936, Harry married Mary Etta Baskerville. They had two children, three sons and a daughter. Following the death of Mary, Harry was elected to the presidency of United States Senate for the remainder of the 1930s and 1940s. Harry died on October 22, 1958.
