Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Alice in Wonderland who worked at the New Hospital in New York. Every day she was a little slower than everyone else, but she managed to be quite successful at her job. Alice's boss, Dr. Watson, also was quite good at doctoring, so she became his assistant. They worked perfectly well together until, on a particularly busy day, Dr. Watson's hands were very unsteady and, after going several days without coming to work, he complained that Alice was too slow in her medical appointments. This made Alice very angry and, at that very moment, she became much more nervous. "If he had been in my place," Alice remembered, "it would have been impossible for me to maintain anything like a steady pace. What would I have done? I would have been so agitated that my medical work would have suffered and I would have been unable to do my business. I therefore decided to take revenge upon him for his slowness at my medical work. I made a number of small incisions in his hands and told him what I wanted him to do. The doctor then came home, thanked me for my ingenuity, and thanked me again for sending him by his hands such a thrashing. We never saw each other again."

The story may not sound very funny, but how many times do we meet someone experiencing an unhappy situation and immediately resort to a quick, and almost too efficient, remedy?
