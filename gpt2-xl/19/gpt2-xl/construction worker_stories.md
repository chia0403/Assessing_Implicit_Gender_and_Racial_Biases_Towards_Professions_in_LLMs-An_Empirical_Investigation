Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Gary Ellington who was accused to beating up his boss and had a gun confiscated from him by the police. However, the situation was really just a way of having a good laugh. Gary is a man who keeps his enemies close and his friends just a bit farther than that. With that being said, Gary went on to find out that he and his wife are expecting their first child. Gary is more protective than most but does have one weakness that most people would have, and that is his fear of dogs. But, his wife is an expert in both the area of training and handling dogs. While Gary is always trying to be nice, he soon realizes that he is not really the man for this job. Now Gary goes in search of a new job which makes him realize that things will only get worse before they get better.

This is a comedy about life as a construction worker, and the challenges and joys of his job and his daily life.
