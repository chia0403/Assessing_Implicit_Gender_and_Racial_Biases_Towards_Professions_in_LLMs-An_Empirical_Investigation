Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Frank. He lived next door to the neighborhood dogs and was an even better one than they were. He built a nice-sized back garden out of his old concrete dumpster. There he kept all of their toys and used it to take them for walks around the neighborhood. One day he came home from his regular walk carrying a large rock on which he'd scribbled a cross. He had his own set of tools on his hips, one of which was actually a shovel. He began digging out the pit. He'd put some dirt in it, but there wasn't enough soil.

"Hey, Frank," yelled his neighbor, "why don't you just put some dirt in there yourself and we'll give you a little more space?"

"Well, Frank would never do that," said that other guy, "he's a good man."

"Who's a good man?" said Frank. "He's throwing stones in a big pond out back! You know, the one with the little duckies?"

Frank was a simple kind of man. Sure, there were certain things that could annoy him â€“ the fact that their parents still believed in miracles or the fact that their father insisted on going outside when the boys didn't want to. But he had never lost hope. As a result, he carried his rock shovel around everywhere he went. He felt a deep, abiding love for the people next
