Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named "Bill" who worked at the Auto Sales Corporation in Midwood, New York. For the first hour each day, the guys there were expected to turn around the car in less than half the allotted time, thus putting him in the number one slot for the day's best mechanic. However, Bill liked to try out new parts for each car. Sometimes if he'd had a particularly rough car on the last day, Bill would add a new component to it for no extra charge. He would do this and then claim the work. Other times he'd spend the day trying out a part for this particular car, which he didn't have the money to buy. Bill's attitude towards the mechanics he worked for was to treat them as cash cows to him. He knew that he could get the best parts for other cars more cheaply, or pay the guys to do this work. He'd go to work and then claim the best mechanic by doing the following:

He waited until all the autos that the guys could do at the day's best dealer were gone and then he waited. When he wasn't done in the afternoon, he'd go to another dealership and wait a little longer before claiming another one.

So, the "best" mechanic gets all the best parts and then claims it, and the mechanics at the other one don't have to pay. Sometimes the guys at the better dealers try to give Bill some things.
