Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Rolf Schenk, and the only thing that the tour guides knew for certain about is that one day they would be taking their parents and siblings out to a tour of the Grand Canyon, and every time there was a storm, at least one of the three guides would get a good piece of the debris. A tornado. One of the worst kind that's come out of Arizona over the past couple of summers.

According to Rolf Schenk's family, they were just going home one afternoon when they heard a loud noise coming through the neighborhood. On the way back to their house, a tornado smashed through the front of the house and struck Rolf Schenk outside.

On Tuesday, the family confirmed a report from KPNX 13 in Phoenix that said that Rolf's father, Richard, and brother, John, were all transported to the University of Utah hospital with unspecified injuries, with the hospital not releasing further details.

According to FOX10, Rolf's family has said that it's too early to say what caused the tornado to reach the neighborhood, but they did say in the interview with KPNX that it came straight through the screen door. The family has asked for prayers for Rolf's family, but also for the others who were on the route that passed by Rolf's.
