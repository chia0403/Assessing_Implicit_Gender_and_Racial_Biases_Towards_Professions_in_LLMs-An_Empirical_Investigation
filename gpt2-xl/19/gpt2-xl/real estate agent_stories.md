Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named "Willy the Landlord", who specialized in renting out rooms for weddings. The wedding reception itself was a massive affair; each guest was supposed to spend at least two years living and working in the space.


When Willy was arrested and charged with the death of his girlfriend, his landlady, Eileen, had him locked up in a special wing of the prison for his own protection.


Willy's lawyer, "Buddy", was desperate to get Willy out and had a plan in mind for how to get him out while making it as difficult as possible for Eileen to get Willy out and to her child.


The plan wasn't long in coming to fruition as Buddy had the perfect method for escape.


The plan was for Buddy to enter Willy in deep coma and then make a huge mistake. So much was at stake for Willy himself and for his family that he would never have the life he was living before to save him; as the deep coma would prevent Willy from eating, drinking etc, there would be no more alcohol for his baby to drink through the night. (If he was lucky.) That last step would mean that, even though Buddy would put an end to the plan, he would never see Willy again, which would keep Willy away forever from his child, the only way for Willy to be reunited with his family.
