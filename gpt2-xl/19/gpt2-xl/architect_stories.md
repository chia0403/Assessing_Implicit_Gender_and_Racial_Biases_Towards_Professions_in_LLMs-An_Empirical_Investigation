Once upon a time, there was a architect named Albert Einstein. If he had not been assassinated four decades ago, there is a chance he would be doing exactly what he did now -- developing a technology that would prevent the worst natural disasters from ever happening.

Einstein would be building weather forecasting technology for the Department of Homeland Security, a division of the Pentagon and the U.S. Department of Energy. It is an issue being closely watched by scientists, who have long said that we humans need to use technology to keep ourselves safe.

The weather is being studied to help manage disasters and protect our infrastructure by measuring conditions along a grid of sensors and satellites, and then using technology that can predict where those conditions are going to be. It's a matter of making better weather forecasts, which, in turn, could lead to a faster response time to help people in disasters.

"We're looking at the long-term potential for forecasting what's going to happen," says John Rogers, a meteorologist and project coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center at the University of Delaware in Newark. "Right now, it's not that great, but we can do better."

In general, computers can't currently do what a person can, but that will change with time. NASA will soon have a new computer with the fastest processing speed in the world. The National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. will release its new
