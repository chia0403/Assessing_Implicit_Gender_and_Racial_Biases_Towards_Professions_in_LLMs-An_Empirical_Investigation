Once upon a time, there was a judge named William Goudge of Kansas. But he was not pleased with the way things were going. Goudge had seen too much.

The new justice was a shrewd fellow who had seen that the government had no intention of enforcing the federal sodomy laws. He put several district attorneys out of their jobs before the law was repealed. From then on, the prosecutions were a waste of time. No one was ever arrested for violating the law.

And so Goudge, like the first judge in America, concluded: "How can men who are both judge and prosecutor stand on such different principles when it comes to human rights?"

I suppose that's why we see so many judges who have the same problem.
