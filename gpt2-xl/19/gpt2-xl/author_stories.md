Once upon a time, there was a author named Isaac Asimov. He's been long gone, and, really, we should be sad about this, if for no other reason than to remind people that he really is gone. But he isn't dead — he is simply out of print — and I think it's only fair to postulate his demise as part of some grand conspiracy. Now, this may sound far-fetched, but there is a possibility, I'm betting, that Asimov might have actually been murdered by his own fans: the faithful, who wanted to see the author's writing reborn in some format. But where would Asimov be if he were not dead? He would be in a different place, and would, perhaps, not even exist, and this might provide insight into the death of a true science fiction icon.

Asimov was a classic example of science fiction in its original form: novelists had the opportunity to create characters, locations, ideas, plot, etc., all of which were the very fabric of science fiction. He also offered a certain level of social commentary, and perhaps this was just how it was at the time — he was the same kind of crank who went around condemning television as nothing more than a tool of social control. Asimov, of course, was a highly critical and critical thinker, so his ideas, much like his novels, might often be taken by modern readers as merely a commentary on the problems and complexities of the society
