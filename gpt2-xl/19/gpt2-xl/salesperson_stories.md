Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Robert Ladd.

Ladd used to sit behind the counter and talk to consumers about their shopping needs.

And then, it wasn't so much about talking, it was about getting to know the consumer.

He would invite a customer in for a meeting, and then they'd sit down and talk in a group.

The next day, Ladd would return to that meeting and ask questions.

For example: If you wanted to buy that new book on the history of the automobile or a piece of furniture, would you talk to your friends about it, or would you wait for the catalog to come in on the Friday?

That's what he did with every customer.

He talked to them like friends.

And then they became like friends.

After they began chatting, they became more like friends and began trusting him, and that was how the shopping experience changed for Ladd.

And so it's a principle that we can apply across the board to help us cultivate friendships with people who we haven't done anything significant for.

There's a way to approach everyone you meet and start building relationships.

But I want you to think about your behavior.

First, consider people you've been dealing with and people from your past.

Now, I'm going to use an example that happened to me.
