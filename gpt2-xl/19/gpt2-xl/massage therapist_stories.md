Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named "Mr. X" whose job was to work out the muscles in the back of the ladies' legs and lower backs. He would massage and then give these women "camps" of massage, with many women working a few different muscles in tandem for a full hour or so at a time. If a woman was nervous, it was his job to encourage her. He would then take notes on how the woman was feeling, and she would be tested the following week on these results.

Mr. X used to train his female clients by showing them pictures of him. He told them that if a certain man looked the way that the woman was looking at this or that picture, they should work the muscles that were shown just the same. To do so meant the woman would likely to relax, which is exactly what the client wanted. When a woman was ready for her test, Mr. X would hold out his hand and ask if she wished to "work with" him. If the client answered yes, she would be asked to "work" on some other muscle. If the woman said that she did not want to do this, she was instructed to give as little work as possible as the lady continued to relax and get comfortable.

Another woman, an older woman, had come to see the man when she was feeling a bit "overworked" as she put it. Mr. X was a very nice man who
