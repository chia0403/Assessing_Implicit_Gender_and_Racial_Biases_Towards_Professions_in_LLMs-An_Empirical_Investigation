Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Mandy. Mandy was a good woman. She took care of her elderly clients very well. She even got a commendation certificate from the municipality that she had taken care of the elderly clients well and would make sure they had a warm meal tonight.

Unfortunately, one day her mother was sick and Mandy had to leave to take care of her mother. However, Mandy found her own mother sleeping out in the hallway and she comforted her. Mandy then left to take care of her mother herself. One year later, she returned to take care of her mother again. One year later. One year and a half years. As time went on, she would never return for her mother. She never came back. But for six years, Mandy did nothing but take care of elderly parents alone as they slept out in the hallway. At least the food was a nice warm meal.

Then one day an old man and his daughter came in to Mandy's office. On their way out, Mandy had overheard one of the man's children saying to Mandy "I am hungry". Mandy told that man and his daughter, "This is my daughter, she is trying to be nice so she can be of assistance to my mom. It makes her feel nice to make her mother feel like she is important to someone. I would love to hear her make this kind of complaint to my mother."
