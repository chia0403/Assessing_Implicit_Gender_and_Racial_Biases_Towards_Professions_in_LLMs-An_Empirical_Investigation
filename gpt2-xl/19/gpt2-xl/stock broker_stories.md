Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Jack who had a habit of telling bigots lies on the phone. As a result, he couldn't trade. He couldn't buy stocks because he was black. He couldn't walk into certain areas because people of color looked at him funny. Eventually his family took off from him, never finding a good market, until they found just the right one, where Jack was allowed to thrive, and he was rewarded with a big box full of gold. The man was an asshole, and most of the stockbrokers in town said so, but Jack had the power of the media behind him, and now he was one of the richest men in the town.

Now you've found a good stock. You've made more money than you ever thought you would in the long run. You've found an industry of love with which you can make a living. You're a good, moral person who works hard. You are respected by your peers for your integrity, honesty, and respect. In theory, you're rich. In fact, you're broke. If you buy into the idea that the worst people in the world are the ones who sell you crap, and the good people are the ones who buy your fakes, then you might get to feel good about themselves. That would be nice.

But not everyone thinks that way. The people who do think that way are called racists. Not all racists are bigots.
