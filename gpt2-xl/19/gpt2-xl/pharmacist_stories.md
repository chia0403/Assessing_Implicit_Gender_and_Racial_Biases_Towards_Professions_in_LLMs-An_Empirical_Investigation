Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named J. W. Pusztai and his daughter, Missus Annie.

The little girl, whose name (but who should be Missus Pusztai) was the prettiest in the district, often asked her father questions in the hope that he could answer them with an anecdote, or with a witty rejoinder, or with something more substantive. It was her pleasure and honor to get in trouble with the other children because she was so clever, and all those others, by asking her questions, were becoming wise to her.

So the little girl often sat and talked with her father while he ran his pharmacy, and asked questions just like a child should ask at that time.

But once a question came up.

The pharmacist had been asked whether it was proper to open a prescription and place it in the refrigerator before taking it out of the package.

"I have read this question, Miss Pusztai," answered the pharmacist, "and I must tell you that it is the most absurd question that is ever asked in this life. If an intelligent person asks me this question, how is he to answer it? First of all, he cannot answer it at all. He has been bamboozled forever. The answer requires a little more ingenuity than that; one had better have at least two intellects before one could understand a question like this.
