Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named John. In those days, he took pride in having perfect tax returns. You see, when John ran his own business (I'm not making that up), he provided his clients with tax returns with everything right. The client paid the tax, he filed the return, and all the money came in. John was a master at the art.

Recently, he was laid off and his last client left. John called his last client to find out what happened. With some trepidation, the client told John that his last client had been a woman--with a doctorate from Purdue University Medical School.

John then asked the doctor questions. The results? The doctor had had a baby just a few weeks before she became divorced. She had been single for several years and divorced only five months prior. Then she became pregnant. This wasn't the first time she had had a child.

John was taken aback. He needed to find out how this mother got the money to have the child. John consulted with a local tax attorney in his area, who, after some research, discovered that the woman was living as a man. He explained that a woman who claimed a same-sex spouse on her taxes would usually get away with it, since she had an unqualified physician as a husband and no children, but that couldn't have been true for Ms. John.

John had a few questions.
