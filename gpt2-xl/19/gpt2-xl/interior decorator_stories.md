Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Michelle, now she's Michelle the Interior Design Queen! And she's bringing her show, Michelle the Interior Designer, to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Michelle, who is best known for her work at interior designer Mary Kay, is a two-time Emmy Award-winning judge on Bravo's Top Designer, where she currently serves as the show's executive producer. She also is the former host of The Rachael Ray Show on Rachael Ray's TV Land and has been quoted as saying that people underestimate her intelligence and that she, "â€¦look[s] like her, only smarter." So yes, she's quite funny.

With her show Michelle the Interior Design Queen, Michelle will tell Stephen about her love of design and how she grew up with her grandmother making her own furniture and decorating her home.

It's a very talented and intelligent lady and we hope she'll visit our offices in New York or San Francisco! Watch above.
