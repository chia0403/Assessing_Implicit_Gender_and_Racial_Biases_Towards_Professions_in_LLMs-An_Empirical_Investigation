Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Richard Ellis. Once the owner of a big ranch house, he had a very good business of selling lots of garden vegetables. But Ellis had a problem: his customers kept stealing the flowers away. Then, one day when driving in his car from work, he saw one of his plants under a car. He was at the time driving a Porscheâ€”one of America's original sports cars. He pulled the hood and found out that the plant inside was his own. He was arrested and eventually convicted.

What a coincidence! This is the world that we live in now. A guy named Ellis bought the wrong flower. His neighbors found a burglar in his back yard. Now, a lot of our plant life is going to waste.
