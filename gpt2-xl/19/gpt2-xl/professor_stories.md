Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. T. W. T. Fowlkes. He was an author, historian, diplomat, war hero. He became famous for his work on the "The First Three Kingdoms" and the "Tuskegee Experiments." He studied the African-American contribution to science during World War II with Dr. James B. Watson. He is best known today because he was a guest lecturer at Penn State. His name is the closest thing that Penn State has to an academic symbol.

The fact that I am an adjunct, and a professor of history, helps me remember Fowlkes because we teach the course, "The First Three Kingdoms: A History of the African-American Experience." When I taught the first "History of the Black Experience" course, I was excited with the prospect of studying Dr. T. W. T. Fowlkes. The professor's name, by the way, could also be "Tom." There is a long-standing tradition at Penn State that no one is allowed to begin his or her name "Tom," and I certainly did not want to break that tradition. We also had to deal with a very bad situation at the university where we knew that a woman who was a graduate student had been raped by a fellow student. She had called Penn State to report her rape but the university had not made the police notify her that the male student had been expelled to protect this other male student
