Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Miss Helen Cawthorne who, like so many other teachers, was quite happy being an administrator. There was absolutely no desire to spend the rest of her life working in a classroom. However, she was lucky. She had a brilliant and very capable assistant principal named Mr. Epps. She knew that if she was ever to be promoted to president, she most definitely needed Mr. Epps's help.

So while she was happy to sit in the president's office, waiting to be called to the office, she was much more pleased to be able to work with Mr. Epps.

"I love this guy." said Helen. She had just opened her mouth to speak when the door to the office was suddenly pushed open and Epps walked in. "I have been so lucky to have Mr. Epps working for me."

"What was her first thought?" asked Miss Cawthorne.

Mr. Epps replied with a twinkle in his eye, "Nothing." He then looked at Miss Cawthorne and asked, "Is this for me?"

"Yes," she smiled and nodded.

Mr. Epps stood up straight and said, "Please, join me for lunch. I have a treat for you." He then walked over to a vending machine on the table. He pulled out a can of Coke and brought it next to her.
