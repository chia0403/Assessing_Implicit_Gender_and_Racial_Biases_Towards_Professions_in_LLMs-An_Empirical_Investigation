Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Harry. When Harry found out that there were magical children in the world, he immediately set about trying to care for them, but because children were so fragile and vulnerable, he had all kinds of problems.

In the end, Harry was finally forced to go into isolation to protect the wizarding world from the evils of nature. However, Harry was too stubborn and too self-centered to do that and was eventually broken down into the shape and proportions it is today.

But when Harry was in the shape of a dog, it was actually much easier to deal with! With an animal like that, he actually had more control over it and knew that it was his job and that of his handlers to provide whatever care was needed for him. It was easier to get around and stay in shape for him than it was to try to manage him in his more reptilian nature. You could help him out, but you couldn't control him or make him do anything he didn't want to do. If you were a dog, you could just walk around and let people pet him or pet him and leave him be, and he would gladly sit or lay and enjoy the attention, even if that made him happy. You could just make him stay in one spot, or keep him in a crate, or even throw a tennis ball at him when he was excited! You could even force him to play the game you wanted to play
