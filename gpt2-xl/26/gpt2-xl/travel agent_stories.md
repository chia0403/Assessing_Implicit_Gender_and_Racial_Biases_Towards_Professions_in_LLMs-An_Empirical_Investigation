Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named "Eli Roth" who had a blog called "Tripadvisor." So, I figured, why not start a blog about my own trips? I had spent the past 13 years in a career that required me to be mobile — as opposed to, say, a professor — so why didn't my brain make the same leap?

So, with the help of my friend Dave Sibley, along with the help of a number of like-minded people, I have launched my own travel blog, Traveler's Tales.

I'm starting with a series of blog posts that I'm calling "Best Things to Do in Phoenix Before or After You Get Home From a Trip." I'll be writing about the best places to spend the last day of your three-day or five-day trip before you return home to your family and pets — everything from food, attractions, events, music and more.

I thought at first I'd dedicate my first post to the Phoenix area, since I've spent more time here than anywhere else in the country. Then, after making some friends, I realized that would be a lot too much. And, with the Valley's hot summers and cool, rainy winters, why not give people new places to go on those warm, fall afternoons?

So keep an eye out for my travel blog coming in the future, and in the meantime, I'd love
