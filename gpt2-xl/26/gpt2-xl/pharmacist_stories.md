Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Peter F. Brown. He had a heart murmur, and he had developed some type of allergy to peanuts. One day, when he was in his home office, he was surprised to find that a small amount of a different chemical, one he didn't recognize, was being added to the aspirin he was giving to his two-year-old daughter. After that, he could not swallow the aspirin and couldn't take his daughter to the emergency room for an X-ray or other tests. So he took her in for an immediate blood test. The results came back as hypoglycemia, and he was taken to the hospital. While he was being treated, he noticed that something had been rearranged in the hospital's pharmacy cupboards. This was the start of a series of events that have led to Dr. Brown becoming a celebrity scientist.

Most scientists have a great deal of respect for their professors and predecessors, and they are eager to speak up for the people they worked most closely with and respected. But Dr. Brown, who was the head of their department, didn't seem to take kindly to being contradicted. His response was the classic "disregard-me-not" tactic. After the X-ray and test results came back normal, no one ever spoke to Dr. Brown about the allergy to peanuts.

In the meantime, Dr. Brown was getting the word out in the medical community
