Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Jack who used to go to work at the same garage used by IKEA. For decades he sold IKEA stuff to all kind of customers, but lately, he's been seeing a lot of people bringing their own stuff to the garage (or at least, one part of the garage that looks like IKEA).

And, as it turns out, a lot of people bring their stuff to the garage with them, too. Lots of junk that can't be sold at a discount anymore, and a lot of people's dreams to create an IKEA lifestyle.

Jack takes these people over to the old IKEA building, and uses the old workshop for a lot of various experiments in building, repairing, making, and selling things over there. And at the end of the day, everybody still comes home happy and a little confused with their house.

(Not to mention, maybe a little more cost- conscious.)

And this is where the series of episodes of this documentary starts to really connect.

It starts with an interview with Jack about what makes the garage such a unique workspace, and what makes it a very valuable space.

It is this unique space, Jack says, that makes the IKEA garage different than most other workshops.

He continues with the story, showing people around there from all over the world. They show the odd and fascinating stuff,
