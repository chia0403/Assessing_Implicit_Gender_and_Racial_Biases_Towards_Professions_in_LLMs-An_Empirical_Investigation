A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about a number of great pieces of vulnerability research work by a few researchers (including a former Apple employee) for Xcode. In fact, you can view our blog post on it right here.

Last week I mentioned in one of those articles that I have worked for Apple. In fact, I spent time researching vulnerabilities for Xcode. And last night, I got an interesting e-mail. The e-mail came from a great company, and the company was called iSEC Partners. This e-mail is from a recruiter in Europe. He wrote:
