Once upon a time, there was a painter named Bob Jackson. After struggling in art school, he was inspired to become an enforcer and become "the world's most vicious cop". With the connivance of his lover and colleague Dr. Milla Jones, he took up his old position and began spreading terror across the city, leading the Gotham City Police Department to be known as the Gotham City Police Department. In addition to his law enforcement duties, Jackson was at the top of the mobster hierarchy, using his status and his cop status to ensure that everyone in the city's upper level was a patsy. His latest target was, unsurprisingly, Bruce. With no other targets, the only person left for the police to pursue was a seemingly unbeatable champion.
