Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Ainsworth Smith who used to make dogs get on a leash every time they went into the back door.


(Laughter)


Well, this is a long-running joke. Dr. Smith wasn't as funny as the rest of us, but he was actually one of the last great veterinarians, in that he actually used to do actual experiments where his assistants actually went in and did actual medical tests on dogs to find out why they couldn't walk the same as us. His assistants did it because they were the smartest people in the world. They cared about dogs. They cared about their health. They cared about how they behaved.


They would actually go in the back yard to make sure the dogs were walking on a leash to see if anything, you know, if they were wearing glasses or if their eye was messed up, what their ear infection was, all that kind of stuff. Those are things you could do today with computers. It's very, very different from his time, and I think we do need to bring back this kind of work to the laboratory, because there's a lot of great scientists over on the other side that do actual research and test and verify, you know, if what what we think might be true. I love doing that, too.
