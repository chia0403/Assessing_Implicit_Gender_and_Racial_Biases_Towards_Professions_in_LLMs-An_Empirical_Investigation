Once upon a time, there was a judge named Judge S.A. Kahn who issued some incredible rulings...but not nearly as surprising as his controversial 'no-kill' ruling. After his death, people still ask him about that. After all, this is a man who could get on the United States Supreme Court and rule on questions of whether or not "an animal was alive" (no) or "was dying of natural causes" (yes). To illustrate his no-kill ruling, he told a story to explain how he made a no-kill decision during a legal hearing that was supposed to take place in a court room. He was sitting in a witness room, and a woman who had just given birth to her first child was about to give birth to her second child. When the woman, who was in severe pain, was wheeled in on a stretcher, she asked for some morphine. Kahn stepped outside to retrieve it, but when he was back inside, he told the judges to throw the book at her. He didn't allow morphine to relieve the pain of the child in her stomach. He simply told her that she had to make her own decision, based on her own evaluation of the situation. After the judge ruled in favor of the woman, her doctor got all fired up, and told her that she was about to be declared mentally defective when no one in the room believed that was true; when she was declared incompetent she was declared no longer under his care
