Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Steve Saylor, who in the early 90s started exploring and experimenting with the ability to grow plants in the lab. He started by growing small, experimental flowers. He was successful in growing some flowers from start to finish, but his experiments were so slow and limited that he decided to move on to growing bigger flowers, which he could grow all over the lab and use as a source of food for his other plants—his greenhouse.

After a while, Steve became so good at growing plants in his greenhouse that the lab was filled with plants. Over time, this turned into a real problem, because a certain fungus, P. aeruginosa, spreads from growing area to growing area, causing deadly infections in people and animals. So, Steve decided he needed to build a new lab, with a new type of growth chamber that could isolate, isolate, isolate every single plant in the room.

He called it The Grow Room. The first thing he did to the room was create a water system—he filled it with ice and used it as a filter. Then, he took down the water-filters and put a new set of filters in. Each filter went through the greenhouse to collect the last bit of water that was used by all the plants in the room, so no plant ever had to touch the same water during its entire life. The next thing he did was install his new system for harvesting, processing
