Once upon a time, there was a florist named Rose.

She was a big brassy flower who loved to be in bloom. But when the town of Poughkeepsie lost its most valuable item - its sweetheart, a bouquet of lavender, in a flood, all Rose could do was cry. She had to find a worthy heir to inherit the bouquet, and with a little help from her pet poodle, the pet parrot, she found one. After a while, her pet bird became very affectionate with the pet poodle, and Rose developed a crush. She kept the bird, until she was forced to transfer the bird into the hands of a human - for no one liked birds, anyway, which meant that she didn't have long to maintain the bird's interest in her. And then she lost him. And that's when Rose began her transformation!

Rose isn't a very smart flower after all, but she has a lot of fun in the florist shop. Her friends are a small yellow bird (a parrot named Chippy) and a very funny green bird (a cockatoo named Snuffleupagus). The two birds are friends, but that doesn't stop them from getting into trouble!

What follows is a fairy tale about an unlikely pair - one a bird, one a bird's pet - but which turns out to be more than one.
