Once upon a time, there was a cook named Ralf (real name unknown) who had the following cooking techniques and tips:

Makes a meal from scratch every day.

Cooks everything in a kettle.

The only way out is through.

Wingspan and scuttle

Cooks with eggs, milk and butter.

To see these techniques for cooking in the real world, check out Ralf's blog, Tender Cooking by Ralf.

Ralf's home has a wing-pan (pictured) that is used for everything from frying eggs to roasting carrots and potatoes. And Ralf also loves using a scuttle for all his potatoes, carrots and other vegetables.

3. It's best to have some kind of a storage box when you're on a tight schedule.

This is pretty much the only cooking tip that Ralf has. If you don't have a storage box, ask a friend to borrow some.

4. You never know when your friend from school is going to come visit you.

It's not that Ralf actually cooks more than anyone else, it just seems like he cooks the most. Whenever Ralf goes visit his friend from school (real name unknown) his mom makes homemade soup.

This is a simple soup mix with a variety of herbs that can be prepared in a variety of ways.

5. Make coffee in the shower
