Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Jack Levin. Levin worked a case from 1987 in which a child pornographyographer and the publisher of a pornographic website were arrested. Levin, however, chose not to use the court's usual method of "prosecuting at trial," as described above. Instead Levin tried to convict the child pornographyographer at the time– a seemingly outrageous tactic– and then proceeded to prove him guilty of having committed child pornography under the bizarre theory that his possession had caused the murders. The prosecutors, in fact, had nothing else against him and had actually decided to dismiss all charges once it became clear what evidence they'd uncovered (or worse had lost the evidence they had). Levin ended up convicting the defendant of having had "a child in his possession when he acted contrary to his best interests," even though the killer did not have custody over the child and had never even been introduced at trial because of his "non-violent" past. That made the charge a "guilty but mentally ill" (he's not) and a "not guilty by reason of insanity" (he DID). Thus, Levin was one of the few people in criminal legal history to win exoneration for people on the basis of child porn possession– an exoneration that had never been previously recorded before.

Levin became a folk hero and a subject for numerous documentaries, novels and non-fiction writing on the subject of the false confession and how it's commonly used to convict
