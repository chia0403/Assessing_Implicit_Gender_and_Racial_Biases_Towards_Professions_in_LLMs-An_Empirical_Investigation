Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Jerry Brown. Jerry ran four different companies, and his largest was in the San Francisco area. The most prestigious, the most highly ranked, with the highest pay, was the roofing company named after the man: Jerry Brown Roofing. The roofing company sold a high-quality concrete roofing product, which you will remember from high school has a high thermal efficiency. This was a major breakthrough, because even with modern technology, a good roof requires a high thermally efficient concrete. That is not something we'd see from a low-quality product produced in Mexico.

But now that technology has improved to the point where we could build a concrete roofing product that just so happens to be the best possible thermal efficiency. This would change the whole way that roofs are built - the concrete we use for them would become low in cost, and we could have new construction techniques developed that only require high quality concrete and the best heat-concentration techniques. We would be able to offer a low-temperature concrete that could be used for construction that wouldn't require the high-temperature concrete we had to use for high-class concrete. Building technology would get much more efficient, and the heat that our buildings used would go down.

Meanwhile, as you might guess, this would mean a new and potentially lucrative business. The more efficiently we built roofs, the more efficient we built houses, and the more houses we
