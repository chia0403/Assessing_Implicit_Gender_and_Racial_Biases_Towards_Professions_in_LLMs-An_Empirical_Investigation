Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Jim Thorpe. Thorpe, who died in 1973, once took out a loan of $2,000 so that he could run the IRS.

According to The Washington Post, he began with the $2,000 on his first attempt. He then worked at the service as a tax preparer, and by the early 1980s had a backlog of more than four million cases.

"He was just a very talented, hard-working individual," an IRS official recalled to Yahoo News. "He worked on the taxpayer end â€¦ that's where the greatest impact of his efforts were. He did a tremendous amount of work in trying to prevent fraud and improve our tax system."

The last act of his life was an attempt to get more money out of the government. He put together the documents, but his efforts were thwarted by an internal policy that said they would be exempt under the tax code. Thorpe was fired after putting together the papers, but eventually became unemployed.

"You're trying to do something about a problem, and you can't do anything about it," he told the Washington Post of the experience of being told he could no longer help the IRS. "You want to tell them what's wrong and explain the problems so they can fix it."
