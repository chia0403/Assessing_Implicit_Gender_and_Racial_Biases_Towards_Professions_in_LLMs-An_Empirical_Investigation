Once upon a time, there was a butcher named George Clinton who was very popular in his village and would come into St Andrew's church after service and make the sign of the cross. This sign was quite a tradition that was continued by the members of the congregation. In due season, they would pray "All Saint's Day" in the presence of Saint George, as well. That is as far as it went. We have no reason to believe that this tradition survived after the passing of George Clinton in 1775, unless the church was not located in the parish at the time, but in a neighbouring parish, St Andrew's. This would be impossible, I think, as the parish was first consecrated in June 1717. Therefore, I have to assume that the tradition that the saints and the sign of the cross would be present on Good Friday remained after his death - even if only in prayer and devotion. This tradition continued in a form that is now carried on by the parish church of St Andrew's, as well. In 1665, George Clinton came back to London, but his family were still firmly attached to their parish. They returned all his relics to London Church. Since the parish church was still standing, the family decided to have a copy made. This copy was taken to Holy Trinity Church in London, where the portrait of George is thought to be one of the most famous portraits of a person, at least in England.
