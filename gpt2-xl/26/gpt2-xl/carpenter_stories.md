Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named William Shakespeare who worked on the top floor of the church, at the top. In the 1590s, his office was the office right next to The Theatre. He wrote "King Henry VI. (Part I)" on the walls of the theatre.

There was a stagehand who did the cleaning and tidying up when the actors went to visit other parts of the town. He wrote the scene where the young Henry meets with Margaret of Anjou.

The stagehand came from a village called Widdrington, near Stroud.

The stagehand lived in Stroud when he was a boy and his father ran a small business near the town. It might be his father's original store, or it might have been one of the nearby shops who lost their licenses and got into trouble. All that we know for sure is that he lived at Stroud, where his mother and siblings went to live. When the stagehand was a boy, the shops that sold his goods also served as the house of his family.

It seems that one day, The Theatre was closed for a few hours. Henry VI. was the head of the household at the time. His wife, Margaret, had not been to her father's family home, so she slept with the servants. Her husband told Mrs. Tristram's Stagehand to ask for their company. At the time, this was a dangerous thing
