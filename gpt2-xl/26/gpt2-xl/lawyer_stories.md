Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Bob. Bob started off well enough, but his career was doomed once it landed on the back burner. Bob had no career goals. No job description. No idea how to make money. Only one idea and one vision in life. To make money for his family. So he hired a big law firm and then hired another big law firm and then another big law firm. What made him happy was his constant pursuit of new clients. He would work all day on the road, call them from his hotel window, and then return only to spend another six hours fighting for money with a client. Even before he could sleep, Bob would go and meet with the client. He'd ask about financing. He wanted the client's business plan.

Of course this process would get even worse once Bob began looking into the legality of a potential business and all too quickly his own legal career would spin off into the right half of the courtroom and the wrong half of the bed. He'd never again manage to get a second bite at the apple, even if he tried. Finally, Bob realized that this had to stop. Bob wanted peace. He wanted a career where he could do what he loved for the rest of his life and not feel compelled to work so hard because he was making money. Finally, Bob had a name for that career. It was called "lawful employment". In the years that followed, Bob started hundreds of small businesses.
