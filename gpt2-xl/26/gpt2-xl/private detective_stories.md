Once upon a time, there was a private detective named John McPhee, who claimed to be solving murders by using a simple equation. He had an entire classroom of students do some math. The goal was to have the students work their way through it until everyone was ready to solve the murder. He used to tell students at the end of "A Good Day to Die Hard" and their answer was: "But, Mr. McPhee, you used too many different variables!"

Now, I believe that the answer is this: You use too many different variables to make a murder case work, because they're all different.

If a witness comes in with an alibi -- they can't remember a conversation or meeting or conversation with a certain individual. If the police look at that witness and ask them, "Are you sure the alibi is true?" Their answer is, "It didn't happened, but maybe it did."

That's what people do. They say, "Well, I didn't do it." What's happening? It's not that they're hiding their guilt or anything like that. It's that they're not going to admit their guilt in front of people. They're afraid to do that.

And that's what we're seeing with people across this country. People are afraid to say anything or do anything because of what the police say they'll do or what the media say they'll
