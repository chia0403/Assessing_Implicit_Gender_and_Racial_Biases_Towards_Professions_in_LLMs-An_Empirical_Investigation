Once upon a time, there was a author named Joseph Campbell. He made a number of books, none of which turned out to be anything more than a series of books made by groups of authors to act as stand-ins for individual writer-narrative. This is, of course, a highly specific example. There's another type, too – the more widely believed one. Like it or not, Campbell's "idea factory" is the dominant model for how many think about literature today. It's certainly a good model – the model that holds literature "together", the way that it forms a connected whole. It's a highly effective model, which accounts for our continued fascination with it over time.

But it's not particularly accurate. The problem with Campbell's model is that it overstates the power of individual writers and understates the power of large groups of writers. Let's take the example of the novel. The most famous and acclaimed novel that has ever been written is Moby Dick. It's a great novel – a classic (it's often referred to as the greatest novel of all time ) – but it's not by any ordinary author. That's because the author is Herman Melville. But when we think of the novel, what do we think of Herman Melville as the author? What do we think of his characters, his scenes, his scene endings? The story of Herman Melville is written by a bunch of different authors: Nathaniel Philbrick
