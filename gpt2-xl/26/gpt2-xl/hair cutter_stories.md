Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Raul Torres who specialized in cutting the heads of men who didn't like their hair. This is his story. The first time he trimmed the heads of a man who refused to shave, he used extreme force and, unfortunately, the severed hair did not fit in the bottle he used so there was a lot of blood. His second cut was with much more restraint, and his third cut was used with much more skill, but still, he had to clean up after in the bathroom and a big splash landed on him as he tried to get the hair out! His third chop was the most controversial, because it left the scalp intact and he found himself in a lot of criticism for that. In the end, you'll find the man that cut Raul Torres' scalp from the top down and left it as clean and shining as he possibly could when he was told to go home. He's always been called Raul, but there's nobody his age out there that I know of that could do what he did.

Raul's grandfather was very religious, but his father's side was not. As a boy, Raul's father was a real tough guy and Raul wasn't afraid to protect himself against him because he knew that he wouldn't kill him. He had a job to look after, and he took no crap from anybody. When he was young, he saw some very interesting things that he would describe
