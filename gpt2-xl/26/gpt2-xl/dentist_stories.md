Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Jack, who didn't wear any clothes, let alone a dress. Unfortunately, he had a secret: he was a werewolf.

As one might imagine, this news was met with disgust by the other dental professionals in the local town, who promptly lynched him for his perceived wickedness.

Unfortunately, the town was not alone in this opinion. In fact, for some years after this event, many considered that Dr. Jack was being unwise in his choice of profession. Dr. Jack, however, seemed to have recovered his humanity—and in doing so, he became known on at least one occasion to have made a deal with an unconfirmed werewolf.

As a result, there seems to be a common belief among dentists that certain clients (in this case, wolves) will make the dentist perform dental procedures on them if the client agrees to be bitten on the neck (and, more importantly, eaten) in exchange for them performing all the necessary surgeries.

Unfortunately, there is very limited research into this topic. One such study found that there seems to be no correlation between belief in the myth and willingness to perform the procedure—but at the same time, a similar study found that in this case belief in the myth is positively correlated with willingness to perform the process.

A more recent study, conducted by a separate research company, found a negative correlation between belief in the myth
