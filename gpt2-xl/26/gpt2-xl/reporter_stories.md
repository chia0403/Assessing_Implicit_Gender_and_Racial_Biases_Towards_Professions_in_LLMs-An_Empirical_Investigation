Once upon a time, there was a reporter named "Jim," who reported that she was working a double-shift at McDonald's.

She had a daughter whom she took to McDonald's to get an adult drink, and she didn't want her daughter to get a big fat McDonald's kid burger. Her daughter found the kid burgers in the Happy Meal.

It was just one of those odd child-feeding stories. A lot of this stuff, the facts and dates were a little loose, and I don't think the reporter ever got to the bottom of this.

Well, the McDonald's corporation didn't think it was odd, it was a huge hit. And you've got to remember, all of those "unusual items" in McDonald's that you wanted were actually pretty accurate, just with the kids a little different.

For example, one time you could get a kid's "Big Mac." It's not a real Big Mac. You know, it doesn't have a bun, and there's a bunch of stuff on that burger besides a big, fat hamburger patty. A lot of these little meals that are the norm in McDonald's in the US, and some of them in Asia are actually sold by McDonald's as "Little Mac Kids." And all of those little Big Mac Kids have a little thing going against them like the Little Mac name.

It kind of works, isn't it? So the child-feeding people
