One day, the head bartender said to the barber: "You need to stop wearing those old-fashioned clothes. They're not a good look for you at this age." But, since Bill was a barber, he refused to stop. Finally, one of the bartenders yelled at him to do what he had to do. Bill tried to walk into the shop, but he passed out. Then the head bartender, his bodyguards, and the police arrived. They handcuffed him and took him away. That was the barber's day. It seemed to anyone who had the eyes to see that Bill was dying. Then he came to.
