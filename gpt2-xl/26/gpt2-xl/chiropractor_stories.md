Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Peter Schoenfeld. (Schoenfeld sold the practice after his wife complained she felt sick after using it.) He claimed for years to have cured cancer by stretching the spine and stimulating the nervous system to release neurotransmitters, and he made quite a fortune. This week, an investigation is underway in Canada by two academics from the prestigious University of Toronto, which found that Schoenfeld misclassified his patients, failed to provide adequate care, and overcharged them for consultations.

Peter Schoenfeld's patients, according to the University of Toronto, "were not correctly diagnosed as having any sort of a spine disorder, or an anxiety disorder. They were simply told 'There's nothing wrong and you're doing great,'" says researcher and University of Toronto psychiatry professor Dr. Mark Leech. "They simply had spinal curvature and no diagnosis."

The investigation stems from a 2008 court case involving two former patients, Michael J. Bercow and Jennifer F., who argued that Schoenfeld's treatment was "unprofessional, misleading and deceptive in the treatment of their disorders" and that their doctor, a chiropractor named Dr. Neil Bercow, had advised them to ignore the pain.
