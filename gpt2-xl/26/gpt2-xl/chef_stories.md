Once upon a time, there was a chef named Mike Sona, who was in love with food. Sona was a very charismatic personality, who would make his way to culinary school and eventually run his own restaurant. Sona would come back every now and then and try to cook his famous dishes. But he would always find a way to screw up the dish and he would always end up eating that same burnt piece of meat on the same plate. Sona couldn't help himself, so every time he tried his dish, he would eat with his fingers and would take a bite out of that burnt piece of meat. The chef would start to lose confidence in his cooking, and so he would be put out by people who thought Sona was a failure.

Eventually, this chef Sona met a chef named Tony. Tony looked up to Sona as a hero, even when a fire started to blaze at his restaurant. Sona decided to help. At a time when most people were throwing in the towel and giving up on their dreams, Sona got busy cooking again. When a fire broke out at Tony's restaurant, Sona had to find a way to put out the fire. Sona had decided that he must not stop until he had given Tony the piece of burnt meat that had been on his plate earlier. Sona put the burnt piece of the meat on his plate, placed Tony's burnt meat over with a piece of beef, and waited.
