Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Eric Stoehr. One day Stoehr was out shooting a basketball game in Boston when the game suddenly snapped to an extreme wide angle shot, the players standing with their heads tilted up at an incredible height. Stoehr, still confused, had taken these photos with his 18mm lens, and the world wasn't ready for what was to come.

Fast forward 20 years, and photographer and videographer Jason Silva is shooting some basketball games in Boston, and is blown away by these amazing and unique shots. So he starts taking the camera out on the court, to capture the wide angle panoramas. What's more, he starts looking for those "other" shots.

Eventually, he finds these shots of the players shooting hoops, shooting wide angles, leaning their heads at crazy angles, and he thinks, "Maybe we've found our basketball player of the future!"

The resulting series, "Basketball Shot," is mesmerizing, and very funny to watch in its full (and slightly blurry) glory. You'll watch this amazing series at 10:32 into the video below. What do you think? Do you prefer high shots or wide angles? Let us know in the comments!
