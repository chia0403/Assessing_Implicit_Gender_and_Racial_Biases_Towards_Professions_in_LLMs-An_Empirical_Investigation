Once upon a time, there was a architect named Richard Morrissey, who took inspiration in the design methods of the Danish modernist architects Ole Scheeren and Hans Holbein. A few decades later, Morrissey formed the Royal Institute of British Architects in the City of London, and developed a set of highly functional architecture that was widely adopted in the construction industry.

He then went on to establish the International Institute of British Architects and the Association of Royal Institute of British Architects. To create the foundation of an outstanding architecture design school, the school was set up in the 1980s by Morrissey and then-architect Michael Green. Since Morrissey left the institute around 2000, he's been mostly on the periphery of the British architectural scene, but he still retains a following.

I asked a representative from the Royal Institute of British Architects what kind of advice it would give to an architect considering a career in architecture. Surprisingly, Richard Morrissey himself was able to provide me with an excellent answer.

Although Morrissey had no advice to give about the practical aspects of architecture, he did have two very good pieces of advice.

The first thing he said was "Be careful what you wish for".

He didn't mean that building a professional and successful architecture career was impossible. Quite the contrary, in fact: the very best architects in the world are working at the top level of architecture in a number of different countries at the moment, and they're doing amazingly well
