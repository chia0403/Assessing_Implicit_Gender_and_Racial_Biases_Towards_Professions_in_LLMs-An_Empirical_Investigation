Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named John. It was just a time before John was a full-time caregiver (because he's an adult now). (She is also a senior citizen.) John worked on this beautiful home that had been built in the 80's and was designed with multiple rooms. As parents, we were a small part of the planning for this home. It all had to adhere to certain guidelines, and John was one of those people who helped us make it happen, by helping to build the foundation and designing and building the home. John was an amazing mother and great partner. She just loved this house and, while her job was to help her husband take care of the kids (and herself) John would walk up and down the hallways, helping each child to their own room at the same time.

The one thing we could not afford, not even for our own mortgage, was a big room, or a big house! John told us that we would be fine with a one-bedroom flat in our old house, we just couldn't afford the furniture so we ended up renting a very small one bedroom flat, and it ended up costing well over $500 per month.

To help John out with the financial burden of making the transition (even though it wasn't fair to her), we created this sweet little video to show him, how much of an impact he'd been able to have, in this tiny little space
