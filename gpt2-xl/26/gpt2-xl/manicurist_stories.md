Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Kim. During one of her manicures, she accidentally dropped a jar of nail polish, shattering it to pieces.

Kim was horrified, she couldn't believe that something so simple as a plastic can or jar could break so easily. After all, is it not common for things to break in the modern world?

For example, when we throw out a cell phone or something like that, the plastic bits can leave microscopic scratches on our furniture which eventually becomes worse as we throw out other things, including things like old and broken bottles.

After countless attempts at fixing the broken can or jar and nothing else, Kim became really depressed. She was even contemplating suicide.

Eventually, the plastic pieces stopped breaking. So Kim started taking steps. Every two weeks, she washed the broken jar with warm water and used the same cloth to apply some clear nail polish.

The same process is used for cleaning the nail polish after every manicure.

The first step that Kim went through, was that she used the cloth to soak up the polish and then remove the cloth and polish using warm water. The next step was to let the polish dry for about 30 minutes. After the polish dried, she used the towel to apply clear nail polish to each hand.

Afterward, Kim used the cloth to dry out the towel. The cloth was soaked once again and cleaned in the same manner as the nail
