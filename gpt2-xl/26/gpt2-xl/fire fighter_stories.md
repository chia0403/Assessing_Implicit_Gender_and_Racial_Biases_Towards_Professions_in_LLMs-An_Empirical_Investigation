Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Sam and a female firefighter named Samantha. When Sam was on duty, every morning, Samantha worked by his side. They got along well. They helped each other. They always said hello. They were kind to their friends. They were well liked and well appreciated by many people.Sam said that Samantha went on some strange, but fun and entertaining drives, most of them involving her car or a car that was parked next to her. After one of these excursions, the two found themselves in the same position. It was dark and raining outside, but a little too early for a trip to the fire station. After an hour or two, Sam said Samantha started to have a good imagination. The two of them sat in the parking lot of the fire station with only the moonlight in their eyes. Then, something strange started happening. Samantha was seeing the streets and the fire hydrants. Sam and Samantha both saw the station lights, and they both heard the fire alarm going off in the background. Just as Samantha and her imagination came to a close, her car slammed into the fire station's entrance, knocking it over. As a result of the collision, a fire hydrant burst, spraying water inside the station to the point where it was on fire. Sam was standing under that fire hydrant when it burst, and she was thrown backward into the station. The only thing she could think to say was, "Oops".
