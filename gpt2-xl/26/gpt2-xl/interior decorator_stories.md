Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Bob (real name unknown) in one of the largest and most expensive houses in town (named 'La La Land') who made all interior decorators look bad. He made every interior designer look bad, too, by painting the walls pink or lavender, or by using too many colors on the walls, and so, some of them would not work. Because all of them were not working on the house at the same time, Bob made everyone think that they were all lazy and incompetent. Bob's mother got tired of it, but she didn't have any kids with this 'bitch, so she gave Bob his turn and made all interior decorators look bad. This was so embarrassing for the entire family, so even though Bob did have a great career as an interior decorator and could afford his house, he said it was "not fair" and "not funny" to everyone else. After almost 15 years, he passed away in 1995, and now no one speaks to him anymore.
