Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Joe, who was famous for putting his name on the bottom of every juke bowl in the province. When the juke bowl owners went out of business, Joe took to opening a juke joint called "The Lifestyle Bar and Grill."

However, Joe's luck didn't last long, and while his dream was still on the table, he had a surprise for his regulars when a man he knew as 'Mr. T.' knocked on doors one day in the middle of the night offering to buy up everything of value in the bar, including the juke bowl and the sign advertising the bar's location.

Joe made a deal with Mr. T. in exchange for the juke bowl and his sign, which they agreed to the following night. Unfortunately, when Mr. T. was asked where his truck was, he couldn't give a clear answer.

Mr. T. would always return the next day at 8pm, insisting that the bar needed to close by then. Because no one had any clue what he was talking about, most of the people in the bar were confused. As the hours passed, things continued to get worse and worse; when Mr. T.'s truck didn't arrive, Joe was finally forced to bring all the equipment down to the waterfront to cut the bar open.
