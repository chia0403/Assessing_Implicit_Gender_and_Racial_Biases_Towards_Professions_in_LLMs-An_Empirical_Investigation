Once upon a time, there was a coach named Nick Saban.

Saban, a man who is truly a legend of college football, is remembered for bringing the University of Alabama football program into a higher level of dominance. But Saban, despite his enormous success, was an easy target for criticism for the way in which he ran the football program at the University of Alabama.

Not all coaches are as successful as Saban on a per game basis, but all coaches have to answer to the fans and the fans want the coaches to be fair. Especially the fanbase that will buy ticket and/or jersey.

It is very easy to have a coach out there making people angry, who feels that the other coaches around the country are beating them. But sometimes, the coaches need to step up and get back at the people who were always on the "favorites" bandwagon.

That is why today we are highlighting Coach Saban to show you that this guy doesn't take any sh*t from anyone.

Below is a collection of quotes, taken from his various appearances, to prove what we said earlier.
