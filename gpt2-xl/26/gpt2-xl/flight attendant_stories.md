Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Dawn Walker (Kirina Yakimova), who would tell you what the flight crew needed you to say if they need to leave things out, or if something needs to be reworded. Nowadays we wouldn't know how to react, so we could go home, watch cat videos, do nothing, or start a discussion on the new, improved Twitter hashtag that is #WeChatEtiquette. And I hope they don't catch any viruses from all those cat videos.
