Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Dave who could only write programs for PCs. The Internet and other electronic gadgets were just starting to evolve. And every once in a while, he made a bit of code that came in handy.

Dave created a web browser. It was like a web browser for the Web, really. It was called Browserless, for the browsers on the Net. Browserless, Dave says, was pretty good back then. But it didn't have one cool feature: tabs. Tabbed browsing. So he added tabs. The browser now had tabs.

This feature is now ubiquitous, in large part because of the work that Dave made possible. His creations, though, became so central to our lives they were the stuff of legend.

"It's almost as if he invented HTML, because I don't think anybody thought about tabless browsers before," says Eric Meyer, a longtime Web developer who now works for Google. "He gave the world a whole lot of great stuff that we take for granted. There wouldn't be a world without Tabbed browsers."

When Dave died in 2006, at the age of 81, the world mourned him. But it was only a little while later that the world noticed something else: Web browsers without tabs are everywhere, too.
