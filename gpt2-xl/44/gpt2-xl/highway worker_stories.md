Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Peter, whose car broke down and he took his wife and children on his back to the nearest convenience store. To make sure she was alright, Peter took his wife on a shopping spree. The people who work there didn't know where he'd gone, but they knew she'd been gone a long time, and they didn't want there to be a riot. They wanted him to return, and he knew they'd have problems with the police if he did so. So he gave them a little bribe instead: he gave the lady who ran the convenience store a hundred dollars.

If you didn't know better, you'd think your car would have stalled when all the traffic slowed down for the two of you. But as it turned out, that person who ran the liquor store wanted the hundred dollars more than the lady running the convenience store did. So when Peter returned and gave the other two people their money back, the convenience store employee gave him a big lecture. She accused him of stealing and trying to extort a bribe from her. That infuriated Peter, so he called the police and he and his family marched toward the city's police station and got arrested for shoplifting (and charged with an illegal, even if perfectly reasonable, shoplifting attempt when the officers found that he didn't have a license key for the store). And for a while, Peter spent more of his time in jail than he did in the store
