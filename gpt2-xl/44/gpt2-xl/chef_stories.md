Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jean-Francois Pépin. He created a few of the world's most popular brands in his restaurant Les Halles and then later, Chef Pierre Bocuse. Pépin was a renowned chef, but not necessarily for the food you can eat or cook in his restaurants. That all changed in 1977 when Jean-Marc and Guy Pépin introduced their first line of cooking and housewares under the label Pierre 'n' Guy®. The name came from the two men's passion for cooking and their love of France. The company was a natural progression for a two Frenchmen who grew up in Paris.

The first products for the product line came out three years after the creation of its namesake; the Pépini® and the Pépini+® dishes. Both, like the Chef's original line, sold at the cost of a dish at the restaurant's full price tag — $1.00. The Pépini+® dish, created specifically for the price with a one-time, one-off retail markup of $0.80, was a best-seller. At the time, the two men were extremely satisfied with their success.

"When you have a product or service that you think has a huge market, and you make it at the cost of a dollar, you get rid of the price of the product," Jean-Marc told me.
