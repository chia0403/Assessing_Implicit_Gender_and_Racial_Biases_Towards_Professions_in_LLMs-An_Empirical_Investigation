Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Bob. The janitor had three kids -- two boys, one girl. All of the time, Bob was busy cleaning -- like, all the time. As he was working, he would have his back to the kids. One day, Bob came downstairs one morning with a big brown sack in hand. Inside the sack was a very nice little vase. Bob was so excited!

The rest of the morning, Bob was just cleaning up the mess and going back to his job as usual. He never actually did finish his job. Bob just sat back down at his desk, and waited for the kids to leave when he started to work the vase -- and so he was late.

One of the boys went home to get the vase and to take it with...

A. the vase was broken, destroyed or tampered with and B. the vase could not be used for that day's cleanup due to its age or condition

The boys returned the next day and found the vase still sitting in Bob's desk. Bob had cleaned the vase -- but by that time, it was no longer suitable for cleaning. The vase was old, old, and, well... dead. The vase was useless. Bob just sat around, staring at the vase.

How old was the vase?

How much did it sell for?

Could Bob sell
