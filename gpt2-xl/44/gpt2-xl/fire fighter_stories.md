Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Ed Nolte.

After helping put out a fire, he took a job as a firehouse porter. It was difficult at first, but he was proud of his work.

Then one evening after he had worked hard and saved all night, a stranger walked into his station and said, "What did you do that night, Ed Nolte?"

The fireman began to cry. He finally managed to say, "I couldn't sleep, and I was afraid to look down at the pit under me."

"That's exactly right, Ed Nolte," said the man. "The worst thing you've ever done is sleep in the firehouse."

They sat in silence for ten minutes. Finally the man said, "Now Ed Nolte, I think I'd like you to get in the fire," and he got on one of the trucks. The fireman got up on it and sat down. The stranger got on him first.

"Do you feel any better, Ed Nolte?" he asked. "Do you feel any better?"

"Of course I feel better, sir," said the fireman. Then the stranger got into the truck.

"Do you know, Ed Nolte," he said, "I think I could get you another job."
