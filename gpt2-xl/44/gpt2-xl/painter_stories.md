Once upon a time, there was a painter named Rochas Diamantas who painted a picture of Jesus in the form of a dog. They said he painted it for his father.

At the time it made a lot of people happy.

But the artist Diamantas didn't stop painting dogs. In 1999, a painting of Jesus as a dog sold for a stunning $3,000,000 USD! And the price of an apple? $0.

Rochas Diamantas is still alive and he's still living in Brazil. He's also still very, very rich.

In 2000 he was interviewed by the Brazilian media where he revealed his secret. His secret is that God created dogs to show us an example of loving kindness.

So Diamantas said:

"The dog was created to help children. The dog has come when I went to visit. Then I got a painting and I sat in front of it, and I asked God, I said, 'God! Why do you make dogs? That's a very bad thing'."

The Dog Jesus of Rochas Diamantas is named Nao-Hana, which is the name she was born with.

It's believed that Nao-Hana was conceived in the human body in the form of a male dog. She grew up in Brazil and went on to be an artist.
