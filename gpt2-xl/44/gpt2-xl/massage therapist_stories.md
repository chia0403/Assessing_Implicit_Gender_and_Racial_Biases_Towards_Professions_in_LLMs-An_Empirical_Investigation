Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Jill Tracy who, before she got into the business, spent six years studying at a holistic college. At one point her study was taken over by a group of young women with a "sensual, sensual" program and a "gorgeous sense of sexuality," whom Tracy would call "the Misfits" (as one does). She became a full-time massage therapist after a stint working for the university. Tracy describes her business as a "massage" business. She's more or less right about the sensual part, which, in the business, means the sexual, as part of your job is to help clients find their "sensual zones." At the end of the day, however, you don't need to know that as you're walking down the street and they're saying "nice rub," which is an erotic phrase that you're supposed to repeat back to them. It's not a word you're likely to associate with massage therapists. When you're being paid good money, the last thing you want is to be told it means, "Your legs are wonderful."

I'll admit that I have friends with whom I massage who have this tendency at times to say things like "I appreciate your body" and "I love getting rubbed". I have never actually done it myself. Of course I'm not going to comment about how many hot guys I know are into this kind of thing.
