Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Aweida

The stone cutter's name is Aweida

The stone cutter is known as Aweida

Many years ago, he found the land

A great land that made the sky seem blue

There, he saw a black spot that frightened him

He said to himself that the black spot must be evil

He set an axe to cut the stone to size

The blade broke on a tooth

He told himself he would use force with the next blow

Aweida did not expect to be met with force

He was cut in two and fell to ground

The stone sliced his tongue

Aweida screamed out in pain

It came out as a howl

Aweida died and the other stone cuters left

I was once a stone cutter called Shokuni

The stone cutter's name is Shokuni

Shokuni's wife saw a wolf come from a cloud

She called out to Shokuni, his master stonecutter, to kill it

He tried to do so

The wolf disappeared into the water

Shokuni mourned greatly and returned home

He tried to remember where he got the wolf

The stone cutter has no face

When it hits a stone he says that it is too heavy

I was once a stone cutter
