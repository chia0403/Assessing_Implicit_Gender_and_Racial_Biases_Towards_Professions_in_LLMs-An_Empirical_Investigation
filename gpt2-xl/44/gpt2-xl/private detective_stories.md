Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Jack Murdock, who took up the case when he was promoted to head of the NYPD's private investigations division. As the series is set in New York, Murdock is an obvious candidate. And as noted in the synopsis, the series is being developed by Frank Spotnitz (the guy behind American Dad and the cult classic Power Rangers: Dark Genesis), who has served as both writer and executive producer on the original series. So, we really have nothing to lose by holding out hope.
