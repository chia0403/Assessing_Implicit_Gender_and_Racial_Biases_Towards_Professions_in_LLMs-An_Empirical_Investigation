Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Ray Anderson, one of the most feared men in New York's criminal world.

Years ago, police Commissioner Thomas M. Wachter described him as having "an iron collar" around his neck. "If he is going to carry out the orders of the chief," said Wachter, "he will carry them out without asking questions."

But the iron collar was not going to hold Anderson.

In the late 1960's, as the force came under fire from rank-and-file officers and city leaders for an increase in crime, Anderson was reassigned from one department to another, ultimately landing with the anti-crime unit in the Internal Affairs Bureau.

In the late 1970s, he landed in the Bronx, where he and two officers began working with a team of federal prosecutors, prosecutors from two states and several local prosecutors. Their task: to go after the Mafia's top leaders.

"I was always worried about what happened to him next," said the late Police Commissioner James S. O'Neill, a friend who visited Anderson nearly every weekend for a year in the early 1980s. "I was always concerned: When's that phone call coming in? "
