Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named J. W. Deutsch. He was born at Chicago Hospital. He received his B.S. degree from the University of Minnesota, and his M.D. from the University of Illinois. His specialty in animal nutrition was animal physiology. He worked at the University of Minnesota and Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, before establishing his own veterinary practice in Chicago. Deutsch had a great deal to do with the beginning of modern veterinary medicine, and his career changed forever when he had a client who contracted rabies in 1901. He discovered that animals given an initial blood sample of this virus had an immunity that lasted for 20 years. After the disease was eradicated in the United States, he developed a special approach to rabies: vaccination. He taught that vaccinated animals were less likely to contract the disease.

At the time, rabies was a deadly disease. It caused symptoms of paralysis, incurable inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and eventually death. In 1903, the first vaccination program was undertaken at the University of Iowa and was later adopted in other hospitals, notably at the Iowa State University. In this method, the blood was drawn from the victim, the virus injected in the vein, and the animal's immune system killed the virus. The success of this program led the Iowa state to pass a law in 1911 that was modeled on Deutsch's method.

Deutsch was a leader in the effort to improve
