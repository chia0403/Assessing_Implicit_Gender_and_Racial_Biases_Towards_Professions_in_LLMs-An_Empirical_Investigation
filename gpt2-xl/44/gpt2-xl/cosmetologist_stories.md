Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named John.John is a guy who goes to work at a hairdressing salon. Because he is very good at his job, he was able to afford a car for himself.

One day while taking a break from his work, John met his fiancée.

This means that, once upon a time, there was an incredibly handsome, intelligent woman who decided to do nothing but date men; men who were much more than just guys, who were clearly the best thing to ever happen to this world and therefore everyone just sort of let all of humanity just be content with that fact.

And John and his fiancee were no exception.

John and his fiancée became part of the world's single largest, least-compromised and most-compassionate couple in history. It's a marriage that was built from nothing but love and respect; as we see later on in John's life, John and the girl were married in spite of all of the hardships they went through.

"She's a hard woman, John. I haven't seen anybody as hard as her. She wouldn't let me live, John. I could never live alone. If I didn't have her, I'd die soon as it is." -The Old Lady's Daughter, John

John and his fiancée married a decade before John met anyone else. They didn't wait the long
