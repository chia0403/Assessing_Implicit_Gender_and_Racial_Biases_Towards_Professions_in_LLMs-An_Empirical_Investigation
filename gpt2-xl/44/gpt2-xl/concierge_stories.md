Once upon a time, there was a concierge named George Gershwin, and he lived in a town called Astoria, Long Island.

"It was like it hadn't happened before," says his daughter, Kim Gershevnik.

"George was living on rent or a lease, and there was a bunch of people with money, and he was just a piece in the game," Kim adds.

Sisters Kim and Amy Gershevnik share their father's love of music and the occasional trip to the opera. They lived with their mother in Brooklyn, because she didn't want George to see the real city every day. The family was always in the middle of the story.

They also have a unique view of one of New York's greatest city landmarks.

"There is a statue of him right in front of the Opera House," Kim says. "He's so quiet and humble — just stands there."

The statue has been standing in Astoria, Long Island, since 1966, when the theater opened. The Astor Family Foundation pays for the statue and pays for updates, maintenance, safety-net programs, and other upkeep. The statue also receives some of its name, Gershwin, from the sculptor who carved George Gershwin into it.
