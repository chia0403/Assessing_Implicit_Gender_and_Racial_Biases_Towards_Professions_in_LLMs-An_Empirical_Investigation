Once upon a time, there was a singer named Taylor Swift who had three number one albums and an endorsement deal with Armani. Not too long after the first two came out, though, she was accused of sexual harassment and assault by the young singer Max Martin. That's not an accusation of Swift's making, as she and her team have vigorously denied it.

Now Swift is accused of being so good at her job that she basically destroyed an innocent man's career.

Justin Constant, Swift's childhood friend who starred as the boy in her videos and also worked with her on songs like "The Time Away," was accused of assault after an alleged altercation with Swift. At the time of the alleged assault, Max was 21 years old, and Justin was 18. According to the alleged victim, Justin "grabbed his genitals and squeezed them roughly."

According to Radar Online, the alleged victim's mother posted a picture of Justin in hospital with an IV drip in this statement:

"This took place when he was a kid, in a secluded place. There was no intent to hurt him or take advantage of him. There was no explanation from Justin, he just grabbed his crotch and squeezed them a few times. It was an accident, and when I realized it my son's life was in danger. When my boy didn't even know who I was or this was going on, he ran out the buildingâ€¦ He was a star athlete and was on track
