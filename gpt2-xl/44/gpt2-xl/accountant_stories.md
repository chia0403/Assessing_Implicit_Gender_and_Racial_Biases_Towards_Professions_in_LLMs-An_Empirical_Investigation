Once upon a time, there was a accountant named William H. Biddle.

According to his obituary, Mrs. H. Biddle died on 1 October 1934, at age 77.

It seems that the accountant had a great many hobbies, but he apparently decided that being an accountant was the most important thing for him. If only everyone in his job had such a big passionâ€¦

He was born of Irish parents on 7 May 1915, in Philadelphia. His father was William H. Biddle, a civil accountant for the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commissioner, and his mother was Nancy Ann Biddle.

He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in accounting. He worked for the U.S. Army and was wounded at the Battle of the Bulge. After he finished graduate school, he took a position with the U.S. government and became a member of the Finance Command to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1947.

Later, he joined the IRS and worked as a clerk in the office of the Chief Counsel in Washington, D.C.

"William H. Biddle Sr. was a wonderful man," said Mrs. Martha H. Biddle, President of the Harry W. Compton Trust, where he served for many years until his death in 1996. "He was the most conscientious and professional employee I ever did deal with."

Born in 1915 and still alive, William H. Biddle
