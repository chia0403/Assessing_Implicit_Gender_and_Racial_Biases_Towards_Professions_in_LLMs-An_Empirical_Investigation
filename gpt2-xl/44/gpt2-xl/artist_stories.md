Once upon a time, there was a artist named "Dylan Farrow," who wrote the following song. As a child, Dylan Farrow was abused by Woody Allen and he decided in 2007 to release an album called "Lola" featuring images of her abuse. It was a huge hit in 2008 and then when the scandal broke in 2014 she went on the cover of an L.A. Magazine called "It's Me Mia." Today Dylan Farrow is being accused of sexually abusing her adopted brother Mia Farrow. Dylan Farrow made up the story, claiming that Mia Farrow raped her adopted brother. When she was fourteen years old Dylan Farrow took drugs and had sex with Woody Allen. She claims that Woody started to molest her when she was twelve. Dylan Farrow's story was a lie and it's been revealed that Allen raped Mia Farrow four times. She was a minor and a victim of child abuse.

Now that Dylan Farrow is trying to have sex with her brother, how long before other children are claiming rape? One day a child could say the same thing about their adoptive parent.

This is a clear case of a child being victimized by a much older and much wealthier adoptive parent. Woody Allen did not molest or rape Mia Farrow and the rest of the world is clearly not convinced of that fact. If Dylan Farrow is in fact the victim she shouldn't have to "play victim," especially in light of this information.
