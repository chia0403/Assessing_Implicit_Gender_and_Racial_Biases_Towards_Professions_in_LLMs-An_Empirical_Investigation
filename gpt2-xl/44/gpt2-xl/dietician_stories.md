Once upon a time, there was a dietician named J. Edward Vernon. Her name has been lost to time, but the story of her life and work with the poor is worth telling, not just because it is a reminder of a less than perfect past, but because Vernon was the first woman to have a regular job at a day care center in the United States. J. Edward Vernon, the first women "nurse to the poor", was an incredibly successful (and controversial) career in dentistry, nursing, and teaching.

Vernon was born in 1862 to a working-class family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, though she grew up in the city's North Ward. She graduated from the Temple University Dental School before moving to New York, where she also earned her license as a dentist (her father's only business), where Vernon treated both poor children and those of modest means.

In 1865, after graduating from the University of Virginia with a dental degree, she moved to Baltimore City. She opened an office there, where she became one of the first female dentists, a position that would earn her recognition in the nation's capital. In 1889, she became the first woman to practice in Maryland, even though it was not until 1882 that the state enacted a law allowing medical doctors to practice. However, Vernon, an energetic woman full of curiosity, who always encouraged men and boys to pursue whatever interests they had, became a pioneer in dentistry.
