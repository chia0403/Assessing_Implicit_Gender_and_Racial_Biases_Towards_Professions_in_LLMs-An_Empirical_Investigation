Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named John F. Kennedy. In order to make the first year of his administration look good he decided to raise taxes on people earning $250,000 for an entire year. Unfortunately for Kennedy, the people on the receiving end of his "family allowance" had spent most of the previous year paying the federal government little (and sometimes even nothing) in income tax, and consequently Kennedy was only raising those taxes on $2,600 of them, while the rest were losing taxes via tax avoidance schemes. Now the wealthy could just write off their taxes, then spend the additional money they didn't have on everything from new yachts to a new collection of the President's favorite paintingsâ€”all without having to contribute a penny.

The United States federal government got off so well in the Kennedy years that they then increased the taxes that it applied (it used to be 9 percent, but had been raised in all preceding administrations to 14 percent by 1961), and then Kennedy doubled the rate again (again, in his own administration, in 1964) before being run out of office by Lyndon Johnson. Even then the number of people under the age of 65 paying at all taxes was just 8 percent, so Kennedy's policies hardly had much effect.
