Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Dick Smith. To me, he's the greatest storyteller in all of radio, period. Here was Smith, on Christmas Eve, listening to ABC World News and, without the benefit of a TV screen, he saw, right in front of him on the screen, the Christmas story. He didn't need a TV screen to see it. You can see it here.

"Dick Smith, remember him?" he says, now. "He's out there somewhere listening to our Christmas radio."

I do remember Dick Smith. And I remember his Christmas story.

But there was no such story on ABC's Christmas Day broadcast. This is what a journalist saw instead:

"And here's a story that we will be doing over the next few days. And it's the story of how the old man got a new broom. Now, Dick Smith says, 'Boy that guy really needs a broom.' Okay, yeah, well, the old man says, 'Why are you so mean to me?' Well, the old guy says, 'I'm getting old. My arms don't work, and I'm always getting cold like this! And you say you're going to take care of me, and just make me a home? Well, you can't make me a home. And I wouldn't want to live near you, because I would have trouble sleeping! Now here's a home!
