Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Stephen Sondheim. His show Hairspray premiered on Broadway in 1986 and won a Tony Award for Best Musical. In a series of interviews, the show's star, the fabulous Rita Moreno, talked about why she loved singing the show and what happened to the film version.

1. They couldn't get the copyright for Hairspray

When the show debuted, Sondheim did a survey of Broadway musicals, and his first impression of Hairspray was that it had "a bit too much fun going on." He was still worried that the movie wouldn't find an audience. But then the movie got a distribution deal and Sondheim got in touch with Warner Bros. who gave him the rights. But, because of contractual obligations, he couldn't get permission from the movie producers or directors to film Hairspray from start to finish. The film got a limited theatrical release in the US but was eventually never released in the UK.
