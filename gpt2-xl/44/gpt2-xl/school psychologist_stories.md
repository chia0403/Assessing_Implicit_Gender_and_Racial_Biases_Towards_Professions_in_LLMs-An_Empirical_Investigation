Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Robert J. Sampson (1913-1985, p=0.05) who, among other things, was in the forefront of the psychological establishment's attempt to discredit the possibility that psychiatric diseases exist. While the study of psychiatric pathology was at its heart a research area, Sampson had made no secret of his opinion that some of the phenomena in psychiatric disorder could in principle be explained by psycho-physiological influences. In the introduction to his book The Burden of Personality and the Process of Personality Change (1922) which laid the groundwork for much of his later work, he noted that "[i]n the investigation of mental problems, it is necessary to take into account a number of special considerations, including the fact that the facts which are sought to be explained in relation to them may be, in part, a function of the structure of the nervous system."1 Sampson concluded that "Psychology may teach us a great deal about the mind, but it cannot teach us anything specific about the mind itself."

Despite Sampson's reservations, his view was adopted by the American Psychoanalytic Association (APA), which for years maintained that schizophrenia was essentially a psychogenic disturbance of the mind, and that the psychoanalyst's role was to give the patient a psychological diagnosis as to why he was behaving unprofessionally.2 This view was also adopted by a number of other psychiatrists and other neuropsychologists
