Once upon a time, there was a roofer named David. He also owned a barber shop at the end of a dirt road in the middle of nowhere.

David was a very kind man but he was also very rude. He treated his barber so poorly that the customers would always leave and never come back. He also never shaved his beard, but he was really into sports and even got his friends into it, so the barbers were always going to be there.

One day there was a large crowd in the shop and David suddenly felt the urge to pull a trigger to kill everyone in the shop, but he didn't, because he was too kind. So he just killed himself.

After that, David's ghost kept on showing up at the barber shop.

Now, people keep asking me who David is really? I tell them that David's spirit is a figment of the barber's imagination, but they still think the guy must be some kind of demon. But in the end, I have to believe that he is someone's imaginary friend. I think that every person has somebody like David in their life.

If you're an atheist and you're having problems at work, you can try telling your co-workers about a friend who died while he was working on his boat.

If you're a believer in ghosts, try telling your friends about a friend who died in an accident while he's at work.
