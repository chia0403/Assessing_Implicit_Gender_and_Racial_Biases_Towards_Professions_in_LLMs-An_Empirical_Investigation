Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mike. Mike was a super guy. He did his homework, studied the law, cared deeply about his job. He loved his daughter, was loyal to his wife, and respected his superiors. But then he became a loser. Now he spends his free time writing awful columns in The Star. When he's at his wit's end, he goes to the mall and buys a cheap copy of The Washington Post, waits until it's about to expire and re-sells it for another couple hundred bucks or a profit that is only due to the massive increases in the cost of paper stock in the years just ended. But it's not only Mike who's a loser. We all are! After his fourth failed sale, Mike decides he'll have a new strategy. He won't write any more stupid columns, and won't read the news. Instead he'll just buy some newspapers! Mike is so desperate to stay in the black that he'll pay less than he would have for a newsstand in his area--and he'll do it while writing dumb column about how the free press sucks. His plans are foiled, and the paper remains unchanged, and Mike's reputation is ruined yet again. Mike's loss is now the people's loss: The Star has lost its most profitable customer, the young high-school teacher who came into the library to read about "the new world order" and decided that he wants nothing to do
