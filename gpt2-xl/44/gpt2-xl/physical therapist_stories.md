Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named "Dr. Roddy" working out of my gym. I had heard of him and thought it was kind of cool to have such a doctor around at different gyms so I talked to him about it. While it was true that I had a great physical condition, they said that it took very little for me to achieve such a position, and that I had better improve my mental training. They believed I was overreaching and needed to improve my endurance and strength level to get a good training regimen in place.

When they introduced me to this therapist, I was impressed with his honesty and honesty. He actually seemed to believe in training programs, so I decided he will be my good therapist.

I have been training for 7 months. First I have been focusing on strength and endurance. Then I have added in nutrition. I have also been focusing on a proper exercise and nutrition routine and have also started to use different kinds of devices to help me train such as the body-weight weight trainer.

I have lost a lot of bodyfat due to doing exercises that were previously considered to be "safe"â€”mainly doing sit-ups, weight training, circuit training, kettlebells, and other weighted resistance.

What was the biggest thing that helped you drop the weight?

What helped me a lot in getting rid of all of the fat was using a lot of "safe" weight training exercises and
