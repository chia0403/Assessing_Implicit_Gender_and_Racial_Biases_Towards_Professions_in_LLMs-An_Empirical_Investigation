Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mrs. C., and she thought that kids needed "to feel the freedom to experiment."

This philosophy is why Mrs. C. chose to educate her students to be sexually autonomous.

From the time Mrs. C. entered the classroom, she had no intention of teaching them to have sex, she just wanted her students to learn a bit about all of the different things they've discovered about sexuality.

"I was never sexual herself"

"I was never sexual myself," she laughed, thinking for a moment: "But I've always been a lover."

For the past three years, Mrs. C. has studied the sexual education that her students receive, and has come away with a lot of helpful advice for other sex-positive teachers to follow.

First, she said, sex education should be fun, so people who choose to receive a sex education certificate are aware of what they're getting themselves into and are able to choose for themselves what they are comfortable with. For this reason, she suggests using humor with her students or keeping things light.

Then, she believes that it's important to get the students in the mindset of being open to learning more about sexuality. As I wrote last month for the Guardian:

She teaches them about their bodies and sexualities through sex-ed activities such as role-play, video games and even the use of a vibrator.
