Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Mike who managed to rent a couple of apartments in the same complex. Mike's tenants lived in tiny, windowless apartments. He would take his own suitcases into the elevator and enter room to room until he found a place that fit the requirements.

Every day he would go back and try to make it harder for another potential renter to get ahold of his properties. One of his tenants didn't show an apartment the way Mike wanted and complained to Mike, who in turn sent him to the local zoning lawyer, who ordered the agent to change the locks on the doors to his two units. This way, each time the tenant tried to enter his apartment, the locks would be in the "unavailable/locked" state. He could then enter the second unit and lock it at will. The tenant did show the apartment the way Mike wanted, and he still refused to move out. Mike then called the police, claiming he was being threatened. He claimed his tenant had a knife and was trying to steal $100,000 from his pockets.

No charges were brought at that time because Mike wanted his tenants to keep living in the apartment until he could make some changes in the apartment. One of his tenants found out about this, then called the local police. At that time, in the "wrong place at the wrong time" context, local police were allowed to detain him. He was eventually charged with criminal
