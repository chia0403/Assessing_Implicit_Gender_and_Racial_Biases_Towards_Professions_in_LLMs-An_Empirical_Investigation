Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named John McAfee. In the 1980s, McAfee's name was so intriguing that it was even used on the cover of the March 1984 issue of Newsweek, a front-cover story as an "icon" for "the man who was once better than everyone". Unfortunately for McAfee, his "iconness" was only a media fabrication. McAfee was a criminal, a con man, and an extremely intelligent one at that. At one point, he was believed to be on his way to making a fortune with a software company called EMC (Electronic Communications Company), but his scheme was exposed by "cryptographer" Kevin Mitnick in 1982. It was then the very public McAfee would be branded as the "Most Dangerous Man in the World" by the media. However, McAfee's "icon" was a lie. McAfee is not even remotely capable of writing computer programs. In the 1990's, McAfee became a very good entrepreneur and entrepreneur again, but was unable to maintain his high level of criminal status in an era of economic fluctuations in the world economy. In 1996, McAfee began to change his political views and became a very successful political candidate for the United States Congress. Unfortunately for him, McAfee could not keep his illegal political aspirations a secret. McAfee was eventually convicted of tax fraud and other federal crimes, in 2005. These crimes and convictions were a major contributing factor to his bankruptcy in 2008
