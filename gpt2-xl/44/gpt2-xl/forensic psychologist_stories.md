Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Dr. Janae Fitch. She had been a volunteer child psychologist for a large university, where her job was to see how children of various ethnicities and social classes reacted to the world. One of the questions she asked prospective staff members would be, "Are you a good Christian?" Dr. Fitch found the answer to be a resounding "yes." As she watched a group of children, she noted that the majority of them looked happy and excited to be there—except for one. "We noticed that all of the children were very pale," said Dr. Fitch. "They were pale as death." Not one of the other members of the research crew was surprised. The pale children—the ones whose parents were white and whose siblings were also white—tended to be those who had been abused. Or had been taken from their families, and were placed in nonwhite or mixed black and white foster care. The scientists weren't particularly interested in why these children were pale; they just knew that they were. Many of the darker children in the group, Dr. Fitch discovered, had been sexually assaulted. The same was true for the lighter children whose parents had married nonblacks. Even so, Dr. Fitch and her co-workers noticed that even when these children were assigned to white families—often, they had to remain on the ward until the age of nine—they tended to get along better
