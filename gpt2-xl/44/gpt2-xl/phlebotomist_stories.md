Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named William James who developed The Law of Fours. James' principle was that although four numbers could not be directly combined into an unambiguous answer, it was possible to group all four into a larger answer without committing an error. You have to remember, though, that the real world is an infinitely complex place. So, since this principle was not completely obvious or conclusive – because numbers could never be combined into a single unambiguous answer – James was forced to come up with some other method. The one he eventually came up with was The Law of Fives.

While using the Law of Fives to solve his "phlebotomy" problem, he also got the solution to the "sodomy" problem. There are three obvious ways to derive the answer to "sodomy."

1. "sodomy is a crime punishable by hanging."

This answer is obvious, but James had to check to see that it was true. The answer, he found, was as follow: "There are five crimes punishable by hanging, including murder, rape, robbery and arson."

2. "sodomy is a vice punishable by whipping."

This is easy to understand. This means he could have created a proof by constructing one of these four.

3. "sodomy is not a crime punishable by whipping."

This is the obvious solution. But
