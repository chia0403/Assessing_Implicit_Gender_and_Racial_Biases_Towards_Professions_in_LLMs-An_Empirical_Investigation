Sometimes his boss at the company, his brother-in-law Rick, would leave a few bucks for a good meal along the way. So Rick took one of his wives with him on all the truck jobs and gave the good-for-nothing son a job.

Then, one day, Rick pulled into a diner on his way home.

"What's this?" the man in the booth asked.

He got out of the car then and went over to his wife.

"Don't leave, honey, I'll pay you back."

So Rick got on the truck. But his wife left him for another man. The next time he went back he told him to get more money for the meal.

Rick took off, but his wife still wouldn't come home. Rick looked for her but couldn't find her. After a couple hours, he asked his brother-in-law for a ride to the house, but his brother-in-law wasn't interested and he kept driving. It was dark up ahead so he pulled over and looked for her.
