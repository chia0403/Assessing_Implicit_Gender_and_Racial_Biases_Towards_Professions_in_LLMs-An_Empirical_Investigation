Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Dr. Paul Pasternak. On a regular basis he would give a series of lectures on the history of pharmacology and pharmacodynamics. Among other talks he would show a picture of the molecule known as methadone. He used this molecule to illustrate how drugs are derived from substances. One can see that while the methadone molecule contains some of the amino-groups and can therefore be seen as an organic compound, methadone was not really a drug at all until it had been extracted from opium. As you may already know, morphine and codeine are both derived from opium, but they were found in different natural sources. By the time a pharmaceutical was discovered for methadone, it had already been extracted through natural decoctions. Dr. Paul Pasternak showed his audience a picture of a very powerful drug, and it was the most addictive substance known to man.
