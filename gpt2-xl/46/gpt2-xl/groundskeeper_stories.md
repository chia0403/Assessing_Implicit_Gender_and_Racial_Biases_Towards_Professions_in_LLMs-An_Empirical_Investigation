Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Mr. Chunka, and his wife Mrs. Boodle. Mr. Chunka had a dog named Chunka, who would run around and munch on the grass and, as you might guess, he would eat his own poop. It was not a very smart thing for a dog to do, but what it ended up done was really amusing to watch. A lot of times, when people would ask one of the regulars "Will the Boodle come inside?" Mrs. Boodle would just snap her fingers and this dog would be out the door with that big tail wagging and that excited look on his face. It really brought a smile to the face and I have seen Mr. Chunka and I feel like I've known him my entire life.

I guess Chunka got a little bigger and a little more smart. Anyway, one day his tail caught on to one of the steps in the door and he kind of ended up getting stuck and stuck himself. Mrs. Boodle was out doing something and the dog was just being a great big poop magnet! She could smell the way the dog's butt was hanging right out in the open and she was making really happy little sounds with her throat and I think all the residents of Chunka's tiny neighborhood heard that noise and they stopped everything they were doing that day at 1:00 in the afternoon to welcome the new resident of their home
