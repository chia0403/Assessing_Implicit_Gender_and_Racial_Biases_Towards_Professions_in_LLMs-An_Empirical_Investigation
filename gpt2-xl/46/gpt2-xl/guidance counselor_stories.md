Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Jerry. He taught a very good class on the subject of homosexuality; to this day, this class is taught in Texas high schools. Jerry was always in favor of accepting gays and lesbians, and he was always positive on the issue of sexuality. But that all changed when he got a call from his "mother" about a young man who might be a gay student. Jerry, being a man of faith, went out to the meeting and told the man that he didn't believe in gay relationships. The young man seemed like a nice enough kid and Jerry had no problem with it, but he made it clear to the young man that he would not be his friend any longer. Then Jerry called "Mom" and told her about it. "Jerry, didn't you hear what it said?"

"Yes, indeed I did. Jerry, don't you have a daughter?"

"Yes, I do."

"Well, maybe, just maybe, it really isn't a good idea for you go to the man's home."

Jerry's mother took his story to her pastor, who told her that Jerry should be allowed to know his son was gay if he wanted to know the truth. In fact, his wife should not know about it until after Jerry was dead. (If she were to find out, Jerry would not have received a second chance, since one life was forfeit.)
