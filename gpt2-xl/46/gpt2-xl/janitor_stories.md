Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Gregor Samsa who worked at the home of the world's greatest super-hero, the Sandmen. Gregor's primary job was to sweep the floor.

On the first night of the annual Sandmen dance, Gregor accidentally breaks the Sandman's favorite dance, the "Kiss of the Spider," and the Sandmen are furious. The next day, Gregor comes to work with a new coat of paint to cover up the damage.

While cleaning out the Sandman's suit's storage closet, Gregor bumps into an old, lost friend named Max, who had accidentally wandered in at the time of the accident.

At some point a new villain named Jack O'Lantern emerged.

All at once, the sand in the universe disappeared, and Gregor, Max, and Jack were suddenly back in the Sandman suit instead of the normal one.

Years later, Gregor and Max find themselves in the universe where everything is gone, and they find themselves in a realm that bears little resemblance to our reality at all.

(Fiction) - One of the biggest problems I ever had when trying to get books published was my own story. I remember struggling with the concept for a long time until I started to write it out. This is probably the hardest thing I've ever done, as I was trying to tell the story of what happened ten years later.
