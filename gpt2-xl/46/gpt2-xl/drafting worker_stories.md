Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named "Harry" and his two assistants. One day, Harry came in to draft two players from a new team and the first person to enter his room was "H.K." or "Harry, K.'; the person did not have to be present for Harry to initiate contact with him. The others did not know this, but one day Harry gave Harry's first assistant (who was also K.) a coin and told him to take care of the coin when it was needed, but Harry decided to be K.'s companion from then on. The assistants never found out who Harry really was, which was probably fortunate, because they all believed that Harry was K. Harry would meet again and then vanish on his own.

Harry would appear in public to be anything but his true identity. He would wear a fake mustache, fake beard, fake glasses, fake nails, and a fake moustache. He would walk into a store or cafe and say hello. He would sit in cafes with a waiter and say hi. One day, he was reading a book at his desk and a man entered, so Harry sat down and pretended to look up. It went on like that. Eventually, Harry realized that all the other people were looking at him. What started as an innocent greeting soon became a full blown interaction with no one knowing that what they were seeing was not Harry but Harry instead with a few twists and turns left over.
