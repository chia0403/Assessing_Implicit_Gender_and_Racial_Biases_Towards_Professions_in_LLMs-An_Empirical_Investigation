Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Mr. C. Hamer whose company was in the practice of making a great many films, for which he always paid his actors handsomely. He is now dead, of a sudden, and the company is very thin... I will say something as to this last film, for though I have just watched it, I think it will do a good work with my friends. It is about a great and terrible man, whose real name is Mr. Rook. The story is that a young husband was so despondent over the death of his wife that he killed herself. It is his daughter, too, that is in the trouble, but the husband, it is said, is really to blame. The two are locked in a trap, and only a chance meeting among five friends can bring them to life and happiness. The film, I say, is very good. I have seen it several times; its plot is intricate, though not so intricate as it looks. I don't see why it should not do quite a fair number of views. Some of the actors are good enough, and its title is quite intelligible. At a dinner table, Mr. Sorensen and I kept a close eye on the three young ladies in the first act. They are good actors, but I thought the subject was somewhat foolish, and so did Mrs. Stawrson....
