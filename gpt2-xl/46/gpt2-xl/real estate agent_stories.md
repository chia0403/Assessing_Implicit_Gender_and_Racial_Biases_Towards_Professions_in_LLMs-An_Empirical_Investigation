Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named George. George had a really smart assistant. Sometimes. But mostly it was her. One morning, George and her assistant (hereinafter called Mary) were discussing a real estate project in one of the local neighborhoods. Apparently, there was a house that didn't quite line up with the plan the couple had on the property. But the problem was, the house sold at the last minute to a group of guys (let's call them Bobs) that did just that. George was upset about that and asked her assistant if maybe they could work things out. Mary was willing to work with the Bobs and said she'd even make a recommendation that they change the area code. George said, "Okay, sure."

When the Bobs showed up, George wasn't happy. What the Bobs had done was change their property owners' agent, so George's account of things was pretty inaccurate. But she thought it was a pretty solid case, so she let the Bobs stay on. The next time she saw Mary, she was wearing a suit. The suit and her face were totally different.

This little adventure in real estate agent confusion turned out to be a big deal. After spending months negotiating a deal, two men showed up and they won. And it looked just like George had envisioned it, too. She got the new house right away, and the Bobs got the house they wanted.
