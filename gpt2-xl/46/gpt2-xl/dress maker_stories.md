And the result? A dress that is still being made today. At this time, the name Susan was in reference to its designer, and they had a name for every dress Susan made. All of these names have been lost to time, but there is one thing in common: She always had a very big head, so I decided to do a costume based on this original theme. The name is: The Princess' Head. And it's all about the head. I modeled the original dress after Susan's original dress, but changed the silhouette, altered the fabric colors, and even made it slightly asymmetrical. I even used old fashioned wire for the bottom for added dimension. The head was made up in different colors which represent a different age.
