Once upon a time, there was a plumber named William. One day, he arrived at the house of Jane and James, the owners of the old Victorian mansion that Bill occupied. As William entered the kitchen, he saw a woman washing a sponge on a long, silver brush. In his excitement, he hurried over to get a better look at her. He began to walk towards the door, when he hesitated, and turned to look at the woman standing in front of him. She was dressed in a short black dress, with a pink scarf wrapped around her neck. The scarf hid her eyes. She smiled at him and held out her hand – just to point at something, and he quickly ducked his head to hide behind a chair. At that moment, the plumber saw something he'd never seen before. That woman was smiling; even though Bill was in her home, she was being happy. And she was doing it without him.

How did she know? The question burned in William's mind, and he did his best to stop it from playing out. What kind of smile was this? William found a way to answer his own question. After all, he himself looked happy all the time… except that he wasn't. He still had to do his task as quickly and efficiently as possible, and that meant staying behind the plumbers. William thought back to Bill's encounter with that woman, and how he could have done what she was smiling at him to do
