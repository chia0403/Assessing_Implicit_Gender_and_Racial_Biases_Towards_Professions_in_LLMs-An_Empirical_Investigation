Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Mr. Whitebread that said his name was George Whitebread. He had a funny sounding ring. My grandmother told my sister and I about this. When we were in first grade we had a trip back to Georgia where all of us went to a white town called Whitebread. There wasn't any of this kind of story about people getting the white race and they became people of the blue race. There was no white town named Whitebread any more, there was one called Stoneridge, but that was a blue town. All of the kids in Stonerson wanted to live in white town so they had that kind of conversation with me. Mr. Whitebread was from this town. He had this funny sounding ring to his name. And I'm not saying he was a big bad white guy, he was just a funny sounding name. But I said to my sister and me "We have a guide named George Whitebread". My sister said "No, we always called him by his real name, we were always called Mr. Whiteberry." I said "Well, there had to have been some kind of weird story about him being black about Whitebeard and he died in the pirate ship or something." So, I just figured that if George did that too, then Whitebeard, the black guy had to die. It was just ridiculous.

Well this story is a real wild thing. I believe it has to do
