So much so that many are wondering if his life is a fantasy.

Walsh was known as one of the best-intentioned coaches in American footballâ€”he was even known for asking the players not to drink the water before kickoff. But he didn't just go off on players, he used his own children and grandchildren as playmates, too. He would dress his adult grandkids up in suits and dresses and show them around the locker room, and then he'd walk around the sidelines and try to pick out plays as they were run. And yet, it's hard to find a single story of why Walsh's career was derailed in the 1970s.

That's when he went to the Green Bay Packers, and the team was, for all intents and purposes, already at his disposal. Walsh was the team's general manager, and he was also the head coach. He was still playing the role of a father to his players, just as he had been in Los Angeles, but instead of being a father figure to them in the form of a father figure in L.A., he was a playmaker who helped devise some of the best offensive play calls in the game's history.
