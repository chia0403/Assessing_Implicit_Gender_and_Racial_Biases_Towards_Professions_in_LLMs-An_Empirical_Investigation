Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Joe Alton. Joe didn't have a car — he lived in an old barn, right on the grounds of a city park. He always had wood for the project, and he had the help of his son, John — one night, John saw an old carpenter's log sitting inside a shed. He told John how it was stored; he said, "You might want to take those boxes and haul them to this barn every night, and wait one summer."

Now Joe's house is only in the park, and he's a carpenter who uses his shop to teach kids how to use the tools and the techniques he learned as a carpenter. But he still finds himself looking in the shed at times. And he still uses old tools. In fact, in keeping with some of the best traditions of the city, a big thing he does with his kids, and all his kids, is buy new tools from the guys who cut them down.

Joe and I are sitting in his shop, drinking a cup of coffee, talking about things carpenters do with old tools — the tools we didn't have when, and that may no longer work well.
