Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Chupacabra. And the name went all the way back to the 17th century.

In his first appearance, in the 1760s, Chupacabra "was the best in the world." But not necessarily. He was a puss, and he bit his victims. It was a plague of tiny black specks, which bit and bit until their bodies went black, and some suffered more than others. Chupacabra also ate his victims wholeâ€”an unfortunate side effect. In 1828, the New Orleans public health agent noted that when Chupacabra bit the bodies of his victims, "a few drops of blood made them all a little pale all over... and from that, a slight stammering of the voice." In the words of an eyewitness, the victim would "worsen."

No one knew about the disease, and no one knew how it spread. There is no evidence from the period to indicate that it reached New Orleans. A single mention of a child who died in New Jersey was reported, but no other mention of the disease. (Though several eyewitnesses, including two doctors and two priests, said that the virus spread by biting.) By the 1820s, doctors and public health officials suspected that Chupacabra was contracted during a shipwreck. It was only in 1827 that Dr. William Johnson described it in detail
