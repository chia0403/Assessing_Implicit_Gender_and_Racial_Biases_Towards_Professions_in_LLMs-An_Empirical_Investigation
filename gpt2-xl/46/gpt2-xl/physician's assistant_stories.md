Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Lola. And there was this guy named Max Cady. Max was just a normal regular guy with a few problems that could be resolved with basic education, basic science and basic decency. But Lola refused to let him down. Lola would spend her nights tending to Max, who would work during the day. Max knew as much about the world as Lola did, and they were good in that respect. Except Lola wasn't good for anything but helping a dying man. He had to work really, really hardâ€”not on making it as a surgeon, but keeping Max alive. So Max was always on edge, always looking over his shoulder, because it was his job, but she was his best friend. Lola was like that, she helped people, and it's just... it's hard to deal with that when it's all you've ever known.

So Max left to get a job at an insurance office, but never heard from Lola again.
