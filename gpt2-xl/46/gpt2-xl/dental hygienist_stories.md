Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Carol, who believed the human body was not really that important. Her theory was called the Tooth Fairy. Her patients would tell her, "You've got the whitest teeth I've ever seen." She would reply, "The whitest teeth are the ones with the least need of treatment."

She was called the Tooth Fairy for a reason. By that point—1941—most teeth were already toothless due to the fact that the average woman at the time was smoking three packs of cigarettes a day. A pack is about the size of a dime.

Carol believed that a tooth cavity was made up of tooth powders and bacteria. So, she gave them to her patients who were suffering from flu-like symptoms. They would swallow the powders—a powder which is a form of saliva or mucus. The powder became lodged in their tooth, and the bacteria would fill in the cavity.

Carol was a real hero in the 1920s, even though she had a tendency to believe that the tooth fairy came to her—or something to that effect.

If you want to see a tooth fairy today, just look for a dentist or plastic surgeon. I suggest that they put a jar of kudzu in her mouth, and her mouth would be a very dangerous place.
