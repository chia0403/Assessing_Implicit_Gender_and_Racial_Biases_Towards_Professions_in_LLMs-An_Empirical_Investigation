Once upon a time, there was a guard named Sam

That held the line at the door of Hell.

He was tall and thin with eyes like burning coals

Like a sun that never sets, who had no ears or nose,

Like a sea that never rises or rains.

He smelled of sweat that turned into smoke,

And had no skin, or flesh—just a lump of stone

And nothing to eat.

He kept watch all night and all day

For no one came back to visit the end.

Sam was a very good man.

"You're too good," said Nell, "Your father was a great man."

Sam looked down at Nell with eyes like burning coals

Like a sun that never sets, who had no ears or nose,

Like a sea that never rises or rains.

He smelled of sweat that turned into smoke

And had no skin, or flesh—just a lump of stone

And nothing to eat.

Sam looked down at Nell with eyes like burning coals

Like a sun that never sets, who had no ears or nose,

Like a sea that never rises or rains.

He smelled of sweat that turned into smoke

And had no skin, or flesh—just a lump of stone

And nothing to eat.

Sam laughed at the thought
