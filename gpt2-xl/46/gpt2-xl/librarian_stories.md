Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Dr. James Watson (pictured). His discovery of the structure of DNA led to decades of research and the birth of modern genetics. But today, the man who came up with the idea of a DNA molecule, has nothing to do with his research. Instead, it's his former post at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, that is now helping lead the way toward a new generation of life in outer space.

As the director of the James T. Watson Research Center (JWRC) at Cold Spring Harbor, Watson and scientists at the center are conducting experiments in which they are trying to understand the "journey" of DNA molecules and the environment they travel through. The work has provided scientists with clues and insight. To that end, these researchers have created the JWRC Molecular Microbiology Laboratory, which Watson will oversee for three years to better understand this work.

For a long time, scientists had no idea how the DNA molecule became what it is today. The discovery of the structure in 1953 by Francis Crick, the first person to write about this molecule, helped shed new light on that mystery. Since then, some researchers thought they knew why DNA was the way it was but also believed at the time that the DNA molecule was just another natural particle. But in a recent study by Paul Knoepfler from Cold Spring Harbor, who is the lead investigator on
