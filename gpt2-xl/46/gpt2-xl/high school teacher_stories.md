He couldn't believe how simple the answer was; he couldn't wait for him to read the answer out loud.

We are all like Miller there once were. We write the answers to the world's problems down in our heads. Every person, of course, is an exact duplicate of Mr. Miller; our ideas and behaviors are the exact same. Like him, we are only capable of thinking in vague terms.
