Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Mrs. C.L.M.P.P.M who was responsible for the daily care of the animals in Nipigon, a town in the French-Belgian Congo. One day it came to her attention that one of the chickens had mysteriously disappeared over a large stone wall near the town's main plaza. She went there with her husband and discovered the remains of a huge chicken that once guarded its owner from the evil spirits. The chicken, with its beak missing and body completely broken into four pieces, was a truly horrific sight but luckily the veterinarian was able to identify the dead chicken as one named Chicken-Lunge-Horn.

For some reason, the chicken had an incredibly large horn, which provided a useful secondary defense and helped the chicken keep any and all predators at bay. The physician then noticed that Chicken-Lunge-Horn was found on every continent but Antarctica.

A few years later, a young man living on an Antarctic island named Richard Gellert happened to stumble upon Chicken-Lunge-Horn in the same region as the original grave. The bird could fly, but the most spectacular characteristic was its large mouth. There was a small horn carved into the top of the large mouth giving it an enormous size, thus allowing the chicken to communicate with the living. Although the bird was extremely rare, and it had only appeared in Antarctic areas for a hundred years
