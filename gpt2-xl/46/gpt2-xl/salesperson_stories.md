Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Jim, and he loved making people happy. Jim was one of those SalesPeople who never said no when a new customer asked for help. Jim went over the sales process: how he got into a new business; what he did to make them successful; how they could do their sales more powerfully next time around. He explained how he used to be a good salesman before he got into the sales profession, so he could relate. After Jim explained how he used to do his job, one more thing: he showed the client how he used to sell; a classic case of what's wrong with Sales.

Jim got the first client on Day One, but for months, he had trouble keeping his job, and with it, the high rating he got from his employees on his report cards. He couldn't do the work they wanted him to do, and he was spending more time with his children than he planned on. Finally, to try to save the job, Jim put his entire portfolio worth of ideas on hold and went home to look for another one, while the CEO looked for a replacement.

"Jim" found a new job in a sales-oriented job with the best manager he could imagine. He even got a promotion. Jim has to put everything he knows on hold, or he'd get fired. On a regular basis, Jim's sales team will ask him at the end of a sales meeting what he thinks
