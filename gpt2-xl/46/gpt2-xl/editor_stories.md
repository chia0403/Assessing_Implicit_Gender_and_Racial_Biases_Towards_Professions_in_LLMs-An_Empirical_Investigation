Once upon a time, there was a editor named Ken Smith, who spent decades fighting against copyright, publishing copyrights, and helping libraries to expand access to information all for the betterment of mankind. Eventually, a publisher, who also happened to be Ken Smith's former employee, used the power of the copyright office to attempt to sue him for copyright violation. This case went on for two years, and when Ken Smith finally prevailed, he was forced to pay half a million dollars for the violation of the copyright. That was a year ago.

In the interim, Smith and his team did all they could to raise awareness of the problem of online piracy by starting up his own blog called the Open Knowledge Foundation. Their mission was clear: "to help the public understand how content can become subject to ownership on the Internet, and to provide legal protection to people whose content has been stolen without their permission." For those years he was fighting the publisher in court, and when he didn't get much better results, he turned the fight over to the public. Through the Open Knowledge Foundation, Smith began offering free access to his work to the Internet community at large. Within just a few years he was able to persuade the U.S. Copyright Office to start providing legal protection to any content in the public domain. The result? A whole new era of sharing.

The same can't be said for the case against Kazaa, a file-sharing website that was shut down in October
