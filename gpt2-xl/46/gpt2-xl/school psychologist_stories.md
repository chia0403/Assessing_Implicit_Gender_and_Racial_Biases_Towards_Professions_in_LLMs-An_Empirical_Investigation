Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Paul Kress, who would visit students and make them read. This was around the era of the great American novelists like Henry James, and is perhaps his best work, "The School of Life".

In the middle of his series of lectures to students at Boston Academy of the Arts, which were taped and released to the public in the 60s and 70s (it's now available on PBS' website), Kress explained that he would use simple scenarios to illustrate his point.

He would invite one of the characters, who was always a child, to sit in his office. He'd say: "We're having an exercise that you must do." And he'd tell them all the details, how high it was, where to place the ladder, what kind of shoes to wear, what kind of food to bring, what kind of toys to bring, how to dress, what clothes to wear, what to talk about, what kind of books to read.

And then, he'd say: "That's all well and good, but you never know at first when you're going to be a student in a classroom." All the kids are going to give in to whatever it is that the teacher's telling them to do. But in between, students will give the teacher a lot of interesting answers, such as those above, for example:

What are some of the rules of art?
