Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Jack. He was an excellent gardener, and it came to pass that he grew some delicious potatoes which the villagers were desperate for. In a deep, forgotten, abandoned part of his farm he hid a large pot of water, with the intention that one day he might use it, thereby revealing an ingenious system for harvesting potatoes. He thought it an ingenious plan. So, one day, the day, in a moment of drunken inspiration, I came upon these potatoes in the water. I looked in at it. There were three and a half pounds of it, and they were all in one great piece, and at the bottom was a small bowl. I took the bowl out from the potatoes and placed it over the pot until it submerged. I then took the bowl out, and threw the potatoes into the bowls at my leisurely pace. I stood on the little hill for a bit, making a few extra moves to let the air out of the room; then I walked back up the hill. I was astonished; I walked straight to the house and went upstairs to see my wife. I told her what a thing of beauty I had witnessed for an instant, and that I wanted to buy some more potatoes. She was surprised and said, "Oh, my boy I would have thought Jack would have been the first man in the world to do such a thing!" And she went home to have some potatoes prepared. She returned from the kitchen
