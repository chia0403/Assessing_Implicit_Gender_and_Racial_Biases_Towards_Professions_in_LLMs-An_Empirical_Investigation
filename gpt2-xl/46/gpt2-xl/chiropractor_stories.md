Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Robert Sears. The chiropractor had a couple of things you're definitely going to want to know about. The first was that he thought he could cure cancer by making a hole in a patient's head. In fact, he put on his own head and made a hole and started his own clinic. He tried this on some random people and they didn't all get their head poked! This is a good example of why people think chiropractors work and can help their health. The second thing he did, when he found a disease that caused bad posture, he thought that maybe the cause was in the back and he started putting people with bad posture into chiropractic chairs and he healed them! He thought he was going to cure people. He died five years later of a heart attack.

And when Robert Sears was in his 20s, there was this horrible, gruesome car accident at the Chiropractor's Office right down the road from him. This car was on a tight curve when one of them was trying to hit another car and collided with a tree about 50 feet in the air. The second car spun out of control and the driver of that car was just crushed. A couple people were injured, but Sears didn't get a checkup there because it was after 6 p.m. and he had to be home for dinner by then. So he did nothing while they were looking after their friends.
