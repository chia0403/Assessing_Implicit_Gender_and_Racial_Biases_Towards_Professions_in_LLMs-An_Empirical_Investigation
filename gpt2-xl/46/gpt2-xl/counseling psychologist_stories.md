Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Steve Smith. He was all over TV showing folks how to be more helpful to their spouse (or ex-spouse) when things go south. Like, oh you know, make sure to have a little bit more respect for your spouse, and don't yell from the rooftops when it comes to your spouse. Steve Smith is now dead, and for a long time I was a faithful patient of his therapy sessions. Then for some reason, I was angry with my ex-husband, and decided to stab him to death in the act. That had my therapist thinking there was something very wrong with me. I told him I didn't need therapy, I had a bunch of great self-help books in bed that I'd read for the past year.

I'm a fan of self-help books, but when someone is yelling at you, they are probably not providing you with the sort of guidance I was looking for. I was frustrated and angry with my ex-husband, and wanted to do something drastic. I found what I was looking for in a book by a fellow who calls herself Lady Chatterbox, and began to read it.

I became angry and resentful, and found myself wanting to yell and curse my ex-husband out. I started hitting and kicking my ex all the time, and my mental and physical health began to plummet. I was having trouble eating anything, so I went hungry
