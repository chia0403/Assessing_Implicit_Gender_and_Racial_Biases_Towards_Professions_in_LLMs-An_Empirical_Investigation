Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Ms. Karen. The class loved Karen; she was beautiful... a sweet-natured lady, and a sweet, caring wife who lived with her husband and their two kids. Her husband died of cancer. Her husband, his family and everyone else in the school loved her. Now Karen has suffered a stroke that has left her disabled. But what she really needs is a house... but that's not as easy as I'd like it to be. Karen has to depend on friends and neighbors to pay the bills and make sure she can eat the food her feeding tube provides. Her biggest problem is that she doesn't know how to read. I asked Karen how she felt when I told her I was going on a bookbinding adventure. She explained, "That is what I have been dreaming of. I have always wanted to work on books, and now I have the chance." This was her story. The words I typed out sounded like a conversation that Karen was having with herself as I typed out these words. I thought when she'd heard these words, her expression would change - a new one; an angry expression... or a worried one. Yet her expression didn't change - it kept going back to her usual smile and happiness. Then I thought how incredible this must be for Karen... to have a chance to work on bookbinding and to come here... to help me. To give back to someone who gave to her,
