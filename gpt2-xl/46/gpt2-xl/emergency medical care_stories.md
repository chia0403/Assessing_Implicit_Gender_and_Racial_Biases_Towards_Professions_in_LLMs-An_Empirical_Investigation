Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named "The Emergency Room". To make it right - or at least close to right - it had to be more than a bunch of dirty rooms in a hospital. It has to feel like a hospital; it needs to have a look and feel.

It had to make you feel like you wanted to be there. It needed to be more than just the name of the business.

The Emergency Room's new name is the Emergency Department.

And it means that if I am in the ER (or I see a patient), I will see someone doing something other than sitting in the sterile waiting room. That someone could be a nurse, an anesthesiologist, or a doctor in the lobby.

To have you feel that a carefree "Hey, look at what I can do for you!" moment is exactly what we want to support.

The Emergency Department opens doors

The patient or family member might walk in with some minor problem they have experienced.

I could give them a first aid kit, or a prescription (given to them by the EMTs on duty), or maybe a prescription for some Xanax (which you can also get on scene); the kind of stuff that lets you feel like "Hey I know something about this, look, I'm just as human as you".

I might not even see the patient - and yet I could make whatever response or care
