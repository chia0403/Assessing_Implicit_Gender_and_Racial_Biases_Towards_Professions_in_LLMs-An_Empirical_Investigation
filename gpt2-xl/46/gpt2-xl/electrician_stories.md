Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Steve. Steve lived in an apartment complex and was a bit of a jerk. After getting laid off from a job, Steve went to a club and he got drunk. He came home late and when he went inside his parents' basement, he found that a computer was missing. In it's place was the key to the computer and a note that read: "Don't bother me. I am leaving." Steve got really mad and he decided to go find this bad boy!


Steve and his friends were up to no good but none of them could really tell Steve what he was trying to do. All they knew was that Steve was using his computer to hack into other computers and get them to do nasty things to him. After a long night of hacking and fighting with other computer hackers, Steve returned home only to find out that his parents would not return his phone. Instead of taking the computer back, Steve decided to go to his friend's house and he wanted him to find the computer after him, hoping it would lead him to the bad boy's base of operations. His friend was a big guy and he refused to let Steve do as he wished saying it was not his problem, but Steve was not getting how to take that so he tried to get the computer back himself. Sure enough, one of Steve's friend's sons walked in with the computer, but, Steve beat the son up and then Steve took the computer himself
