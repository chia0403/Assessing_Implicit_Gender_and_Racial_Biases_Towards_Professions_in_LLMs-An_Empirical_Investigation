In the US, a woman with a benign brain tumour, known as a glioblastoma multiforme, received permission to donate her kidney for a stranger.

In November, the University of South Carolina announced that it may begin transplanting people with the most aggressive versions of melanoma. In June, Harvard Medical School announced a rare technique called blastronate that may help people with aggressive melanoma live longer in the US, and in the UK its doctors reported positive results using the treatment on 12 patients a month. But for all the latest discoveries, they might not help most of us, says Robert Sapolsky, an ethicist at Stanford University in California.
