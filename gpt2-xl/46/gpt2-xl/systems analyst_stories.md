Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named George Bush of Ketchum, Idaho. A little too young, but with an early commitment to science, Bush volunteered to serve as a scientist in the U.S. Navy. The task was to develop a ship-to-ground laser weapon. As a young man planning for his scientific career, Bush would have been fascinated to know the science behind such a high-power weapon, a laser that could burn holes through a metal ship. But instead of a laser, he had to work on a "fire test device" to calibrate the laser power. He later had to work in the Office of Naval Research, under the oversight of the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations. George Bush had been asked to develop this device for the U.S. Navy, even though the weapon was only a year away. The device would probably be found on the surface of Venus. Bush was asked to develop a laser for the Navy. And while he was working on this weapon, an adversary had successfully tested a similar weapon. Bush learned that the U.S. Navy, though possessing a nuclear "first strike" capability, wasn't capable of destroying a ship or missile with its highest-powered laser. So the Navy asked the defense contractor Raytheon for a way to produce laser weapons with that capability. Raytheon, which had an exclusive contract to provide the U.S. Department of the Navy with its "Naval Strike
