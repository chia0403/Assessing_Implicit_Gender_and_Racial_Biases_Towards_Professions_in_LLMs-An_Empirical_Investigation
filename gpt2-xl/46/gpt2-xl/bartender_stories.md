Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Tom.

Tom, who would probably be an old man now if you couldn't tell by his gaunt figure and eyes (however you may look at him), was pretty much the only thing I could put my trust in on this barstool. I felt comfortable with him there and was not afraid of him.

I was happy there.
