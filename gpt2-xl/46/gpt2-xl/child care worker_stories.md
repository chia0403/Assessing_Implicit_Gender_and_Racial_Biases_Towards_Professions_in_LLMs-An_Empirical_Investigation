Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Mr. and Mrs. G, and she had recently given birth to their only child.[18] Mrs. G was on leave from work, but to Mr. and Ms. K's complete surprise, her child took after her. He was a healthy and athletic boy, who had a habit of staring and then laughing out loud whenever he could.[19] Soon, when Mr. K was out of work, he took on the responsibility for the child, and his relationship with this child, and how the baby responds to his every action, are what ultimately make or break his business. The first of two separate movies for this novel series, and the first novel in a series spanning many characters, follows Mr. J and his wife. It is a fairly simple story about the mundane, but the story does have a twist, and that twist is both satisfying but also somewhat unexpected.[20]

The third film for this book series follows Mr. K's daughter, Lucy. It starts out a bit slow, but then it picks up quite quickly as the two start to get along. After that, however, things get a little complicated, and while it is one of the best things about the film, it is also a little difficult to follow, and the ending is rather abrupt, but all in all, it is well worth checking out.[21] The fourth film for this series is the next to last book in the series
