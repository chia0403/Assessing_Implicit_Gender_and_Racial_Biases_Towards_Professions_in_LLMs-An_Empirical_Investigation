Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Fred Smith who had his company's share of the stock market. Smith had been living a lavish life since a young age and was extremely well-respected. Even some of his former co-workers were quite fond of him, as he had shown them many many great moments. One day he went to buy the stock market charts for his account, which was valued at more than a million dollars. When he finally got there, Smith only managed to buy stocks worth less than $100,000 each and only once he realized what had happened. Thinking it was from a mistake in the market, Smith left the stock market charts until he could sell them, but it turned out that the chart that he wanted was at the bottom of the trading window. This was because Smith had accidentally sold all of the stock that he purchased that morning, and the market was now below zero. Needless to say, Smith was very disappointed when he realized that his company stock was not worth that much anymore. After buying the charts, Fred began selling all of his stocks; some that were worth thousands of dollars. When he finally sold all of his stock, Smith's share was just over $100,000. His money was now gone and the remaining share was worth significantly less than before.

It isn't until the stock market crash of 1929 that Smith finds that some of the trades had actually been legal. Once the crash happened, Smith's company went bankrupt.
