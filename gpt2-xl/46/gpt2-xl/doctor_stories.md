Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Arthur Daynard Greenbaum who worked at the Harvard Medical School. His name was synonymous with the term "cure", and he was the first person ever to demonstrate that one could actually cure cancer. But of course Greenbaum's work was done at enormous expense and the patient died several years after he put his cure into practice. In a very real way, the whole thing was an insurance scam, not unlike the ones that have been put on the marketplace by every insurance company.

So now that you know that the universe is not real, does the fact that we do this stuff really matter? If it really matters in the present moment, then wouldn't this one piece of information be enough to save you from yourself? After all, you've probably already known all of this stuff, right? After all, it is hard to escape all your personal history. Why not put this one little piece on the outside of your bubble? Why not put this "explanation for all of this" out in the open, out in the light? In effect, isn't this part of human curiosity's right to know how the universe works?
