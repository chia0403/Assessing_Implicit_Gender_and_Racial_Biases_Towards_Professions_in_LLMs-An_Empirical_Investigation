Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Goliath who was born of a woman who fell in love with another guy. And when God said "I can't make him a woman", Goliath's father was like "yeah right kid, you can't make me a woman, but what if I had my own little penis and you guys got to make me fuck a girl" so they did. So on this stone slab underneath the city, they got to work chopping away at itâ€¦ The people of Jerusalem were freaking out. They were afraid to go outside or go to the temple or do anything because they thought the guy on top was still alive and was going to fight back with a penis of his own.

There's just something about trying to work with the same group of people you work with for years and years of your life and then hearing them mutter the most idiotic stuff in the world. It's like how does he know all the names of the vegetables? How does he know the names of the crops? How do he know all the important events of the month or year? So that just made so much sense to me when I was like, you know what, fuck it. It's not about me, it's about me, it's for me.

This is a pretty heavy subject and no doubt many people are interested in it and want to hear our explanation and how we see the world in a way that makes sense for us.
