Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Carl Rogers and he was the first one to really understand what the brain's "emotions" were and how they function in everyday life. He realized that people had many different emotion/sources from an innate base in our biology and that emotional responses (like anger or sadness or joy) evolved out of an innate base in our brains.

However, many years of research had not made much headway on identifying which emotions and which sources of these emotions actually are based in our brains due to the highly compartmentalized nature and nature of the human brain.

During this time, neurologists and psychoanalysts had realized that emotions are not simply different "nodes" in our brain that are coded by the limbic system or amygdaloid complex. It has been found that our emotions and most of our other behaviors actually stem from several different neural pathways, each which is coded with a different neural language.

From an evolutionary standpoint, these neural pathways would be highly advantageous in allowing for the rapid expression of emotion in a wide range of situations. A simple example of this would be we do not typically want to take a shower in our underwear. However, if we have to take a shower in our underwear we have to activate several different neural pathways. Instead of being angry or sad, we would rather be sleepy, anxious or embarrassed.

This was why evolution did not favor a "giant" limb
