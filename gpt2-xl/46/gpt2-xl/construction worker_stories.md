Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named George.

"George was a good guy," his wife says, "but he had a secret." "George was a good guy, and he did a job, but he didn't sleep for seven days. He was so out of it. He was on fire for that," she says.

They kept George company. A few times, they watched George sleep, with his eyes open, his head resting on his arms.

They figured he was dead. After 10 days, she called a friend, who told her about George's little secret.

The man who had helped build George's house had built himself into the most powerful man in the country.

George was one of hundreds of construction workers nationwide under investigation for "a long, detailed scheme of fraud involving rigging bids for work and, in many instances, stealing the money owed" to the government, the Justice Department said in a statement. The workers were part of a widespread scheme by contractors hired by a Mexican government-funded organization, commonly known as the Zetas cartel. The men were accused of taking bribes from the Zetas and hiding them in payments to government officials — and sometimes their home in Mexico — where they were then used as collateral. There is no evidence the workers ever cheated clients, the DOJ says. The alleged fraud was committed between 2006 and 2015.
