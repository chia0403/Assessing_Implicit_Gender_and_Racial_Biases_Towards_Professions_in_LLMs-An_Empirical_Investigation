Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Mary who served in the United States Department of Education. She met a girl named Sue and their relationship blossomed into a passionate romance. When Sue turned 18, she went to go live with her parents in Texas. Mary went along with the change because Sue seemed too young to leave her parents and to be left at home alone. Eventually, Mary grew to be suspicious of Sue's behavior, so she started doing more research into her background.

What Mary discovered was startling. Sue admitted she was a child molester. Mary said that she was so shocked, she told everyone she worked with about Sue's criminal past.

Then Sue started telling Mary, 'Did you know, Mary that I used to have a boyfriend? He was the president of the P.E. club at her school. He was a student at Texas Tech. And he was killed about a year from now because he ran over a girl crossing the road. I killed him and hid the body. I'm not gonna tell you where or how. But it's in your house.'

This was shocking enough for Mary. But so were Sue's other confession:

She used to drive to West Texas and meet her boyfriend at a motel. She found him and then went to his hotel room and raped him with a knife while he was passed out. She then tied him up and drove to Houston where she threw his body out of her car window
