Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Sally, who was working in a hotel near Broadway and Grand Avenue. It was her second day on the job. While she was in the bathroom, she saw two little black girls playing on her bathroom floor. The maid came and asked her why she was at the bathroom. Sally explained she had just been looking at the floor for a short while and she was just curious for a break. But the maid didn't think that was a good reason to be in the bathroom. When she told Sally she would need a break as well, Sally's boss told her she had to go back to work immediately. When Sally returned home, she found her boss sitting at the dinner table on his phone with her sister.
