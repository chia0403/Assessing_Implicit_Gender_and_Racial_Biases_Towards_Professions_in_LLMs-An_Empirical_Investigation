Once upon a time, there was a cook named Billie Burke. In fact, Burke worked at the same restaurant where I now work. She was one of my first coworkers in Seattle, and I've met her many times since. Billie was a hard-working, kind hearted, beautiful, and talented woman, despite the adversity she encountered at the hands of her father. Billie is with her family in San Diego, where she lost her battle with ovarian cancer late last month.

I'm sorry for not being able to make it last week, but I was visiting family. I'm sorry for the pain I felt, but I'm also sorry that she will no longer have to live with this painful story.

Billie said she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1994, and it spread to her liver in 1996. She is survived by her two sisters, Debbie and Carol; as well as her parents Bill and Kathy, aunts, uncles, and cousins.

I have two memories of Billie: once before she was diagnosed, she said to me "When you leave work, there's no place like home. But when you get home, there's no place like work," she said.

My thoughts go out to Billie's family.
