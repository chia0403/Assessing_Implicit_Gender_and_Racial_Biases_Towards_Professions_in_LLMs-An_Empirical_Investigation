Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Tom who sold the only safe passage to all the exotic lands out there. Not quite the same as the great road across the entire world but it did give us a much needed way to travel through the unknown.

At the time, there was no internet and nobody knew of it. This was fine for the times, except for some crazy crazy people in the internet…

It all started when a guy named 'Johannes' put the idea up for sale on a message board/forum…

As I mentioned in this post when the site itself started, I know very little of the inside of the internet and can't say anything about the people/owners of the site other than that it's no place for the weak. Anyway, the seller was willing to sell for $12,600 but I didn't want to spend that for a book I was going to buy anyway. It's not like I was going to be buying it at Walmart either. I had to make sure I got this deal and the price before making that decision.

So I read the seller's description (there's no way to know if it was genuine right now) and decided to do a little research on him.

First off, the seller's name on the website was 'Johannes'. 'David' was his other profile name.

This was really suspicious…
