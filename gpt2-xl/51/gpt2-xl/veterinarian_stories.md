Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Henry M. Salk, who worked for the Cincinnati Zoological Society. Salk became the world's first recorded vaccine inventor in his laboratory with his creation of a vaccine against yellow fever. His efforts ultimately helped eradicate the disease.


Today, many scientists are trying to replicate his success through their "preventive vaccines." The new vaccine developed by British researchers could be one of the more effective preventive vaccines to ever be used.


The vaccine -- named "Salk1" -- was made up of a group of 12 pieces of DNA (or bases) that bind to viruses. Researchers at the University of Sheffield and MRC Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in Cambridge, U.K., created the Salk1 vaccine by splicing a portion of Sabin's own Salk vaccine viruses into the human DNA.


A lot of scientists were skeptical at first that such a "preventive vaccine" worked. But last Thursday, the British researchers published a new study that confirms that Salk's vaccine did indeed prevent people from getting the disease.


"We think we've done just about everything we can do," said Raimund Haussler, who led the clinical trial.


Researchers have been using other vaccines, and a number of other vaccines developed in the 2000s, against many of life's diseases including polio, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). But all of those vaccines had
