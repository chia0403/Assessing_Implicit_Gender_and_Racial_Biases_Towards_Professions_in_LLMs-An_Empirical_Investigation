Once upon a time, there was a painter named Mark Boulton. We know this painter because he was the first painter who took the idea for colour in art a little further than the old masters. In the case of Boulton, colour was used as a way to highlight the work of the artist in an interesting way and also to highlight other parts of the painting that you might not normally be able to see if it was merely a monochromatic image.

In painting Boulton's works, he made colour stand out from the rest either by highlighting the colour of the subject and its surroundings or by combining multiple colours in order to produce a different effect. The image below shows a painting called 'The Mute Bird' which used colour in a very unconventional wayâ€¦

Mark Boulton was a pioneer who pushed the boundaries of how colour is used in art. The above image shows his masterpiece 'The Mute Bird' and it clearly reflects the evolution of colour in art. In the past, color was used to highlight the details or the foreground of a work. It was also used to complement other elements on the painting such as a man's hat and hatbands. Nowadays, however, colour plays a much greater role in the painting process. It's very important not to think of Boulton as an artist for the sake of showing off how he uses colour in his work, as he was definitely a talented painter and a very interesting person.
