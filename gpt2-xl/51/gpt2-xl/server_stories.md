Once upon a time, there was a server named "WannaCry." And while some say the server name could have been more clever it at the very least had one "W" in it—or even more—what can you do with just a couple hundred thousand computers (all connected to the Internet), in a world where viruses and hackers spread via the same means as any other virus, "WannaCry" had to be stopped in its tracks.

The attackers used a program called "WannaCrypt" to encrypt files and then to change how that file was displayed to the user. The new software, not unlike what many security professionals consider to be ransomware, would encrypt the files and also erase all the important data from the hard disks of these devices—the files that contain the information for people to carry out business and government services, save their personal information, work or play.

And so it began.

Carrying on the tradition of "WannaCry"

"WannaCry" was not the first, nor will it be the last, computer virus to scare its victims. It is simply the most destructive. As such, there is already a wide-spread understanding of what caused the outbreak of "WannaCry." But in the past, we have seen what not to do when confronted with a crisis like this, and the mistakes were just as significant as the mistakes made by the attackers.

The biggest mistake made was not having
