Once upon a time, there was a reporter named John Hulsman. One day, in the middle of a story, the reporter was called out of his bedroom to check in on a man named John Hulsman. John Hulsman was a young man. He was a writer, a young man, with a promising career ahead of him. John Hulsman was a man whom the reporter found appealing: a man with a clear, straightforward mind, yet another who was willing to do anything for his story.

In one case, Hulsman was asked the question he'd been dreading: If his story wasn't good, would he go to the man himself and turn it into a new book? Hulsman felt like it probably wouldn't, but he tried again.

"I would," he said.

"Or you could just sell your story as a tabloid."

"Screw that," Hulsman said. "It has to be a story worth telling."

It was now Hulsman's third time at the Post, and a few days later, he was called back to the office to discuss a story. The reporter was looking to break a particularly big story regarding the Clintons, with an eye towards the White House press corps.

At this point (the interview was conducted a few months later), Hulsman hadn't been involved in any real investigative journalism before, but he had some skills in spades
