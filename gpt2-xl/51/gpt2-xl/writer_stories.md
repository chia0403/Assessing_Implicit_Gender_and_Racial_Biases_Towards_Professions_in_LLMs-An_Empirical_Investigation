Once upon a time, there was a writer named Paul F. Tompkins. He has been doing stand-up comedy in the L.A. area for several years now. I'm not exactly sure what kind of comedy he does, but I can certainly appreciate it. As someone who has seen and laughed at every single one of his shows, I can honestly recommend that everyone do this. Every time I see a performer I have never seen before (and in a great show like this one), I'm blown away. He is incredibly funny, one of the best interviewers around, and he really knows how to entertain. His show has a relaxed, relaxed vibe. It was a pleasure to watch Paul at his show. The two nights he made it to LA were memorable, and I wish I had more time to see him. I was able to catch two of his stand-up gigs. On the first night I went to the venue, it was the late night slot, as they closed down their regular Monday-Wednesday late night slot and moved it to Wednesday nights for the comedy. The show lasted all of 15 minutes. This was a very low-budget way to sell tickets and to advertise the show.
- Paul is hilarious. This might be something he's known for or something that's true about him, though honestly I haven't made the connection yet. Some of the jokes were hard to follow at times, though I'm not sure that made the audience feel worse
