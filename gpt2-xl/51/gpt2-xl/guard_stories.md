Once upon a time, there was a guard named Harry.

That was a long time ago.

He ran into his current situation because he was patrolling the town's perimeter after a fight erupted between the gang behind him and another group that followed him. It took Harry a couple of minutes to find the right area, then he ran in and kicked the first man who challenged him in the teeth, then he kicked the arse back of the group that followed him, and he kicked one of the hoodlums that had followed him around. In the end, this gang got so bored that they decided to leave town to do their own 'dirty' business. The problem was that their new home wasn't that far from Harry's location, so they all decided to go back to the place where Harry was patrolling while they stayed behind to make sure Harry didn't steal any property and steal back any drugs they stole.

So, Harry spent the day before Halloween doing his job, and that's when things started getting weird. He went down to the river, where he usually would find some old abandoned houses, and he stood on a log and watched the water go down, hoping noone would come to knock him down, and he'd have some time to get lost between patrolling and spying for the local drug ring, which he'd definitely do if it meant beating the hell out of those dirty street punks that were getting all the drugs without him knowing.
