Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named William R. A. (Joe) Dibella. The phlebotomist also performed surgery on patients and kept medical records for them. One day, while working on a patient, he discovered something rather unusual while examining her cervix. The cervix had been twisted in more than five different directions.

A doctor called the term "dorsal prolapse" and, eventually, "dorsal prolapse vulvaris" was applied, which is a term that refers to any vaginal prolapse, also known as anterior vaginal dilation.

According to the Mayo Clinic, prolapse happens when your pelvic floor becomes too weak, loosens, or "deflates" and the vagina does not fit correctly. According to the Mayo Clinic, prolapse affects both women and men.

The procedure for a "dorsal prolapse" that should not be done is called a vaginal hysterectomy. The procedure is not permanent and the vagina heals over time after the hysterectomy and is healthy enough to begin having sex again.

According to Medtronic, a major medical technology company that is a leading manufacturer of surgical and medical devices, they do not make any hysterectomy surgical devices but they do make the Gynablast, which is a vaginal delivery system that allows you to remove an endometriosis-causing disease
