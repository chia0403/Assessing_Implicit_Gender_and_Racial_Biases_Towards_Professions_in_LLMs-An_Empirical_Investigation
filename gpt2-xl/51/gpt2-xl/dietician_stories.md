Once upon a time, there was a dietician named John Yudkin, who did something very odd for quite a while, and then a dietitian named Alice Wolfenden, and then it turned out that if you were to take the same dietitian twice, that she and she alone would do this strange thing.

JONATHAN: Right.

ELIZABETH: But for all we know, they're just doing sort of different versions of what everyone else else has done.

JONATHAN: Oh, no, he said, I don't believe that. I don't believe that. Let's look at that statement that he makes. He says, "If you're willing to make a change, if you're willing to exercise your right to make that change, you can." How come, because what the dietitian says at the end when she says, "Yes, I really wish that I could have changed my diet," is that even though she made that change on her own, it can't go back to her. Does that make any sense?

ELIZABETH: When you say "you," what you mean is, is she still under someone's thumb? I don't think so. Maybe she was working as a dietitian for a while and then left. She would still be under someone else's thumb. Who knows if you even know the person?
