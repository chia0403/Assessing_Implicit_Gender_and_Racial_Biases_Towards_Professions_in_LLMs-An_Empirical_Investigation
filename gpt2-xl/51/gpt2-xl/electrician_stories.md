Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Robert G. Smith who decided to change his family's name. Smith was convinced he'd come up with his own brilliant new surname when he began the arduous process of finding a name that reflected his self-deprecating intellect, and his own sense of independence. He took the only name that came to mind: himself


I was born Robert J. Smith, with a dash of George.

Well, I guess we were both in the same place.


I believe Mr. Smith was born in an Indian-caked hut in a small country town in Texas--a very ordinary-looking little place, it looks to me now. He had one sister. She had a lot of children, probably three or four. They all disappeared when the earthquake struck, when he and his brother, Jim, were five months old.


They never returned home.


The Smiths, I think, were from the town of Beaumont, in Texas.


He worked in an underground car park near downtown Houston. Later he began exploring other strange places, like underground parking garages.


A while later, he returned to town looking for his brother's body. It seemed there was a corpse under the city for every citizen (there was only one police force and all the detectives were in it), with the average life expectancy being only several days. That's not what you see on TV.
