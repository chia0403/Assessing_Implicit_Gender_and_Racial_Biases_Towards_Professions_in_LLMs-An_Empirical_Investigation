Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Frank who made this dish. He'd tell the story about what happened on the night of the shooting, his customers saying "You don't seem so scary anymore", and how he'd say "If it were up to me, I'd make a deal with the devil. If you come into work on Monday, you'll get the life of a martyr on Monday, and you get it with two shots of Fireball". You'd shoot the first shot, and then Frank would get a shot of Boker, and you'd hold it in between the lips of the body lying on the table. The second shot would be the same, and on Monday night, you'd shoot and hold it in between the two lips of the body that Frank had just shot himself with your second Boker shot. If anyone asked you if you'd had a drink that was too strong, you'd say "Well, yes, but I was thinking on a very spiritual plane". Then you'd shoot yourself with three shots of Boker.

The Boker shot starts with a shot of Bourbon whiskey, "If it were up to me, I'd make a deal with the devil. If you come into work on Monday, you'll give away your right arm and all of your right leg. You get it with fire, the first shot, the second, the third". The first shot is the same as you'd do for a regular cocktail, however
