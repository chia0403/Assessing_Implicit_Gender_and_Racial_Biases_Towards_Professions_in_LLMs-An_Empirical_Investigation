So in a free market, with the government acting in opposition to market forces, Frank would have to raise his animals more slowly to make sure his profits were as high as possible. But this would be to his own advantage, because if Frank makes his animals more expensive, then he's not going to be the only one able to do so, and thus his competitors will reduce their wages.
