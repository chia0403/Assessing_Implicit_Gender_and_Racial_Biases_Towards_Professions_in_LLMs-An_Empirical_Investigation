Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mrs. Pines.

One day, Mrs. Pines taught her class about the dangers of touching a hot stove. Then one day while they were out running around in the house, something amazing happened! One little girl named Mimi got so hot that she started to melt. Not only melted, but got hot enough to melt the butter! So what did Mrs. Pines do? No worries! She just covered Mimi with a bucket of butter! It was that kind of day. The most amazing thing.

So what are some other things you could do to protect your child from the many hazards of everyday life? Maybe your child gets his or her hair caught in the oven (it happens) or the toilet seat catches on something and catches them in the butt, causing them to become very tired and irritable! What if you forgot to lock the door? What about your child running off in the night with a big box of toys? Even a simple act like these can be deadly, making it hard to protect them against the dangers of everyday life!

We hope that these stories can make you think about the dangers that sometimes surround us like these. Because we think it's so important to teach these kids a life worth living!
