Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Edie, who wanted a big cake but couldn't afford to pay a baker to make it. So she hired a professional to make it, and that professional had the help of a little girl named Sally, who was not as crafty as Edie. The professional made a cake that was bigger than Edie could have expected, and the cake was more beautiful than Edie could have had done. Then one summer, the little girl Sally left home to walk across the country. She never came back, but her mother told Edie, "The girl left home because she wanted a bigger cake." Edie did not take the story well. She felt it was a bad thing for her because, as a result of hiring a professional cake decorator, this little girl wanted something that she could afford herself. She had no right to pay somebody to give her what she didn't have. So, she hired that big cake decorator again and gave him an order to make the cake bigger.

Once again, the professional made the cake bigger. This time Edie thought, "He's going to pay me for doing the same thing that I couldn't afford to do!" She told the professional not to come back, but he did, and the big cake was still bigger. And what a beautiful decoration that big cake was. "It just looks so pretty," Sally said. "Everything is just so nice and tidy,"
