Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Mary Lou Jaffe, with this remarkable and fascinating blog, called The Closet Clap. She wrote about her closet as a space of both beauty and power. (If that description doesn't make you say, "I'm in a space of both beauty and power!" then our lives may just be in another galaxy.)


She describes how, in her room, there's a little white box with two matching curtains, a little white box with two matching curtains, and so on, to keep everything in order. "So you have to look at your life through that little white box," she writes. "The little white box shows you both the beauty and power of your life."

Jaffe also describes the moments, like those around her birthday, when she says, "I don't know what to expect, but I just feel a sense of peace."

You can see her room on her blog, or in this photo of her in which she shows off her closet. (She's a very talented and talented woman.)
