Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Dave who was the son of a very wealthy family. He knew that he couldn't follow his father's footsteps and so he went outside the system to find an alternative path his father had failed to take, something he called "The God Path." When he was only 13, Dave began to believe in God...and God was great.

Later, at his retirement home, Dave was able to find a copy of The Secret. This is essentially a book of the "Way of the Secret" passed down from Dave's father, but unlike Dave's father's version, The Secret contains a message from God! Dave read the message and he realized that The Secret, or something similar, was his path to God. This is perhaps my favorite book ever by a guy who has left God.

As it turns out, the "godpath" was simply a path that was used by the Mafia, the CIA, and other evil things. Dave decided to go on the "godpath" and started to make himself as "rich, powerful, and dangerous as the Mafia and CIA needed!" The result was a series of "accidents" that caused his boss's house to burn down, a plane to crash into a quarry he worked in, etc...All things that allowed Dave to become richer, more powerful, and more dangerous! Dave kept on doing this, and eventually decided he had made enough money, he had enough power,
