I am not a fan of the current President, but I am a huge fan of his father. While I will not discuss details of this presidential race, I will say that this election is like no other presidential election that we have had. There is one man that stands out above the restâ€”one man who has done good things for the world and one man who has done bad things for the world. We will see how this story ends.
