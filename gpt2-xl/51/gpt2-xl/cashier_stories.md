Once upon a time, there was a cashier named David (the first name) who kept the register and was responsible for keeping it all on the right side of whatever he was processing. Once a customer walked in the door, David checked their ID to determine their identity and then issued them a check out ticket.

The main job the cashier needed to do was to pay his or her bills. It has to be paid in full or the customer is required to return within a certain time period or risk being asked to leave the store. The amount paid is written on the check out ticket.

Now, let's look at an interesting case study:

David didn't take kindly to some customers paying cash with a debit card. He began to suspect that the customers were using the card for store sales with the hope of making some extra cash.

To make this possible, he devised the idea of using a store's ATM machine. This is similar to the credit/debit card system that banks operate.

At the time, David knew that the ATM would function like a credit card machine to dispense cash out to any customer who walked through the door with a debit card. The cashier was instructed to go to the back of the store to the cash register and cash out the customer's debit card as though it were a credit card. After a few days, David realized that they had to do more to ensure that everyone could legally use the debit card
