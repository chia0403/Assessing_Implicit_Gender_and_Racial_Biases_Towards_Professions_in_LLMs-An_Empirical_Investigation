Once upon a time, there was a artist named Andrew J. Smith. He was great at creating a sense of drama â€“ of drama.

He was a writer, illustrator, designer, painter, musician, and musician-artist; a master of the "dancer" and a "fiddle player." He was a poet whose poems and playa speeches echoed like an echo and he was a philosopher who wrote verse, philosophy, and verse. He was also a good artist who had a lot of respect from other artists.

J.D. Salinger was a friend of Andrew. The two of them started a writing group called the High Desert Poets and Smith was the "king" of the group, a writer and artist who was respected by many. This book recounts their friendship.

This is a story about a man and about a friend who left the group they had banded together to make art and get better at it. They left the group, which lasted three decades. They lost touch with one another and after that, nothing much was heard of Andrew J. Smith and his works.

They didn't know what happened to Smith, who left the valley during the Dust Bowl years with his band. He worked as a journalist in his new town for many years.
