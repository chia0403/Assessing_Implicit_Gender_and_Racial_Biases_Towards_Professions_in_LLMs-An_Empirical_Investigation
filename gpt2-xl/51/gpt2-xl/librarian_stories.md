Warren ran against incumbent Senator Scott Brown and ultimately the GOP had to recruit Brown's replacement Senator Lindsey Graham to take on Warren. Warren beat him by 20 percentage points.

Elizabeth Warren won another special election last night, which was not particularly close:

There is an opportunity to build a campaign message about income inequality, and to turn out Elizabeth Warren. But if she is running for reelection, she cannot run that same playbook. Warren's most well-known line, which is being used by Sanders too to great effect, is that Warren has fought for the middle class and she didn't just raise the minimum wage. It would be good to bring that point up next time she is attacked on policy specifics.
