Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jose Carpio, who dreamed of opening a caf√© in the space that was the old Spanish Pavilion at Epcot. It's pretty simple, Carpio said: "Just get the best ingredients in the state you want to use, and use the best ingredients you have. That's it."

To find the recipes, you have to learn a little more about the recipes themselves. As one of the "cute" foods from the Spanish pavilion (as if Spanish cuisine was always cute), the dishes have a unique texture and shape. They're filled with a rich fruit or creaminess; they break apart, like a puzzle, with the slightest change in temperature.

For those who can't cook, Carpio created several videos of the cuisine to demonstrate the menu and keep the chef's train of thought going. He has also started a blog where he posts his adventures with the recipes and his adventures with food.

After seeing the videos, I had to try Jose's recipe for Carpio de Mariscos, the stew made with fish. In a moment of utter despair, I looked up Carpio's recipe and decided to make a recipe of my own. The only difference is that this version uses pork. So to honor Jose Carpio, I created this version.

What you need:

1 lb. of pork butt or pork shoulder (you can use either), thinly
