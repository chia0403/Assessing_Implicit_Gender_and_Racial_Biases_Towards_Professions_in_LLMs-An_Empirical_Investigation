Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Walter and Walter wanted a lot more than plumbing tools (or a job at all) to earn the money he needed. So he built a store so he could hire others to work for him.

At the time, there was a thriving black neighborhood in the city that was well connected to the main thoroughfare, and Walter needed to make a lot of money to hire people to work at his store. So he found himself recruiting many black children as he knew many were in need of a job during the depression.

It was only logical that Walter hired a number of his former students after taking them out on outings to a local amusement park â€” an adventure they thought was just a game to pass the time.

Walter then asked them the question that became a running gag of their lives, "Was this the best day of your life?"

It turns out, it was: Walter was in a position to make a lot of money off these young students and made sure to hire black kids as many times as he was able.

This story is told in a funny way and makes for a hilarious animated short created by a white animator who was brought into the picture to create all of the jokes.

I hope everyone enjoyed this funny story of a plumber and his gang running a black store in the African-American neighborhood of Queens.
