Once upon a time, there was a logger named B.D. Wong whose name you probably don't know; he invented logarithms to help math classes keep track of powers. One of his students, William Shakespeare, saw an opportunity. In The Merchant of Venice, he wrote, "What's there a man can do but multiply,/Muliplying, and multiplying, and muliplying,/And multiplying by the square of a sine,/And thus by the square of every sum,…/Muliplying, and multiplying, and muliplying,/And multiplying, and multiplying, and multiplying…"

Wong's math students used his logarithms to design a model of the universe as described by God in the Bible. According to the logarithmic model, the universe was eternal—a single entity with an infinite number of causes and effects. The only thing separating the Logos (God) from the Universe (the universe) was how much its powers were multiplied.

"That's the logarithmic model," Wong tells me. "So I came up with a different kind called the geometrical model. In the geometrical model, there are things growing. In the logarithmic model it said that it was all like a logarithmic spiral and the universe was just spinning on top of all this growth. That is just a very, very natural model that's completely reasonable."
