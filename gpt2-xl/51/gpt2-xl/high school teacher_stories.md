Seuss was not known to read books written by children. He preferred writing stories. Although he has said that kids shouldn't read his stuff, he is known to have published several books written for and by young adults as well.

Seuss may also have been part of a group called Parents-to-Be of America (ptob.org/parents1ba.htm), another group of parents who supported the cause of adoption by lesbian parents with their children. A number of them were on the board of the American Adoption Movement.
