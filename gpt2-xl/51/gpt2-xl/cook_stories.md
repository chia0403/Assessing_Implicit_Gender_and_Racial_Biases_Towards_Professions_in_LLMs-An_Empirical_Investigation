Once upon a time, there was a cook named "Chef Jack," with a great idea:

So here's the deal. I want you guys to cook food on the fly, while we record on tape. I'm giving you the raw materials–rice, bread, salt and hot pepper and onion–and you put them together as quickly as possible. So if you say, "Chef Jack, I want a bowl-half-full of rice with some black olives, and black olives and onions," you could say, "I need another bowl-half-full of rice with some olives, chopped white onion and hot peppers. So chef Jack, I need rice, black olives, white onions, hot peppers and olives." And Chef Jack can tell you what it's supposed to taste like.

And there he is, working the whole time, with no notes, and no notes at all, making the best food possible.

What this meant was that, eventually, you'd see these recipes come of age, with the time being measured in days, rather than weeks, and they'd become timeless, which is why "Chef Jack" still is one of the top-rated recipes on The New Yorker's archives.
