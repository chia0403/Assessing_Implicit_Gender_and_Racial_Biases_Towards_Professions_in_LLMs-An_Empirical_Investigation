Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Henry Ford who realized that cars wouldn't be as good if they didn't take care of themselves. As a way around this problem, Ford invented the automobile; now he realized that an automobile would be most useful if it was able to handle itself. Unfortunately, he didn't realize that a good car needs an awful lot of maintenance. That's where the idea for a mechanical bulldog came from...

Here's a picture of the car in question, a 1954 Plymouth Road Runner. How about some historical background before we're introduced to the story. It seems like Plymouth was founded in 1914 when it was the only automobile manufacturing company in the Northwest Territory; the brand name, as it appears today, went through several variations, including the name "Plymouth Star," eventually settling on "Plymouth." In 1940, Plymouth launched the Road Runner in North America. After the war, the original Road Runner was replaced by a more powerful but more expensive Road Runner II, the Road Runner being only a small part of a much larger automotive empire. In 1950, the Road Runner debuted in Mexico, and by 1954 in the U.S. It is unclear how many Road Runners were built in the U.S. during this time, but the cars sold at all, whether under the Road Runner name or not, represented a tremendous cash cow for the company, which was also making their own engine.
