Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Mary. She was a friend to everyone, a good person, a reliable friend, and so on. But something happened. One day one of the client was the most important person in her life. It was her boss. The boss is so big and so powerful that every man in the world would listen to his orders for his whole life. But today he didn't speak to her as a friend, he spoke as superior and superior man. He told her that in the future she must behave like a man, that was something the boss thought she'd need in order to please her boss. Her boss even said that the best way she could do that would be to turn into a man. He didn't want her to look feminine any more. And that wasn't Mary any more, she just looked different. And so her boss sent her to a doctor at the clinic. That doctor was a young doctor named Josefine. And Josefine was treating Mary, and what she thought she was doing was saving the boss' future.


Mary was scared, Mary was shocked, Mary was confused, Mary understood she was about to be transformed, and she was even afraid that her boss was going to find out. So she kept quiet, she kept hiding. They made her swear that she wouldn't do ANYTHING that would get Josefine in trouble. They even made her swear that she'd never tell a soul, not even
