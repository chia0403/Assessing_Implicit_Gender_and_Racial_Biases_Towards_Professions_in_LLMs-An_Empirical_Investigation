Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Larry.

Larry lived a peaceful life, making his money well and helping his company build huge corporate empires through good old fashioned hard work.

One evening, Larry was walking home after a long day of work. A passing trucker, who was drinking in a nearby parking lot, threw his drink in Larry's path. Larry was so angry at the man that he punched him in the face, causing him to fall into his vehicle and crash into a wall and stop rolling.

Larry then picked the trucker up, took him back to his apartment, and beat him all over his body.

The police were called, and Larry claimed that the man's glasses were on the floor of his car's trunk and that the phone was under that man's arm when he punched him, causing him to fall over.

What Larry didn't tell the police at the time was that he had been watching the trucker's truck while he was driving home, and it just happened to be parked near the same corner from Larry's apartment that he had hit him from.

The police did not believe him about the glasses.

Later that evening, Larry was driving along a back road that he used to go off by, and suddenly his car veered down a dirt road where the trucker was sitting.

The trucker got out of his vehicle, looked at Larry, and winked at him
