Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named John Jacob Astor, who opened up his shop in the New York City neighborhood of Brooklyn, with the intention of creating a salon like no other.

He began by offering hair cuts for men and women, adding that he was more than happy to give clients "a haircut which had never been done before for a reasonable amount of money." However, the salon quickly grew to offer "high quality professional services at the lowest prices ever."

The business quickly built a devoted following, and soon became the "hanging out zone" for locals, who could come to the salon knowing they could be greeted with high barber-quality service and hair care.

This early salon opened the door for Astor to become one of the biggest and most respected hairdressers on the East Coast, as well as the pioneer of what we know now as the "hair salon."

Today, the word "hair" is defined as anything that is removed through plucking hair, styling hair, plucking or coloring, and styling a wig.

So, in light of Astor's famous quote, what is actually meant by "hair salon?"

So, now that we have defined the term, let's go over the exact definition.
