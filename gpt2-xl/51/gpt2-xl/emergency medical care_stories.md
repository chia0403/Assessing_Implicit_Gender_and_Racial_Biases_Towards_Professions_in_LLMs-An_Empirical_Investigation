Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named SIDS. This little, yellow pamphlet has been a key resource for children and their parents, as well as educators, for many years. We believe it's time for it to pass from this earth. Today's SIDS prevention professionals may feel obligated to incorporate this work into their training. As nurses, educators and volunteers with no formal training in SIDS, we would like to ask you to consider adopting our own version of these guidelines so it can continue to flourish. Here is our letter, in one word only: Thank you.

Our message

Children and the environment are the most important things we have. As clinicians, we cannot have our patients and families become the focus of our research efforts if we do not teach the children and caregivers the basic knowledge and skills required to prevent SIDS. As educators, we must be concerned about how we teach children and caregivers to prevent SIDS.

We at SIDSCoalition are working to ensure that children and their caregivers are trained to recognize the warning signs of a SIDS infant. In addition, we are advocating that our schools, hospitals and other health systems use proven SIDS prevention methods.

We ask for your support and your help, so that we too can continue the work of preventing SIDDs in the future.
