The defendant was convicted, and the Missouri Supreme Court overturned his conviction on the theory that "when a defendant claims that another person committed a homicide, the defendant automatically loses his right to have his case evaluated by an impartial [forensic] psychologist."

Two years later, the same court determined that the defendant's allegations about the other person's involvement were false. The defendant appealed that decision, and the Supreme Court upheld the lower court's decision.

This is an unimportant rule because, as it turns out, only about 1 percent of crimes get solved with the help of forensic psychology, even though it has a reputation for being effective in that field. This figure puts us at the head of the pack when compared with the other sciences that solve crime. The numbers also put us ahead of traditional law enforcement — which can get a few thousand cases right and hundreds of thousands wrong — when it comes to the number of arrests that do get made. Forensic work has made arrests in murder, rape, and arson cases. But it is less valuable than law enforcement in solving other crimes, such
