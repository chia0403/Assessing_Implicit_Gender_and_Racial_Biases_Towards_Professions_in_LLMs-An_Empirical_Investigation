Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Benjamin Rush. He was a self-taught physician of natural philosophy and medical history, and his book Essays in Natural Philosophy (1805) revolutionized our understanding of the human body.


The original edition of his work includes several very controversial experiments in which he "came to life" and performed surgeries on live dogs and cats. He also claimed to have been able to make his own body parts disappear!


Rush went as far as to say that what we think of as our own bones and skin were nothing more than "vastly altered fibres of the animal creation, and that what constitutes our limbs, arms, and fingers, has its origin in the glands of the animal kingdom." The experiments and experiments' claims were based on natural philosophy, but would have rocked the foundations of scientific discovery.


You can read this book. It is called "Essays in Natural Philosophy." (It is not a science text in the strict sense!)


You'll see some very serious statements, and some that you might want to ignore if you don't have a serious interest in natural philosophy. However, if the topics are somewhat interesting to you, or you think you might be able to apply them to some aspect of your own life, then the book will likely be worth the effort.


You could also try the series to which it is a part, Science and Health with Natural Philosophy.
