Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Joseph. He had a store of his own on North Market Street in Springfield. He was very good because he had a large, clean, and bright store with a very large and cheerful window and a good sounder stock, and as much order and cleanliness. He looked like a big, brown-haired, fat-bodied man. He dressed well; so well that some people liked him very much. "I was working in the shop one day," says Joseph, "and I remember that Mr. Johnson came in from some visit with his wife. He came in from a very bad tripâ€”a trip that he had made, quite likely, that had not been very healthy. "Just at the moment that he came in I looked through the window and saw the gentleman, and told him that it would be all right. He told me 'Just as you please!' "When Mr. Brown came in after his visit one day I looked through the window and also saw him, then I told him 'Just as you please!' and he told me just the same. He also looked through the window very soon and made himself so welcome. I would have given half a dozen pounds to have been able to spend a few days with him, because he was to me the finest tailor in town, and I really felt I would have liked him a great deal."

Joseph had met a lot of great and good people through his business.
