Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Julie Brown. She had been involved with the city's school system for years, earning a reputation for being "the best," and working with low-income kids. And, she would say, she had the kids' best interests in mind.

A few weeks after she started work at the city's high school, Brown was fired.

"We talked about everything from bad grades to bad behavior to when you make the phone call about going out and fighting at a fraternity party," says her former boss, Rick Baker. The calls had been happening more frequently.

"She's on the other side of the phone, you know, dealing with a kid who's not going to be here long from a drug arrest or a gang assault or anything else. And what she said to them was: We're still on the job until you get back to school. That was all they ever asked."

Her dismissal came in the middle of the school year, in June, 2009. In her dismissal letter, Brown said she was "suspended for seven days for failing to follow school rules."

"One day I was working with a group of kids who had been hit with multiple suspensions for fighting," Baker says. "One of the kids turned to me saying, 'They should have fired me.' This was a very angry kid who'd gotten in trouble in school."
