Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Mimi. And when Mimi disappeared, a whole lot of things happened. A lot, in fact, that were so bad that something had to be done. You see, Mimi once served the prince of Belknap, and he loved the way she flirted. She was so talented that he took her under his wing. And of course, she flirted back.

Mimi became a lady of style who knew all the secret ways to impress the prince. And to his credit, the prince loved her heartily.

After a little while, however, Mimi developed a bad habit of talking to anyone who was on call to her. And, no matter where you were, you couldn't help but hear the conversation. For about a month or so, Mimi would chat up a clerk in the kitchen department, then a baker for one, and finally the cook for dessert, and they always left with a smile on their faces. But it was only a matter of time before Mimi made Mimi talk to you instead.

And, the moment Mimi would reach for you, you couldn't be sure which one you were dealing with. This is not something to be feared.

This is an encounter with Mimi, rather than a con game.

It is difficult to believe that this "person" — Mimi — can actually exist, but she does.
