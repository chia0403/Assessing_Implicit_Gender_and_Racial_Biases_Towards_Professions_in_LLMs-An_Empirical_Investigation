Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Chuck Yeager. (Actually, he flew off into space on the back of a Saturn V rocket, but that's something for a later column), Yeager was famous for his "loop that goes around and around." That's rightâ€”or, as the movie credits describe it, an "unsinkable airplane." But he wasn't the only one to fly around like that. In the mid-'60s, two men named John Glenn and Gus Grissom used loop-the-loop tactics on the NASA Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) to circumnavigate the globe in two weeks. Since then, a number of people have used loops and other aerodynamic maneuvers to reach great heights: Alan Shepard became the first American to reach the "highest altitude made by man," the stratosphere (about 40,000 feet above the surface of the Earth) during a suborbital flight in 1962; Chuck Yeager was the first person to fly solo in space in 1962, but did so because the rocket that made him soar into a black void of space wasn't quite ready for a return trip to Earth; the Apollo 17 moon landing crews were made up of four men, but one man, Neil Armstrong, flew on and on without refueling because he wanted to make up for time lost for the mission to the moon; the first rocket to be sent to space was the Titan IIB in 1960, and it was fueled
