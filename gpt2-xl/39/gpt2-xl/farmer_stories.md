Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Joseph Mikes, who was an excellent shot and could get very high. One day Joseph's horse tripped him, so Joe picked up a stone and used a lasso to pin his horse down. Joe then stood there, with his horse between his legs, and shot him dead. I have since learned that there are still some stones left around the farm that Joe had shot. However, on the farm that is presently occupied by Joseph Mikes, someone has a stone that is used as a lens for the camera.


While this is not a great deal of a surprise information considering that they live in the same area, it is worth noting that the farmhouse is situated about a mile from another farmhouse where another Joseph Mikes family is known to have stone lenses for cameras. The family was probably out with the animals one day when these stones were dropped in, as these stones are still there with the family.


I do remember that one of the Mikes' children had a stone which he used for a camera lens. He would put it in his pocket and take a picture.


Since I have only met with the Mikes family one time, none of them have mentioned anything about the stones used as lenses until very recently with their kids in the area.


This is a fascinating story, one that deserves to be heard by all those who cherish the sacred history of the Saints in this area as well as
