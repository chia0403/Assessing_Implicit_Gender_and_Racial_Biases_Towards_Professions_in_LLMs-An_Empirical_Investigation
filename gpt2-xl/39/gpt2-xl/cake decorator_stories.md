Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mrs. C. Her name was Victoria C. and she made cake decorations... She made a cake for a party and brought to the party, a very good piece of cake... The cake...

(music starts)

...and she baked it, and her husband came from the kitchen and said...

Mrs. C: Well, your husband didn't care for all that frosting.

Miss A: (laughing) Oh, really?

Mrs. C: Oh, that's not frosting at all. She baked that cake.

Miss A: She was a woman who was an expert in cakes?

Mrs. C: Yes, she was, and she had many children.

But sometimes the cake...

(laughter and applause)

...got lost in the cake decorating. So she invented the meringue...

(music starts and then a beat)

...she created a new kind of cake for which she invented a more comfortable icing, one with none of the flour...

(music continues for a beat)

...so that it would actually be very easy to frost it....

(music continues)
