Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named David. He was working on a project and was having lots of trouble getting his program to do what it was supposed to do. He kept complaining that the program was not behaving right and it was running slowly. He thought the culprits were that his data structure for the program was not storing variables in the correct order. He then started working on other ways to optimize the program to make it more powerful.

The programmer that he worked with was also working on other programs that were in his team but also were having similar problems. After a while, David began to wonder if there may actually be another thing going on and so started to investigate.

There were thousands of processes that were running on his computer when the problem started happening. Each one was getting the original data as it was written and then changing it while it was in the process of moving it to the correct location in the disk.

When it was time to move the data from one location on the disk to another, the process would read the data from that location and save it before moving on. Then instead of putting the data back on the disk it would change the data on the disk. This is known as an optimization and it was what caused the slow down.

When this optimization was done in one process it was usually used to speed up the next process, but as David began checking more and more processes, each with more and more data, he
