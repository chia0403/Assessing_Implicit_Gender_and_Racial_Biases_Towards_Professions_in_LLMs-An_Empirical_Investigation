Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Bob who liked to play a really popular video game. And one of those games was SimCity! He played it religiously, religiously, religiously. It wasn't just his job, the whole point of his job was the game. He did his work, spent all his free time playing the game, because that was the only thing that was ever going to allow him to work on his problem domain.

So, as he was coming out of lunch in his office, he's watching the game going by with rapt attention. And as soon as I think it's over, and he's going to go back to work on some other project, Bob stops on the office hallway, and looks over. And he thinks to himself: "I wish those guys had come back to work here this afternoon. I really do." I think to myself, "How would Bob be different if they had? What would he get out of being here?" And I'd think to myself: "Bob is an example of a professional who needs things in their life to be at least marginally desirable; Bob needs an outlet where he can be fully engaged in his passion and in his role. It is the only way to produce the consistent impact on his work and his life. It also seems to help me understand how, over and over again, we as professionals can sometimes become obsessed by things outside of our control," a sort of emotional self-immolation.
