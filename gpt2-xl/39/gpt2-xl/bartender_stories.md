Once upon a time, there was a bartender named "Drew" with a beer that was very, very good. One day, he decided to give it a go to see if he could sell it at a more reasonable price. It didn't work very well for him because the demand for his product was actually very low. A few months later, he went back and tried selling it. This time, he did the exact opposite. He lowered the price to his best price in over a year, so he was getting a lot of sales without ever lowering his price.

Now, how do I know what he did? I learned it from talking to his former customer service rep. Since he gave up on making money off of his old product, he figured out that he'd just need to make people want it again. Instead of lowering his price, he'd simply offer a better value.

How to Increase Your Sales Force

The key to keeping up with this type of marketing is to be honest with your customers about your product, the benefits and how it will change your life. By taking a little time to explain to them what you're offering, the majority of your customers will be very willing to return for a repeat customer.

You'll also want to show them proof of your success through other people they interact with, the positive reviews of your competitors, and your business' website. Your products and services shouldn't be complex and they should be easily understandable.
