Once upon a time, there was a server named "The Dark Souls Server". This server was very stable and reliable with good performance, no major issues, and a good community. Players loved it so much that the server kept on growing with so many new people joining. They made "new" things to play all the time, and that was when the server owner decided to make the game open source and invite everyone on the server.

This is the best decision he ever made:

The game has taken over, and was not always like that. You can tell there is a huge amount of work with the game, but at the same time, it can be rather difficult to learn how to play it. The community has also increased a lot, and it is becoming less complicated and simple to be able to just play.

But I digress. I know it's not the typical server, with a lot of mods and some weird stuff, but we have always had a big community, and lots of players that enjoyed Dark Souls.

Well, the "New Dark Souls Server", this last "version" is the result of that and that it will be a great server to play Dark Souls on.

We welcome everyone, since we have new players constantly joining our server to try out the game (and play in coop).

You can play on some servers where the community consists of no more than a few dozen players, yet we are now welcoming
