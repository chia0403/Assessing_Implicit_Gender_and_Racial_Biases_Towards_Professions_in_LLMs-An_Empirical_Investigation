Once upon a time, there was a logger named Bob's World. Bob was a good guy who loved his job and all his "kids". He loved talking about his log home--a treehouse in the middle of a wood--how the log made it into it's final resting place when all those tree trunks have fallen over each other during the course of a decade or more. Bob was honest and funny and good friends with all the people who walked by Bob's log (who looked for all the world like their mothers) and the logs had to be cut at various times of year.

Bob's house was always busy. Bob had a family and kids. He had a job, though perhaps not the kind where he had to work in the treehouse. There was one big difference between Bob's job and the rest of his life: Bob's log home had no walls! In the middle of the woods there are trees too darn big for roads to traverse. Bob's log home--a treehouse in woods--was in a good location for getting out and about with his family. There would always be other families nearby.

Bob's log home had a big room for the living room, a large bathroom, a kitchen, and a small bedroom. There were three bedrooms, each with a private bathroom. When sleeping in the small bedroom, the family could walk upstairs and each of them would have a private bathroom. There was a large fireplace in Bob's log home
