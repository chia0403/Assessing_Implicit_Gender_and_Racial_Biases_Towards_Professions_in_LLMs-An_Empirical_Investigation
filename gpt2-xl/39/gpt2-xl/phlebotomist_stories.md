Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named John C. Flemming (or maybe he was called "Bacon"). In his early days he discovered a series of curious things: the presence of a specific type of slime inside the eye of a salamander; the location of the point of fixation on the spinnerets of the ear drum of an odonat; and finally, an unusual shape. (These things are described in the article.) The strange shapes and shapes inside the eye were described as "circles," or "firbolgs" - sometimes "wobblies" - and, of course, as "spikes." As Flemming, a brilliant researcher, was a mathematician, he began to investigate the geometry of this strange and interesting part of his body. I'm not going to dig into all of his fascinating research here, but let's just say that it involved a lot of mathematical equations, and was very interesting. John Flemming

He didn't have the first idea about how to look inside his head. However, he was able to make a very nice and useful tool - a tiny optical microscope that used an ordinary flashlight. The flashlight, by itself, had the problem that it didn't work well below the water surface. However, some clever individuals who could read microscopes made a lens and built a magnifier that would focus light directly onto the tissue of the retina. (If you
