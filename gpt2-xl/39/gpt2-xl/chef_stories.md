Once upon a time, there was a chef named Mike. A couple of times a week, Chef Mike would come to my place, and I would do the dishes. It got to the point where the customer service would be so bad, I was ashamed to be a customer, and the chefs were jealous we were the ones cooking food.

But one day, our chef brought us a tray of steak frites. Mike wasn't satisfied, and offered us a free meal. We said, "no!" When Mike saw we were still standing, he asked if we would take him for free, so my best friend and I went.

After a couple of burgers and fries, Mike was still not satisfied, and asked for one last thing. My friend and I told him we'd pay for the food, and the next thing we knew, I went outside with him to give him our money.

When we told him what they charged, my friend and I realized he had just thrown away $300. I just had three bites of the fries and they still weren't done hot. We could hear the food rustling in the oven, and just when our order was about to be delivered, another chef entered.

The chef said, "hey, guys, we really appreciate your support at our last stop over here, we just could not serve you because we didn't have time before we close." A customer had left us a $300 bill.
