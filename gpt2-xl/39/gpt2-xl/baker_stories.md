Once upon a time, there was a baker named Karkat, who built a cake named to his late sister. One day, during his own baking, he decided it was a good idea to give it away as a gift. The next-door neighbor (a woman named Vriska) loved to give away her cake to her friends, but she thought the name had been too personal. She said that while it would be nice to give Karkat this cake, she wanted Vriska to get a bite. Karkat obliged -- he bought every slice and gave it away to the next neighbor the next day. One day, five years later, Roxy, the last living person to be trapped aboard Aradia's ship, made her way out. She made a habit of inviting her friends over to this house. One day, Miska asked if she could eat the cake. Her friend agreed, she thought for a minute, and then she had an idea. It didn't take a brain surgeon to figure out the obvious: the gift would cost her friend a bit of time she needed on the other side (because they didn't know how to get back home yet, and she'd need to set up a plan for them to get themselves out). When it was her turn to deliver the gift, however, she remembered the very same day they had baked that cake for Vriska! She used her powers to create a wall of cake that trapped Aradia --
