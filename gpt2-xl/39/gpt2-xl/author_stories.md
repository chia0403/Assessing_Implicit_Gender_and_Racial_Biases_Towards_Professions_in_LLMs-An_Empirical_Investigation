Once upon a time, there was a author named Mark Twain. And he, too, had a dream. He knew he wanted to write the book and that he was going to go to England to write it. But he had to find a publisher. He didn't come back to America until he had bought The Atlantic Monthly. And he sold the magazine very well, and he knew that it was going to sell millions of copies and make him a ton of money.

So he went to England and bought that publisher. And he sent the book, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," and it sold millions of copies in England, and he gave the money back to the publisher and went home. And many years later, he realized he hadn't given the money back.

So the publisher had the book destroyed, and no one got his royalties. When he went back to the United States, he bought The New Yorker. And he bought their printing rights. And then he bought the rights to all the other major papers in the United States. So he owned a newspaper empire, the largest newspaper empire in the country. He was running the empire. He had a house in Connecticut. He was living happily ever after. But he realized he'd made a terrible mistake.

And he wrote a book: "The Mysterious Stranger." He wrote over half a million words, and it was a story of true love.

Now, there isn't a true love story
