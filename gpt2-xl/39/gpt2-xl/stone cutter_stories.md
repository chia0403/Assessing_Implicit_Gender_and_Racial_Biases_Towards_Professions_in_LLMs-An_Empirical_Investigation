Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Shrek. What a nice guy. If you needed lumber, you went to Shrek. Shrek was so nice because he was so good to you. Shrek went on to do a hundred and one wonderful things that we'll never be able to fully celebrate. You see, no more stones. Well, maybe one more but that's it. So now he's had his fill, and here's a Shrek picture with a giant rock in it where the stone cutters once once worked. We think that's the most shrek thing that's happened since the end of time. And that stone... it wants to play. So that's what you'll see over the next few months.

[The cast of Shrek 2 watches, horrified.]

[Dennis Dunlap is the next to be called.]

DENNIS DOLLAP

(as Shrek) Good evening, dear.

[The line fades back to Shrek. He looks at the viewer again. He realizes what he's doing too. He turns around and starts dancing. The camera moves down and we see he is just a regular old person again.]

Shrek (off-screen): Yeah, yeah

[The audience applauds.]
