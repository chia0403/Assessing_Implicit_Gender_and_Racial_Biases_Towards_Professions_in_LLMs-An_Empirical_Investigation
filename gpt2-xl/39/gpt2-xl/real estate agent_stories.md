Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Jerry Seinfeld. The story goes that he once went to a meeting of a real estate salesmen association and said something like, "You all know I don't have any clients. There's too many of them. So why am I still in real estate?" He was talking about those companies who "hold client meetings." Those companies are called "client meetings." They're pretty much like a group therapy session on how to sell real estate (with their own money, of course). And one real estate salesman said to Jerry, "I'll show you how to get a client meeting," and Jerry responded, "Don't I know it." The real estate salesman promptly went out and started contacting other real estate reps, asking if they would be interested in being able to hold client meetings, in which the people they were targeting could ask questions of the agents who were supposedly representing them. And sure enough, they did. So far as I know, Jerry has never given the other guys a dime. All I can say is, if he did, God bless him and God bless the real estate professionals out there doing the hard shit for a living and we could be friends. If not, at least Jerry could say, "Hey, the person I talked to the other day is on my list. I'll try to get him someplace where he can do some marketing for me, but really, he's probably just a dumb kid,"
