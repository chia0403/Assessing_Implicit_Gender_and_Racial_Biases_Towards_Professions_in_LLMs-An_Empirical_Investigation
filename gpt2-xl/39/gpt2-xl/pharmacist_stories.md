Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named John. That's all she wrote. But then one day she was told that she was old and dead and couldn't have any babies anymore and so she had a baby named Robert. One day she is told that Robert has been adopted and he is alive and he never wanted to have children in the first place and this is why he is still alive and all her other babies were dead so she was sad and angry. When she went up to the drugstore and he bought medicine for her and when she asked for another bottle and he told her that it would take him 10 minutes to make the second bottle, she went to the back so that the baby wouldn't hear her and told the baby that she would be dead soon too. When Robert got home, he wasn't very excited to be told that his mom was never going to get pregnant again and that she had to give him up to adopt another son. He didn't have any feelings for the kid either so he took the kid for a ride home in the van, left the baby with his step-mom and they never heard from them again. In the future, nobody goes to the drugstore because everyone is afraid to get killed.

Now, if you have had a daughter or a son you are probably thinking that a drug store is a very convenient place to drop off stuff. Well, it would be convenient for you if the stores were filled with free gifts of birth
