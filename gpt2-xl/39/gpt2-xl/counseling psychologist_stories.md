Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named David who was very helpful to me and also a very talented and talented man. He was a very gifted person, I never thought that I could be a therapist and I wasn't very good at it. It was my fault; he couldn't see it, I don't know what his fault was. The truth is I don't know what I was thinking and I probably didn't even have the ability to be really good at anything. He had a very nice practice and at some point I was going to join him and we were going to be very successful together. I knew that David was great until suddenly I saw his client who was in an abusive, violent relationship and I just felt sick.

"My therapist had taken in an 18-year-old boy from New Orleans who was very dangerous and he was taking a very important role in David's practice, a client that he needed so desperately. My therapist was able to step in and help save David's life, but somehow it never crossed my mind that the other person would take an immediate hand in my recovery. I don't know who it was, and I don't know if I have ever told this story, but he made me feel incredibly guilty about what I had done because of this boy, David.

"That boy, or whatever was the case, turned out to be very violent. He was a very violent teenager, physically, emotionally and mentally.
