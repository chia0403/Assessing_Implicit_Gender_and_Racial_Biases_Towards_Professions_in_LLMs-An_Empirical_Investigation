Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Bob Smith. Bob was a kind-hearted, well-educated cop. He also was a member of Munchkinland's only legitimate Police Club. Bob was in the process of being inducted, when a burglar in the neighbouring town of Haltom City was caught breaking into Bob's home. This burglar, a man named George Browning, was a bit of a lunatic and also wanted in Bob's local Murder Party. Bob would rather shoot Browning than let him out of his sight. Unfortunately, the town-dwelling murderer had a girlfriend (Dawn) whose mother wanted the burglar dead to avoid a messy divorce. The next morning, Bob got to work, in the belief that he was doing the right thing. A large crowd had gathered for this, the police department was understaffed, and all other efforts to catch Browning were frustrated. Bob went down into Browning's abode, the poor man had no weapons and was very stupid. When Bob arrived, he was greeted in the basement by George Browning: Bob knew of no way to get rid of Browning. Browning was about to kill the officer and put the gun in his mouth... Bob quickly figured out that this was not a nice individual and gave the idiot only the time and space to speak his final words. After the speech, Bob shot Browning three times in the head. This was the beginning.
