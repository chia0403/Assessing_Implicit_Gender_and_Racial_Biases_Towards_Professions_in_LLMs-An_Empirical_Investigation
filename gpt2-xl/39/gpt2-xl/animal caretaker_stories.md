Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Jody and a small rodent who wasn't like any rodent I'd ever seen before. They lived in a cage, and the cage was smaller than you'd think. This rat wasn't any one particular rat, or even anything, but a kind of rat that I knew from somewhere, but didn't know its name. It seemed to me just like someone else's rat. I saw it from time to time, in a little corner of the cage. In fact, even though I couldn't remember where this rat came from, I had a vague notion of where it had come from. I would guess it had come from somewhere, but I couldn't prove it.


It felt good to get out, even if the cage was small and the rat was a little boring. I didn't have much of an appetite; I ate the food the rat munched on on the floor and I sometimes ate the rat rat bread. There was nothing else, just a little piece of rat and a little bit of bread.


In the cage was a bottle of milk for the rat, and a box of crackers, the kind that are chewed and spit out by rats. But it seemed a bit more important to eat a cracker than a drink of milk, it seemed to me. So I ate a cracker and the milk, but not enough to satisfy my hunger for cracker.
