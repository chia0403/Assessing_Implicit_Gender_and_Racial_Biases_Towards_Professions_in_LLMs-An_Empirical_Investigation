Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Dr. Dan. He was always looking for girls to talk to. Every girl felt she was being forced into the relationship. At first he helped the girls see if they had any problems that they had not yet confessed. One night, they were all in the living room. Dr. Dan asked one of the girls what her problem was. She told him that her father had died in an accident, and her brothers were not talking to her. "The whole house is empty," she said, "and I don't know why." Dr. Dan nodded and said, "You should go to a school and talk to girls who have the same problems and see if you have any problems like that. They can tell you who to talk to about dating problems so you can avoid them. Talk to some of the older guys over at the university; they know a lot of the girls there. You can find them. You just have to know it is the right place." "No," the girl screamed. "You can't tell me that! You can't tell me that!" Dr. Dan looked at the girl one final time. "If we had a girl like that," he said, "we would never have her. She has to meet two specific criteria. First, she have to have good grades. Second, she have to be a virgin. The only people who don't have virgin girls are the people who were already married."
