Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Kappel. He was a farmer in South Korea. He moved to America and worked in the field for a short time. He left that life behind when he became a Bellhop and began teaching Bellhops. When the Bellhops reached his age, they made him the bell guy.

He was quite the popular bellhop. You can't tell from his name, and yet here he is â€” a little bellhop. He's here to teach us some tricks and tips on how to hold a bell and be able to move it.

Q: Do I have to bring my own bell to class?

A: You are welcome to use any bell available on the Bellhops of the World site.

Q: Do you ever give feedback on how we are holding the bell?

A: Please always speak with at least two bellhops at the event before making any changes. We will be honest about what we see and hear on the day. No one wants to hear their bell hopping make the mistake of being too high with the bell. Some bells are a bit lighter than others, and some bellhops prefer a different bell style. Always give us your feedback.

Q: When do we show up at Bellhops for a Bellhop session?

A: We usually begin with a bell hop session at 6:00, weather permitting.
