Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Jimmy who taught me a thing or two. It was a lot of fun and a lot of learning at the same time. Since that time I've had the chance to work as a mechanic for myself or with car clubs, as the new instructor in my shop, and, of course, I was the first to teach my students to work in our new shop. I've always loved cars, especially on the road. Now, I love to be out on the road with new people and I look forward to it every day.

I've always enjoyed the challenges of teaching, having to find ways to improve my own teaching techniques while also making sure I have enough time to spend with my family. This is particularly true when I teach classes I don't have the luxury of being at home with or around. I think that being outdoors while still being in the classroom has done much to help me become a good teacher, having to spend time in the classroom but also taking that time outdoors will definitely help anyone learn.

What's your ultimate aim?

"To be able to sit in my car, put on tunes and play to music that I love." - Jimmy V., owner of Jimmy Auto Mechanics


For me the ultimate aim is to be able to sit in my car, put on tunes and play to music that I love. My life's work is about inspiring others to enjoy the great outdoors with those they care
