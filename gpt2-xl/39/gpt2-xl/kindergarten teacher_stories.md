Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Miss D., who, while on the board of the local university, was asked by a student whether the Jews were responsible for the Nazi Holocaust. Her answer: "Not even a little."

In the 1970s, a group of students approached the school to apply for permission to form their own pro-Israel student group; at the same time, Miss D, who was already on the board of the university, wrote to her old student the following, to which Miss R responded: "I can't give you permissionâ€¦ but I can try to help." Miss D went on to become president of the Hillel student association, and the following year the Hillel group was founded by the two students.

Miss D's story is one of the more fascinating examples and has led to further research by Jewish groups at the university, where it found "support from several members of the university's faculty and staff, along with students."

There is certainly no shortage of cases of Jewish support for Israel. Jewish professors, for instance, routinely lecture to and study with their secular, not-so conservative Christian colleagues; and Jewish students can sometimes be found teaching at the same institutions that they also attend Hebrew school at. Just this week, a Jewish student at Georgetown University spoke out in support of the BDS campaign, and Jewish students are also involved in the United Daughters of the Bible, who also support Israel.
