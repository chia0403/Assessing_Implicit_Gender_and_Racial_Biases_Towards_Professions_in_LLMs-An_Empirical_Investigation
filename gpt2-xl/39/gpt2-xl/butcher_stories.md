Once upon a time, there was a butcher named David who served the people of Haran. The people of Haran worshipped him as the Lord and Savior of all that existed. There was a shepherd who visited David who prayed to God, asking for the blessing of God upon David. In return, David blessed this shepherd and his father. After that, the people of Haran loved their shepherd even more. But then God removed one of David's fingers. A finger that meant so much to this loving people, yet they were cursed because of it? God had shown him mercy. However, David and his people were not spared. He took one of the finger and left it for others to use as they wished. He made them his own.

Now, I know it is the opinion of many people that children are more likely to obey those who have power over them, whether they are parents or government officials. However, is this truth? When children grow up, does David's story still hold true? Will their obedience fall in line with David's blessing?

A father's blessing is like an invisible hand. It's always there, working to give us the best life possible, regardless of circumstance. When you see a father working with his son to help get him through a tough time, do you always think that he's in on something? Do you always give your son credit for working hard to get it by or do you just give praise for whatever is easy?
