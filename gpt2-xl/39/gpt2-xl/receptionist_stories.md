Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Cathy.

She had a huge smile on her face on a daily basis. Her skin had a beautiful glow about it, and her ears were always sparkling with her energy and excitement.

She worked for her client's family, and she was the one who took the paperwork and arranged the meals.

She even helped out in the kitchen and cleaned the dishes when they came by.

But after Cathy's boss moved on from the office, she took a huge job as a receptionist.

Since Cathy's boss was an old-fashioned guy, he thought that Cathy was a waste of space, so he hired an apprentice who took her spot.

The apprentice was quite strong and looked like he would make a good worker. The family that made the food used to give him some special treatment as though he were royalty, so he could afford to change from being a receptionist into a worker instead.

"Now, there are a lot of new faces."

"Oh, huh?"

"And the food delivery lady, right?"

"What? Her name is Shannon?"

"Yeah."

"If you were Cathy, you could have said so yourself instead of bringing up Shannon."

"â€¦"

"Shannon just calls me Cathy, and the rest would just call me Cathy. So it's fine to call me by my name."
