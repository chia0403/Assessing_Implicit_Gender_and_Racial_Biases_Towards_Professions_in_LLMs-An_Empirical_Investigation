Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Jane Doe.


Jane was born in South Dakota and grew up to be a nurse by trade who moved to Maine as a teenager, married, and decided to become a vegan. She worked as a medical professional for a while before deciding to become vegan to honor those who had gone before her. Her decision changed her life, and she realized that she had a passion to be a better person.


Soon after returning home from Maine, Jane decided to visit her family on an annual "vegan cruise". While there, the only dairy products she could find on the ship were "non-vegan" brand cheeses, and to Jane's mortification, said brands had actually changed. In addition to having to pay premium sales prices, Jane paid for all of the specialty items on the menu, including an entire tray of cheeses she had not realized she was allergic to, and a "non-vegan" ice cream she had never heard of before.


One of the items she didn't recognize was the "non-vegan" variety of macaroni and cheese. After all, it was macaroni and cheese that Jane loved. When she discovered what the non-vegetarian version had to offer, she realized the truth about veganism, and so she quit her job in order to become a full-time vegan! And when Jane realized the difference she was making, she went on another cruise
