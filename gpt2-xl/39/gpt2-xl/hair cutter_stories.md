Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Max, a girl who, after falling into bankruptcy and losing her hair, decided not to shave for a year to see how much they would shave off. The result was that she lost her hair, but gained 15 inches, so there's that, and Max never met a haircut she didn't like. But, that's the thing about Max: She was really into her clothes, as you can see in the photo above. I love a girl with an enormous ego, and, for that matter, a huge sense of humor, too.
