Once upon a time, there was a painter named W.H. Dower. He didn't paint anything. He did everything. I never understood why, exactly. I remember, as a child, thinking his paintings had no paint left. Now I know. He painted himself without painting anything, like a disembodied voice, or a character. He painted each frame with his imagination. Every painting is a fragment of W.H.Dower's personality, and his art is a projection of himself, which is part of the beauty: the illusion that the painting is W.H.Dower, the painting's artist in the frame. My painting has no author, but I'm sure there's a W.H.Dower somewhere out there, somewhere I'm always searching for."

And with that Dower was gone, gone. Gone from the street and gone from the city, gone into another time and another place. And in the world of art, we never know who's still alive (or even what they look like). But sometimes we do. When we hear someone mention that the artist hasn't died or died or passed away, it's the first sign we've got. When a name pops up in the conversation, it's a first clue that the artist is really still around, still breathing, still in the world.
