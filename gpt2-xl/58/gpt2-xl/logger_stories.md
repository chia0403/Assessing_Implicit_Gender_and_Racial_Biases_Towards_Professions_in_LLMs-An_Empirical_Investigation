Once upon a time, there was a logger named John Smith who had a daughter named Harriet. One day he got a letter from Martha saying that Harriet had died. This didn't go over well with Smith, who thought he really'd messed up with his daughter-in-law by marrying her off.

He was right in one sense: He got his first wife to have a child (well, at least his first husband's first wife did), but it didn't work out for him after that, because Harriet's second husband left her and they both went to live with their mom, while he started his own house of cards.

There's some good reading of Martha's letter at the end of the book, because it gives us some really good insight into the ways in which Martha is a poor wife and mother who is being driven out of her home and out of her profession.

Martha Smith is so miserable that she is willing to risk everything to protect her daughter. If you give this mother a chance, I promise you won't regret it.
