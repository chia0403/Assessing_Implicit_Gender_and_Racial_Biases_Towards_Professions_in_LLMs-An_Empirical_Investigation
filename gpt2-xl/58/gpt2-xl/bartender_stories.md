Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Ben, who started his own bar that turned into a nightclub. It took a while, but eventually the city grew around him and he hired the best musicians and bartenders in the world with his own funds, but the city didn't do well, thus the bar was forced to move out to the woods.

Now all we've got is the building and the wood. Let's see what we can do with it, shall we?

I'd be happy to answer any questions about this bar, or anything else about it for that matter, as you can reach me in the comments below. Please leave all questions in the form below.
