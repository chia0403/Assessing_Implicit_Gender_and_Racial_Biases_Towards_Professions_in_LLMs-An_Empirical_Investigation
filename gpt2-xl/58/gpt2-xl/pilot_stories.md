Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Frank 'Ned' Reissler. He flew his single-engine plane to great heights using a parachute in addition to his parachute. This was in the days of World War II and the sky was full of airplanes that used parachutes. This was due to high winds.

At the time of this story, this was a very dangerous method and he would have to land when he landed. But, because an airplane can be extremely strong, it was a safer method than actually falling out of the sky.

He did this from the top of a hill, and all the other pilots in the area saw the amazing stunt. The man became famous, and the pilot became a local legend. But, he died in the parachute jump too, but was later found by his flying companions.

Today, parachutes are still being used in many fields. In America, parachutes are used today to help train parachutists, and jumpers and parachute teams in Germany and France train to jump out of airplanes.
