Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Jack. I loved my grandfather very much, but I didn't love him like he loved me. I had to learn that, in fact, he hated my mother like a rabid dog.

He never gave her permission to go out at night, never let her leave the house alone, refused to spend the night with her, never cuddled or kissed her, and he could never understand why she so strongly wanted to be with me. This was the kind of person he was.

He was a strict disciplinarian and he believed that there was no room for compassion in his home. There is, as a matter of fact, a long-standing tradition in our family, inherited from my grandmother, of not using any kind of affection to make another human being feel better â€“ the kind of affection that's used so often in the movies and TV shows of our childhood. Our grandparents never taught me this tradition. And they did teach me how to look at my mother with suspicion, because they couldn't figure my mother out.

All my grandparents had was hate and bitterness, and I've never once understood why they hated my mother so hard. Was it her looks, her eyes, her hair?

The truth was that they hated her because she was too different, too vulnerable. They couldn't understand the way she'd lived and thrived since we were kids. They could only hear about it from others,
