One day he had an inspiration and penned a pamphlet entitled "Why the British Have a Navy" which can be found in an excellent collection of B.R. material entitled The B.R.A.S.E. Collection. You should read it. Bentley had a big imagination and he was always looking for ways to explain things in a way which didn't sound absurd. He said that he would always invent a situation to make his point, and people didn't like his points. So he came up with their solution, and for the next 250 years they claimed that when Britain has a navy, it's an advantage, they say, because in a war with another nation Britain will hold the upper hand, and that when they have a navy they are able to get what they want. They claim that it is because they can use them defensively and offensively against any enemy. It worked in their favor for centuries because they won and they dominated the world in the two world wars. Now, of course, since the Cold War began, that position has been eroded.
