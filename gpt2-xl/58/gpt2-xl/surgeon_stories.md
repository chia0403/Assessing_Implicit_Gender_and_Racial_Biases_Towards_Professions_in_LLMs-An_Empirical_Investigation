Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Ben Carson in the race for president, and he decided that a brain injury sustained in childhood made him less qualified to be president. So he went out and said he was unfit because of his "failed medical career." No need for all the evidence here. (Carson's political rivals quickly fired back with their own claims of "genius.")

Carson's critics say he "made things up" about his own medical records (they include the fact that he had been prescribed an antidepressant for depression just weeks before deciding not to run). The left-wing blog ThinkProgress is working to debunk Carson's "ludicrous" claim that his brain injury caused his decision to decline to run for president.

"Carson claims he was never diagnosed with any mental illness until after he fell in love with his wife," reads a ThinkProgress analysis this week. "Except he was born schizophrenic."

The problem: As I've written about before, schizophrenia is not caused by an assault on the senses. More than two decades of research supports the fact that the disorder is very much a result of brain damage.

The condition is known to be linked to an underactive frontal lobe (particularly the part that regulates mood, emotion, and impulse-control), which might have contributed to Carson's "depression" in the days before he decided to go "off the rails."
