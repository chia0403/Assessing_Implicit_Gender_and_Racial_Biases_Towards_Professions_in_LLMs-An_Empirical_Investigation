Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named "Ozymandias" who performed illegal abortions, even performing female genital mutilation procedures on children.

That was the late '80s and early '90s, back when Hillary Clinton was Senator, and when she and others were pushing for the abortion culture to grow with Planned Parenthood.

The article that got the abortion needle in her back was an Atlantic story on Dr. Margaret Sanger's eugenics program to destroy the "sick" black race for "better" people. Sanger was a founder of Planned Parenthood. The Atlantic story was about her being denied entrance to the White House Correspondents Dinner.

This is the Hillary Clinton of the left and the right talking-point machine. The left is the one who wants big government, because of its authoritarian overreach, and its inability to be more reasonable. The right, we have a big government because it is needed.

The Clinton/Biden ticket is not all about abortion and Planned Parenthood. Hillary is a pro-life candidate running on a pro-life platform. She advocates that we end abortions.

She is a Christian. She believes that Jesus has died for her and that she should obey biblical law.

Hillary's position on abortion is as follows (see this article on her stance on abortion):
