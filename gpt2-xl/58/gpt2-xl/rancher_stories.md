Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Johnny, born and raised in the woods of California.

Johnny came from a nomadic, nomadic, nomadic life. His way of life involved roaming the desert, hunting exotic creatures, and drinking beer in the desert sun. His life, like that of many poor, uneducated white men, included a lot of booze and rough living. To make an income, Johnny built a shack and lived off the land, often eating only the leftovers of other ranchers he'd killed. In his early day as a lone wolf, Johnny was known to hunt a local elk, and steal the meat; Johnny also killed deer, a couple of buffalo, and a cow or two. As a young cow-killer he took a name, as he was often hunted by neighboring ranchers and farmers.

In his early days, Johnny earned more than enough to support his life. One day the old man from his past decided to come back to visit Johnny and tell him a scary story about his childhood. The story is told as the boy Johnny was walking down the road one day. The old man is heard telling the story to a local sheriff, as he makes his way through the plains of Arizona one late summer, and the story was that his father was a man who drank himself to death after a violent incident in the farmhouse. When in doubt about a story, Johnny trusted his gut feeling more than his gut.
