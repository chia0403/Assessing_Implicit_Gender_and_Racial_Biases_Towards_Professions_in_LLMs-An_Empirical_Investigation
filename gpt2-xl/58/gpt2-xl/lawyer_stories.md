Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Tom Crouch. The Crouch Law Firm was well known for its ability to represent clients in complicated, convoluted matters. But Tom had one big thing which really set him apart as a lawyer: he was the best of the best, period. And he did not do this aloneâ€”he had a small army of associates, attorneys, and other support staff. Tom never failed to make time for important clients, which was why he was regarded as one of the top criminal defense attorneys in California and also as the most sought after family law attorney in the state.

But a few years into his career, his life changed forever when he received a surprise phone call. A friend was trying to offer Tom a job in an effort to boost his image in the legal community. Just what will become of Tom now?

This book follows Tom's personal journey as he deals with all kinds of seemingly impossible questions. Is it possible to trust a lawyer? If there is no crime, what happens to the lawyer? Can a lawyer kill a client? How do we prove the innocence of a criminal?

Tom's clients have ranged from violent sociopaths to murderers to sexual deviants. After facing challenges, they have returned to their lives with a purpose and confidence they never enjoyed before. Tom has never failed a single client. At some point, he has earned the right to call himself, "America's Greatest Lawyer."
