Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Paul. In addition to living in South Central LA where he loved to fly model airplanes and play a round of golf at night (the best kind of round), he also loved to play poker with his friends. He'd play every chance he could, and sometimes even on Tuesdays.

One day Paul got into a dispute with a rival agency. The client didn't like the business model Paul used so he did what any good agent would do. He went to his friends and put his foot in his mouth.

"I have a problem, Paul. I have a problem." "What problem?"

"It's not that I don't like your business model."

"I know, I knowâ€¦But if you don't want to work with us, just say so." "I'm not going to work with you, Paul. I hate you." Then he stormed out of the agency's building in tears. "What the fuck? What happened to the guy from the agency?"

Of course, that guy from the agency was Paul. He hated Paul's guts, but somehow, he was able to keep his feelings concealed. Not too terribly long after that Paul was asked to play in an event at a casino in Las Vegas. His team won the tournament and the agency was invited to hang out with the winners, a trip that cost them more than $50,000.
