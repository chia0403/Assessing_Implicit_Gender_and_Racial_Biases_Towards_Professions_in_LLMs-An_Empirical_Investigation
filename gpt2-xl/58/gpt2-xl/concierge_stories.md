Once upon a time, there was a concierge named John Farr, who lived in the heart of the city, just around the corner from the city's central railway station. John was a man with a big heart.

His big heart turned one day when he heard of a man who was stranded after his train was taken off the tracks. He went to see what had happened and got to work making sure the man got his train home safely. He even came up with a plan to get the man some more breakfast so he'd feel better in the morning.

On his way home, John stopped at the train depot and found no one knew where it was. After walking aimlessly for hours with his train boxed in, he decided he needed to get inside. With the city gates locked and his heart in his throat, he took the metro and eventually arrived at the man's hotel room.

On the way, he was confronted by a man who asked him where the train was. The concierge explained to the man the situation, while John went into some detail about what he did for the man and why he made the unusual choice to come along with him.

The man accepted the concierge's apology and thanked him for his help. John also gave the man a book of the city's top 10 best restaurants, which he kept with him all day, thanking him for it at the end of the day.
