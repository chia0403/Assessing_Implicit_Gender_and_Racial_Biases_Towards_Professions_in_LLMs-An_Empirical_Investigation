Once upon a time, there was a coach named Chuck Noll. A native of Indiana, Chuck is widely considered the finest coach in the annals of the game. Noll is the man who, in a game between the University of Arkansas and Indiana, coached a legendary drive into Indiana territory before his team threw an interception in the final seconds of the game that changed the entire complexion of the rivalry forever. His accomplishments are quite extensive—although some of those accomplishments may have been overshadowed by the legend of the punt. Here's a look at the history of the Arkansas-Indiana rivalry.

BAD SMILE

The rivalry comes up each January, but what has been the first game between the two schools? Arkansas beat Indiana by 20 on Dec. 28, 1935—a 20-17 victory in Razorback Stadium. For more than a century, the teams met every year. The first meeting occurred at the end of the 1931 season and the games occurred every year except 1934. Indiana beat Arkansas twice then came in 1934 for a 31-21 win. They beat the Razorbacks, 19-14, in 1935. Since that first meeting, there have been three different winners.

FED UP

Razorback fans believe the games are based on a lot of personal grudges. Arkansas fans believe it was a battle of two big football schools. It was not, however. Although they're both big college football schools, Arkansas University has very few athletes.
