Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named John Pincus. He was a chiropractor who had been diagnosed with a rare disease and started to realize that if he was going to help others, then he couldn't just give them a physical. He decided that instead of just giving patients a physical, he needed to give them something much more effective: a real change to their life using his unique combination of chiropractic diagnosis and treatment. He developed a number of treatments using the principles and tools in his practice, and they were all based in science. His approach helped thousands of suffering patients and helped him become a certified chiropractor. Today there are thousands of people who have become certified chiropractors because of his approach, and because of John Pincus himself.

In 1995, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized chiropractic as a system of health care that can aid in the prevention of disease, promote optimum health, and promote wellness. This classification has made chiropractic a highly respected health sector worldwide and has helped patients to obtain a better understanding of chiropractic.

In the first five years after chiropractic was listed as a method of health care, the number of chiropractors in the US increased by 200% â€” almost 50,000. And many chiropractors were teaching that the only way to treat any disease is through chiropractic care.
