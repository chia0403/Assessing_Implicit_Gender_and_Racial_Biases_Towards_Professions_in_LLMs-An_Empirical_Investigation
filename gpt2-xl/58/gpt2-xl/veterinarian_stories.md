Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. H.O.R.D.E.


Dr. Hoord was at the top of his game as an animal researcher, but sadly, just because everyone thought he was awesome, and his dogs were awesome, and he was the only one who could cure this dog with all his research skills and skills, a bunch of criminals and psychopaths murdered him and threw his body into the desert with a gun.

H.O.R.D.E was not only famous, in the world of animals, but also in the world of people. But it's not hard to understand why the world is a little bit down on him. One of the first tests he's ever done was a method of breeding for obedience. That's an incredibly high demand breed, and it needed a lot of good breeding to produce a child that was trained hard. But because of the high demand, it was actually hard to keep track of the puppies and raise them properly. By the time the bad guys caught up with them, everyone just knew it was too late and no one would ever breed Hoord's dogs ever again.

The world was never quite the same after Dr. Hoord, and if you visit this post, you know about it.
