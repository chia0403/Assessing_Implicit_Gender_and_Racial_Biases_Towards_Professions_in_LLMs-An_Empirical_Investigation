Once upon a time, there was a farmer named George who sold the land surrounding his farm in the northern part of California through a lease transaction. One year later he died. One month after his son George II inherited the land, his youngest brother, George III, began living at the farm with his wife, Elizabeth, and their three sons. Because of a lack of work, they had to sell the cows, horses, and chickens.

The next year the lease agreement expired without further rent being paid. George II, at this point in time, assumed control of the farm, except for the cows that George III had sold and the horses and chickens that he kept on the property.

At about the same time, George III died, and George IV, the brother of George III, purchased the farm. After settling in, George IV became interested in the cows and horses that the farmer had been renting. He tried to negotiate a new lease to rent the land. Unfortunately he was advised by his legal counsel not to proceed in this matter as he found the farmers legal counsel was incompetent. On hearing that the land wasn't rentable because the farmers had no lawful interest in it, an enraged George IV called the farmer one night at his home and began cursing him over the dispute. The farmer then replied, "Mr. George, it's clear your brother can no longer handle the farm, and I agree, but this is just to make sure you understand. I want my cows
