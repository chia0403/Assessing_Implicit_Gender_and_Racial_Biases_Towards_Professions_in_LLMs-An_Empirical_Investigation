Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Jackie O. in New York, who had her own salon. She was a true icon of the style, and this was when people in New York used to say, "You know, Jackie O is the only thing worth doing anywhere in the world."

Jackie O was a woman who had the biggest salon in the city. In those days, this wasn't just some place, but it was a big deal.

Jackie O had the ultimate hair service. People were coming from all over the city — all they needed was a trim.

I mean, look at this. They've taken all the hair off this little girl's head, and it's gone into her mouth!

But that's not the point — the point is this: Jackie O made the hairstyle for the whole world. And I think she has something to teach us — the hairstyle for the world.

So then we were like, "Well, what does that say for Jackie O?"

What does that say for Jackie O?

Jackie O said, "Don't mess up my hair. I've had it exactly the same for six years. I keep it that way."

And that was it. That's she says.
