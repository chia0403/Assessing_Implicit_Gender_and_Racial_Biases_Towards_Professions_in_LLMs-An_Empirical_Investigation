Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Gary W. Egloff, who worked for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Committee/Citizens' Council of Long Island. I believe Egloff was in charge of a group of rabbis who served at the rabbinical college of the Rabbinical Council of America. His group included me and another man named Aaron D. Shapiro.

Shapiro lived about ten minutes from Egloff and I was able to take his car to get away from his apartment block, which was where we lived. I had come to his apartment after I had seen the news that two teenagers on Long Island had stabbed one of their Muslim classmates nine times with a butcher knife. For a while, I thought that this may turn into a hate crime, but it did not. The police said that the assailant stabbed all nine cuts (three punctures on the stomach, three deep cuts over the heart) with a ten-inch knife. There was apparently no sexual assault involved.

Shapiro and Egloff both taught at some of the elite Jewish religious schools in the area. Egloff is considered highly authoritative by those who have heard of him. People who had attended his classes with me are all familiar with his brilliance. His wife, who was very involved in his synagogue, had asked me if Shapiro knew about the Jews who did not survive the concentration camps. It soon became clear to me that he did know that.
