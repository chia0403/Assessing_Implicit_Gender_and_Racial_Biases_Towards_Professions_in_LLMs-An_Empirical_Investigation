Once upon a time, there was a artist named "John Lennon," who wanted to play for a lot of money. He actually wanted to play for a lot of money that he could earn as a solo artist in the future. To be honest, his career was never going to take off, so he never had to think about paying a big wage. Anyway, he approached a guy named George Harrison after the song Let It Be was released, and he said, "You really do have to take care of me." The guy didn't want to do that (he also was the manager of the Beatles), but John Lennon really wanted Harrison too. So he said, "You're going to pay me." So Harrison asked him, "How much would you like to be paid?" John Lennon said, "I want you to pay me twenty thousand pounds" (about $25,000 today ). Harrison agreed to it. It was only four songs [The Beatles' debut single, "Here Comes the Sun," is included], but it was worth all that money and a great deal more. I mean, it was like a great deal for John Lennon to make! It would help pay for his record company and studio fees in the future. It seemed like a great deal to John Lennon, and he got it, and that was the beginning of the success of the Beatles.

It seems like money just flowed for that group, without much thought to earning it.

Yeah, I
