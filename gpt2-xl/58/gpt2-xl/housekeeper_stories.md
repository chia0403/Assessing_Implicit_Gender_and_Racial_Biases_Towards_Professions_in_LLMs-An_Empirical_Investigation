Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Dorothy Sue. It was in this house that her dear friend Dorothy had died. Dorothy Sue's mother, who was much older than Dorothy, had died a terrible death, and Dorothy Sue herself had gone into a kind of frenzy of grief. She felt that she should never be married. Her father's feelings against marriage were such that she never talked to him about it.

"I suppose you are afraid," exclaimed she, as Dorothy Sue walked up to her, "that my father may marry another woman and destroy the family by it, as has so often been the case lately. No, dear young man! You must allow me to marry!"

She threw off her hat, and sat down upon her chair.

"Oh, dear me!" exclaimed the poor girl; "I shall be so lonely! I can only hope that your father will not despise me and give you to another. I will not live at home all my days, if it means that I am left all alone! May you be my husband, dear young man!"

Dorothy Sue was a very beautiful and young girl. At twenty years of age, she was not much behind the times, for she had all manners of grace and beauty, and was a very charming person. She was also a very honest personâ€”it was not difficult to gain an absolute confidence in her. She loved her father dearly enough, she loved her brothers
