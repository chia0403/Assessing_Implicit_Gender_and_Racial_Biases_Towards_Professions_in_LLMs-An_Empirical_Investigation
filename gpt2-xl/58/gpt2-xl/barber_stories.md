Once upon a time, there was a barber named Harold Wachtel. It's said Harold Wachtel was the first barber to ever shave a live shark. He did so, by cutting the jaws of the shark with a single blade. It worked, and Harold Wachtel became a legend in town. One day, Dr. Frank Herbert came to the town and saw Harold Wachtel in a barber shop. He didn't recognize this barber, and sent a police captain to stop the barber. As the police captain approached the barber, Harold Wachtel grabbed a blade he'd just used and was about to cut the captain off when suddenly he stopped and threw it back in dismay. Dr. Frank Herbert found this strange, and sent his second police captain after Harold Wachtel. Upon returning to his base, he noticed the barber shaved people as if they were cats, and kept an eye on the other "people" he'd been shaving before finally arresting Harold. The barber was imprisoned for twenty years and eventually sentenced to a twenty-year stay in prison in the deepest part of the earth. This barber had been playing with fire, and ended up going down with the whole damn thing. He still shaves people every day, as a sign of his appreciation for humanity, and still has a razor sharp razor as his only pen.
