Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Mina, who worked for the police in the city where my family lives, and I've had the privilege of meeting her twice, while sitting on the same couch in that home, for about an hour at a time.

Mina was a fascinating and empathetic woman. She's the only person ever on any of the news shows I saw mention that some of the "evidence" presented to the court was apparently not true -- they had a forensic analyst actually check that evidence, and they found it to be false.

The media, including Fox News in this country, has always tried to depict Mina and the investigation in a particularly negative light. She's one of the few people ever to have appeared as a celebrity on the nightly news, in all the major broadcasts. She told me that she always had the appearance that you should never cross her; everyone who was ever seen doing anything in public with her always knew what they were getting into.

Mina told me that all of the police officers who were in her office had a reputation to maintain to some degree or another; they had to stay on top of this, or they would have been taken off the investigative team. She said that in her opinion, everyone who knew her knew she was a woman of integrity, and was a very strong person who would not tolerate dishonesty from any source in any case.
