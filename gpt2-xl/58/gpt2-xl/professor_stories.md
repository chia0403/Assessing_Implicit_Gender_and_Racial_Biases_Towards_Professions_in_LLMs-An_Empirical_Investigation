Once upon a time, there was a professor named George R. Rada. He was the most beautiful man in the world and a brilliant writer with a talent for creating worlds outside his own. One day, while he was sitting around his desk getting angry at all the people who didn't believe that there was something beyond the human world that he and his students were studying, his phone rang. The phone on his desk was dead, of course, so George Rada picked up a phone that was on the wall and answered the phone.

He was told that he had a new assignment for him. He sat down at his desk and a thought flashed through his head. A man with blond hair and a goatee was sitting on the grass outside the building talking with a man with a goatee who looked like he used to be in a band called "The Killers." One day, George Rada decided to investigate the man in the goatee's suit and his story. He walked up to the blond man, took his goatee off, and noticed something that intrigued him: The people he was talking to did not seem to recognize him as a character named George Rada.
