Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Dave McSweeney in Atlanta who was the son of Jack McSweeney, who designed the city's first municipal building.

By the time Dave was in high school, there was a famous photographer of the city, John E. Mosher, who was famous for taking portraits from city rooftops.

When Dave started working at Getty Images, in 1981, he went to work as a trainee. It took two years — a lot longer than most photographers, it sounds like — but he was soon promoted to a post, and ended up as a senior photographer.

By 1984, Getty went public. It paid Dave $3,500 a year. That year, Getty had a revenue of $120 million. By 1995, it reported a revenue of $6 billion. "All this happened," says Mosher, "within less than 10 years of McSweeney leaving his father's building."

So it is with many companies that are on the rise. Their founders may have started small with just one photographer. A hundred years ago, that would have gotten you fired. But the world goes on. They go to other countries. They hire other photographers. Over the years, their growth is exponentially better, and it can happen the other way, too, so that now they have a whole new generation. In some of the big cities, even a couple of these photographers will make much more than McSweeney
