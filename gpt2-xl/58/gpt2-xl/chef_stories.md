Once upon a time, there was a chef named George Clinton. He was a man who loved the taste of grilled cheeses and he wanted to try his hand on a new flavor...

Clinton is the godfather of BBQ! He is also a man with a very unique storyâ€¦ he was born in Ohio and moved to New York City back in the late 40's. It was in New York where George began to pick up the flavor and artistry of southern BBQ. At the age of 16 he found himself in Jacksonville where he was introduced to the local BBQ culture. The taste of the sauce and the rubs he encountered there would forever change his life.


This is one of those dishes that George would come home from work and devour, but his real love affair occurred when he met up with this local grillmaster named Chris Williams.


At this point, every chef I know started trying a bit of the sauce that was served up from this place. Chris told Clinton to just throw anything he could find in a bowl and cook it up. Soon George was making his own sauces and he began to experiment with new blends of ingredients, but it was the sauce that made the biggest impression on those who first tried it.
