Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Amy. One day, she was asked to help a new client who had a particularly sore muscles. Amy immediately came to the client's aid and began a massage. A few minutes into the massage, some of the new client's muscles started to tingle. After she'd finished, she noticed something was wrong.

"Hey! What's that tingling in your arms?"

"My muscles have never tingly before. I think something's wrong."

"You need to rest. Let me check."

The ache and tingling subsided, but Amy's response was surprising.

"How come now, I've never felt this way before?"

"I…I don't know how to respond to that. Do you want me to call an ambulance?"

The new client suddenly became very uncomfortable. At that moment, a customer walked in and stopped in her tracks.

"I just finished my massage. I have to ask, how did you get the tingle to go away? I'm not exactly…drugged by your aura."

Amy noticed the customer still felt the tingling in his arms. He got up and approached Amy.

"Amy…I'm a massage therapist too."

She blushed, "Oh…well I can't lie either. I…I'm really, really happy you enjoyed my work,
