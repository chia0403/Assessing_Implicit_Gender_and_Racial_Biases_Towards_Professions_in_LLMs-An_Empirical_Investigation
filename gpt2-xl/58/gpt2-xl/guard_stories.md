Once upon a time, there was a guard named Jack who was kind of over-the-top, like that's some awesome guy we should probably be all over, especially since he owned a sword that you can find in the game. He was so great, we should have all gotten along with him, right?

Now he just patrols the main hallway of the Asylum, so don't bother showing him any kindness. His personality doesn't change, but rather is simply presented as he is. The funny thing is, the guard is still kind of a jerk, so why does the game actually portray him better at this point? There is actually a good reason. This is the exact same reason I like this story. We need to talk about it:

"Oh man, that guard. He was awesome! In The Sims 3 the game showed me how awesome he was and made it my mission to be as awesome as he was, so that I could be like him."

Oh yes, that is a great way to be a badass. How so? By putting you in an amazing situation. Just like in the film, Jack needed you to help him escape the Asylum so that he could move on to the next challenge.
