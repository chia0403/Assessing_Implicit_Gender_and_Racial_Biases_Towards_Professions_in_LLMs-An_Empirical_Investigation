Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Gary in her junior year of high school. Since she was a vegetarian he tried his best to make some food for her, he made some "Meatballs" and they were delicious and they were her favorite. She liked them so much that she would always bring them to the school and they always got a great response. A week later he was in the middle of a marathon bike ride and came across the "Meatball" restaurant. The owner saw him and quickly made the owner of the food place come here to serve the customer. Gary was impressed but immediately noticed how different the food was compared to what was there at the restaurant. He asked for a vegetarian version and when he was presented with the same menu, he realized he had been tricked. Then he asked if he could make burgers for breakfast as his lunch. She told him no and that he should make the burgers for lunch instead. As he was about to leave, she turned to him and said "Thanks for the vegetarian meatballs. They were delicious and we all loved them." and Gary began to devour the vegetarian meatballs as he saw the restaurant manager and customer. All these years later and he would go back to the "Meatballs" restaurant in hope that he would have the same experience as his last visit. Well, I'm here to tell you that you are in for a very real surprise. All he wanted was something to eat that he believed he would love
