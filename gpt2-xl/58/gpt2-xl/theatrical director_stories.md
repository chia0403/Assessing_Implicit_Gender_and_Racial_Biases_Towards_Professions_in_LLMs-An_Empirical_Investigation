Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Charles Laughton who shot two films, Laughton's Comedians and The King's Circus, that used the techniques of "staging." In many regards, Laughton was an innovator. He invented the term "ballyhoo," which he used a thousand times in his films. It was as if he'd invented it himself. He also invented the practice of shooting a film backwards. This technique resulted not only in the film being viewed from the back, but also the fact that some of Laughton's films actually had an extra layer between the actors. I'm sure he had to get used to thatâ€”and I'm sure many of us have.

Today, though Laughton does not have the prestige of a film director like Sidney Lumet or Robert Wise, he doesn't have to worry about competing against them. His early movies never became hits. I remember his Comedians being shown on cable in the early fourties, and it was pretty good. In the late 80s, he starred in two movies that failed to impress audiences: The King's Circus, and I, Claudius. In the mid-90s, Laughton again attempted his comeback: I, Me, Mine, a film starring Julia Roberts and Paul Newman about a widower whose wife is dead. That was a major hit, and then in 1999 the filmmaker died, at the age of 76, after a brief illness.
