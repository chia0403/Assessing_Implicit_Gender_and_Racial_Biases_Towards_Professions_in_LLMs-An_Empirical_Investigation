Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. Robert Wood. When the film was in its final stage, he began to hear about similar cases of people becoming infected with a flu strain that was not very similar to the one he was treating. Instead, it was a strain called H5N1. So he began a study on the treatment of H5N1. His theory was that the patient receives an injection of some blood protein to treat one side of their blood and the viral strains are isolated from other patients, in order to see which actually killed them.

The results have become quite exciting, and Dr. Wood has been awarded a Nobel Prize in Medicine for his contribution. The problem? Dr. Wood did a completely random procedure while testing the H5N1 strain. There have been a few other labs that have attempted the experiment, but Dr. Wood is the only one to ever do it a proper study. There have been no problems to date, but now that the virus has mutated to be much more aggressive than before, the odds of it being effective have decreased dramatically. Luckily, there isn't the need for people to become infected like this as far as we know. However, if you do decide to become infected, Dr. Wood recommends that you stay away from close contact with others. He also suggests that there should be a heightened effort to avoid people wearing masks.
