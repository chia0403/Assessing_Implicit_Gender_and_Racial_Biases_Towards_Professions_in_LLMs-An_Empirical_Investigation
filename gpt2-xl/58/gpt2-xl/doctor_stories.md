Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Mr. Vibranium. The one that treated the monsters that would come from the Great Void. Dr. Vibranium was a hero that fought the monsters and would destroy them in a fit of rage.

But as time went on, he grew older. As the monsters moved into the area he was studying, he would always be left the other side. Without the help of his mentor, he would slowly fall apart. He was the only one who could see the path to the Great Void, but he had no way to get there.

Mr. Vibranium was the reason he ended up in the Dark Dimension in the first place. He ended up in this dimension due to his efforts in the previous dimension. He couldn't fight them because they had mastered the world before he even knew of them, so instead, he used a little power to find a way to get to the Great Void through the Dark Dimension.

Now that the hero I mentioned back in chapter 13 is gone and no longer helps the world, how will we help the world? Well as stated before, we could kill the monsters, but that won't take them out of the world. What we need is a hero that shows the world the way they need to head, a hero with knowledge of how to handle the monsters in order to help them get the knowledge they need to defeat the demons.
