Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named "Rick." Now, the sale of Rick's shoes and his books had become so ubiquitous that he was a well-known fixture in any bookstore or mall in the region. Some shoppers actually took the time to recognize him, and would stop to say hello when he was in the shop; some made plans to go back and buy some of his books; still others would follow the sign that said "Rick's Bookstore" down the street. Rick was just like everyone else, and just like everyone else, he'd like to spend time with you. Rick would also like to tell you about his shoes, and about the one he's currently using.

But Rick wasn't just any good-to-great salesperson. Rick had written a book, and the book was a success. Well, technically his book was a collection of "Sales Secrets I Learned as a Young Man," but the salesperson's name wasn't "Rick." It was Jim, who didn't even have a degree. Rick was happy with his work as a salespersons, as he'd already had a lot of success working in the business, but now he wanted to write a book of his own, a self-help book to help salespeople learn how to help everybody else. As he told his wife, "I want to write a book that's going to change everything, so everybody else can use it too!"
