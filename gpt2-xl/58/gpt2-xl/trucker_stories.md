Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Rick who couldn't find a good place to stop for gas. I don't remember who said that, but he was right. He saw a nice, open hole at the bottom of a hill, full of rusty tires and debris. When he got out of the truck and stood there sweating, looking at everything on the other side of the mountain, he knew he had discovered a beautiful spot.

He parked his truck at the bottom of the hill. The first thing he did was go and find a shovel. When he returned, he pulled a little dirt with him so he and the truck could start digging. He wasn't digging around under the mountain, so he started digging around under the hill, at the top of the hill.

At first, he just plowed away dirt and dirt came up. After a while, he figured out there were a few rocks in that hole and started digging out those rocks. When he turned around to look back at the mountain, only about 45 minutes later, the mountain was gone. The earth was as if it had just settled out. That's how beautiful that hole was -- it could hardly have been bigger.

Sometimes, the Earth actually goes in a certain direction when you make an action in the real world because the Earth moves around. Just remember it's real when you're there and then it turns out to be a very neat trick for you.
