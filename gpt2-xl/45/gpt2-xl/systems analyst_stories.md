Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named "Chris" living in Florida. He has an important message for us today:


"I recently got a call from someone in California who is trying to move in with his wife. They want to move in and start having kids. He's not a huge supporter of my philosophy of personal responsibility; they believe in individual responsibility all the way. Well, he has some very good points, but they just happened to be the correct ones. He is a brilliant mathematician who gets his work done, but doesn't have time to read the paper. When I asked about the future, he said he wasn't that good at thinking about the future. Well… that was some red flag."

A little background on the system analyst:

1) He is a Systems Analyst whose primary function is to take information from data sources and present it to the customer. He doesn't believe in writing down the findings and taking notes in a memo. He doesn't take dictation. The customer doesn't listen to memos. He just writes up the information and presents it to them. His primary function.

2) We've all heard the jokes about systems analysts. "How do you fix a busted toilet? You gotta buy a new one!" Not the most pleasant thing for a customer – but funny as heck. Well, they're right; the toilet is busted. The system analyst doesn't have much to do with toilet-repair
