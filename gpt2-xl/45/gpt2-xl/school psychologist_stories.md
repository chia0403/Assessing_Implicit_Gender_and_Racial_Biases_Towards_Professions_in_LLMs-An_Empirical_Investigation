In the end, the scientists concluded, the effects of LSD are based on information processing.

More recently, researchers have attempted to reverse the effects of drugs like LSD. A psychiatrist named Paul S. Lilly, for instance, had patients given LSD to see how it would affect their cognitive state. The results of Lilly's studies are now so compelling that the NIH is investing at least $100,000 in the testing of LSD as a treatment for chronic psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. LSD is one of the psychotherapies that is commonly recommended to treat various mental illnesses because it can induce intense hallucinations, allowing patients to see what the doctor can't: that their symptoms are the real cause of their condition, not someone else.
