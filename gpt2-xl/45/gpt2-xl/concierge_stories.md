Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Fred West, who helped people like himself to travel through the world, in the style of a concierge who travels, and who knows everyone's name, including the person he used to be. But when Fred West took on a new lover, a beautiful young man who could never make it as a dancer, the old Fred left the high life behind him for the low-low lifestyle of a private detective. If things don't go well, however, Fred's ex-lover can call on this new companion, an attractive yet ruthless and deadly black-ops expert, to save the day, and Fred must take her out of the field to try and get back on track.
