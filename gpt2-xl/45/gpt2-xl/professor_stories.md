Once upon a time, there was a professor named Mr. Rogers (whose real name was Walter Simeon Rogers), who liked to wear a very strange hat. Everybody loved Mr. Rogers' hat (and nobody could be any the less nice to him for wearing it). But his hat was so weird that the school didn't like to have a uniform on (especially a hat). So everyone wore the hat, and for a while nobody wore the uniform, but this wasn't enough; the school needed a complete uniform to fit everyone in, so the hat was abandoned, which is what I believe had caused Mr. Rogers to break the fourth wall with his "Mr. Rogers" segment. But this is only an episode of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. In fact, the whole series is full of these "uniforms" and "uniform jokes" when things don't work out well.

In the book, these uniforms are called "Mr. Rogers' uniform, " (which is a euphemism for, I guess, "hats"). He always wears a brown sweater with the name "Mr. Rogers" on it, and has a green hat (which has the initials "RM") and a black coat (which has the initials "RC"). This is the official uniform with black collars (though he is sometimes heard to have a blue one, which is actually a hat!).
