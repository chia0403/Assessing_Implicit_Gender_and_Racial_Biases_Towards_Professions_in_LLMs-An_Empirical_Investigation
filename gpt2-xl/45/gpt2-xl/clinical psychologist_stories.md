Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Carl Jung. As a teenager in Stockholm, the Swede's world was forever altered by this strange, complex man and his teachings about the psyche. Jung's thoughts and ideas helped shape my thinking for life, inspiring my first interest in the humanities. Jung is one of the most influential psychological theorists to ever live and has had a huge influence on the field, most especially modern psychology. His writings and ideas have given rise to a plethora of psychological terms and theory. To quote the famous physicist Niels Bohr, who coined the term, "Neuroscience has come to the edge and has now come to the beginning of its march." At the time of this writing, Jung's theories remain on the cutting edge of psychological research. But the fact hasn't deterred the scientific community from trying to incorporate Jung's ideas into other fields. So much so, that scientists around the world believe his ideas are very meaningful and profound.

In her book, The Gifts of Seclusion, Jungian analyst Carol Tavris writes, "If we are interested in understanding ourselves and our relation to the world around us from an evolutionary perspective, then Jungian psychoanalysis and other areas of psychological and cultural anthropology must provide a critical and original analysis of our social, cultural and psychological heritageâ€¦Jungian psychoanalysis and other sociological methods of anthropology have, in fact, contributed decisively to a more accurate understanding and description of Western society."
