Once upon a time, there was a florist named Ms. P. W.

We didn't know anything about her except her florist business was on the way out. She was also in the flower business and had done well for herself.

"Who is Mrs. W.? I want to know!"

The florist was a very nice lady. She was in a hurry to get to the airport where her flight was to take off. Mrs. W. was on her way to the airport to see how she was doing that day when a man called her over to a counter.

"Mrs. W,, can you help me?"

Mrs. W. was amazed when she heard this and looked over at another employee who answered her.

"Yes ma'am, what number is this?"

Mrs. W. called the other employee with full knowledge of who she had just spoken to. When all of them called the same number, the florist was surprised to hear that the person who answered was Miss P. W.

The florist called the number to get another employee who identified herself as Miss P. W. She also knew it was that woman who had answered the phone.

Mrs. W. ran from the counter. Mrs. W. ran outside of the florist and into a parking lot when she was stopped by a police officer. Mrs. W. was then searched
