Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Paul Wertheim. Wertheim was an early, and incredibly influential photographer, whose work is celebrated today in a variety of art museums and academic institutions. Many of those photographs, and those of Paul Wertheim himself, are now collectible. To my knowledge, Paul Wertheim photos, and the original prints, are the only ones of the original work of Paul Wertheim available on the internet, and no one I've asked has heard of Paul Wertheim's original photographs or a working copy.

In 1988, Paul Wertheim and I went to my home to visit, and I went to photograph some early work from Wertheim, in which he was experimenting with black-and-white photographic methods. This very rare and unique experience has been documented in a book of photographs and writings, titled Crop Circles, Inc. That work is now up for auction and with a starting bid of twenty-five bucks, I've heard that it could go for as much as fifty dollars.

While I have no idea what Wertheim might've produced with this particular piece and the original negatives, the photographs are a rich tapestry, and I think this was Paul Wertheim at his very best, experimenting and exploring. As one of the best, it's not too hard to imagine such a portrait, and a painting of this kind on the wall of one of my rooms.
