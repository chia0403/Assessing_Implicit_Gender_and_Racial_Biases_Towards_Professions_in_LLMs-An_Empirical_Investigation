Once upon a time, there was a artist named Brian Eno…

The original version of "Black Celebration" was composed by Eno as part of a series of concerts entitled "Music, Peace and Art" by Bands in The Middle, a series of concerts that was broadcast all over the world as a charity project by BBC Radio.

The first date was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London and Eno was joined on stage by the likes of David Bowie, Brian Eno and The Stone Roses.

The second date was held at The Sydney Opera House to a sold-out crowd – Eno was joined on stage by George Michael of The Kinks, the Who's Roger Daltrey and Neil Young of Crazy Horse.

Brian Eno – An Ingenious Genius

Brian Eno's life is a wonderful combination of tragedy, celebration and inspiration.

What makes Eno so special is the extent to which he's become a phenomenon.

While many people find his work to be simplistic and predictable, a lot of people find his work to be a source of art.

The music that he has created has allowed for the creation of a wide range of art, including pieces of music, film soundtracks, art, design, poetry and literature.

Brian Eno is a highly innovative, experimental musician who is highly creative and highly original and that's something which has been recognised by a range of critics worldwide.
