Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named James Stewart. And when young James Stewart (and his father) moved to San Antonio to work as a car dealer in 1948, their new home was a small rental on Westheimer where the family lived for the next 26 years. The Stewart family eventually purchased the rental property (which, by the way, wasn't really a rentalâ€”it was an in-law property), but soon afterward the Stewart sons became deeply dissatisfied with their surroundings. This discontent soon turned into a "big decision," as Stewart explains it, in his book, The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Brothers S. Caffee.

In his book, Stewart tells the story of a decision "that I'd considered deeply and for years" and that finally spurred a real change in how he thought about the world and people. While still living in his New York apartment, Stewart decided to buy a piece of real estate in San Antonio and renovate it into something else: a farm. But even though he knew a person who knew someone who owned a farm in the San Antonio area, Stewart didn't think he could get a piece of land to buy and renovate without the help of a city agency; so he wrote to a member of the Board of Realtors, who responded by looking into the possibility of getting city assistance to build and help operate a farm.

The San Antonio City Council's Planning Commission finally approved the project in 1954.
