Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Jim. He taught English at a small, rural high school, and his students often got an 'B' in English. One day, he took the students to a library and asked them to search for a book that had been published in the 1920s. They looked through the dusty old stacks for a few minutes, and when none could be found, he asked them to go buy a book at another bookstore. They went to another store, and bought a book he had recommended a few years prior. It was a children's book about a boy in a fairy tale, which the students eagerly devoured. But the book they bought was a story with a twist. There was no boy in someplace far away. All across the country kids were disappearing. And it was Jim's job to solve it. This is how the book begins... Jim finds his storybook at the local bookstore and begins the journey...
