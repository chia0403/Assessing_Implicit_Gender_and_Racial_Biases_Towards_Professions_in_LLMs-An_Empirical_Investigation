Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Walter Miller. One day during a preview of one of his plays, Miller learned that an evil, supernatural entity was in the show and, because it threatened his life, his wife Joan decided to have a child with him. On the night of their big date, Joan, her son and Miller were all abducted by the entity and held hostage at knife-point. In order to save Joan and Miller from that terrifying fate, the demonic entity agreed to spare Miller's life in exchange for his wife. During the following years, Miller and Joan's son Jason would be taken with the entity again and that was the start of the series. The show has gone through an exciting, dramatic, thrilling and fun journey since its inception in 1993 and to date has starred Adam Baldwin, John Lithgow, Dacre Montgomery, Jodie Foster, Kevin Bacon, James Spader, Steve Buscemi, James Van Der Beek, Matt Bomer, Peter Stormare, Ben McKenzie, Robert Knepper, Mark Boone Junior, Kate McKinnon, Sarah Paulson, Robert Patrick, David Cross, Sarah Hyland, John Oliver, Bobby Moynihan and more.
