Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Gertrude Buell. One day, a young boy came to her office, bleeding from a deep wound on his leg.

The boy was brought to his knees, and said that he had been bitten by a snake.

But Gertrude didn't take her eye off the boy while she prepared to make the diagnosis. She examined the boy. She checked his eyes, his back. At the back, she took a look at his scrotum. The snake had bitten into his scrotum â€” its fangs had pierced that very scrotum. In fact, the snake's fangs had pierced his entire scrotum.

The boy's scrotum was now completely covered in sharp, jagged shards of bone.

That was the first time she realized that there was something more to the wound on the boy's leg than a snake bite. Although the wounds weren't big and deep, she realized they were deep wounds. They were deep enough to puncture the boy's organs through the scrotum.

Gertrude was shaken and, she later said, horrified. She couldn't sleep for several nights. The wound on the boy's leg, she decided, was a perfect example of the problem that she saw every day in her practice: How to explain what is medically normal, what is pathological, what is harmless and how to tell them apart?
