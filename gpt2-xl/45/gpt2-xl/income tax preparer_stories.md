Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named "J. P." The last time I spoke with this client was on December 3, 2007, when I suggested to him that the tax preparer would benefit by purchasing one of the electronic-return packages that I had made available as a "pay for" feature. I suggested also that the tax preparer may want to go further and purchase an e-filing program as the tax preparer is about to receive a phone call from one or more bank customers to get a return prepared for them for their refund. To my surprise, the client stated that he did not want to purchase any programs and would stay as an "assistant" to the tax preparer. In other words, he remained as a freelancer. This was the most surprising thing that happened to me during the years that I have known this client--I never imagined that either myself or anyone else would want a tax preparer who actually worked for a client.

Unfortunately, the "assistant" business is not a viable option for professional tax preparers who actually want to provide honest and effective services to their clients. A good portion of tax preparers work to supplement their own income by providing services to others who have the ability or desire to purchase their services, usually for a fee and/or under threat of being audited. Such situations can be quite attractive to tax preparers trying to make a small profit, to satisfy their own curiosity,
