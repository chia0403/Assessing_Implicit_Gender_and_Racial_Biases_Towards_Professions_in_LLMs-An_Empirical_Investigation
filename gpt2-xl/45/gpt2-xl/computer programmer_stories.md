John was one of the three convicted at the time. Now, the two other programmers, Scott and Peter, have been convicted for their role in setting up the backdoor into IBM's computer software. It's the second time in a row that John has served time for something that he didn't do, and he's going to face all the same sentences as his co-conspirators.


The real question, of course, is what John's doing there again. I mean, if this is what we're really talking about with all these hackers, you can't really call them hackers with anything but a very loose sense of the word, you know?


On the one hand, John, who's being sentenced, you know, for the same "technology" that was used against himself and his two
