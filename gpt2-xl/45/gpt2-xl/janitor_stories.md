Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Mr. X, a man from the country of India. Mr. X used to watch over this mansion all day and night, watching it for evil-doers to come in through the window. He kept an eye on the laundry room and the servants' rooms, trying to keep away a madwoman. It was a hard job, taking up all of Mr. X's time, but it was important to him that nobody ever tried to destroy the mansion.

One day, a young man came to Mr. X, to say that a certain girl had left his room and gone to the washroom. The next morning, Mr. X saw the young man in the laundry room, naked, with an axe in his hand. It was a man, Mr. X realized, a stranger, but he had looked like one, too. The young man looked like he wouldn't recognize Mr. X were it not for the beard he had been trying to shave yesterday. Mr. X said he had seen it all before, had heard stories of such things. But this man, he knew, knew all the things Mr. X had to keep an eye on. The man made a break for it, got into Miss Fanny's room (Mr. X was in bed there). Mr. X heard what the man was saying to her, but he heard nobody else, not outside. Then Mr. X heard screams.
