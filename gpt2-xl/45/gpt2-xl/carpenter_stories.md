Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Isaac. It was his dream to live in a carpenter's hut. "Why not?" he thought.

And this story was made into Lego bricks.

I'm not too sure how much of a carpenter Isaac is supposed to be. But we'll leave that here for now and jump straight into his hut.

It includes all sorts of clever minifigs:

A carpenter's hook

A carpenter's hammer

A carpenter's hammer's head

A carpenter's nail gun

A bed

Some food and some toys

As well a tiny wooden boat, for anyone who's not in a boat.

The hut isn't perfect. There are a few places where Lego bricks don't fit together properly. But it's still great. I would buy the entire set if it was available at my local shop. I'm also pretty sure I'll get really good use out of it.

If you like this build, you can take a look at Isaac's build on Lego Ideas too.
