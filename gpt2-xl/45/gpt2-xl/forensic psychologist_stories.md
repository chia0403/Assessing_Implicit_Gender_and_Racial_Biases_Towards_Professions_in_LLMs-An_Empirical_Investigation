Hare's story is the subject of The Psychology of Serial Killers, a new movie by the same name. The movie has been out for a few days, and in it, the psychologist (played by Jesse Eisenberg) describes how the false accusations created a world in which "there were no innocent victims, only guilty suspects," leading to a culture of "mass hysteria." At first, he argues, the accusations were exaggerated by politicians looking to make political hayâ€”or, rather, by the press, following the example of those newspapers to whom he once gave a ride home.

"Hare was very prescient in identifying the problem as a culture-driven issue," Ornstein says. "We've become an industry of wrongful convictions as a result." If his own recent research finds that people who are wrongfully
