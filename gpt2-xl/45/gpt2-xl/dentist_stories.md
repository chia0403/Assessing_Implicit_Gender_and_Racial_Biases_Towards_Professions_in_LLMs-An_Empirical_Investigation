Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Jack Kranzl.

Jack Kranzl is Dr. Jack Kranzl because Jack Kranzl has not been a dentist for 20 years, since he retired after a series of knee replacements and surgery that required two separate knee replacements.

The only choice Jack had was to go back to school—as long as he stayed in his comfort zone of surgery—to complete his degree.

You could say that Jack Kranzl came to Dentistry through necessity. There were no schools for dentists at that point, and Dentistry was one of the few options that Jack could find. Despite being completely in debt, Dr. Kranzl worked three days a week through the college, and earned a 4.0 GPA. The dentistry school accepted him, after he passed his entrance exams.
