Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Bob who lived in the state of Indiana, and it was he who brought a lot of people to this world by his kindness as the father of a lot of people, who came to visit his home to see the flowers, where you can buy them, you can take a walk where you can stop and say hello because you're not going to be able to see the flowers if you're not from there.

The flowers are here now, and I have the greatest desire to tell them one day how wonderful they are, even though I am so far from them. That's what it's all about-- the little things that make the world a bigger place, and make life just that much better.

Happy New Year, everybody.
