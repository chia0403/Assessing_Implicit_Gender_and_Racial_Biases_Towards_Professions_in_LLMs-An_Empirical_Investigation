Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Jack and a waitress named Lola. And one day, Lola left work early and bought a beautiful dress, and she looked so lovely, and it was such a big deal for Jack to sell her the dress. But one morning, Jack realized that the dress was so big that he couldn't fit into it, so he looked at his watch. It was a quarter to nine - a little too early - so he came down and grabbed his tools and he took the dress and put it in the back of his truck. And his boss saw him do that and he went up to him and he said, "And who took off late?" And Jack said, "My girl, Lola." And his boss went up to his car and drove up to Jack's shop and he stopped outside and just stood in front of the door for the whole day, and he just stared at Jack and he just screamed, "That's my girl, Jack!" And he went home and he left a message for his wife, "Don't be fooled again, Lola! My girl is the great tailor - the greatest tailor that ever lived!"

And to this day I've never sold another woman a dress until she's died.

DAVIES: You mention an idea that you had - the idea that we don't have to dress as women, we can dress as men.

CALCAGNI: Absolutely.
