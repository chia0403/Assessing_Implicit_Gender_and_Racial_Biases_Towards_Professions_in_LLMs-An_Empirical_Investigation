Once upon a time, there was a barber named Richard Nixon in San Francisco. He'd been in San Francisco since he was three. He was on the boards of a few banks. He was a high school basketball star, and he thought of himself as a political genius. So one day he said, "I was in San Francisco when I picked up a copy of the Sunday Times, and here's what they had in its page headlines that day. All of a sudden I was aware that I had gone from being the youngest president to the most hated president."

And you realize that you're now the most hated president because you have been the most successful.

That's exactly right, and it was the beginning of Watergate. That was Nixon's moment, and it was our moment, too.

That was my moment too. Our moment was Watergate.

Do you have any sense of where it will go from here?

Probably over time more and more. [Laughter]

What does that mean to you? People will always remember and remember and remember, and it will be very sad if in 50 years every time I'm in a room with 20 people, I have to talk about Watergate, the biggest scandal in American history. I can't tell you at this point.

I do want to point out that for the purposes of this interview, the Watergate tapes were a big thing not just in California, not just in Orange County
