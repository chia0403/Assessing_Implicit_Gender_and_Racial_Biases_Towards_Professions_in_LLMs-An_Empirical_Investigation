Once upon a time, there was a reporter named David D. Horowitz, who was an ardent advocate of "Israel bashing" and the boycott movement against the Jewish state. He ran a weekly column called "David Horowitz's Letter" in the National Review, the publication of which, along with National Review Online, has received funding from the Koch brothers. I never would have even noticed that it had a letter to the editor, if not for a recent column by the editor-in-chief, David French, about some recent, pro-BDS, articles. The first of these columns was about "Tilda Swinton and Jewish Supremacism." The second about "The Pervert on the Set."

When David D. Horowitz ran for president on the Reform party ticket in 1996, he had an "Israel first" platform. In 2000, former Israeli President Shimon Peres was the keynote speaker, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton.

David Horowitz, of course, is pro-BDS too, and I wouldn't expect him in a Bernie Sanders/Hillary Clinton administration to back away from his anti-Israel stance. As a Trump supporter, I would be disappointed to see a Sanders administration not be pro-Israel. However, I would be very disappointed if there wasn't some kind of compromise position, on Israel and Palestine, on which Hillary Clinton would agree, if not enthusiastically.
