Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named John. He got a job at a gas turbine manufacturing facility, called a turbine manufacturer, and soon discovered that he had an unusual talent for working with large and heavy engines â€“ he was very good at moving them at a high speed. He worked on an air turbine engine that measured 30 feet tall, and an engine that was much, much wider than that. He was always trying to figure out how to make it work better, which sometimes turned out to be making a really big fan, and sometimes just a huge hole. As he moved these large and quite heavy engines around the factory, he found himself taking photographs that would later become very successful advertising campaigns, that showcased the unique quality of speed and speed as it was realized by a person standing in one place.

When you're in one place, is there tension about being out of the way, but not wanting to disappear completely?

Yes. That's the thing. It's a very odd kind of tension for an operator to be always in the way as his engine moves around. It's a nice job. He gets to move lots of engines. But it's something you have to deal with. You don't want to be out of the way. The only reason he got into those pictures was he liked to show the speed of some of the engines through those holes. He couldn't just take shots all day; he had to take pictures at some point.
