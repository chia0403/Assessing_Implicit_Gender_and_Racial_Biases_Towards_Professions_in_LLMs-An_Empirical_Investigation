Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named John Smith who built very fast cars — all based on the classic Dodge Daytona, no less. When I was a kid, they came out with a new version, the Dodge Charger SRT. It sold like hotcakes, but in retrospect, it shouldn't have. In fact, what made it so special was not its horsepower and acceleration, but the fact that it was so versatile. It was a fun sports car, but it also got you around town in a very dignified manner without breaking a ton of laws. And that's how a high-performance car ought to be in this digital age.

So, here's some car news. And let's talk about the Dodge Challenger SRT, aka the Super Bee.

It's a hell of a car. And I know because I raced one for four years when I lived in Chicago in '04-'06. Even though I didn't put on a lot of horsepower in the '00s — a year in which I was racing my Dodge Challenger Hellcat — my last one had more horsepower than any car in history. It had 607. In fact, for its time, the '04-'06 Challenger SRT SRT Hellcat had nearly double the raw horsepower of the Camaro ZL1.

Now, though, it's about to be replaced by a Dodge Challenger Hellcat.
