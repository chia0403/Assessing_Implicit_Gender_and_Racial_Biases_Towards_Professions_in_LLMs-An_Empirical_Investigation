Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Dr. Robert O. Wright who saw potential in that little girl called Jennifer. Dr. Wright, who was a bit of a radical in his approach to rehabilitation, was able to do something few others thought possible: He turned a hopeless situation into a chance for a healthy lifestyle. He made the determination that Jennifer was to be given a chance, and he did his best to make her a model patient...


In our case, as we know Jennifer from the beginning to the end of the story, the world of the hospital would not allow us to give her this chance. We could not give her the opportunity to make the best of her little life.


Even if we knew that the world of our hospital was on the verge of failure. The world of the patient is the one that carries the greatest burden. It is the one that carries the responsibility to make the best choices possible in his or her recovery.


This is where you come in. This is where we find ourselves. If you have found our story online or in the newspaper coverage, we would like to hear from you. To do that, we invite you to fill out our online survey. Thank you for your time. A very important consideration, however, is for you to keep this survey strictly confidential. We do not wish this to be the only time we hear from the public.
