Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Paul that got kicked off the job for talking about God on the job. I don't know if you were wondering what happened to him after that, because if so, I've missed an episode. Let me introduce you to the guy that was once known by his given name: Dr. Mark Regnerus.

Oh, the science is clear. We all know sex is beautiful and that it can give kids the best start in life. It's just not so clear that there's such a thing as "good sex." I believe my fellow Christian friends are right when they say that God cannot be blamed for anything that happens between a man and a woman in marriage. But, sex is not something God created; sex is created by some people in marriage. It's not the man who created sex; it's the man and woman. The reality is you can find anything in a woman that she hates or loves and then put that down as the essence of love, but it's just not the kind of love that's true love. I don't care which sex you are, the only thing you can be is human.

I mean, I've heard all of these so-called experts say stuff about gender dysphoria and the gay-gay-gay debate. I think what we have to say that is correct is that your gender identity is just as much a choice as your sex is. You can change them.
