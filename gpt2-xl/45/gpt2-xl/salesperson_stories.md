Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Paul, who sold shoes. Paul wasn't an especially good salesperson. Not that he wasn't good — for someone who did all the things so many people spend their day doing, he was pretty damn good. But Paul had the good luck to work for the company Paul was best at. It was at that time the company was named Nike.


Paul's company, however, was no more than a pawn in a much bigger game. It was as if the company had hired a new executive team (or more precisely, a new marketing team) who were all out of their depth and simply didn't know how to market their new product.

Paul's company had been a major player in the footwear business for more than 40 years. It had been a fixture in the footwear sales world for decades. More than a few of America's favorite athletes had been wearing the very shoes Paul's company designed and manufactured. Paul had become more than just a salesperson — he was a designer who had earned a spot in history as one of the most influential and famous men in footwear.


Paul's team had managed to get Paul to go along with their plan of marketing the new shoe through the sports world. But Paul's salespeople — his own team in particular — were not about to give up control of their own brand to a corporate entity whose marketing efforts were a disaster.


Paul's team was still very much alive
