Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Larry H. Brown, who, at least according to Dr. Brown, had some skills outside of the office. While he may or may not have been able to take on a role as a personal trainer, when it came to helping people train their bodies for better performance—a topic of great interest to many—this wasn't his area of expertise. Brown was able to take the pulse of the bodybuilding community and, as a result, he gave a great deal of insight into what was happening with the sport at the time.

When I think back on the days I spent as a young gym rat, I often wonder if I learned anything from the advice Brown gave me. While it may not have been what I wanted to hear at the time, his wisdom served me well, and I eventually used most of it.

The following are 25 of Bob's most powerful and useful pieces of advice.

1. Train the entire body, not just your arms or legs.

This one is an easy one. Many are under the misconception that in order to develop strength you need to focus on only one part of the body. But the truth is, if you could train just those muscles you'd look even better. So, if you train your arms, legs and core you'll reap amazing results.

2. Don't use drugs or diet to add muscle; train how you want to look!
