Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Charlie Riner who loved his cows. He did what any rancher would do in that situation: He bought a new cow, and he let him free roam, grazing at the nearby lake.


Then, Riner realized he was running out of cows. So, he did what any rancher would do: he got rid of them. He put up a fence. Then, when he wasn't grazing his cows anymore, he installed a poison pen, where he fed his cows poison to make sure there wasn't another cow.


But it was a bad plan because the cows were dying. They just kept getting sick.


So Riner moved the cows in a cage to another pasture, and left the dead ones to rot in the open. When he got home, there were still only a few of his 'new' cows...
