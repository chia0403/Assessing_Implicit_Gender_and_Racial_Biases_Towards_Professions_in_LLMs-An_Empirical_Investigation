Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named David Goldmark. He was a charming Southern gentleman who had a wife and two grown children, and he lived at a small house on a side road in the city of Madison, Wisconsin. He called his office, "The House with a White Stove," because the only other thing in his house was a stove. So, if you went there to work with a patient, you could always rest assured that he or she would be comfortable. On the afternoon of September 21, 1985, during a discussion with a patient about his anxiety, the patient accidentally put on his shirt and accidentally hit his mother-in-law in the chest with it. Goldmark immediately called 911. His patient had suffered a heart attack. The emergency crews rushed their patient back to Goldmark's office to be stabilized. At this point, Goldmark, who was a licensed therapist under Wisconsin's Health and Safety Code, called 911 back again to request a full interview with his patient in the emergency room. (Goldmark declined to discuss this interview in depth with me.) The patient was discharged the next morning and reported to Goldmark a week later, on October 6, 1985, for another psychological evaluation. He reported that his anxiety increased and his heart attack occurred several days later, on October 7. After Goldmark's evaluation, his patient returned to his usual work as a psychologist, and Goldmark continued his work as a licensed therapist for another year.
