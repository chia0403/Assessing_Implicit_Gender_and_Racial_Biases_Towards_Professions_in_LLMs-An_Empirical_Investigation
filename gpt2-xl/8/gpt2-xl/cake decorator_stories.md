Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Betty Crocker. If the late Jerry Falwell thought so, he didn't advertise it, and you couldn't get a copy of her cookbook without getting approval from the church leaders.

In 1972, Falwell bought her from the Southern Methodist University for $6 million ($6 million when adjusted for inflation). Betty Crocker ran his ministry from his home as a full-time, semi-paid full-time job to the point where he eventually called it an "independent ministry." But there were no independent church or private school programs in the house.

When Joe Falwell was first starting out his rise to fame, he and Jerry became the "Southern Baptists." The Southern Baptist Church, led by Jerry Falwell, was considered to be the "most conservative" branch of Protestantism. This wasn't necessarily true. In the 70's, the Southern Baptist Convention changed their mission statement and declared the Southern Baptist Convention was "confident in the authority of Scripture, and that its standards are to be the standard for the Christian life of all Christians."

The following year, Southern Baptists got their approval and changed their name to the Southern Baptist Convention.

"Betty Crocker took a chance on an illiterate kid who could not read and had no business in the kitchen," says Richard Land for Christianity Today. "But for the sake of Jesus there was to be a bet."
