Once upon a time, there was a coach named Steve McClain. Back then, he was leading his team to back-to-back conference championships. But now he's the coach at San Diego State: a team that won the Sun Bowl this season, and is currently in the middle of a six-game losing streak.

McClain has had a hell of a year. The Aztecs have plummeted from 12-1 in 2010 to 5-8 in his first season back. McClain's biggest issue: A lack of talent on the field.

They're the only non-Power 5 program still undefeated, and despite being the only team to crack two hundred yards of total offense in a game this season, they're still just a top 150 ranking. The Aztecs need help: the program hasn't had an over-the-air broadcast in nearly a decade, so McClain could use some fans.

So they're looking for someone, anything, to hire as their new head coach. And a well-known celebrity agent might just have a lot to say about that.

On Friday, a Twitter account based in South Florida was promoting a Craigslist ad.
