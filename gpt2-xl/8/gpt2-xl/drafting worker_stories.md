Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named John Smith. He was born in New York, the son of a small-town doctor who knew little about the game of basketball, but was a brilliant judge of character. One day in 1841, after finishing work on a report for the county court, he told his manager, "I'm gonna take my talents to the East, where that new country is opening its eyes to the value of a decent basketball system." But once there, he couldn't help but notice that there was too much basketball being played right there in the capital city. As a result, he took it upon himself to organize a league of free-agent hopefuls from the New York area to challenge the established players. Not being a master deal-maker, Smith couldn't be sure what would happen to the players once they reached the Big Apple, as well as what would happen to the city itself. By the time there was an NBA team there in 1884, John Smith's league had already folded. (Smith ended up being the second president and chief of the city's police force.) The league, Smith reasoned, was a failure but would eventually pay it forward. He hoped that, when the basketball was finally in demand in Manhattan, other cities would follow his lead and build up their own teams. But it seems he never got that far. Smith's leagues, like the NBA of today, failed, and it almost cost the city of New York
