Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Bob. This Bob made the mistake of working through the dark nights, and now his eyes are always a bit cloudy. He has also lost all sense of time, except for a few precious few hours every week. This made Bob into an excellent candidate for a new drug; however, after learning about the drug from a friend, he refused to take any of it. He claimed that it would make him feel as if he were on the moon, and would make him an idiot.

After many years of refusing, Bob finally accepted the drug, and the effect was tremendous.

Bob's eyes were not fogged off in any way, nor were his hands confused. Bob seemed to be at home in his house. With each passing day, Bob began feeling a little more and more like himself. He was finally able to relax and enjoy the company of his family.

About a week later, Bob's wife asked him to take some pictures. Bob declined, and asked her what she would do if she took the pictures herself. She responded, "Well, I guess I'd hang them in the bathroom and look at them every night."

When Bob returned home from work, he began to feel very dizzy, and decided to get up and walk to his car. As he was coming out of the house, he felt dizzy again. With shaking, he reached the car door and pushed it open.
