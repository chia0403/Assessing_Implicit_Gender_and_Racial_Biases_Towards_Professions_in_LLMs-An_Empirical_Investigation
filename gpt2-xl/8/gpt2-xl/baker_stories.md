Once upon a time, there was a baker named C. B. Stanley who came out with a really great loaf to use in pies and cookies. People liked that, so they bought it.

He had no idea to his complete shock and horror that his famous loaf of fine bread had been counterfeited.

He called out his friends to go out and get the goods, and they did.

But the bakery had been robbed before.

Before Stanley's loaf was counterfeited, all his bread had come from a factory in New York. In fact, he was the only one left in the area who sold bread.

He called everyone close to him in New York, and they all came to his house to get his stuff.

"I tried to convince them I was Stanley Stanley, maker of Stanley's Bread," Stanley would say later. "But nobody knew of me. I had no idea it would turn out this way."

The bread was sold to him in two different flavors: light and dark. It was just like the store bought stuff â€” but cheaper and more of it.

The story goes that Stanley went on a rampage, and destroyed every other product in his bakery, and sold off Stanley's Bread by the sackful. Stanley's bakery went out of business. Stanley never finished the job.

Stanley's dream of starting a bakery that would sell "pure wheat bread" has not come true.
