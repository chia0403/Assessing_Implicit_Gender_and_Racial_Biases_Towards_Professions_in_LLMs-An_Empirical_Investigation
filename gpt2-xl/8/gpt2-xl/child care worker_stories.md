Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Julie who, because she was too tired to stay awake, did a lot of unpaid work for the same clients as a babysitter. (She is no longer working. She is very old now. Her sister used to work for the agency from time to time once before she divorced the other parent and started building her own life.)

Julie's clients would have the two kids to themselves every day, and she would clean them up, feed the dog and clean their bedroom. She took care of a lot of tasks for kids who were really cranky; she was the "good mother of the house."

This was very popular with parents, and the work was easy to find â€” in fact, in many cities Julie was the only care worker who would do this work for two or three people at the same time.

But once Julie had a child of her own, she began to realize that this wasn't the most fun job. Julie's clients began demanding more than babysitting and was no longer able to make enough money on a "day shift" to provide for herself, but not everyone who worked for other agencies was that fortunate. The "day shift" job was already more complicated and tedious than most people would like (especially because some of these childcare workers were unpaid), and it was very hard to find a job that didn't require you be present every day.

What does this mean for parents
