Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named E. B. White, who in 1938 published an article about one of his experiments with an atomic bomb. He called it the first controlled nuclear explosion, and called it a "theoretical explosion." Here a nuclear explosion is discussed as a theoretical phenomenon, but one so uncertain as to be beyond the reach of experimentation.

Nowadays, the idea of a controlled nuclear explosion is as close to mainstream scientific reality as nuclear technology has come. There is a lot of scientific certainty associated with small nuclear explosions, in which a large quantity of energy is released at once.

The science of controlled nuclear explosions is complicated, and at some level I am not so certain of it that I'm going to go into every detail of the physics involved. But I have to say that the fundamental concept behind every atomic bomb is simple: The bomb's core is enclosed within a bomb casing, which is encased in a thermonuclear device. An explosion takes place inside the thermonuclear device, releasing nuclear fission (a form of atomic reaction that releases one nucleus of an atom, plus neutrons, rather than an amount of energy as in a fission bomb), which fuses and burns the material inside the thermonuclear device, then it is released at high speed – often in the form of a shock wave – out the bomb casing. This creates an expanding pressure wave, and which can be compared to the force of a water
