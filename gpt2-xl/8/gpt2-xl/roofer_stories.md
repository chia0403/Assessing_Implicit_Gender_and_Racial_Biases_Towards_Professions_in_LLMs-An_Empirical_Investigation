Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Dave, and he had a son called Jack. Jack was a big shot, a roofer, and a guy who never cared about his family. One day, Dave and Jack were standing by an open-top truck when Jack got into a screaming match with a couple of guys sitting inside. When Dave finally left to go to the bathroom, Jack and the two guys got into an argument, and one of them opened the back cargo door. Jack ran out, opened the freight door and jumped of the open truck. Jack took two steps forward, and fell into the ocean. Dave didn't know he had hit a huge chunk of land. He had no idea that somewhere beneath the water, his son was desperately trying to pull him out.


We've all been there. You've got your goal, and all you can think about is getting there. You've got your plan, and you're counting down the seconds. Finally, in a rush of adrenaline you think: What if I just say I'm gonna jump? Your heart starts beating faster; you start looking around for the perfect rope, and your toes start digging into the dirt. With your last ounce of strength, you swing yourself off, confident that without that rope you'll just die. And, amazingly, you land on your feet.
