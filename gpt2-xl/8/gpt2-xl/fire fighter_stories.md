Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Mike.  He loved her dearly, and was always there for her when he got the call.  And yet a funny thing happened when he had a little girl.  The little girl became a full time firefighter!  And no matter how many times they tried to get her to give up the job, she just refused, and her love for the job was too deep in her to give it up. If Mike had been lucky enough to grow up to be one of the lucky ones, this little fire fighter in Texas might be his daughter someday.  A fire fighter from Texas who will always remain a Texas firefighter. And when Mike goes to school, he is sure to be sure the little girl always has a seat near him!
