Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Ms. Kim. Every day for 15 years she fed hungry young children in the school cafeteria. Today she and her school have been transformed into a new and shiny complex, complete with a park, a theater, restaurants, and a luxury apartment complex. The complex itself consists of 13 buildings, each one of which has eight floors. (Seems to me like 15 is too many.) At first glance the buildings have a vaguely New York architectural flavor. What the buildings have in common is a large, open, open courtyard, enclosed by a large fence with a tall metal gate, and a high metal security gate that separates the courtyard from the building. This is a security barrier. The courtyard is the center of the playground, and the fence is where the play is, where all that comes before and after play are hidden. Play in New York playgrounds is not exactly the same as play in a playground in London. The London playground has been carefully designed and maintained over time. There were people in the first years who lived in the playgrounds â€” people from all over the world, many of them very poor and without any children at the time. Over time, this population slowly dwindled and people moved out. It was not unusual to find children playing on a sidewalk with a piece of bread in her hands, or on a stoop with a pair of shoes in her pocket. In some parks there were children from countries across the world
