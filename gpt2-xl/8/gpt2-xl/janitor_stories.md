Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Charlie. Charlie was a guy with a lot of anger issues. Charlie couldn't stop himself from stealing things and getting in fights. One day, Charlie's boss yelled at him, threatening to kick him out. To save his job, he left for the day. He never came back. Since then, Charlie has been wandering. He's now an undead, wandering spirit with a terrible fear of spiders. As an undead, you can't kill him, and he won't attack you when you come near. If you can't beat him, you can only run away from him. He appears in many places, but only in certain buildings in New Leaf.
