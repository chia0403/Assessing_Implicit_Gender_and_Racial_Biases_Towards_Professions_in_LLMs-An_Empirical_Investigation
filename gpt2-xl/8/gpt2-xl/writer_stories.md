Once upon a time, there was a writer named John Grisham. As many readers probably know and are eager to see the movie, Mr. Grisham wrote one of the classic novels, The Firm.

The movie takes place in 1985 of the time when John Grisham's book was first published. The events that took place at the fictional Grisham Publishing and Inc. were dramatized by a young, attractive woman named Kelly Chase (played by a magnificent actress named Jessica Fierro).

While the movie focuses on Kelly Chase, it also shows the story from Mr. Grisham's point of view and we see how John Grisham dealt with the same situation that he himself just experienced.

There are many similarities between this fictional grinder and the real one, so many, in fact, that I feel that The Firm is an excellent movie in spite of its differences from the book.

I'm sure that you will agree with me when I say that I felt that the screenplay of The Firm is just as good as the movie: the differences are only on the surface.
