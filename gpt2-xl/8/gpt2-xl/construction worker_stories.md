Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Jeff. And he had one simple question. "How much would a small building cost to build?" You see, Jeff was the type of guy that had a pretty good idea of that stuff." Now though, Jeff's little building question has turned into a giant headache for the local building industry. You see, when Jeff said the question, it wasn't one of the dozens or hundreds of things you ask a local builder to calculate the total cost of a major construction project. Jeff said the question was simple: how much would it cost to build a small building in a small neighborhood? In other words: how much would the total cost of construction of a big box store be? And it was simple stuff.

But Jeff's question, with all of its unknowns was an easy request to answer. And while a number of local building firms tried to do their own back-of-the-envelope calculations they never quite hit the amount of construction that Jeff's question implied. They never came up with a cost answer that would compare apples to apples. It seemed that what they were looking at was the total cost of a small construction project in a small, middle-class neighborhood. No wonder they seemed to be getting it all wrong.

Then, on one rainy day in 1979, Jeff woke up and asked himself the question he should have asked his contractor back in the 1970s. Jeff's question was something like this
