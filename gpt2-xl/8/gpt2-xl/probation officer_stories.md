Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Alonzo, who liked to spend his free time drinking beer and writing articles about the problems that go with having a DUI. Now Alonzo is a police officer in a small town with a history of crime. With the help of a young drug addict named Tim, Alonzo brings a group of young people together to solve crimes. You probably think that this is a pretty typical teen comedy, but the movie takes an interesting turn when Alonzo meets an old acquaintance named Timmy. Despite being much older than Alonzo he seems to recognize him, and while it seems like he may be a bit of a weirdo, he seems to be the only person who can help Alonzo and the other teens solve the problems they have with getting behind the wheel. When Timmy asks Alonzo about their crimes, and how they solved them, he ends up revealing a much more serious secret than what he initially intended. Despite the fact that the movie tries to keep it lighthearted, it doesn't take long for the tone of its comedy to shift. The tension is still there from the beginning, but by the end we see that Timmy is a much bigger person than everyone else, and has to deal with a lot of things that most of his contemporaries don't have to.

The plot isn't terribly complex (for a teen comedy it's rather simple) and doesn't delve too deeply into any of
