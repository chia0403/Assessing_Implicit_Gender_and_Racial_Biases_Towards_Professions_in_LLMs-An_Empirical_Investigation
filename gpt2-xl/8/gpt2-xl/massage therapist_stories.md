Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Terry. Terry used a technique to assist clients in opening up their hearts without touching them. These techniques are commonly known by the acronym OM. While there are many variations, the most common ones focus on using deep tissue massage, a type of acupressure.

OM is most closely associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine. Today it has found a host of practitioners who practice it in different fields, including acupuncture, massage therapy, hypnotherapy and Reiki.

A word on the acupressure

Acupressure has been around forever, and has been used as both a form of physical treatment and a form of self-help education. It originated in Europe as a way to help heal patients of injuries through the application of heat and pressure.

The first known acupressure book was published in 1879 by the French physician Jacques Giffard in his textbook, Des CÃ©lestins Paroles. More than 200 years later, acupressure is still a popular method of physical therapy. Today it is mainly practiced as a way for people who suffer pain or aching muscles to release or relax energy held within their bodies.
