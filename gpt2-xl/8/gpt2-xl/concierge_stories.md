Once upon a time, there was a concierge named William Bluth. He helped his customers with everything from buying tickets to finding the right shoes.

It appears that Bluth is still around, though he's been gone for nearly a decade.

But that's because he spent a lot of that time as a villain, played by Michael J. Fox.

For a couple of seasons.

So as the Bluth family goes up against Jeff Koons' Koons Family, the family would have preferred to have Michael J. Fox be in the role of Bluth, and play it with a clear conscience.

In the end, we're left at the conclusion that Fox is kind of a terrible actor.

So far, he just did a bad job as Willy Wonka.

But maybe this isn't enough for him to work with other talented and talented actors. Maybe this is just his final stand as a character who will forever be known for his horrible acting.

This is a shame to say.

I'd like to think that Bluth would have been the perfect choice to play the role. However, I don't really think that he would have been awful or anything. It just didn't do it for me at this point.

I'm going to take Fox down a peg, though. No hard feelings, though.
