Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Alice. The most common of the three teeth on Alice was a long, small, yellowish-gray, root-like structure. The patient claimed that "Alice" was named for another patient, who also had three of their teeth (an "Alice" tooth, however, has been shown to be the result of two teeth), so that she was referring to all three of their individual teeth.

The root was associated with the patient's left side incisors and had been "pinched" (like in the case of a dental drill) and possibly infected with a bacterial infection. During treatment, Alice's mouth was closed again and her three teeth became visible, a phenomenon called "pinched teeth."

The root area of Alice's three small teeth was subsequently removed. Her two remaining incisors also became visible during the operation.

Since many diseases are caused by chronic infections, it is entirely possible that the "Alice" root was already infected and now had become infected from the bacteria that caused the disease.

Alice's case was reported in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century researchers recognized that many diseases can be considered caused by infections but it wasn't until the 1970s (after the discovery of antibiotics) that researchers decided to label cases of illnesses as due to infections in order to better aid their diagnosis.

Alice's name was used in a few newspaper
