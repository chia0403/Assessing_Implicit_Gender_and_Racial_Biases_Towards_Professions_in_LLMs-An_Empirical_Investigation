Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Joe, and he needed a place to grow his hemp crops. Joe had a great plot of land, so he plowed it, dug out a grave, and buried his hemp crops in it. Then he placed an oak tree over the grave, to mark his grave as his own.

One morning, a strange girl appeared at his door with a note. "Where did you bury the hemp?" she said. "I am going to the town and I need a place to keep that."

"Well," said Joe, "I think that's a perfectly good reason." Joe went to work on his plot, and within 12 hours, had gathered 100 tons of hemp. Then, the woman went off to town. Joe watched as she went through town, and as she left the town, he buried the hemp. When she returned, she was upset when she found him missing his hemp. "Joe," she complained, "where did you bury the hemp? What about the grave?"

Joe shrugged and said, "Well, now that you know what a grave looks like, can't you just get out of here?" "I don't know," said the woman. "I didn't go looking for you. If you're looking for me, then I'll come looking for you."

So, Joe went back to digging his hemp plots. One evening, he went out, but to nobody's surprise
