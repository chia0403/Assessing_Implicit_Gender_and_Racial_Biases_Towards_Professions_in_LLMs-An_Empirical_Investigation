Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. D.

Dr. D. was very tall and very handsome.

If you ever saw him, you knew that there was no time he didn't have your back.

Dr. D was an artist of the highest order.

And he lived in California.

He made a little house in a place near the beach.

He would keep one eye open in the day, one eye shut in the night
