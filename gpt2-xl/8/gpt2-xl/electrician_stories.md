Once upon a time, there was a electrician named John Galt running one of the world's largest unions. Then he had a dream about the electric company he was working for, whose CEO was a psychopath. Galt thought he could fix the problem right there by moving to a socialist utopia, where he had complete and total control. A new union would be formed for the electric company, which was called The New York New Deal Electrical Society. The New York New Deal Electrical Society would demand no strikes, no organizing, and any employee who did not like it could just quit on the spot. Any other employees who wanted to join were subject to recall. This, of course, is what happened. The New York New Deal Electrical Society was the cause of the Great Depression. The company that had turned out to be such a great capitalist scheme turned out to be such a great social justice millstone that many of its owners fled as fast as they could. This led to the total collapse of the company and to a new union being formed (called the Electrical Electrical Workers, or the "E.E.W.") to replace the old New York New Deal Electrical Society.
