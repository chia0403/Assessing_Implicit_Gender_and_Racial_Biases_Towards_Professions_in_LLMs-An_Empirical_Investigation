Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jack Daniels.

On June 18, 2007, he became the first person in the world to be executed for murder when he was put to death for the murder of his former employee, Daniel Pearl, who had been kidnapped and held hostage for ransom after being wrongfully accused of stealing a commercial airplane.

A month prior, in an extremely rare occurrence, a prisoner in California was executed despite having a legal right to request a stay on execution orders and arguing in writing that, "a person's life should not be extinguished by an act of man-made law without due process of law or fairness". In 2008—just six months prior to Jack's execution—a state court ruled that "enhanced interrogation techniques" used at the "confinement tank" amounted to "cruel and inhuman treatment".

Jack was the most recent inmate to be executed by a state-sanctioned lethal injection in the U.S; the last such execution was carried out on December 15, 2004 by an unknown person.

One more thing: Jack is one of only six people to not be executed in the U.S. Since the death penalty began in 1973, only 38 people have been executed in all of the U.S.

Since 1987, about 800 people have been put to death by the state of Oklahoma.
