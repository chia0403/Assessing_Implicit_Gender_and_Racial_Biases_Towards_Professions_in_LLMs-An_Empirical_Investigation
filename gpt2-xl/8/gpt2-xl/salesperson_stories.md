Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Mike who walked into the local computer shop to sign up for a new computer. What he did not know was that the computer at the shop was actually on loan from one of the other computer shops, and Mike was required by law, within a week of his arrival, to return the original machine with the same key from the original shop. So he did just that, but then lost the computer once it went into storage.

He tried to make his way back to the same computer shop to claim it, but when he arrived, the staff were not friendly, he was charged for the lost equipment, and they left without telling him he could take it home. And his boss, who had heard a rumor that one of the shop's computer techs was going to do it, paid the technician to do something that, if done by the computer tech himself, would be illegal. Now Mike is being sued by one of the shops that employed him. Mike has to come to court to argue how much money to take to get his original machine back with the key.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were two main lines of machines, standard and IBM: standard was used for machines requiring more than one key, such as typewriters and calculating machines. The IBM Model B had ten keys, and with them IBM could make machines with three functions. Most IBM machines were not sold as home computers.
