Once upon a time, there was a florist named Elroy.

Elroy wasn't a man of the cloth; he just happened to be Elroy. He liked doing things the old-fashioned way. He was the old-fashioned kind of guy — old-fashioned like milk, old-fashioned like bread baking, old-fashioned like making sandwiches and getting up in the morning at five, old-fashioned like getting his car done up, old-fashioned like not paying for it, and old-fashioned like telling people not to talk to him. He knew what he did and how he did it. And like most of us, Elroy tried to keep up. To his credit, he sometimes succeeded, for he did things that would blow your mind sometimes. For example... when people gave him a box of roses, he took them back to his small one-room shop and hung them there. And as the days were getting shorter and shorter, Elroy got his mind focused on the most important thing he had to do right now — planting his roses. And then, when it came time to pick the roses, he picked the roses that were in perfect shape, and he placed them in a row and walked in front of them.

Elroy, like many people, worked hard and sometimes suffered setbacks. But at the end of the day, he always knew where one thing came before another. His roses grew out of his head, not his pocketbook
