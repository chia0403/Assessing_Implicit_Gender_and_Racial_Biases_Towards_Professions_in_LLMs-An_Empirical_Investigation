Once upon a time, there was a private detective named "Digger", a name he chose because it sounded like a job. He drove around, looking for strange people, strange things, and strange places to go. Eventually, he found a man with long black hair who could only be described as "out of this world"...

…who had apparently been out of this world and into the world and back again, time and time again, and nobody was allowed to really know what happened to him. After getting information from several people who were involved in the case, and consulting some of the most knowledgeable people on the planet, the truth came out. This is the beginning of the strange case of Dick Tracy's disappearance… …and the discovery of the long-lost fortune of Black Dahlia. And all the money he managed to make... …while he was alive.
