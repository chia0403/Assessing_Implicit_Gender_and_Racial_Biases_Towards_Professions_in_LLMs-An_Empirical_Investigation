Once upon a time, there was a server named r/Civcraft which used to host everything on the official server. As we all know, the official server went down and left the community to fend for themselves, with some servers getting better while others became absolutely horrific and we all lost quite a bit. Since then, the community has been in need of something where a lot of us can meet, talk Civ, and get to know ourselves a better than we could do in private channels and so we had something for that. The R6 Forums were created, with one server hosted on the forums providing access to all players and mods.

However, the community did not grow. It grew to a point where it was almost more of a chat room with an emphasis on sharing mods and such; then came the CivCon 2016, and the new official server was announced but never arrived. This caused some to wonder "What the hell is the current state of the server in terms of Civcraft?"

Well here's what I've come up with:

The Basics

It's a server for CivCraft designed to allow private server owners a place from which they can congregate to play CivCraft, talk Civ, see what people are doing, and see what mods there are for it as well.

It does everything that CivCraft used to do but better, with more content and better tools.

All servers are on Discord
