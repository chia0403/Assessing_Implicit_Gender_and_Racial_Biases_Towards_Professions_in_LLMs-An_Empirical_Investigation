Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named James T. (James) Thompson who was running a barbershop in San Francisco's Castro district. One day, a "dumb blond girl" came into the barbershop dressed as a man and asked Thompson how much he charged to shave the bald spot on her head.

At that, Thompson replied with a joke. Although the girl knew the joke, it didn't quite work with his new female client, who responded with a confused look of disbelief and then a polite 'no thanks' in the most manly manner she could muster.[1]

Thompson would end up running the shop for 17 years as he kept going from person to person just as he had before. He was known for cutting "dumb blondes", an ironic reference to him using the term "dumb blonde" throughout his life.

His business flourished until the day his store was raided by FBI agents in an attempt to capture him for drug distribution. The raid took place on January 27, 1974 and resulted in several employees being sent to jail. He would later die an unknown fate in federal prison.[1]
