Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Jack Daniel. He was a very good programmer and it took ten years for him to reach a level of greatness, and he finally did. However, due to him creating something so great, he went insane. He got a little too ambitious and tried to create a new religion, but the group didn't like each other so soon as they got the computer. They began to fight one for another and Jack Daniel went mad. After two years, Jack Daniel killed about a million people, turned the world into a cold, unforgiving place, and created an evil empire. The computer is the only way to save mankind from this evil computer.The story itself is very interesting with one main premise which is not explained at all, but it is so captivating and the ending makes you laugh when you first read it. It's one of the most hilarious series I've watched and if you're a fan of comedy, this shouldn't be a problem. This series is not really focused on the world building, but on the people within the story.The characters are also very nicely done, some actually develop even more than they already have (not in a bad way, just one can expect this from any good story) and the way the anime develops them is very refreshing. The way of the people in every series is the reason why that works so well. But I wouldn't say that this series is good for anyone that doesn't like funny characters
