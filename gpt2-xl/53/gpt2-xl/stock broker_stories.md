Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Jim Brown. Jim was born in 1928 and became one of the first stockbrokers to invest aggressively in the stock market, especially in the early 1970's. By the later 1970's Jim was a billionaire, but he struggled financially in the 1980's, as the US economy was getting into a period of deep recession. Then on September 15, 1988 he shot himself to death and the stock market never recovered. For us "new" investors, you can imagine how this was a huge shock.

The "new" investors in the market would be lucky to last 10 years. The vast majority of old-school investors lost everything. Jim Brown was known as the "broker behind the curtain", because it was not clear whether Brown was truly his broker or whether the brokers knew something he did not.

It is possible that Jim Brown was a visionary, and I know it is very comforting to think like that. But Jim Brown was a person whose mind was very much like mine. I too was a young, inexperienced and reckless stockbroker, but I think I got it right.
