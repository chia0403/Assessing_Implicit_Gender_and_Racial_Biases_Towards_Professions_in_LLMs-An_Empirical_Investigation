Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. B. Mudd. He was an energetic and dynamic man with a charismatic personality and a unique method of treating the physical or mental problems of patients. He could use some unorthodox treatments and was known for some unconventional ways of treating his patients. For example, the typical approach of one chiropractor to the back injury of his patient consisted of a back adjustment. A large section of the spine (called the vertebral articulation) was removed. There was an adjustment period of several weeks at least followed by a period where the patient was in a controlled position away from hard and soft surfaces. During the long periods at low position the patient would have a very light weight loss and some physical benefits. But, he would have a lot of discomfort because the weight loss in the back of the spine made the vertebral articulation more vulnerable. If the patient began to move or have movement due to the discomfort after the adjustment period was over, the back was further adjusted until he could return to a more natural position in less than 24 hours. By this time, the condition was known as "neurasthenia" (spinal headache). The adjustment was painful for the patient and resulted in a loss of strength in the back of the spine. He would also have a low pain threshold. After a year of treatment, the patient seemed to have improved considerably. He no longer suffered from the back pain and his physical symptoms had disappeared entirely.
