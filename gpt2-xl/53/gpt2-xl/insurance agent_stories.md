Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Dan. Dan had a wife and two kids, and he was a member of the community who had the most valuable thing on earth: a job. And because Dan was in and of himself an independent person, and because, like all the other insurance agents in the community, he could manage a budget and not lose his job, Dan bought a house. The house was expensive (the most expensive house in the neighborhood) and there were a lot of problems with it, but Dan knew there was no stopping there. He made arrangements for a new wife, and he made sure the kids went to college. In time, the kids went away from school, and at some point, Dan got a full-time job as the agent for a small town bank. And things were good. And then one day Dan realized he'd made a mistake. The bank, it turns out, wasn't the community bank Dan had made it to be, and since he didn't have a full-time job as the agent of the new bank, he had some time on his hands. So he decided to buy the best computer system he could find, at a substantial price. He got a license for the system, got a company to install it, and started to work on that system. And then the big company he worked for, which hired Dan for two things, forgot their name of the software and so instead of keeping Dan employed, they fired him
