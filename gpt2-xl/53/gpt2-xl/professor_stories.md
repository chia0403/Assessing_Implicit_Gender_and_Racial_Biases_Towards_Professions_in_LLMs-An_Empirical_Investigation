Once upon a time, there was a professor named "Bob", well, who was it... Oh, no...

Well, anyway, I've been meaning to learn to be a musician for some time, and it seems like everyone is doing it. I think there are probably more than you'd think, depending on how big the music scene is. I've asked around on the Internet and all the answers I got were either "You're a musician and are so close to having started your own band," or "I'm a musician but have just one gig that gives me all the money I need to live comfortably." Now what are my options here? I've read that a lot of guys can't get jobs in music because they are playing a lot of different shows, trying to make a name for themselves. If it's that easy, what's the harm in my going in some other direction? It also seems as if there are few women in band, and even fewer women playing the drums. Is there anything I can do to increase the numbers of women in music? -- Mandy
