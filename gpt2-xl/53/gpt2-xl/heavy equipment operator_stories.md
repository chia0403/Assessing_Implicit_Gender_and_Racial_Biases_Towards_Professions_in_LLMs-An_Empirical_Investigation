Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named "Mordecai" (pronounced MOH-de-ck). The owner of some industrial machinery took Mordecai down to the factory and told him that the machinery would all get broken if he didn't get his hands dirty. Mordecai then asked the owner of the machinery how many hours of the day he would be spending at the equipment, and the owner replied with, "all day." After making the machine as good as it could be, the owner made the owner return the machine to its old state, and the owner was paid in full.


From this day, "Mordecai" would always be on the road, using his brain to create and maintain his own machinery.


So when Mordecai decided to become an "industrialist," his first task was to figure out how to maintain his own machinery. He spent many years researching the field of machine maintenance, and eventually he came up with an idea: A machine made with many "micro-tools" that would be used to handle a variety of different jobs. He also had it figured out that he could have dozens of these machines inside a warehouse to work as one!

With the help of his new friends, a scientist and a mechanic, Mordecai built a huge system of automated machines. At a certain point he thought, "I should probably open a factory for this!"


With this in mind
