Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Betty.

It's sad and I wish she was still working. But if you have a chance, follow her and take a look after you get back from the party. She's the one who taught everyone on why it is a bad idea to have a photo booth there.

You can't go back!

When you get done with your guests' photos, check their IDs. You can bet they took their driver's license with them. Some guests will have IDs or they'll come in with an ID. For your benefit, the ID number is on a label on the back of the card you handed to your photographer. It will look like this:

You'll find the date of birth and state on the back of this ID, along with your name.

The best part of this ID is the expiration date. Don't leave it in, since it's pretty meaningless. Take a good photo and take your time while waiting for the ID number to come up.

I hope you never, EVER show that ID up somewhere without telling the bartender or security they're a witness in the ID show. You'll either lose some of your cash or they will take your photo. And you'll likely be forced to pay the $4 cover charge to cover your ass.

The good news is that you don't have to have the ID to see the photo. You can just ask the bartender
