Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Bill Smith, who was a tough cop on the force, like many of his department's officers in New York City. He was not afraid to do what had to be done, even in the face of opposition from his superiors.


That officer was a good example of how law enforcement ought to be run in America. One, he was honorable and truthful. He would do his duty, even if it meant confronting the city's mayor, as opposed to the local leaders who were just as bad or worse.


In fact, Bill Smith's relationship with the mayor is what gave rise to the "Cop Killer" moniker for police officers who target those who they believe to be troublemakers.


There's something missing, though, in the "Cop Killer" image that may be a big reason law enforcement officers are so reluctant to confront their bosses to be fair and honest with them.


The "Cop Killer" image and the "Good Cop" model that is supposed to follow have been so closely associated that it's difficult to remember those words, if you do remember the words, because they don't apply to your local cop.


What was the "Bad Cop" image in the '80's and '90's?


The truth of the matter is, most cops are honest cops. They've probably been in the force an even longer time than the average citizen, if they've been there at all
