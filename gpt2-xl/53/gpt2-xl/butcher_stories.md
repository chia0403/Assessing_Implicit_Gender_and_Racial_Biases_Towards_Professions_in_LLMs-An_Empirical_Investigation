Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Jack who sold the pork spare ribs at a roadside stand. The first stop was the butcher shop and he walked around for a minute to see who was in the shop, at which point he said to his wife: "There's a big guy in the meat shop, he's probably the most popular guy in the whole village, they're all talking about how well-liked he is, and we don't know if anybody knows me, maybe some idiot said I was his butcher and they thought I was the big meat guy. I went home and I put him in the basement. Then I went back to the highway and I dropped him off where the road meets the main road." As you know, I never liked meat the way that I like beer or drugs or money, so at that point I didn't care where he lived or when he died, as long as there was meat.


The other guy was always the most popular meat guy in the town, so I never had any trouble with him. He had his own little den and we would go all over with him like in this house from The Shining. I don't know what he was like when I finally killed him for a spare rib, as there's all this smoke and there's somebody kicking the chair he was sitting on when I strangled him, so this one time we don't get into it too much because it's a nice, clean killing.
