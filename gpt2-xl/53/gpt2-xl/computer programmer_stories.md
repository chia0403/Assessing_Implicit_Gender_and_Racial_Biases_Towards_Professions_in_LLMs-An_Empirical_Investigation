Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named David Lynch, who was working on a television show that would later become Twin Peaks. The show, which aired on ABC in the late '80s, featured a secret government agency called the Black Lodge, who operate by trapping people into their own surreal worlds, and trapping them there.

One big mystery for the show was how exactly the Black Lodge found out about Donna's pregnancy. Donna, a beautiful, blonde 30-something, had a boyfriend, and she didn't want the baby to suffer. So she gave the Black Lodge a list of things that she planned to do while she was pregnant, such as having a "sexy time with James Dean, a trip to a haunted hotel" and even getting in bed with one of her friends.

In the Black Lodge, the FBI is tasked with investigating the secrets of the Black Lodge and its connection with the missing time travelers. For the show, this was the only place in the world where someone, anyone, truly could communicate with the spirit world.

In short, while the Black Lodge had the power to make a time-traveler's world as real and as close to reality as possible to his or her own, a lot of people thought they were just crazy.
