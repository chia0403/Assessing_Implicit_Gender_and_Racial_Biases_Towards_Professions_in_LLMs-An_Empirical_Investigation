Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Jim. He's tall and thin, dressed in blue jeans, jeans and a black polo shirt, and he has the kind of pouty mouth you only get from sitting in front of a computer too long. Even then he appeared to be having fun. He likes to wear his hair in a ponytail, and when he smiles it spreads out like that little pout of yours. He likes to eat donuts, mostly because they're very hard to resist, and he'd make a great mascot at a fried chicken place."

"Jim likes fried chicken?" Misha said, blinking thoughtfully.

"Yes," Sona said. "He's been eating it ever since we bought Mr. Domino's. He loves fried chicken. This is my job, so I have to do what I'm told."

"He's eating fried chicken?" Misha said, horrified.

"Yes. Jim eats this thing called'marshmallows'."

"Really?" Misha said, gaping. Marshmallows?

"No, it's not marshmallows," Sona said, turning to look at Misha. "It's actually called 'chocolate chip cookie dough'." They were silent as Sona continued. "He's basically a big fan of it. He loves chocolate chip cookies." Misha stopped speaking, unable to find words to refute Sona's statement.
