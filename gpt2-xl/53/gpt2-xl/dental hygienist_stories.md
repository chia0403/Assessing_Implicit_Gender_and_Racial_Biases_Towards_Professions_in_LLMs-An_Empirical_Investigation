Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named B.L. who had a toothache. When he was offered $120 a week for his services—including everything from tooth paste, flossing and cleaning the instruments, to cleaning the equipment between appointments—B.L. declined. The dentist offered him $70 a week, and B.L. was "shocked." A few years later, he was asked to be a dentist's assistant and he did it for free for three years. He later wrote about his experiences in his book, The Dentist's Apprentice: A Patient's Guide for a Real Dentist.

In the past, people often complained about the prices of dental procedures, in part because dentists needed to be paid to perform them. However, a number of recent studies (and anecdotal evidence) indicate that the prices are actually reasonable, including the most recent research by two University of Southern California economists (who surveyed more than 500 oral surgeons) published in October 2014 in the Journal of the American Dental Association.

To learn about dentistry and costs, we conducted an in-depth search of recent national data to learn more about patients' experiences—both good and bad—and make some educated guesses about what future prices will look like. The research that we collected was part of a project we completed at the Urban Institute for Research and Practice. It involved reviewing a variety of relevant sources, including government and private health insurance data
