Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Bob. One day he was saving a woman from a house fire, but he didn't realize he was in over his head because the flames were a shade of orange, not green. The other firefighters had to remind him repeatedly to stop saving people and help put out the fire. They reminded him enough, however, that they decided to name themselves the Firefighters Are Orange, in honor of him.

So when a fire truck is approaching a house that they believe has been heavily damaged from a fire, a homeowner can stop them and ask if they want to inspect the damage to be sure they don't have to stop the fire truck. This might even make them reconsider whether they want to let the fire truck through.

The Firefighters Are Orange fire department has the motto: "Never stop because it takes longer." They've been doing it for a generation now.
