Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Eliza. She was a bit like a friend of mine, if I was really into music and the occasional cocktail party with my ex-girlfriend's best friend and an internet friend. She was just as kind and beautiful and intelligent as she was crazy, and her passion for nails was a gift she gave me. Over the following years, she provided me with an endless supply of manicures, and as much help as someone as kind and generous as she could give.

Today, Eliza has retired from being manicurist to spend more time with her family, and I'm her successor as the "Gifts and Nails" columnist. I'm a little different, but I still care deeply about nail care as much as she does. I still hope this blog will get over 50,000 hits from the manicurists I'm inspired by, as well as a few more new people who aren't manicurists. But I won't stay up this late tonight, so let me just say this: Thank you for being Eliza!

So, without further ado, here are some new manicure tutorials from a few blogs and people I think are aces in the industry when it comes to nail-related stuff. And just like any good manicure, they can come in fun and edgy shades. Also, this is a good excuse to go ahead and take a look at the other nail polish colors
