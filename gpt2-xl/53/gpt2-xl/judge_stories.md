Once upon a time, there was a judge named Alpheus Jones. Jones was always the judge that always got the parties to settle things by the "whistle and whistle" (that's how you know it's the judge, I guess). His specialty? Sticking things in his robe. And now the old man is back! There's no doubt at all, that the people of Equestria now have a real judge. And who is, you say? Well, I'll tell you: The mighty Judge Alpheus Jones! A man of wisdom, skill, and compassion. If you want to resolve any disputes, or settle any disputes, you'll make sure you pay your respects to the Judge Alpheus Jones, come to Ponyville on a Wednesday, and hear the wisdom of the wise Judge Alpheus Jones!

- From the episode, "The Pony Who Would Be King".
