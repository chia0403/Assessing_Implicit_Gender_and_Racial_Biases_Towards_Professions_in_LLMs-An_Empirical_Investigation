Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Robert K. Schoenfield, and his father was a man from North Caron, Michigan. Robert was a good mechanic, but he never got to play all day, so he would be working outside the house. One day, while he was working with his sons, Robert felt that he needed to go hunting to make his life more comfortable. A bear then walked over to the carpenter and began to attack him with its paws. Robert threw the carpenter in the middle of the road before the bear could strike him and, after Robert put the carpenter to sleep, had the bear shot to death. When the police arrived, Robert went to them and said that his uncle John and a friend named Charlie had killed the bear and that it had just been lying in wait for him. The police agreed to Robert's story, and he was later exonerated.
