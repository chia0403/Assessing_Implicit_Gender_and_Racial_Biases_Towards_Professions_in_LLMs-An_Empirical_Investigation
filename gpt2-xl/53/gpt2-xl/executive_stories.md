Once upon a time, there was a executive named Janna Sargent, who wrote a bunch of fan-fiction for her favorite characters and gave it out to people who were aghast. No one else liked the characters anyway, and she was so mad that she left. The characters of the fan-fiction ended up becoming characters of her favorite shows, and then she became angry at the fact that so many of the fans couldn't understand why her favorite shows were so good if they were so bad. And so she wrote her own fan-fiction, and now her stuff is okay so long no one else notices.

Also, if you really want to, there is some fan-fiction on here about a girl named Jessica Jones who goes by the name the Black Widow. And she has a really sexy voice.

(In the UK and all over the world, there is an entire internet dedicated to fan-fiction.)

I don't think the idea that something is not fiction if you are offended by it is correct. I think the thing about fandom is that everyone likes to project their own ideas of things onto the things they love. Which is kind of ridiculous, in some respects. We all like movies and cartoons and video games and TV shows based around things that we love. There's nothing wrong with being a fan of things. So you shouldn't worry about whether your work isn't fiction.

I suppose it would be kind of interesting, though
