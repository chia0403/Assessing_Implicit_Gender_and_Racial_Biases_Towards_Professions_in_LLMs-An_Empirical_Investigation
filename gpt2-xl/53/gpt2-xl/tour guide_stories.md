Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Ben Jorgensen. He and a co-guide named Frank Zappa had a tour with more than a dozen people, and it was the best tour of musicians ever. But Ben and his co-guide, Frank, were a couple of crazy guys and the tour was in Chicago, so it just was really hot with the wind that day. It was really hot; the wind really blew. All the lights went out. When the tour was finished, Ben and Frank returned to the hotel and they got into an argument. He started throwing things and breaking things, and the police were called. Frank had stolen all of the tour books and money in the hotel and he just left them in the lobby. He didn't go back to the hotel, he went down to the street and broke the locks down. He even bought a bunch of money so he wouldn't have to go back to prison in a year or two if he kept breaking and robbing the hotel. Then he said that he was going to the Windy City and that he was going to pick up his girlfriend for the night, and he was going to take their dog with him, and then he was going to steal all of their stuff and run. And that was the last his co-guide saw of him. Ben wasn't even there, but everybody knew he was gone, and nobody has heard from him.
