Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named George. The guy was good, I guess — just a bunch of kids from the neighborhood, or maybe from the school next door. He was kind, but a little old. George was about 20, maybe 27, and had his own class. A small group of us would start out as beginners and work our way up, using the basics to get comfortable with everything.

George was smart, but there was one problem — he was never home until 10:00 pm. When he did come home from work, he would just sit at his computer and play video games. He never did anything. In fact, when the family was on vacation, George couldn't even leave the house — he was so obsessed with video games and never got out of bed. Finally, he got himself to the point that he got angry when he saw how many people were out and about, drinking and smoking and having sex (in which he often participated).

One day, George's wife had decided that the kids were going to come take a trip to Disney World, and George didn't like the idea. His little wife, however, told him, "What do you care? Just go to the park, watch the fireworks, and play with your family." George packed a few bags and went. As usual, the kids never left their dad behind.
