He added little shells that were one-quarter inch on top of each other, and he filled them with gravel. He then formed the outer shell of the pot. The inside shell, called the pectoral, he gave it one layer, about 1 1‚ÅÑ 2 inches thick, and he covered that with more gravel. The only two areas to receive air were at the top and bottom. Then he put the pot in the water, for about two hours, at least. Finally, when the lobster was cooked, he put it in the pot, which was then cooled. He sliced the lobster meat on the inside, and the lobster was eaten.
