Once upon a time, there was a server named "Sterndale".

It was a server in the early days of the world. With all the new technology and stuff, server admins had to have lots of admin/server account access and it made life difficult. In the beginning of server's life, it was not a problem. However, eventually it got to be a burden. In the server, the admins could just give any request to one of the players by a username. But during the course of time, the load on the server doubled and then tripled. Many admins got tired of it and they stopped giving access by username, until it was so difficult that the admin, who had to make these permissions, started giving only via a password. As a result, an admin had to come up with a system to make sure that the server worked reliably. As a result, there was this username/password combo that was necessary to access the server.


Sterndale, a server that had been around for ages.

Nowadays, there are still servers named "Reklik" and "Sterndale". But, it should be noted here that when we make changes to these servers or do maintenance, we will make sure that our changes or maintenance will be released to all three of our original servers. We have more than enough users and staff to support these servers and to keep them working reliably. This way of releasing maintenance will hopefully keep us
