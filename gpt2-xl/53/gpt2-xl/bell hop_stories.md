Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named "The Hijacker", who would randomly change the game's rules, and force players to think outside, of, the box for extended periods, even to the point of cheating. His rules included:

1. No more than three players allowed (with two exceptions as above, see below).

2. Only one ball allowed.

3. No ball being brought to the playing area from anywhere else.

4. No rolling or touching of a ball.

5. No cheating.

6. No breaking the rules, and no stopping a ball.

7. Players can have up to three balls; players with more balls may request a new ball.

8. No more than fifteen minutes between points; five minutes before changeover.

He was a great and popular hero of the New Zealand game scene.

The only way in, or out, was by turning the knob - a knob covered with small red knobs. The knob was located on the table in front of the ball, and it was pressed down with heavy pressure. If it was pressed by one end, it turned - if it was pushed at the other, it came out - and no longer pressed - and the ball left...

The ball would fly high and fast, and then land heavily. From that point on, players would attempt to follow the trajectory of the ball, or else
