Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Karen Reeder. Now she is in hiding — not because anyone believes she was the victim of a serial killer, but because the FBI believes she's been the victim of extortion. It was a very small claim with a very large payoff." For the agents, Reeder is a very good informant.

That's because Reeder — and her attorneys — have provided a list of witnesses, including those who saw the dead woman being carried out of the crime scene. "In this case, the informant said the female suspect in question had an unusually small vagina," says one of the prosecutors and the lead FBI agent in the case. "That's an absolutely incredible claim."

But it may be true, Reeder's attorneys say. The FBI is still searching the area, and agents have located a witness that saw a very large-size, dark female suspect walking off the property in question. The witness, for her part, denies any knowledge of Reeder.
