Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Tim Lott who was commissioned by a big-time newspaper to shoot a large-scale mural on a large scale. To shoot the mural, he built a 3-D printer. The next day he sent the piece to a local computer guy who scanned it and rendered it into some sort of digital 3-D surface.

For those who aren't in the know, this process is commonly known as "3D printing." This is what Lott did: he took an image taken by a digital camera and then scanned the image into a 3-D machine which creates a photorealistic and virtual 3-D surface of the world. He then used a 3-D printer to put this digital surface to a photograph which he then sent to a computer guy and to a commercial 3-D printer.

This is what Lott printed in 2009 and it looks like this:

The 3D printer does much of the work, but Lott also built special equipment. The printer is able to print in a liquid resin, and to change the shape of each part, much like a 3-D printer can. Lott also built this equipment at the beginning of his career, but it was later added on. For the final piece, he used a large computer screen as the viewing platform for it and placed the pieces of the final work in a special box so that they could be sliced and diced in the computer.
