Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Gentry (that's right, gentry). Gentry and his son Jimmy attended a small girls' academy. Jimmy attended the elementary school with the most children as well. Gentry and Jimmy went to be friends when they were fifteen years old. After Jimmy left the academy, his parents divorced. His Dad is an alcoholic, and his Dad also cheated on his kids with several wives, and she says that if he hadn't divorced Jimmy's Mom she would have had a good chance at having a son with Jimmy, as she would have known what he really wanted in life. His Dad had the money to take them all to his home to live, so when they came home, he told them that they have to leave.

Jimmy stayed on the farm to finish his education and find a job. As a teenager, he made a living picking and cleaning potatoes. One day however, he was picked up by two men who were trying to steal the farmer's donkey cart. The men beat and dragged Jimmy onto the road. This man and his accomplice shot Jimmy in the stomach and left his body in the road. His heart stopped just above his ribcage, and the doctor later told Jimmy's Mom that no one could know whether he was alive or dead. Jimmy finally regained consciousness sometime in the early morning when he was dragged back to the house with a couple of people. There, they took him into the kitchen.
