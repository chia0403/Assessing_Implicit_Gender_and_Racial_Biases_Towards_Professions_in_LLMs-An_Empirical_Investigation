Once upon a time, there was a singer named "Penny Lee." After a stint in prison and a stint in an early version of rehab, she re-emerged after years of self-imposed exile. She has been on a long, very dark journey back into that music she loved... and back into herself.

A record of that journey comes to us via The Racks, the label of the musician's new record, called "Swinging With Penny Lee." Here are the songs and videos and the story behind the record, the singer, and why she's going back there.

From Penny Lee's Website:


Swinging With Penny Lee is dedicated to the lives of the many women who have had the pleasure of knowing me, the music I'm obsessed with, or anything that I want to do with life.
