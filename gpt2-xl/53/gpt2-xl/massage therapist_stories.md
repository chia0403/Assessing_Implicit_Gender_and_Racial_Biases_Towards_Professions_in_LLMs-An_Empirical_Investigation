Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Darya. Now she is not. So, a lot of people asked me why I couldn't write about the subject. But here is the deal, I didn't decide to call her Dr. Darya - I've decided to name her Dr. Darya. She is, after all, Darya. Now, I could write down "Darya" and the rest, but honestly, is that the most fun I will have writing about her? I'd rather be writing about the things I am passionate about.

So, here is the thing about Darya as I understand it: she was in a relationship with a man named Alex. And, for some inexplicable reason, Darya decided that Alex was nothing more than an easy date. She went on a date with him. They were going to go on one of those first date adventures, not because she needed the money, or the adventure, or the adventure for his company, she just decided she wanted to go on one of them. Anyway, their date, unfortunately, did not go so well. Alex got angry. He punched her in the face. And then he ran off.

At that point, my first issue with Darya is that she was drunk and therefore, I think this is fair. I can't tell what she was thinking at that point. Is she thinking that if she punched him, he would run outside for help? Not likely
