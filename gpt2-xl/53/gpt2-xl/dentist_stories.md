Once upon a time, there was a dentist named David Reichenbach, who had a little shop called "Dentistry" in Las Vegas. David, as most Las Vegans know, was in fact also the son of a Jewish immigrant named David (aka "Reichen") Reichenbach.


In the middle of all this, as the story goes, the dentist's son fell in love with a beautiful, young woman in the medical division of the hospital. He took a long romantic walk around the city, and his love ended at her office -- the one on the top floor of the main building. He then promptly killed himself. As most Las Vegans know the last time some "funny" dentist walked into a place of work, it wasn't so funny.


This happened several years ago, but the legend has been around for quite some time. Las Vegas locals call it "the famous crazy dentist story," and it has been a popular Las Vegas tale in other stories that have been published elsewhere in the world. I'll leave it as is for now, but a similar story was the subject of a Las Vegas radio story about 10 years ago.


At the intersection of Flamingo Road and Henderson Highway is a place called the "Vegas Dentistry" Building -- a large, beautiful building with a red roof. The first floor has a lounge area and a bar, which I'm guessing was once an office for the dentist, but
