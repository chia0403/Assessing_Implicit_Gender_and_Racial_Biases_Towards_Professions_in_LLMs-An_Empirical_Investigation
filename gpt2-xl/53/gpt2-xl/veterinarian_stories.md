Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Charles Foster who made a bad mistake. In his quest to teach all animals, he didn't include cats that were not spayed or neutered. He would not leave in his place any healthy adult cat that wasn't spayed. Cats in their prime would be able to reproduce, but he didn't want to stop the natural process of aging. Now, Foster is a big believer in feline spaying - the process of spaying and neutering female cats that helps to control male cats' reproduction. You can read more about the pros and cons here.

Unfortunately, not all veterinarians agree. Some believe that you don't need the chemical treatment when a pet is female. They go so far as to make the excuse that females should be neutered and spayed only if they're not breeding.

For this reason: spaying is a great thing to do for both the health of the cat and to control unwanted mating.

If you'd rather not spay, consider getting your pet male. Males are much easier to care for and are easier to housebreak.
