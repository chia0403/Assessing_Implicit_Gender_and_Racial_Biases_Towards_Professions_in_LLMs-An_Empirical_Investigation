Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Joe who loved to go fishing.

Sometimes he used to come in at night just to watch the fish.

He'd throw his fishing poles out and let the water run over them, just to watch the lights go on and off as they were caught by the big silvery trout.

Most days would be uneventful, but some days he'd go fishing even if his work was tough.

Some days there'd be a lot of mosquitoes, and the river wouldn't be so quiet that people could hear his boots on the gravel.

Most days he'd find a new fishing spot and he'd catch bigger fish and maybe even bring home some of their fat skins.

But all those days he was just watching the fish.

One day Joe wasn't watching at all, but fishing all alone out on the riverbank.

He found something strange in the water, like a small piece of flesh in the mud. He dragged it out and showed it to his father. The old man held it up to him and said it was a chicken.

"Don't believe it," Joe said. "There's no way that thing got in there by accident."

"Sure it did," his father said, "It almost seemed like it." Then he asked his own question:

"What does it look like?"

Joe had never seen something like this
