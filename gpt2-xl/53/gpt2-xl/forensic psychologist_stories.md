Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Dr. John W. White. He was on vacation and thought this was an appropriate, though highly odd, activity to do while away from his desk. He took the time to look in on a serial killer, a man named Vincent Bugliosi, who is one of the leading authorities on the case.

A few months and thousands of dollars later, this man had written a book about him. It's a classic and remains highly recommended.

We still have Dr. White.

But now, we can add another addition to the growing list of people who know him well: his cohost, David Cassidy.

It all came to a head this week on "The First 100 Days," Cassidy's program on Fox News.

In that segment with White and Megyn Kelly, "The First 100 Days" showed us, among other things, White's love for the man most responsible for changing his life for the worse.

White's own self-described obsession with Bugliosi is so significant, it would make for a fascinating segment on "Oddly Normal." (You know, if the people in the room were not talking about the Kardashians.)

(By the way, he's not a sociopath like the Kardashian-esque Mr. White. He's a man of great substance who worked in medical school and medicine for years before finding his calling with murder cases
