Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Jody Kaczmarek. His job was to enforce parole and supervise ex-cons before they went onto the new, harsher penal system. (He could do this because he could use the prison computer, which had real-time updates of the parolees' activities on their microchips, and he knew their locations at all times.) Once it was established that Kaczmarek was working at his own desk, the parole officer became a target for an arsonist who lit the office on fire, burned the evidence, and sent him packing. When Kaczmarek finally got to his desk, there was nothing of interest on it. His computer crashed. He had run out of space on the hard drives. He checked in via telephone. No answer.

His new partner, a younger man named Steve, was already on duty when it was discovered that Kaczmarek had been locked in his office by a violent inmate. He came to the rescue, and the fire was put out before it spread to the building. At the time, Kaczmarek was the supervisor of over 250 prisoners. He spent the rest of his term inside.

Steve was an idealistic young man, eager to change the system of mass incarceration. He was also a lot like himâ€”young, idealistic, angry that the system was failing. Kaczmarek's death was a watershed
