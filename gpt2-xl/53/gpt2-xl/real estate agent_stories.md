Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Frank Rizzo. In addition to a successful career of real estate and real estate loans, Frank's main love was his pets. He had a pet store in his back yard, and a pet shop in his office. His pets included a cat named Miss Kitty, and a dog named Rizzo. When Frank was forced to retire early from his job, Frank bought a real estate property in Chicago with the money they had made. The property was a rundown house where the two-bedroom had fallen apart. They had no tenants, but all of the money they had made from real estate kept their expenses low. But they still had too much debt to be able to move into a home that might work for them when they retired. They turned to Frank to help them out. At first, Frank had his fees waived, and a percentage was left over. Frank then offered to help Frank, Sam and the cats as his personal assistants. But Frank's real dream with his "assistance" to Frank was that the cats and the dogs would make off the property in a few months. Frank's pets were more successful than Frank. The "assistance" ended after six months. "The cats and the dogs managed to make themselves at home (without help from the assistants)," he said. "My advice to Frank is to never do that again."
