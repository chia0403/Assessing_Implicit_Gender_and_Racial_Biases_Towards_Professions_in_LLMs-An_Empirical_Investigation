Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Dave B. Walker. There was the trip, from Los Angeles to the Twin Cities to visit his girlfriend and to work as a host for a reality show. And there was a night he wasn't supposed to tell anyone.

"We're going to see the city," he said, trying to get a little help in the pronunciation of a town that has only been mentioned a handful of times in his life.

"I'm just going to tell you again that, in my personal opinion, it's a great place," Mike's sister, Trudy, said. "I had an unbelievable time and it's beautiful."

The two men, both in their mid-50s, have become unlikely business partners.

Dave is a real estate agent; Trudy, a photographer. And for the past nine months, the family has been documenting the Twin Cities experience for a reality show called "Living the Dream."

All along, there was one question:

Why Dave B. Walker?

As in, "Who are you?"


That question has led the brothers, who started dating in college, to meet through the show and to spend countless evenings of fun with each other over their shared affinity for travel and the outdoors.
