Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Jenny. Jenny was a brilliant, gorgeous, good-looking, successful woman with no money. It was easy. She did this thing for a living. She had her dream job in a big city in the Middle East, and she worked with people from different backgrounds to make it work.

A man showed up at her hotel room, and Jenny gave him something to drink. She thought she was a little too forward for him, but he took the offer nonetheless. Maybe she liked the boldness. Maybe she thought it was a sign that he wanted to be with her. Maybe she was a little drunk. Maybe it got to her. Or maybe she was in love with him, and she's got that fancy job in the Middle East, and you'll never catch her by herself.

He didn't care, either. And once the drinks were through, they had sex. He told her he loved her, and they fell asleep together.

She woke up that next morning, and she had a nice body. "My body is beautiful," she said.

Then a guy from work showed up. He had a car. And he did not like women. And that was Jenny's job. She worked as a flight attendant. Jenny's job.

The guy couldn't believe he got a chance to sleep with a person who also worked in a flight attendant job.
