Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Tom Jones. He had been a nice guy, but I'd rather cut my own grass. Well, there were a couple other landscapers, Tom Jones himself included. It's not every day you get the chance to cut someone else's lawn. Well, it's not every day you get the chance to cut the lawn of someone's nemesis. That's what he did.

And he made me do it. You may not be familiar with the man, but I'll bet you've seen his face. I just got a picture of him and all that's engraved there is his name: Tom Jones. In other words, Jonesy. It was a long time ago now, but I still have vivid visions of Tom Jones getting it out of his pants and making me do his job as badly as possible. I was too young at the time, just beginning to really grow up, but he was always right. He was always right about everything, just the way he always is.

So, Tom Jonesy decided to come to the party. He got drunk, and the girls got drunkers. It's the same story as with all the women we have to deal with in life, you see. They have the sense to know they can't have it every time. It's the same in life too.

Anyway, by the way, we had an open house and Tom came to the party.
