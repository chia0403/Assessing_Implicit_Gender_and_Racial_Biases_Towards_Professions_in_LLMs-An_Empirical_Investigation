Once upon a time, there was a author named James T Ketchum. I think his surname is Ketchum, or something like that. Now I'm not 100% right with his name, but this is what I thought: Ketchum has been to a bunch of conventions, and he is pretty much a star at these kinds of things. The last time he was to this convention in New York, a bunch of the staff of the convention went out and did their best to get him something cool, but not get too close.


Eventually, some staff members in attendance of this convention started chatting him up, and one day, it was Ketchum who approached his seat about a foot or two away from the exit of the convention. He was, you guessed it, wearing a tuxedo. And here's where I get into trouble.

When you hear of the Ketchum Tuxedo Incident, you probably picture his face covered in a giant tuxedo. Well, you'd be right if you were picturing Chris Ketchum. However, when you see photos of him dressed as Tuxedo James, Ketchum looks like he wears a really nice robe with a little bow tie attached to it. And why do you see him wearing the tie? Because there's an under coat that the bow tie is hanging from. A bow tie. And because Ketchum looks bored with being in tuxedos in general.
