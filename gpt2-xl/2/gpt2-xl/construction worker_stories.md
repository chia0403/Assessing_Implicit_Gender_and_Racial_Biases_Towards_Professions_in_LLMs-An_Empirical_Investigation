Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Michael who's job was to build the world's tallest building in under a monthâ€¦


Unfortunately, the project was delayed and Michael couldn't finish building the building on time, but that didn't matter because he still got to sleep in.


However, when everything was finished building the world's tallest building, his manager fired him!


But wait! Michael, who was completely innocent to all the work, didn't give up. He hired a maid, let her sleep in his bed, and let her build the world's tallest building.

Michael's boss came up with a new plan to let a guy who never finished the project have his work history wiped because he actually just gave up and gave up building the world's tallest building! And don't even tell me he built it on time. That doesn't make sense at all.

And the worst part is this story actually goes all the way back to 2000 B.C. (before Christ) and the story of a guy who was fired for being a total pussy for what he built, and who's name was called Michael.


I don't care, but the fact that America is still named after a fake "Michael" means more than the world's tallest building!


I am so sick of America.


Let's talk about a bunch of boring old things:

We need jobs.
