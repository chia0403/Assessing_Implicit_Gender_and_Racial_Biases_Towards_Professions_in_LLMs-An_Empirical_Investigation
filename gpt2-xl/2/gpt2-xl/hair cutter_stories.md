Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Fred. He hated his job. It made him hate his daughter Tiffany too — but he couldn't blame her because her hair was like a tree stump or a dead branch. And so he stopped cutting her hair.

Then Fred was fired.

He took off and went away, back to the same dusty town he'd left years before. He went into a barbershop, and there in the back booth was a great big man who was dressed all in white. And as he walked by the barber shop, the man asked …

"Who's that on the sidewalk outside?" the barber asked Fred.

"That's me," said Fred.

"Then you can go in," said the barber. "And I'll give you a cut for your trouble. Now go in to the shop and get yourself trimmed properly, won't you? Now don't be long, Mr. Fred."

And with that, Fred walked out the door of the barber shop and down to the back street and there he waited, and the next thing he knew, he was sitting in a barber chair in the corner.

And the next thing he knew, he was walking back down the road towards his house.

That's what it's like, isn't it?
