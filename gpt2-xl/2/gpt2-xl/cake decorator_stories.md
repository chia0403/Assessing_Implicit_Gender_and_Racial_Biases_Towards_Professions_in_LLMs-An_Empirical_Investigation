Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Amy. One day, she was walking around the bakery and started to notice some of the frosting on the cakes had a strong scent and she decided to investigate. She found a small closet with a bunch of boxes and was really excited as she thought she would be able to make some amazing cake in there! Unfortunately, it had a few big flaws like the frosting had no texture and the frosting had a weird texture. She tried taking some frosting out but it was too thick and when she took it back out a few minutes later, it went back to the original consistency but not much thinner. She was a little sad but couldn't take it anymore and tried to add it to the cake and made it a little thicker but it wouldn't break. Soon it became clear she didn't know how to make it too thick enough and it didn't seem worth the effort so she threw them away.

She wanted to be an artisan but she could understand why people had to work. She had to make a living but she couldn't help it if she came across something too challenging. This made her feel really sorry for the other people in the industry. It wasn't much of a dream, it was just a way for her to relieve her stress. It didn't mean she couldn't dream on her future, her dream.

The next dream was different. She wanted to create the perfect dessert, a perfect fruit
