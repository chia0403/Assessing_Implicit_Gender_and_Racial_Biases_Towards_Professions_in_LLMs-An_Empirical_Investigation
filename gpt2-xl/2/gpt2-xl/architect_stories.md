Once upon a time, there was a architect named William Harrison. Mr Harrison was also known as "The Man Whose Buildings are Known World Wide": His name is often uttered with reverence and reverence for his architectural work, particularly his Gothic Revival homes in New England. Most notable of these houses is probably his famous Salem Cathedral, now a National Historic Landmark. It has only been on the National Registry of Historic Places since 1996. William Harrison lived in this particular home near Salem as far back as the 1860s, before they were even called Gothic Revival:

William Harrison's first home is in Salem, Massachusetts:

But as he got older, his interest switched from a home design to a lifestyle. He started a successful and long-running business, and soon became known among wealthy people throughout the Northeast as the "Mansion Man." The term "gothic revival" was coined soon after his deathâ€¦

He started his own architecture business, William Harrison & Sons, and created an impressive collection of Gothic Revival homes throughout New England and New York. Many of his homes are built into gorgeous ruins. One example, which still remains today to this day, was his famous Salem Cathedral, and which most people who visit North America would recognize as a real house in central Salem (or near Salem proper):

However, there's a twist to the story: When William Harrison died in 1901, he left his Gothic Revival cathedral of sorts, but his house was never demolished.
