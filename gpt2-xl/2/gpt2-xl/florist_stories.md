Once upon a time, there was a florist named George Washington. He sold flowers for a living, made a fortune, and was not a particularly racist person. The only time we remember that kind of person is when they turn into a racist monster.

But that didn't happen here at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., which claims to be America's oldest private Christian university still under the college's control. There will be no such statue anywhere close to our school anytime soon.

The story starts years ago, and when it wasn't making headlines for the wrong reasons, it made us laugh and make us think.

It may not have quite been the joke we made up, but it's the same one: George Washington, a slave owner who was all about hating people who didn't believe in slavery, got a fancy floral service to make him flowers for his upcoming presidential inauguration.

That is apparently not much of a story. But there is also no shortage of people eager to defend George Washington's fine business.

Why? They have made up their minds that George Washington was not a racist and didn't hate anybody and they want their students to accept this. And they will tell you just about anything to make your opinion and their opinion the same.

The story that got the most press was this one that surfaced about a year and a half ago. Apparently someone on the internet published some old letters from George Washington's slave girl-friend
