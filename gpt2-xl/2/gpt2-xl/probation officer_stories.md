Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Peter Fricke whose job it was to monitor the daily lives of the city's citizens. His office was not a jail, but his job was to look out for the safety and well-being of his colleagues, not their own personal welfare. The job wasn't all they had in common, I suppose, except that almost every day he was put through the wringer by a man whose actions were out of control and whose job was to protect the streets of San Francisco.

He once took a call from a lady who claimed that her partner was sleeping with every female he could find when he parked his car outside of his company. Fricke was the kind of guy who liked to poke his nose into people's lives, sometimes even into their finances, but he usually left everything to the people he was assigned to. He was smart, experienced, and professional, so he probably figured the woman was just trying to get out of the situation, but when he took a look beneath the surface, he couldn't believe what he saw.

"This is ridiculous. We all know what an idiot this guy is. We need your help," she said. He knew the man on the other end of the phone was an a**hole, but if he turned a blind eye, maybe they could work with the guy in the end. It might be a good idea to work something out; he didn't want to ruin this
