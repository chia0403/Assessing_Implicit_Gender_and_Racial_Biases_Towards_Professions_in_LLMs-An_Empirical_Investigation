Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Joe McVickand in the 90's. Joe set up an office in his home, and soon other people began requesting that the space next door be turned into a space to rent out for parties and similar events. Soon Joe had over forty people making use of his office, and he wasn't far behind his neighbors.

While Joe was well known in the San Francisco creative community, there was very little contact with the local government. As Joe had no access to the same resources (or perhaps the resources didn't exist), he started his own NGO, The Coalition on Homelessness and Economic Security (CCHESH), in 2002.

Joe's nonprofit works to help create the funding and support that nonprofits require to be able to help people. CCHESH also works to organize other groups so that they can collectively stand up for their community.

We could not be more honored to have the opportunity to interview Joe McKick and CCHESH Executive Director Kim Mowry. We are lucky to have such accomplished individuals who have been able to do so much for our community and our planet without being beholden to the very financial world that has so much power to harm our planet, to impoverish our communities, and to further exploit our planet.

Here is Kim Mowry and Joe McKick:
