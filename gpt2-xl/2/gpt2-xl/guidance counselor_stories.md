Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named "Mr. Smith." Now there were two. On the one hand was Mr. Smith: a charming, well-dressed man, with an earnest, gentle face, large eyes, and soft, honeyed voice.

I was in his office one day, and he told me that I must have God's help to remain faithful to my wife. He asked me to pray, and he told me that if I believed and repented that God might forgive and bless me. I agreed. Then he prayed of Jesus Christ for the same thing. I prayed it of God, and he asked me to ask Jesus, and I did, and when I did, God told me to keep my promise to my wife. I was not a very active prayer person then, but I was able to remember that promise. I asked God to give me His Spirit to feel His will, and I knew instantly that He would give me the Will. He said that for two years I would have to go on in my office, and do everything I was told to do. I did not ask if I should have a salary, or any of that junk, but whatever He told me to do would be my work and duty in the Lord's name. I was to remember I was my Master, and the Lord said I would do my work with all that is right in me, and that if there was anything I did which was not right
