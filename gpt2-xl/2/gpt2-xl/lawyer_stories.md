Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Bob. Bob's clients had included both "The Firm" and the government, and Bob's methods were not the stuff of legends. But on one fateful day, when Bob was still alive and well, he went into some long-delayed meeting with the head of the Department of Justice… who then took a page from Bob's own playbook. When he wasn't being a dick in court about the scope of work, he went on the record claiming that all the things that Bob complained about were actually OK!
