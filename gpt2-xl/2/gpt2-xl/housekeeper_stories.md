One day there came a little black girl in a black dress, who wanted to know who was the master of this house and his family. She was surprised to hear from them. "We are not the household maids who visit you," Mr. and Mrs. Sotra answered, "but our family, as you can see." "You say you serve us," she asked, "or you take orders to look after our house and furniture? That is very good, and how do you please us?" The old lady looked round the room and had no answer. "But will you come back?" "Come and see!" she cried, "if I did not want to talk!" And with this they took her up in the carriage and off they rode. When they came to the great stone bridge, Mr. Sotra, who had a great love for the white horses, told her to stand by the edge of the bridge and not to step onto the white horses until he told her to. The girl had no more difficulty in restraining herself than a woman would in stopping a young child from jumping on a child. "I am going to take my revenge on you, Dolly Sotra," said the little Irish servant, "for having abused and insulted me.
