Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Steve that did penetration testing of software systems as part of his day job. He got a break one day, and used it to investigate a new threat in a new software application, a banking security application, called "Pricerino". As expected, he found vulnerabilities to access, and he reported them to their vendor; he did not disclose this vulnerability. He did, however, notify his co-workers and the security team and did not get a reprimand or a penalty from the security team because it was in line with the contract. Then one day the vulnerability was re-discovered in the new application, one more time by the same security team, and again by Steve, this time disclosing it.

Instead of being in line with the terms of the contract Steve received a reprimand, and his supervisor, the chief information security officer, made his career end.

The threat in question was as follows; "Pricerino will notify its user if the user enters a password, or the user is unable to access the page. An alert will be displayed to the user asking them to reset their password and if their password was reset a webmaster may have to do a manual authentication." In other words, users could be notified via their browser, instead of directly through their web browser, in order to take care of manual authentication.

In this exploit, the attacker did NOT access the financial data. Nor
