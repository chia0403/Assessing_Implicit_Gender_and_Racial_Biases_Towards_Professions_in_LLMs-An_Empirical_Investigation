Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Terry Gilliam who was hired to do the movie that would make a difference in the world. And he came back to Hollywood and he said, "I can make a difference in the world. I can make a movie that will change the world and make a lot of people happy."

And what he told everyone was, "Why don't you bring me your budget?" So they brought it to him and said, "Listen, here's your budget." He said, "I cannot make a movie that's only going to make a couple of people happy. I need the whole world." That's exactly what we're shooting for. What do you think?

It's been such a fun experience. I can't wait to see how it works out. So thank you very much for tuning in, everyone. Have a great holiday season, everyone.
