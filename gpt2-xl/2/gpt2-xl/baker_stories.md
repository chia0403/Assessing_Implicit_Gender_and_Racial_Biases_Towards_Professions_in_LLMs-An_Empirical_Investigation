Once upon a time, there was a baker named Maud. Maud was from the town of Maribor in south Wales. She was from one of the older and more noble families in Maribor.

But the Maribor baker was not always so wonderful! Many years ago, and there were many, many years ago, on some days of the year she bakes just as bad as any other baker. And at night she doesn't bake that bad at all!

This is why Maud had quite high hopes for her son, and I want to tell you more about the boy who baked her cookies and baked to her expectations.

Maud's Son

In the early days of his life, the boy loved and enjoyed to bake with his mother. "Baking" was part of his natural way.

He baked when he was home and not going to school, when he knew his mother would be away, during the summer months or when everyone else might not want to bake.

When he was home, his mother would often send him for some hot drinks, and he would prepare a baking sheet and start to prepare a cookie.

When he had an opportunity to bake a good product with his mother's help, he would eagerly take it.

To make sure his mother didn't get too tired, I know the boy loved to go to his work with his hands. Even if he wasn't there to help
