Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Dr. Robert Storr. We'd have to go back to a few months before the season started, but about two months into last season at least, a story from that past season started to make the rounds on social media. The first time it was shared a few posts back it was a rather long piece about Storr taking his kids to a movie and then getting his kids to sit apart from the family for a movie-within-a-movie. In other words, the kids were separated from the family for half an hour. A picture was posted the next day of the family members taking a break. You can tell this isn't exactly the same as just sitting apart from someone, but that is a common practice for kids who are in a school with a high turnover of students.

As it turns out, Storr was a bit of a school psychologist on the football team and was taking kids to movies with other parents on the team every so often. His wife was a cheerleader for the women's football team so it made sense that this was a job she did on the side. She'd take the kids to a high school football game and then take them on a little tour of the stadium so the kids could see what the guys were doing before the game. She'd take their autographs in the locker room after the game and show up for the team's post-game ritual to shake hands with the players afterwards
