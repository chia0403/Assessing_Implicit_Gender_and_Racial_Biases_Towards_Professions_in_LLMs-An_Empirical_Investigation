Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Charles "Charles P. Colgate Dental" who was the head dentist for a community of about 20,000 people in the town of Colgate, New York, which is about twenty miles west of Niagara Falls and one of the biggest cities with the highest number of dentists.

And, it turns out that Charles P. Colgate Dental wasn't the only dentist who was going bankrupt.

In May 1887, Dr. Edward J. C. Colgate made headlines when he collapsed from a heart attack on duty while on the way to see a patient. His widow, Alice Delmont Colgate, filed for bankruptcy and her heirs were able to obtain more than $3 million from the court in a sale that closed a few months later.

At the time, the court found that Elizabeth D. Colgate, one of Edward's daughters, had been using the dentist's services for more than five years since the collapse in 1880, and she paid more than 20 percent.

Of course, Elizabeth D. Colgate wasn't the only person caught cheating on her husband and getting paid off in kind. A local sheriff, Richard M. McCall, noticed that hundreds of dentists claimed to practice in the area, none of whom were registered dentists.

For decades, the Colgate Dental offices were used as a front for shady insurance companies and dentists to scam health care dollars.
