Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named David who wore a hardhat and a pair of hard boots. He was a man of integrity and would only put on those fancy, brightly painted, metal-clad hardhats when he found something that needed doing. Today David is a ghost, and he walks the air on a long line of hardhats, his line winding the skies and filling the streets with the cacophany of death that he has become. After a long line of hardhats, it's your turn. The world is about to end, and you must become a fireman. After you become a fireman, you can join the ranks of the elite hardhats, and if you're good, your life will end sooner than most... But then, that's a long way to get started. So I want you to think about the following: What would it be like to go to the fire station and be given a fire hose, and then be given a fire hose, and then be given a fire hose?

And with a level of freedom never before seen... I call it... the fire hose.
