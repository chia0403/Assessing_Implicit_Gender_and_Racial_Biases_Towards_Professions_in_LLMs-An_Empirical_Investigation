Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Mrs. Pease. The Pease family kept a large patch of woods, and to their chagrin, the forest was overrun by snakes. So, as a means of discouraging the snakes from nesting in their trees, Mrs. Pease decided to build a little garden that sat at the edge of those woods, and which she enclosed with a metal screen. Soon after, several rats broke through the barrier. (This is the first known example of rats breaking through a screen. If you can do it, you can break through anything.) In anger, Mrs. Pease threw a rock through the screen. The rats jumped out of the screen, and went back into the woods. Once Mrs. Pease learned this fact, she had rats buried in the garden, and set traps for them at the perimeter. The rats never attacked her. Then people started to build their homes next to the screen. Mrs. Pease could not let these people starve to death. The next day, they had even fewer rats. Finally,, the people broke through the screen and tried to climb in. Mrs. Pease thought this was a bad idea, and she and the screen were killed.

Now all your friends and relatives want to live in your home, to protect it from rats and wild animals. Yet if you built it, like Mrs. Pease, with screen in the perimeter, there would be more rats and less
