Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named, "Emergency Medical Dispatch." It was the first emergency medical service of its kind in the world and it was so successful that it became the standard for other emergency services. But, it was originally based on a single physician and his entire hospital staff. Today, emergency medical care has become so sophisticated that hospitals across the nation are now equipped to respond to medical emergencies and emergencies of any type anywhere in the country. But there are still areas where a phone call from any one of the world's top emergency medical professionals could mean the difference between life and death.
