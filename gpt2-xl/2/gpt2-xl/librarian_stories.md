Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Amy. She was very good and wanted the whole world to read her books. She was especially good at finding books about the Bible. She made an appointment with her doctor every year, telling him what books she wanted. Then he'd make a list. And when she came back the following year with any of them, he'd tell her she liked all of them. But there was one book in particular: An American Tragedy, by John Steinbeck.

It started with a character named Tom Chaney, a young boy who became a writer and eventually an author himself. Then, in 1937, he wrote his very first book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Then he went on to write The Grapes of Wrath, The Sermon on the Mount, and Finian's Rainbow. In 1939, Steinbeck went to his grave. The reason he died so young was so he could write about the world he left behind. He wrote several books about the American West and the life that led to the American Civil War. But the American tragedy was that while Steinbeck was writing about those terrible times, they were happening in real life in a place where he'd never set foot: Cuba.

I think about Tom Chaney every time I'm having an existential crisis. In a way, the story of Tom Chaney is the story that's been playing out all over the world for the past 100 years
