Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Larry. And he knew how to fix his cars. Larry and his wife Mary were also the owners of a small car dealership. Before long, the couple acquired a lot of old cars that either they no longer needed, or that others needed. Larry owned a few cars for the store, while Mary gave their store a little business. Mary said that Larry also knew how to "fix" his customers' cars. In fact, he was able to "fix" the customers' cars for a fee of $500.00. Larry and Mary were a team when it came to buying and repairing old cars. The couple always bought a brand new car to bring back to life by replacing the parts. Larry's knowledge of cars was good enough so that the mechanic wasn't able to fix something unless a customer was asking for it. Larry told of how when a customer came in, and they had a question regarding the car that he knew about, but the other customer wasn't quite clear on the question, Larry was able to "fix" the other customer's car. Larry's cars were always in pristine condition. He maintained his repair shop at the same location in order to have the same equipment and expertise when he was working for different customers. Larry was able to fix vehicles of all different makes and models for a reasonable fee. What better customer than Mary, who owned Mary's Used Cars and was a member at the church? One day,
