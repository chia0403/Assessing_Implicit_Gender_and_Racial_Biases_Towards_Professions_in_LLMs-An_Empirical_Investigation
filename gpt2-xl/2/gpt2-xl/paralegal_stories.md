Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Diane. She was a sweet girl, and she was good at her job. As far as Diane was concerned, her firm was doing very well and she loved what she did.

But she hated what she did almost as much as she hated working there.

"They're jerks," Diane said to herself. "They're jerks, and I don't like jerks. I don't trust people who give me stupid work. I don't need to see their stupid faces when I work. I hate it."

After a period of deep reflection, Diane resolved to do something to change the situation at her office.

"Darling," she said aloud to no one, "I've had enough. I'm going to quit. And I'm going to do it tomorrow."

She'd known about quitting long before she tried it. She'd always planned to drop out before it became necessary. But now she did. And she did it because she had nothing to lose. What could she lose?

For awhile after she quit, she became extremely sad. What had Diane been? A sweet girl? A good person? To her, she'd always been exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Now everything had changed. Now she was just another office drone, working alongside an assortment of jerks with no regard for her feelings. She couldn't take that any more.
