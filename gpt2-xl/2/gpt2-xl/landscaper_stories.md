Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Jack, who's name, of course, is spelled with a J. It was such a common spelling at some point that nobody ever wondered whether Jack in fact meant "Jack of the Johns" (or the John John song) or just just "Jack," and everybody adopted the J spelling. It was not until recently, after Jack was dead by two years, that the first newspaper and most dictionaries began to refer to him as Jack, even though almost everyone, from his great-grandson, up to his daughter and his friend, still refers to him as "Jack." (It's been more than two years now, so I can't really say, with any certainty.) In other words, the "thing" is the verb; the "subject" is the noun. As in this sentence:

Jack started to make a garden out of the junk he'd piled up in the backyard.

This sentence has been understood by speakers of English since at least the 14th century, as was the one below. I never considered it a mistake before, and until recently I thought it was a perfectly good word to use in English:

"What's your name?"

but I came to realize that in this case, it was not one.

[You may note that these examples are actually quite old, from the 19th century, and I've tried to preserve them for posterity, even
