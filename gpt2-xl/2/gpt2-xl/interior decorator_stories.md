Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Barbara Smith. She was a big part of the beauty scene in Manhattan, and it's probably not too surprising that at one point, Barbara Smith owned her own business.

And it turns out that her son is the one behind the iconic "Barbara the Great" sign and all the other signage at Barbara Smith Designs. The name Barbara Smith Designs dates back to the 1800s, but apparently was actually named after Barbara a bit earlier, too. Barbara, like so many beauties, was the daughter of a real estate mogul.

Now, you might be wondering why Barbara Smith Designs would be named after one of the greats in beauty in this day and age. Well, it turns out Barbara Smith had a lot of influence on style and design. Barbara's mother, Maria Smith, made it big in New York in the 1920s, and the success of the Smiths was in large part due to their ability to attract big-name clients. Maria Smith was one of the most talented interior designers of her generation. She left behind her own "famous" namesake, a home that would be home to many famous people over the years, including Grace Kelly, Barbara Stanwyck, and even Barbara Ann Williams.

When Barbara Ann Williams was starting out as a model, she was shown to a young beauty named Barbara Smith. Not much is known
