Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Sam.

In the early days of the ATC, everyone wanted to fly. It would give them a chance to grow and learn, test themselves and their aircraft on a national scale.

To have that opportunity, pilots had to prove that they were capable. They had to fly like they were in the military, to be up to the challenge with the help of their family, friends and the community.

A new generation is here, ready to take that next step, and help the world of aviation.

Now it's up to you.
