Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named H.M. Sanger, who made a remarkable discovery in his years of study. Sanger discovered a genetic defect in the white blood cells responsible for white blood diseases like sickle-cell anemia, as well as cancers like breast, prostate and melanoma.

His discovery was the same as what millions of other men in the world have been experiencing ever since: that their sex organs don't seem to match their genetic coding.

In the case of Sanger's discovery, some women of low-risk to pregnancy and childbirth may never be able to conceive, not because they didn't want to, but because they don't have the same blood types his experiment determined in everyone.

But that could be about to change.

In 2015, Sanger's nephew John Yiamouyiannis, now 41, discovered a second genetic defect that may turn out to make a woman sterile.

Yiamouyiannis also found a gene that, if mutated in all of humanity, could potentially stop a sperm or egg from bonding.

"There could be an awful lot of families like mine in the future," said Yiamouyiannis on the phone with Yahoo Health.

John Yiamouyiannis, shown above in 2011 with his parents, was not the first to discover a genetic defect. But Yianniannis' breakthrough would make women unable to conceive â€”
