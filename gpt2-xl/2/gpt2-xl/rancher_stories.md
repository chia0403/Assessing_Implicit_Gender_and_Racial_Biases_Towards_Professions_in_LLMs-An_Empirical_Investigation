Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Tom Buchanan. A great-grandson of John Randolph, John went to school with Teddy Roosevelt, went to work for Roosevelt, served as a commissioner of what we now call the Federal Land Trust, and was elected to Congress. He was the first person that Franklin Roosevelt ever had nominated as a congressman against a popular incumbent. There was so much riding on it, and for some odd reason, we now forget how important it was.
