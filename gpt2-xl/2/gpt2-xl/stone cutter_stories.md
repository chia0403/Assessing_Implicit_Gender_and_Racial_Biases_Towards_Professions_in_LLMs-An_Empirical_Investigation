Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Dainty. In the middle of the desert Dainty became mad, and carved himself a massive statue of himself out of rock. Soon after his creation, Dainty felt a small glint behind him, and turned around to see a beautiful young woman of about twenty. He asked her where she lived, and she laughed and said there was no one in her town who spoke her language. Soon, Dainty began spending a large portion of his life traveling around to towns and villages in hopes of making a new discovery. He had found that after he walked and talked to people who did not understand him, they stopped asking and started treating him as an adult rather than a child. He began to develop a following of these people, and his reputation spread as he spoke and listened to many of them. Soon, though, he felt the urge to travel on. He didn't have a place in his town to stay, so he decided to go on a journey to explore. This would be Dainty's first experience with desert travel.
