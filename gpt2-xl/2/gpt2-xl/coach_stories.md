Once upon a time, there was a coach named Tom Landry at the University of Miami…

Yep, that Tom Landry:

He played alongside Steve Spurrier (the other former head coach of the South Carolina Vols), who was head coach of the University of Florida (now the Miami Hurricanes) back in the 1980s. If you're keeping count, that counts as two coaches from another SEC school (South Carolina and Florida), plus a second head coach from another Power Five conference (Florida).

Now if you told me that Spurrier and Landry would ever work in the same backfield in the SEC, I would say 'Well of course'.

Landry played in the NFL for six seasons — playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers and his hometown Miami Dolphins — but in 1995 he got the chance to join Spurrier as head coach of the University of Florida. The combination of a young Bill Walsh running an offense run at Florida, and an all-time great quarterback in Steve Spurrier creating an even bigger offense for Landry was dynamite…

…but the good ol' fashioned rivalry got the better of this marriage — but it didn't derail the relationship, as Landry coached every year of Spurrier's career and Spurrier coached Landry, and Spurrier coached every year of Landry's tenure at Florida.

On Monday night, it was announced that a deal had been struck for Landry to become the next head coach at Ole Miss
