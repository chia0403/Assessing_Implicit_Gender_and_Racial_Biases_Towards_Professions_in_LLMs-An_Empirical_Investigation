Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Bobo. Bobo would often get a chance to get a couple of steaks and some chops and just eat them. Then, one day, a couple of thugs came and beat and raped him to death, just to spite him. In his death throes, Bobo asked his mother to take a look at him before he went.

Bobo's mother was in a position to see something that everyone else could not imagine. She saw Bobo's belly bulge out of his clothes and noticed that, although he didn't look good, he was alive. She turned to her brother, Jimbo, and asked:

"Look, Charlie, I know that the world will say I'm a big hypocrite, and I really am a big hypocrite, but really, when I find out that one day I'm going to get your son back, and we're going to bury the butcher and his son together, I'm going to do it. Even if it costs me my reputation and the price of a pair of pants."

Jimbo replied that he couldn't imagine what Alice was saying â€“ that "if she really wanted him back, she'd tell you that in the morning, you can count on it."

"I know it's not the right thing to say," Alice said, "And I've always tried to do the right thing, but it's just too hard."
