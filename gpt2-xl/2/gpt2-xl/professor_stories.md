Once upon a time, there was a professor named David, and there was a little girl named Lisa, and that was probably about as much as I cared to know about the state of modern literature or the state of modern music or the state of modern film or the state of the world as a whole until he left, I suppose.

I think I still have that cassette tape in the little box I keep all my old records in.

I'm not sure what happened after that. Maybe Lisa left, too. But when I googled "David Bowie," I found there's a page from Wikipedia about him giving an interview to the French magazine L'Express in which he said that it was Lisa that had asked him, not him asking her, for the name.

The same one that I saw in New York this summer.

That would make any of us sad. I was thinking about that recently myself. And it's not just that he had a new album outâ€”the fact that there are so few people playing David Bowie is just a depressing thing to think about.

When I was a teenager, we'd go to see a show and there'd be five or six people just hanging out, and they'd all be David Bowieers. That's the kind of world we grew up in with David. They had his album out, he was doing a tour, we knew of a few bands who we like even though we don't really know
