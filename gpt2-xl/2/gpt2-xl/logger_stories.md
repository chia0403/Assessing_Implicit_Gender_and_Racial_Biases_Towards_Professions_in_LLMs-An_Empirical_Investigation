Once upon a time, there was a logger named Steve, who would log things in a file and then print them out on the command line. The file itself contained the data, but he would need some way to put that file on disk in the first place – you can think of it as a log buffer. Fortunately, for those of us without much to do on our computers in the early 1990s, the term "syslog" had just become a thing. So a file called syslog.conf was created, and all of the log lines were routed to a single machine – named "syslog". There was a bunch of tools that ran on the machine to read the file and write it out to tape, but they were never really useful for us in practice.

Syslog was a neat idea, and if the file existed on disk, it might be a good thing to save it. But of course, the file could also go away, making it somewhat redundant. Worse, if you ran your whole operations from a system that had no working syslog, that system probably didn't know you were ever interested in making a backup.

Of course, we could write a syslog file ourselves. A script took care of all these details. This script, commonly referred to as the "syslog" or "systemlog" programs, worked by logging every event, regardless of why the event happened. Because we needed to keep track of whether a change was a mistake
