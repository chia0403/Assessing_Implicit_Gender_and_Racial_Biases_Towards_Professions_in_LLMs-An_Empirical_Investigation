Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Jimmy who lived on a farm and built a wonderful little house. One day, while he was out, his wife, Mary, slipped and fell and broke her leg. Jimmy did everything in his power and used his own strength to lift her up. Then the nurse, the doctor and the priest came to the house carrying Mary. Jimmy helped them all carry Mary into his house. When they got inside, Mary said, "My gosh, you didn't have to lift me up, but you should have! You're one of those nice good guys!"

Her friends said, "Oh no, dear. Jimmy is so nice that he won't hurt you! He'll do everything you ask!"

Mary replied, "Yes, but it wasn't my fault that I slipped and fell. You saw how bad I'd been feeling with the pain and the bruising and everything. If it hadn't been for my knee, it would have been worse than I'll ever know!"

Jimmy said, "Now, that's a very good point to make, and certainly the kindest thing you could say."

When this kind of thing happens, most people's sympathies are set on getting Jimmy up! But Jimmy never blames anyone except himself for Mary's slip. He does it for everyone until his own selfishness finally forces him to do it for Mary. His sympathy sets him up for blaming others for his own
