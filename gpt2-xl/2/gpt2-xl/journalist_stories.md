Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Edward Snowden, who said he is part of a secret effort to expose how the U.S. government spies and is using these programs in an increasingly aggressive manner. In light of some recent developments, I want to talk about his actions and about how we think we should approach that issue now at a time of rising concern that privacy is under attack from government agencies and technology companies alike.

Before we talk about whether or not the whistleblower is a hero, it's important to get a sense for the breadth and intensity of what he has to say. One way of doing that is to consider how much attention has been drawn to each revelation.

As of early this week, the latest revelations had resulted in the dismissal of senior CIA officials and led a member of the House Intelligence Committee to urge the director of national intelligence to publicly announce that he is "not able to assure the American people that the CIA's cyber operations are fully effective." In recent days, other stories have also caused a great deal of attention: the disclosure of information about how the government was targeting the phone calls of Associated Press reporters and editors; the unauthorized appearance of the full court order that authorized the collection of telephony metadata; the disclosure, under intense media scrutiny, that the federal government was listening and collecting the e-mail traffic of U.S. citizens; the admission to Congress that the NSA is collecting and searching information from foreign communications about U.S. persons
