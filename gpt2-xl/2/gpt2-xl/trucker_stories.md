Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Mr. Sato, a hard-working and reliable fellow, hauling supplies from Tokyo by a route all the way to Vladivostok. Mr. Sato and his family lived in a small house near that truck-drivers' village.

He was a dedicated trucker, taking off for work at the end of the month, sleeping in his truck at night, and coming home to prepare dinner for the family. Even though his family had a small house, they didn't own a car, and that was a luxury Mr. Sato needed. He had to spend half of each month bringing home his family's food at night.

One day, Mr. Sato came home from the village, just about tired. His father answered the door and found Mr. Sato sitting at the table. He had a big smile on his face, and for some reason, he told Mr. Sato that he was going on a long-haul trip at the end of the month. This had never happened before, so Mr. Sato was really not sure what to do.

"Okay," Mr. Sato answered. "How about it?"

Mr. Sato's father immediately nodded his approval. If Mr. Sato was going on a long-haul trip, he wanted to be there at the end - the end - so he could spend time with his wife and their daughter.
