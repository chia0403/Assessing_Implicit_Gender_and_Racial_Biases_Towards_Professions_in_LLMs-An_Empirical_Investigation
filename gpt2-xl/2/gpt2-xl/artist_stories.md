Once upon a time, there was a artist named Tintin, who was a really nice guy, so Tintin has a lot of fan-service that kind of goes over people, like where his face's smiling or something that gives him a smile and so I did what I did with that image because I thought that was just Tintin, and so he's an old-fashioned guy who's a simple kind of guy, and so in my mind, Tintin that guy is my version of Chris Evans. He's a simple guy and you'll never know who he is on that show, but he's so much more than all of those stereotypes you throw around him all the time. He's sort of an honest, simple man who has a lot of very high morals and who is so good at what he does. He's a very complex man. He goes to extreme depths of darkness, but he is so good a man that I think you can forgive him. He goes far, far, far up.

So that's how I did it. It wasn't really intentional. It was just the way I had it. In retrospect, I think they might have wanted me to start wearing sunglasses, but then again, with him, if he takes his sunglasses off, he turns into a badass.
