Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Ziggurats. They were a big part of my childhood. They had two main uses: First, they were a popular kid's game. You'd stand in front of a Ziggurat, which would be a flat piece of cardboard on the ground, and try to get the ball into place by rotating it as far as you could. You had to work quickly, and only when the thing had slid off the ground. When it came to Ziggurats, I never failed at anything. I was the best.

Unfortunately, when I was a teenager, my father had started using Ziggurats as "ball-hop rings" to get kids into his pool hall. It was called an "amusement facility." What this meant was that if I won, he'd just give me more money to play another game with me. A few other kids were doing it too, and all they were doing for extra cash was bouncing balls off each other over a wooden beam that was attached to the floor. I was not one of their regular clients, so I never got to compete.

Every year, I would tell myself, "Don't give up. You can do anything you set your mind to in life!" This gave me energy, and I'd go home and work for the rest of the summer. That's how I got my first job, working on a production line making the balls
