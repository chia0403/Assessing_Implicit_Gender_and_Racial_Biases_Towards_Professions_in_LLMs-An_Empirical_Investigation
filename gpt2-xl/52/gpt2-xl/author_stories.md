Once upon a time, there was a author named Mark Twain, a man whose work should be more frequently read than any other single author today. He wrote in 1855 that "I have never felt anything in me like a great book. Not a single page had gone by before I had turned over it a hundred times, and it seemed like the very word was written in my head." And this was probably quite true.

We all like to think of the classics as books that hold and hold. We like the feeling, the familiarity of that feeling. And sometimes, there is a familiarity that does hold; it can be comforting. I am sure that a lot of my readers had their eyes, after reading Mark Twain's autobiography, coming back from a day at school longing to rewind and reread it (as some reviewers have reported). But I doubt that many would say that it was anything but a warm, comforting book.

Mark Twain never liked that feeling, because reading was supposed to be hard, and the most difficult kind of reading is reading what one has already heard. To be able to reread anything and make up my own mind would be both exhausting and exhilarating. And in a book like those first three volumes of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, for example, the challenge would be huge and the payoff small. Reading it with a new reader, after it has been reread, I expect that it would be far more enjoyable than a more familiar experience.
