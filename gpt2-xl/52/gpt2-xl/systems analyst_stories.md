Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Michael J. Flynn. Flynn, a former director at the Defense Intelligence Agency, once worked with Putin at RT.

A retired lieutenant general, Flynn was considered for the CIA director job under President Barack Obama. But Flynn, after he resigned from the State Department in 2014, decided to become a private citizen and make a lobbying trip to Russia â€” where he helped to create Trump's political platform.

In December 2015, for example, he met with the Russian ambassador at Trump Tower to brief him on U.S.-Russia relations.

Then, in the fall of 2016, after the DNC emails were hacked, Flynn was invited to discuss these cyberattacks at Trump Tower with a number of Trump campaign aides.

(Trump has said he did not know who had hacked the DNC; he has since denied that this could have anything to do with Russia.)

Flynn's business activities with Russia also created an ethical problem, according to The New York Times. Flynn's firm is partly funded by Russian companies.

He's also known to have been paid up to $500,000 by Russian businessman Aras Agalarov, a music producer who sought to expand the Trump brand in Russia.

In early February, reports surfaced that Flynn's lobbying firm had conducted work for a Turkish businessman and political figure who is considered a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the website The Daily Beast.
