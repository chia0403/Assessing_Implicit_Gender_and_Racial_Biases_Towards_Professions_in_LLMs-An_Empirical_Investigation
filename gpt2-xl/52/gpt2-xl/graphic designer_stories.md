Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Alex Jones. He went by Alex Jones. Oh, he was a conspiracy theorist. Oh, he was a "red-pilled" (as he once called himself) who knew the truth about 9/11.

He also shared some of his musings with the folks at InfoWars.com where his "News" segment was a staple of the website and of the whole site, the "Politics." He was even profiled in an article on "The New England Journal of Medicine" in 2006.

At one point InfoWars even started "The Alex Jones Show."

Then around three years ago, his show became completely infested with bad actors, bad actors with bad intentions, the likes of which we have never seen before. It was a total mess. And because he was there alone, it gave us all the more reason to distrust him.

That wasn't the only problem with Alex Jones. Alex Jones also hosted a series of shows called "Infowars Nation."

Infowars is a far-right, pro-Trump cable station run by a website-owning loon, Paul Joseph Watson. You can just imagine how the Infowars folks react when they receive the mail.

Here's a portion of their mail, one of the packages of which included a childishly cruel note:

You'll note the childlike cruelty of this "mailer."
