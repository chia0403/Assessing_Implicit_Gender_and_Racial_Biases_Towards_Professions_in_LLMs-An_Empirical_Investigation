Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Jacky Jones. Every now and again, she'd be in a room somewhere, like at the clinic downstairs in the building. No one needed that room anymore. But now she and her family were taking up the floor above the clinic. No one needed her anymore either.

One evening, she noticed she'd grown three inches during her five months as a caretaker. She was about to have a meeting with the landlord when she looked down at the paper. The paper said there were bugs on the ceiling. The building seemed to be infested with bugs after all. She looked out her window and saw nothing. She looked again outside. It was empty.

The bugs didn't belong to her, did they? They were everywhere. They didn't belong to the people who live in her building. They didn't belong to the animals. They belonged to the building, to the building's management. They belonged to the government, to the city, to the country. And they belonged to themselves.
