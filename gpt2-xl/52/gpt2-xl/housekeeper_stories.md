Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Margaret who shared one room with her husband. Margaret was pretty as a girl, but she suffered from a terrible skin disease called Eczema. Her husband was a doctor, and although he did not believe in curing it, he tried to take good care of Margaret. When she began to lose so much skin, he felt sad, and so encouraged her to make more of herself. One day, she started to wax everything. She thought she was doing the Lord's work, which is exactly what she did!
