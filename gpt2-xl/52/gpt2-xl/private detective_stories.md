Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Harry Houdini. There, in this life, was Harry Houdini.

He was born in 1864. He was a graduate of the Columbia Law School, which made his first book, The Mysterious Stranger, a New York Times best seller. He did live the life of a showman. But he was more than that. He was also a genuine occultist. A true magician. A mystic. He claimed that he could perform amazing feats of mind over mind communication. He became one of the early American spiritualists. His best-known book was simply The Magician and the Magician: A Treatise on the Power and Use of Astral Projection

But Houdini was also one of the first American public figures to be persecuted by the Church of Lucifer. And there is a whole chapter of the occultist's life dedicated to the trial. It was the most infamous case in nineteenth century American history.

On Monday September 12th, 1862, the year after his twenty-fifth birthday, the court in New York City held a trial for Mr. Houdini. The accused was guilty of blasphemy involving a public performance. His crime was that he had made comments about the Devil at a show in front of a large crowd of people.

The evidence provided by the prosecution included statements by the Devil, testimony from three witnesses, and a detailed description of the devil by a clergyman.
