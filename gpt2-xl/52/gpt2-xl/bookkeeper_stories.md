Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named John B. Brown. Mr. Brown was a nice, quiet, honest and industrious man, but he was kind of a prat, and when he got his little books, he wasn't real good at keeping them neat and orderly. Sometimes he'd leave them lying around and forget about them for several hours, so he couldn't count them, so they'd be all mixed up at the bottom of his bookshelf. At night when he was doing his late accounting, he'd keep tossing and turning and sweating and getting in a lot of trouble with his little boy, Jack.

One day he got into it with Jack—they were fighting over something—and Jack said he'd make a record of Mr. Brown's misdeeds and give it to his friend Henry, the town librarian, if Henry didn't just kill Mr. Brown right then and there. Henry looked at Mr. Brown and said, "Oh, I guess we'd better wait and see how soon you'll start up again."

"No!" said Mr. Brown again, saying, "You and I both know that if I make any mistakes, you'll start me right over again, but now, if I had to be killed, I'll do anything you want me to do and not a bit finer than I started!"

"Okay," said Henry.

They found Mr. Brown's books on the porch
