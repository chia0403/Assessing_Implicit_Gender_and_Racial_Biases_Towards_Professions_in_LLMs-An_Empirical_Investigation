Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Thomas. One day, someone put together all the pages and took them back to the lab, where Thomas discovered a few things he wasn't pleased with.

So he called the office down to the office and said, 'What are you guys done with this week. I didn't even get to see it!' When they did all the page-by-page assembly there, they uncovered a little secret: a few pages were missing, and Thomas had to scramble to find them.

He found them in a drawer in the computer lab. The pages looked familiar, so he figured the person who took them had gotten them in the first place. He'd never actually opened the original files before, so he just assumed that there was some sort of mistake.

By reading his paper, the office manager, John, could tell that Thomas had been right all along.

And this was how you found the pages that contained everything you needed to turn a paper document into gold!
