Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Bill and he did most of the work I do today. But his job is more like mine than ever. Most of his students are working on their Ph.D's while he's teaching a course. Or maybe they're just bored working their second jobs and have no idea they can do so much more than any library clerks do, or that they're actually doing more for people than they ever thought they could. I can see him in the library as I'm making a new selection, so I turn around to look at him. There he is peering at the stack of books beside the stacks of CDs. "Do you need me to put those away?" I ask, trying not to interrupt him. "I'm just looking," he answers. "And the other books are in the stacks by you." I look around. I have no idea what he's talking about. "Well," I say, "I was hoping to get the books I'm working on done now so I could move out of these stacks." I can hear him chuckling behind me. "I'll call you back when we're finished," he says. There's no need to ask him what the stack "by me" is. I put my back to him. I do a quick check of the shelves to see if I'm alone, but I find a group of five or six of these books were sitting just beside each other on two shelves.
