Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. Seuss.

"His stories were more complicated and wild than he was known for," said Dr. Lisa A. Lewis, a professor of English at Syracuse University. "In the '40s and '50s, a woman on the verge of giving birth was almost always a tragic figure. In The Cat in the Hat, Dr. Seuss' first book, he writes, 'That's so sadâ€”she's not going to live, the baby is going to die.'"

Lewis said that Dr. Seuss' books were a major influence on the modern book industry and its image.

"He popularized it," she said. "We know that some of his illustrations are based on real people. It's been very hard to divorce the cartoon from the realistic."

The Cat in the Hat can now be found in more than 100 libraries around the country through its official website, where you can find a list of the books that are currently available through digitization.
