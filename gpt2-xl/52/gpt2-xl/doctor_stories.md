Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Michael Blaha who used to come to my son's school when his friends were sick and do regular surgeries for free. His services are now very good and the school is very grateful for it. This doctor had a strong religious upbringing so that was something I had to keep in mind when my son visited and discussed religion a lot â€“ he insisted we both wear our Islamic head scarf and to eat Halal foods. He explained it simply, but it was enough for my son to know that Islam is simply what God wants us to do. At that point, my mother had to admit she was no longer his guardian. His parents decided to give him the care he needed even without his father, so they transferred me with him. Michael was his father's doctor for a few years until his father got sick too, so he moved on and got the job as the main doctor. He is a really good doctor and does some very good operations. I miss the times when he used to come to the house and do surgeries for free. His practice is in the big western city of Stockholm, so I've never gotten to see him. I think I might have grown used to having other people in the house, so having him come wasn't too much fun. Maybe some more time as a full father could go some ways in making it fun.

The first time my son showed me on the road map, that is, an iPad he could play
