Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Bessie (she was a woman). Bessie's husband was, unfortunately, not interested in taking care of his family so he took his family (all women children) into a different dimension where Bessie worked as a dental nurse with two women and one man (they had to stay in their proper dimensions).

Then one day, this same doctor got so pissed at her for not taking the proper care of her patients that she summoned her male sidekick (a male dentist) to break her into an alternate dimension where Bessie worked as a dental assistant with more than 1 man.

To make matters even better, this doctor was in a competition with himself where he was attempting to dentify the mouth of the same woman that he had used as a dental assistant.

Eventually, the doctor defeated his sidekick with her help and decided to try and keep her.

The husband decided to put an end to the female-only realm and returned to his wife for a quick reconciliation.

At that point she gave it to her husband (instead of the other way around) who proceeded to destroy the female-only realm with a powerful laser beam. The doctor thought they could have a "quickie" but ended up getting a little more than he bargained for (in this movie, the male dentist gets a mouth full of jizz).

This movie is hilarious,
