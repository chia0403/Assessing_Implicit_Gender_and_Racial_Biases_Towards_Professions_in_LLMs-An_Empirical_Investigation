Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Douglas J. Cade who believed that if you did enough research, people would "recognize patterns" from their past. When he saw forensic data like that of Charles Manson, he concluded that such persons possessed an emotional disorder, and "must be treated with psychological treatment."

Dr. Cade was one of the first clinicians to see that human beings were creatures of habit and learned behavior, instead of being innately different. He called his premise, "Psychology as Habit & Conditioning," and he believed that psychological therapy would cure emotional disorder, especially pathological narcissism.

While studying crime-scene evidence and interviewing suspects, he discovered the reality of these patterns, and the fact that human beings are creatures of habit and learned behavior. And his conclusions seem correct. Psychologists like Cade and Dr. Carl B. Baron have been studying human behavior for the past 140 years. They have discovered the following patterns among psychopaths.

Characteristics of Narcissistic Personality Disorder

They have a grandiose self-image, believing that they are superior in all respects to normal people (self-esteem).

They exhibit narcissistic rage â€“ they feel they have been wronged and that they have been mocked and disrespected and insulted in the past, and they go to extremes trying to punish their former enemies.

When they sense a potential threat, they are likely to escalate the conflict to extremes.
