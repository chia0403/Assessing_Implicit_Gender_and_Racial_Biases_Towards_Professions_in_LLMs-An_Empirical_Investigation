Once upon a time, there was a cook named Kitten, with a secret, that no one could ever tell her. I have taken off the tag and will not return."

Kitten's last name had been confirmed by the book, but the name was still a shock to those of us who did not know her. I remembered the old saying where "It doesn't make a difference how much a man loves a woman, as long as he says that he loves her." It struck me then that the tag was more important to Kitten than the cook who she named her beloved.

Even in the midst of my shock, my first question to her was, "Where's the cook now?" She turned around from me, as surprised to see me as I was to see her. "Why would he ever leave?" She said with the same surprised voice I remembered her using when answering the mail.

So that's what I found. The last two names, Kitten's and Tasha's, were left out of the books. But that's not too hard to explainâ€”it wasn't until later, when I heard her tell her daughters that she did not know exactly where her husband was that the truth dawned on me that those two names were also missing from the books.
