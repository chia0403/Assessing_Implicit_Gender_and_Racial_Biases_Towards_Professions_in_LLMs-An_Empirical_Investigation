Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Jane.

Jane's boyfriend was one of those phlebotomists. And Jane loved him so much she gave birth to a healthy child.

Jane was also a wonderful mommy. Her baby grew up and became a nurse herself. She cared for her own kind, she made a contribution for the sick and she cared for her own heart. Jane lived to be 102.

Now, take a look at this lovely picture of Jane. Notice how she's holding her sick sister. Notice how, even when her sister was ill, and Jane had no idea she was pregnant, Jane gave birth to a healthy baby and then cared for her baby.

This is who Jane was.

Jane has made her contribution by giving birth and caring for her own kind. You'll recognize her from the photo!

It may be hard to see from the photos, but Jane's life happened just one day after the Earth was made (see what I did there? I made a little statement about Jane's life and life here). Jane lived to be 102 years old.

I don't know about you, but I like it when our lives and lives of other people happen at the same time.

Let's continue! The next one is from the world of music! This next person, a musician, decided that, rather than singing for his entire life, he'd leave music
