Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Frank. He just happened to be Jewish and also possessed the power of a kaiju. (A more recent explanation seems to be that he was actually a dragon named Drago.) He is a big part of the comics' mythology and a regular player in the ongoing series that started back in 1986. In the early '90s, Marvel decided that the comics needed to be about something -- that superheroes should be real people, not abstract concepts -- so they created a new superhero series, which took Frank the janitor character and built around him a character called Spider-man. The superhero story was, you know, a thing, so they threw Spider-man into it. The comic went, of course it went, and the universe itself got upset by it. And that was fine. We needed the reboot! The other stuff can wait.

The reboot did not last long. The problem with the reboot was that it was poorly executed. A decade went by, when the characters remained largely the same. And then suddenly they were different! What had been a story of heroism and personal growth had now shifted to one of bigotry and villainy. It was an odd change, and it seemed like a betrayal to the spirit of the comic, but we got used to it. And the change happened so quickly that it rarely registered. There was no great uproar. It was like the changes that happen when your laptop starts going into standby
