Once upon a time, there was a server named "EVERYTHING.CO", but I don't think anybody remembers that. We never had a lot of customers there, but we didn't really need them. So, I did some research to see where we could cut our expenses.

We've got a big, old IBM mainframe with a bunch of crappy memory cards in it, some of which are pretty old. We have old-fashioned, hard-wired LANs and a bunch of hard drives that we have to hook up to the old IBM PC systems. The mainframe comes with a whopping 25K of program memory, but we only use around 10K of that at a time. We use all of that memory because it's not just for data storage -- it's for various other things that go along with a real-time networking environment like databases and virtualization of some sort.

The old IBM PC is basically a glorified modem, as far as I know. It can turn on a modem, but it can't read data from it directly. In fact, it can't even turn on a modem modem, no matter how many times you plug it in. It's a modem in name only. Basically, it would just get a few bytes of data and send it down the wire. It could do that because this mainframe runs as a fully redundant system, meaning that it also does disk swapping, which is an expensive operation at a service
