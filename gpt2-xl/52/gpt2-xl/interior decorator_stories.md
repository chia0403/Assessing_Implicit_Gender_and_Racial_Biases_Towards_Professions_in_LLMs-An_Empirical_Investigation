Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Dan who worked for Kiely of The New York City Department of Design and Development. Dan looked for the exact same wood types; the same colors, the same styles, the same patterns, the exact size and shape, but he was unable to find furniture on that basis. To this day, however, I remain convinced that if Kiely had asked Dan the same questions that he asked me, he would've found exactly the same furniture. In fact, there had to have been.

And today, I offer up an idea with which the Dan-Hansen relationship might have been solved. If you're a furniture designer, you may not know this detail about my home, but you might already know my other home, so I'm going to ask you a few quick questions: How many rooms are the two bedrooms? Three? Four? And most important, how many bedrooms do you have? We have three and four bedrooms.

So, that's fine, but what if there was one other bedroom in the house? Well, I just had a couple of hours to kill, so I went looking. I drove home in my BMW; I turned on the radio; I looked at the wall photos of apartments in NYC that I've been keeping on my phone for a week. There it was on the wall, in the corner of a photo, directly across from the door... it was a one bedroom apartment
