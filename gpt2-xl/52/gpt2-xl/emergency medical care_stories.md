Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named by their nickname, 'Pepsi Care.'

That became a very unpopular decision.

On paper.

Well, so what happened?

They were the first to try it.

And with people telling him they couldn't use the new brand name that Pepsi would use, he had to come up with a new name for what later became called a "pepsi" company.

And when the people who were going to be in charge of the Pepsi brand didn't think it was a good idea to keep the name, Pepsi was saved. And now no matter what Pepsi does, it's called Pepsi.

That's the story of Pepsi-Cola, the first product of the world. If you try to get rid of that name, you'll always get it back.

That's what can happen.

And here's the final lesson.

So what can anybody in this industry learn from your failure?

Here's what happened.

When everybody goes somewhere else â€¦ nobody's ever going to know all the secrets and tricks that you had, but you sure got the first one right.
