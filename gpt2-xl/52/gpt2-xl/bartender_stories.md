Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Sam. One night while Sam worked, a group of four came into the bar. As they were leaving, the bartender was approached by the three girls. "How're the rest of you guys doing tonight?" The four girls all nodded. "Great," said the bartender. "Let's head back out." "Sounds good to me!" yelled the four girls. "Let's go!" The four jumped up and went after Sam. Unfortunately, the bartender was in the middle of talking to another customer and couldn't be bothered to stop by or say anything to them. The bartender came by once more after that. She smiled at the girls and said, "Hey! Wait for me, will you?" The girls went to follow the bartender. The bartender returned two minutes later. "Hey! Wait for me!" she yelled back. Again, the girls went after SAM. But they didn't wait. As they were going along the road, they saw a car going really fast. They stopped to say some prayers. Before the four walked into the bar, the car swerved and hit them right in the chest. As soon as they passed out, they had to rush to the hospital. Sam was given first aid and rushed to the hospital by emergency services. The bartender was given first aid and rushed to the hospital by emergency services. The girls were given first aid and rushed to the hospital by emergency services. One of them suffered severe chest injuries
