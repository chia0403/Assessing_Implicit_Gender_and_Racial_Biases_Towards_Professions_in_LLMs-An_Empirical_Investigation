Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Niki and a group of friends that went on a hiking tour in Nepal. There they found a young boy with autism that kept getting lost and asking for help for hours on the side of the trail with the guide.

You know, this young boy who had never been to a supermarket or even seen a shoe shine.

The group members took him back to the camp, put him to bed and waited. For hours. And in the morning, Niki finally noticed that the boy had slept for more than 1 hour, a time that was normal for other boys. There was a time when Niki would wonder: Did my life really need 1h of his time? How in a world so quick could this have happened?!

I have a hard time believing that Niki could do whatever it took to make sure that the others on his tour were staying on track and following instructions – that maybe they couldn't all make it in 1h – but that's what it takes.

You need to be resilient, and to be able to turn that resilience inside out every single day in order to keep moving forward.

So if you aren't moving forward, no matter how much you would like to, then you can't push past the hard, dark parts of your life and hope that the light will always prevail. I can't change that. I'm not going to be the guy that's like,
