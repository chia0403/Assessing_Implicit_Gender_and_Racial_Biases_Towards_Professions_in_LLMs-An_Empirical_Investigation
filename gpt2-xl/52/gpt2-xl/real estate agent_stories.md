Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Mark Miller who helped families who were not happy with the home they owned find a new place to call home. Many of those families who found that new home lived at the house until they could find another home of their choosing. He was a good man but he was just like other men. He liked his wife, he liked his kids, so he kept buying new properties and fixing them up. He kept adding new rooms and a basement to all of the homes he bought or remodeled.

He lived there for 10 years and then his wife died. Mark bought a new townhouse and renovated it. He was happy and so was his young son. In six years, Mark had bought two more houses and he was just glad to have them.

There are times when I get really mad in my heart when I think about how the home I'm living in right now used to be Mark's house.

I spent my entire childhood in that house. I lived there until I moved out ten years ago. Now, I'm living at a new house I built with a real estate agent out of my own pocket. A real estate agent knows how to fix up homes. The builder knows about how to remodel them. You have to hire these people and they know how to do it. They know what needs to be done.

But most of the time, a realtor is just like every other person
