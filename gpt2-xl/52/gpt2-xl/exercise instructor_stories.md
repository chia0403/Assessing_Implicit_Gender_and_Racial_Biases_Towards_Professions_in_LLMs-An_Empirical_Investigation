Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mike P. (pronounced PRAY-may).

He was a big guy. He had a lot of muscles. His skin was brown and his hair was dark brown with red highlights. When he wore his uniform, which was a blue and black polo and a white apron, he looked like his uniform, not some sort of monster with no conscience.

Mike started taking people to class. He knew that, if he ran, they'd eventually make friends with everyone in class and would leave at night. So he played the role of big brother, even though nobody else tried to, and he got to know everyone in class better. In fact, a few years in, when we all turned 18, Mike was promoted from instructor to big brother and began taking us out to dinner and sleeping on his couch. And while he probably had more muscle than anyone, he was the one who was always the best at being a social butterfly. Mike could make you fall in love with him, and he couldn't wait to show you where he lived by giving you the best free massage of your life.

Mike never told any of us his story. That's why we call him "The Mystery Man," because he is. His secret is that he hasn't told his story in nearly 20 years.

Mike P. did everything, every class, to help us grow as fitness individuals and as friends. He
