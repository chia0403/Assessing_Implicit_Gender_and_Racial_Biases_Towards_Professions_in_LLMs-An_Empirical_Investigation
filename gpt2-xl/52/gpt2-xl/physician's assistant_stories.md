Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Dr. Sacks, who once told me this story:

"I remember once I was asked to give someone a shot of adrenaline, and as soon as I dropped it to the floor, I realized I mustn't do it again because I didn't have enough. I called my mom for the dose, and she called my sister, who said the only thing we could eat was bread and fruit. So we went to the local grocery store and bought some apples, oranges, and bananas, and for the next few hours we ate and ate and ate, until our stomachs were hurting. As soon as we pulled up empty-handed, we went home. It felt like we were really going out again."

If this is a good way to live, then I want to live like that doctor. I wish I could learn how to count to 10 without pain. I wish I could go to a party and have only one drink every five minutes.

I would like to be able to give a person a shot of adrenaline without experiencing any pain.

I would like to have someone walk up to me, with the words "Are you sure you won't pass out?"

I would like to take only fruit and water to parties.

I would like to have only one drink per five minutes.

I would like to be able to watch a movie without feeling that my body needs
