Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Lisa, who made very attractive and loving home videos about her clients with her adorable baby in the background. It looks like she has moved on from that niche, as it seems that not only are her videos no longer available, but her website as well.

In one video, Lisa appears to be on a first name basis with the child she is supposedly talking to. This video, along with many others, has been removed from her video hosting company's web site, but it still exists on the third party website.

The entire site seems to be an attempt to get the money from the advertising income that this child-related video company was generating. However, the real Lisa was still out there somewhere, making all of the videos, still looking after her new client, and enjoying all the money that this endeavor has brought her over the previous years.

What goes around, must come around. It's time that Lisa finally goes to bed and lets the kids do the talking for her, because what she is left with after over 10 years of working for children's services is more than enough to care for all of their socialization needs with a little extra income.

I wonder what really happened to Lisa. We would love to know. Would you be willing to donate to Lisa at some point? Would you see your hard-earned money go to some evil, greedy pedophile who would want to have a little fun
