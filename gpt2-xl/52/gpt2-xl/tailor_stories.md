Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Emeric. He worked very diligently in the town of Nuln. He made his entire living through an elaborate and intricate web of deceit. At one point, he was so adept at deceiving his employer, Emeric was able to keep his job for over a decade without being fired, and he lived a wealthy lifestyle. All went according to Emeric's plan, and he even earned enough money to begin building a large mansion, the very same one that he created to escape Nuln and live his life to its fullest. One day he came downstairs to find that his boss, Mr. Emeh, had left some extra clothing on his chair. The garments he wore were quite modest, but nevertheless his boss was displeased and threw Emeric out of his position. Emeric ran outside and began to mourn the loss of his job, and so he began to seek ways to gain it back. His quest would take him all over Europe, and all over the United States.

But before he could accomplish any of the aforementioned goals, he was stopped by Mr. Emeh himself. A man that had been so good at making Emeric and all his fellow workers believe that he was a master tailor, one day Emeh made Emeric an offer.
