Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Robert Stein that specialized in borderline personality disorder and other related disorders.

Stein used the term "mild psychopathy" to describe the behavior of the patients he saw, while labeling the cases where they were violent as instances of "marked psychopathy."

He did this for quite a while, and eventually a paper was published that concluded in 1965 that Stein's description of the three basic types of individuals with borderline personality disorder were accurate. He was able to get several of his patients into treatment because of this study.

He had a number of colleagues who wanted to try to identify what Stein's type of "mild psychopathy" was and what the clinical picture looked like, but he was hesitant, since the results could be misinterpreted. He knew that it was a risk, but believed that the more accurate method would be to identify certain factors that made a person more likely to act out violently.

Robert M. Hare and Peter R. Breggin went on to find the markers that made people more likely to engage in violence. Hare developed the "Violent Trait Inventory." The test has been used both with inmates and with community members and family members.

The key findings are that:

People who scored in the bottom quartile in the test (i.e., those who experienced the lowest levels of aggression from others) are more likely to have a violent history
