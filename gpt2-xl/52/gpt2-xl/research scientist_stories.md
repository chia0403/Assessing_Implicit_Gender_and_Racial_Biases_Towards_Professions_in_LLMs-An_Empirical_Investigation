Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. B.J. Novak (aka Dr. Octopus), and he had no idea who Dr. Octopus was. On the day of his "discovery" that Dr. Octopus was, in fact, Dr. Octopus, Dr. Octopus took out his collection of weapons and started to look around the lab in a state of panic while Dr. N.O.P.E.D. (Dr. Noreen Peppers) held Octavius back. They went to see the other lab members that were there, and they all decided to hide until the other doctor (who was Dr.N.O.P.E.D.) finished his exam. Once Octavius (who appeared to be Dr. Octopus) was in the room with Dr. N.O.P.E.D., he used a mirror with his octopus arms to look at the human Dr. N.O.P.E.D. before he revealed himself. Dr. N.O.P.E.D. turned into a giant robot and started to attack everyone (save for D-Dreidel, and the last remaining humans). Dr. Octopus then threw his octopus arms and started fighting against D-Dreidel; however, the robot ended up hitting Dr. Octopus in the head with a giant hammer and knocked him out.
