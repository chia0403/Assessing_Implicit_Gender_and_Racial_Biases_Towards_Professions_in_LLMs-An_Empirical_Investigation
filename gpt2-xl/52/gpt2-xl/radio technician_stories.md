Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Richard Beasley who was so bored with his job that he decided to travel through time to find out what was happening in the world of radio. One day, he met a man named Harold Jett, who worked in a radio station that was owned by William Kirtland. They both decided to do the same exact thing that Richard Beasley had done with his radio, but this time, instead of asking one of the big corporations to build a radio from the ground up, they asked William Kirtland. Afterward, William Kirtland gave Richard Beasley's radio to Harold Jett, who became a millionaire and later killed several men on the other side of the world.


"So what's up with you and me?

"Hey, you look pretty beat."

"Yeah, but I'm looking for a woman."

"And why'd you ask?"

"Why's the hell would I ask?

"You want to have a baby."

"Why would anyone want to have a baby?"

"Well, you look so young, and you have a pretty face and you look great in that dress. And with you eyes..."

"Oh, my God, please don't tell them where I work!"


"You know, I think you're kinda strange," said Richard. "I think you might be in love with me."
