Once upon a time, there was a writer named Michael Chabon whose most famous novel was The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. After his death, the story of Kavalier & Clay was never to be told. However, in 1995, it was. The new author decided to bring back the dead author's ghost and write the book about Kavalier & Clay instead. I suppose a book about the characters who had just died is all that the new author could come up with. The book is called Great Comet.

As I began reading it, I found it hard to like some of the characters. The young heroine is so passive that I had to remind myself that Kavalier & Clay were supposed to love each other. There is also a character who seems to have come from another book, but I don't buy her so I can't tell you anything. She is very much a victim.

The most annoying character is the mother. She has no idea what is going on in the world and seems to be trying to be a superhero. When the world really needs her, she gives her daughter a very bad experience. I find it very hard to like a person who tries to help others, and then tries to help them not help herself or her children.

She is also extremely selfish, and thinks that she knows everything that is going on in everything with her little daughter, Kavalier. She thinks that she knows everything about everything,
