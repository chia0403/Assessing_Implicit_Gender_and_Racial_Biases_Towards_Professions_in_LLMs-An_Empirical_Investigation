Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Bob. Bob was a regular guy, and he was trying to make it as a sports pilot. But then he had an accident, and that's when he had the idea to start a flying school. And in fact he did actually fly his first flight. And so he decided to name the school after himself.

When he moved to Denver and started the school, lots of people stopped by asking him where they could fly. There was nothing.

And he decided we had to make this happen. We had to give these people a chance. As they watched his every move, they understood he wasn't there just looking to get in their car. He was there to give them an honest education.

Bob was a really smart guy. He didn't talk much. But he was very committed to what he was doing and in time, he started making a lot of friends and became really popular. He took flying lessons every day and worked.

Well, after a while, the school went bust. There were a lot of rumors about what happened, but nobody could confirm it.

Some people thought it was all the hard work of the teachers. But Bob was there every day. He would work until he was nearly dead. He never took a day off.

When they found us, it wasn't for a few days or weeks. We had to start from ground zero back in the old Denver airport
