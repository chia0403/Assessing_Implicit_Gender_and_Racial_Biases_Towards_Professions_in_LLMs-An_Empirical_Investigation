Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Jerry Brown. He said he would help put San Francisco on the map. But his administration's efforts to control the port — through a tax increase, the construction of a new sea wall and the introduction of "dead lines" — were a disaster, Brown argued. "Jerry was great," declared Bob Raben, the veteran city-councilman who now serves as mayor. But "the city was so strapped that the only thing that was going to keep the lights on and the phone lines running was the Port," Raben said. "No one wanted that." After a long series of compromises, Brown's legacy is in tatters, and so is his once-strong hand.

A decade and half since his administration of the "Miracle On Market Street," a plan that raised billions for affordable housing and transit, Mayor Ed Lee has done nothing since to transform San Francisco's infrastructure. His administration was the primary force behind San Francisco's decision to block the expansion of Transbay Transit Center in the Mission on the city's waterfront. Lee's "infrastructure spending" policy led to a $300 million subsidy to help build the Transbay Terminal, which has been a bust-out hit. The decision to cut off the city's share of a $1.3 billion waterfront tunnel cost our economy up to $8 million a day.

But Lee has continued to promote himself as the city's prodigal son
