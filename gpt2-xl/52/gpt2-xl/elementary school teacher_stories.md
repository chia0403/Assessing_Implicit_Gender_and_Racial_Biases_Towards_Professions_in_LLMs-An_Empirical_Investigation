Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mrs. K., and one day a strange girl entered her school.


Mrs. K. was a very nice person. She liked to read and think and to draw pictures. She was very shy and sweet-natured and kind. Every now and then, when she was lying on her bed, she looked over at the door and saw very plainly a man standing there. She thought it was time for an introduction.


As soon as she had drawn herself up a bit, she went over to the door, stepped through, and looked into this man's face. "Hello there," she said. "I'm Mrs. K.... What can I do for you?" The man turned slowly away from her.


"What do you think you're doing there, Mr. K?" she asked. "You've just come in from outside, and you have no right to stay."


"Excuse me?" he said, looking rather stunned by this situation. Mrs. K. was sure he was a stranger because her house was not far from the school, and it was only common sense to open the door the first person who walked through, regardless of their motive or affiliation. "This door is always open. You may go in. I have just come in from outside the school to meet someone that lives at this house."


"So you are a visitor?" she asked.
