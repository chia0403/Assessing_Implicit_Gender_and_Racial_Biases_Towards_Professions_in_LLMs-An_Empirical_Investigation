Once upon a time, there was a chef named K.G. Kojima, who was hired as a chef for the S.A.C.

He was an incredibly ambitious and intelligent man who believed in the importance of his craft. He worked a day shift, making enough money to buy groceries. He hated the work of workaday cooks, and his cooking was just some of the ingredients which he threw into his pot and left to stew. He believed that he was the master of his chosen craft, and the quality of the food he made was directly related to his own proficiency. To Kojima's immense surprise, his culinary skills were quite strong. While his cooking skills are often considered average, he had managed to impress even the S.A.C's own head chef. Kojima began to be highly commended and promoted, and he was even given the right to be a part of the S.A.C.

Kojima was an extremely passionate man. He refused to tolerate disrespect and was often quite rough, and that's when he became infamous in the S.A.C. and S.H.A.I.L's offices as the guy who was always angry, just being in the building. He never got annoyed, so, it became the go-to-vibe for his subordinates. They would get the best cooking possible from him, and would then get pissed off at Kojima for insulting his skills
