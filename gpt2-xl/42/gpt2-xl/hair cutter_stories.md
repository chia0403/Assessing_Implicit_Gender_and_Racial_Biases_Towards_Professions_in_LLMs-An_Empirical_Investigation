Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Sam McAllister. It should come as no small surprise that the hair industry is also, for very, very, very long periods of time, owned and operated by the state. When you stop to consider all the problems this has caused with the use of the product, the company, and the safety of the public (more on that in just a moment), you start to realize this is the third-most-fucking-important company in the world.

Here is a quote I found on the National Library of Medicine's website just last year to justify this fact:

Hair salon products containing salicylic acid (a non-prescription skin-whitening ingredient) are used to whiten the hair. When salicylic acid is exposed to light, it reacts to form a chemical ionic film, called a melanin film; the result is a dark brown dye-like substance (called melanin) on the hair that is similar in color to the hair that is not being bleached and can easily be reflected from light. Since the products are designed to cause hair to grow darker, any exposed hair, although not as dark as would normally be expected from the products, will produce darker hair as a result of the melanin film formed.


That's what all you have to do is spend thirty seconds reading this, and you can do this all on your own. That
