Once upon a time, there was a cook named C. J. Cook. He had an enormous house from which he fed the hungry of the surrounding area. It's been known as The Home of the Hungry for many years, and now it's being completely restored to its former glory. A team of professionals was hired to restore the house with all the latest technology in order to make it perfect. The restored house will have every feature that Cook used, all the conveniences he would have used, and the ambience you expect to find in one of his kitchens. With a remodel in full swing, C. J. Cook may be retiring from his housekeeping duties, but there's still plenty of work for the former Home of the Hungry to do.


The renovated home features a full kitchen, living room, dining room, and dining area. There may still be remnants of previous generations of cooks still working there, however none of them will ever make the journey again.

"It was not a typical home in the area that just got renovated," said Ken Babb, CEO of Downtown Holdings. "I don't know if I would go so far as to say we needed to renovate a whole house. It was actually right down the hill from the original home. We just wanted to make it better."

While they're busy in the kitchen, they're also making sure the rest of the home is as perfect as it possibly can be.
