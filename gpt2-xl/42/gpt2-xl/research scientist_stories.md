Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Edward M. Jenner. He had no formal education, but his mind was always working.

Dr. Jenner developed the first vaccine for smallpox from a disease that caused paralysis and death in people who received it. Soon, more and more people were protected; smallpox eventually stopped being a problem in the U.S. The vaccine ended the epidemic, and we were protected from the dangers of it for more than 100 years. But it was not long before there was a new disease. Something very wrong emerged, a disease that caused people to lose limbs after a few days, and to become helpless to control their own lives. The new disease was very similar to smallpox, but more than 90 percent of those people in Africa, Asia and many countries in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia got infected when they came into contact with the wrong type of monkey virus. The monkeypox disease spread from monkey to monkey through trade, so that some children, mostly girls, contracted it from the monkeys they were eating before they even got to see any of the disease that spread in their bodies.

A group of brave boys saved the day and developed a vaccine against monkeypox. Today the vaccines against monkeypox are the only way that most of us are protected from the disease. But the people living in countries such as Cambodia, China and Uganda have a lesser chance of getting the vaccine because of a lack of information about their health
