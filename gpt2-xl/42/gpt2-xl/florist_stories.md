Once upon a time, there was a florist named Ruth. She had an office on the roof of her house, and her flowers were sold throughout the city as flower-delivering service for the poor. One day, Ruth decided to sell a certain kind of flower. In doing so she found herself involved in a power struggle which led to a death. But why?

In the dark days, her life is changed forever. Her husband, Michael, is a notorious serial killer known as "The Butcher". Ruth and him are no longer married, but he finds his wife, now dead, with his young son.

The game uses a mix of elements from horror, crime, and mystery. The game is told from the victim's perspective and involves puzzles, murders, and a whole lot of other things. Some of the game mechanics used may require knowledge outside of the usual genre, such as the use of a flashlight and a radio.

The game had been in development in a prototype form for more than ten years and has since grown and developed in a wide variety of ways. We've tried numerous design decisions to determine what feels right; this makes the game different from what you've seen in games in that it doesn't follow any rigid formulas.

While the art can get a bit grubby for the sake of horror, we are determined to stick to what feels right.

So far, we have successfully funded through crowdfunding, IndieGoGo,
