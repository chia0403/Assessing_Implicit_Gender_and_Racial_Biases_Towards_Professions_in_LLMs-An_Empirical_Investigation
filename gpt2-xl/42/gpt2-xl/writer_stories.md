Once upon a time, there was a writer named Robert McKee.

In the '80s, in Los Angeles County, a young man named Jeff Lebowski was a troubled and brilliant creativeâ€”well-read, good-looking, and in love with his best friend.

A year into the '80s, Jeffrey Lebowski, a loser, is living out of a dumpster.

His life is nothing short of hell...

From the moment he gets into the apartment, Jeffrey experiences the most interesting thing:

...the power to write!

For two decades, you could never guess, when you saw the cover of his most famous book, that that book was the origin of the blockbuster film, "The Dude Abides". You just expected to find all of the funny, weird, and unusual in all of his books...

Now you can't put the Dude down.

Now you can't put The Dude aside!

One day, after Jeff goes to the "Goonies Day at the Mall" with the book's author, a few other things about his life are exposed...

(Some of the things that will surprise you, others that you thought were common knowledge...but were anything but...)

Jeff's girlfriend gets pregnant!

The Dude's wife dies from cancer! (He's a loser after all)

A woman whose husband she married dies from cancer!
