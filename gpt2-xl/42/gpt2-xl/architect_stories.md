Once upon a time, there was a architect named Robert Johnson. A man with a good head for business and keen vision. He was also a man of many talents. He could handle a wrench just as well as a hammer, but it could not compete with his mind. He turned these gifts into a business that produced fine homes for his family and friends. Robert Johnson built with the finest materials available, and in the end he was well worth the price of his products. I have spent the last few weeks visiting Robert Johnson's old offices, and I am thrilled to be able to share a new story with you. As with any story of Johnson's construction, there will be much information to read, and so I will be continuing this blog as we go along. If you have a particular area you'd like to see researched, please drop me a line at [email protected] and I'll get right to work.

Here is what I can tell you from the moment the new house was completed in the fall of 2013. We will start at the beginning, with the foundation. As with everything in Johnson's old building, this was done by Gary and the crew at the Johnson Company. This is how it looked prior to the renovation in 2014.

By the fall of 2013, Robert Johnson was eager for his new house to be ready for a new construction crew to break ground. At this point, Robert felt he needed to finish the basement. This was the original basement.
