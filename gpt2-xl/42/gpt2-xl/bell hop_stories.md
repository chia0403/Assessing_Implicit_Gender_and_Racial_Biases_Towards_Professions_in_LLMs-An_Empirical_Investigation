Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Bill Nye. This was before the internet. Before YouTube and a billion dollar advertising juggernaut. Bill Nye wanted all of the kids to go home and read his book, Bill Nye's Very Bad Day, because children were evil. A very bad day, in this book, was when the narrator said "It takes all kinds to make a world," not once but three times in his entire story. In his book, Bill Nye went to see what happened when someone made Bill Nye's very bad day, which is about as good as a bad day gets. He visited the playground of the preschools he worked at, found a girl who used a broom to try to clean up her room and made her come to him. When she was with him, Bill Nye said "It takes all kinds to change the world." The girl got sick then she got better and she used a broom to clean and she cried and then she got better and then she got sick and then she got better. So Bill Nye told her that she needed to go home to read her book. Then at the end of his story, Bill Nye says "It takes all kinds to make a world." I think this is a pretty good summation of the moral and the lesson of our world today: it takes all kinds to build a world that works for us, and it takes all kinds to make it work for each other.
