Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named Emergency Dept.

Then somewhere along the line, they stopped doing those stupid ambulance-style emergency services that are a perfect fit to do all the stupid stuff they do in a world of instant gratification.

But what if there were a system that was more effective, that was more predictable, that was more humane and less expensive?

What if we could put some smart, capable, caring people in charge of EMT training and paramedic training?

What are the top priorities of EMTs and paramedics should they be asked to enter this profession? What would be the top priorities that a paramedic or EMT could pursue?

These are the questions I want you to answer on this short survey.

Thank you in advance for your time.
