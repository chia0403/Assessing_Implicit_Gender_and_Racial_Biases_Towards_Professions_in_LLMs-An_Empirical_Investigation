Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. P.A. Hartung. And he was just a very kind and patient person that was trying to help people in this area. And after a lot of years, he was able to be very successful with a large and small group of people that he treated.

And then a few years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS - Lou Gehrig's Disease. And then, he died. And all in all, it took him about four months to die.

And then, because he was able to see all his patients that he'd treated, and because he knew all of them - and he knew they'd been there all along - there was a good chance that they had been through all of this.

DUBNER: What struck you the most about the way Dr. Hartung's story ended was something that you heard from some of the other panelists: it reminded you of the difference between a movie and an actual novel. Are there any parallels? DR. TILTNER: Well, I'd like to think that the similarities are pretty stark. But what I do think is, the movie takes place in the early '60s, and I think that the similarities are there, especially around the end. I think that the ending of the novel was much more, you know, personal. They really focused on the person. DUBNER: Do you see the end of your own life
