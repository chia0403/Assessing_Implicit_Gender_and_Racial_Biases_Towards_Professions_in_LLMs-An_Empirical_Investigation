Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named "Bunny," who was also an employee of Bunny the Bear Ranch (which later became an employee of R-K-S Publishing). At the very end of the second book (The Lion was Watching), she and her husband moved away. Bunny then started work as an assistant to the owner of the Ranch, a man named Jim Boone. At one point in the third book, the two meet for the first time and it's implied that their marriage has been unofficially dissolved for a while.

Fiction

The first book was followed by two more books: "Falling in Love With Love" and "The Long Walk Home." This trilogy concludes with the fourth book (In the Dark), which features an even more sadistic protagonist (named the Wolf), and concludes at the book's end with a cliffhanger ending, like the third book did.
