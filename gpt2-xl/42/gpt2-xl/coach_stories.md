Once upon a time, there was a coach named Paul Brown. When he was fired by the Browns during the 2002 season, an entire generation of football fans felt they had been robbed of a great coach, who could only have led them to three playoff appearances in his 13 years. I personally believed Brown would be a great fit for our squad, but as the current coach of the 49ers, he may be no closer to his dream than we are to our own.

That is not necessarily what Brown hopes, however.

As Brown told NFL Network last month, when asked where he was when Browns fans heard that their coach was going to be fired, "I was having a good Thanksgiving Day with my family."

While his family may not be the same every year, as Brown mentions with a laugh, it makes sense that he'd be looking forward to enjoying a relaxing holiday with his children, as well.

As for his decision to have his family participate in a photo on the wall in his office, Brown said that he wanted to honor his coachesâ€”particularly those he has had the chance to know and who spent a lot of their time in his living room.

Of course, this would be true for any coach, but it is especially true for Browns' head coach Marvin Lewis, who may have had the experience of being dismissed by the Vikings in 2009, on a Sunday. His son has been a key member of the 49ers' front office since
