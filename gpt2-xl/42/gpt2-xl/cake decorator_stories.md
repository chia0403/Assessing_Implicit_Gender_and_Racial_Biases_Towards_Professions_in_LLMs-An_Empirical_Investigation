Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named David Allen in the small town of Ashcraft in upstate New York. He went around every room in his house and decorated with a white cake. His neighbors asked, "What's that?" And he said, "I can't explain it. It just says 'Happy Birthday.'"
Gifts for Grandchildren
Some parents have cake decorating parties for their adult grandchildren.   Birthday parties can seem a bit excessive, with many gifts to be presented.  A lot of it is just because grandma or grandpa, for whatever reason doesn't have the money for gifts, but other gift ideas include:
Biscuits and gravy
Candy
Ice cream
Chocolate and nuts
Wine and other beverages
Other ideas: Make birthday party cards and create a birthday photo and memory album (or make card prints).
One day, David Allen decided enough was enough.  It was too much for even two-year-olds.  He decided to open the closet and pull the cakes out.  "One day cake decorating will be just like I did with my granddaughter!"   He said.  This was the beginning of David Allen's secret cake decorating secret.  
He wanted to make a cake decoration that didn't scream "Happy Birthday" in big letters.  Instead, David made it very subtle.  The message would be hidden in plain sight.
