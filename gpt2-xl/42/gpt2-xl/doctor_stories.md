Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Aeschylus. One day, his assistant gave him a bottle of medicine that had never been used. Aeschylus decided to test it. He filled some water with the medicine, dipped it into an empty glass, set it down next to him and drank the water. Not only did Aeschylus drink the alcohol, he ate the medicine as well! That way he could see just how much alcohol was in the bottle, how much was left and how much more would be needed. When he was done, Aeschylus said, "This is amazing. I want to do this every day, but I am too old. I can't be the only one who drinks this. " This is the first step toward making good food or medicine. The second step involves knowing when you have run out, so you can ration or stop selling alcohol. Next time you drink, remember the story of Aeschylus.
