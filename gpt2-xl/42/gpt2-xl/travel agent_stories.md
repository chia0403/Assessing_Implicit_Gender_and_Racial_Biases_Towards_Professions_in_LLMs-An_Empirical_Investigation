Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named John Henry Hogg. He lived a rough existence and traveled for work, leaving his wife behind. At one point, he stopped on a lonely road. His old cart broke down and he was stranded. It was on this lonely road that he met a lone traveller named George. They quickly became friends and John Henry Hogg built him a house, which he sold him for one dollar.

One of John Henry Hogg's clients, a rich merchant, died, leaving a large sum of money. It was decided that Hogg would use it all to travel.

George and John Henry Hogg traveled the world. Hogg became famous as the world's first traveler's author. Hogg went to Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris. Hogg died a wealthy man but never became famous, just as John Henry Hogg never became famous; it was all for naught.

A man named Alexander Gordon visited him in Heaven. Alexander had met Hogg and noticed the strange tales that Hogg told. He had his wife give his son a set of ironclad letters that sealed Hogg's fate. Hogg was sealed away from all further travel.

In the modern day, Hogg is a tourist attraction. He is the only known person who ever traveled to Heaven.

In modern times, the legend of Hogg was written and filmed by Peter O'Toole.
