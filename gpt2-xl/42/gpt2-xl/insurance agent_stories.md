Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Jack. Jack's job was to look out for the safety of clients' money, which was deposited in some bank accounts, like all bank accounts really. The insurance agents for most banks had a few rules about what they could do with customers' deposits—some had to put them in checking accounts, others in savings accounts, some only in insurance companies' mutual funds, and no other type of account. Jack always said the rules were just a way to ensure an efficient market, because the bank didn't have a lot of different customers clamoring to get into the same account. He was not a fan of savings accounts and always advised clients to put most of their money in mutual funds.

That was his job. There was no question he respected insurance companies' role in the financial system so much that he was happy to pass his expertise on on to them, but he felt it was his job to let them help protect customers' money with little regulation. So there he was, an insurance man. Maybe a little over his head, maybe a little too comfortable. But he had been trusted—believed.

He never heard of the guy. Jack wasn't sure it was time for him to leave. His job was just too good. He liked the office. He enjoyed the work. It was one of the few jobs in his field where he was considered a valuable employee. He did what he needed to get ahead.
