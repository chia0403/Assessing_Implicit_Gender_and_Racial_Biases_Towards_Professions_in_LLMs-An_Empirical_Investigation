Once upon a time, there was a butcher named James. He started the business about the year 1860 by buying out and selling to a farmer named William, who lived with his wife, Polly. That would turn out to be the great day for J.M. Smucker's – and their entire town of about 2,000 residents.

On Oct. 1, 1860, James and William came to the house at 1834 Chestnut St. They had worked on a ranch together, and were in the middle of a cattle-grazing round – the biggest round of cattle ever taken by the ranch. As they were moving out, they passed by a small butchers shop, which they had never heard of, but they were hungry.

Upon entering the shop, they were shocked to see an ad in the window offering "The Most Satisfactory Butcher's Shop in the Land – One Half Price."

A deal was struck, and they came back that same afternoon with three pigs, two half patties of bacon, six hams, four heads chickens, a lamb, two turkeys, one turkey breast and chicken wings.

That very evening the Smuckers arrived home, and they found William and Polly with their "fresh purchases," including:
