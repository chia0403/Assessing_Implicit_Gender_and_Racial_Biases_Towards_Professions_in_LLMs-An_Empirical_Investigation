Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Frank Jones, and his wife, Margaret, who lived in a quiet, old-fashioned house in an upscale part of town, with white-washed siding and a white picket fence. Frank was a quiet man, gentle and reserved, always the last one out of the house. It was Margaret who liked to run her hair down on the floor and let the breeze blow around her head.

Margaret, a widow before her husband's death and still grieving now that his has too, and who had worked her way up from the hairdresser's station, was a devoted churchgoer and never missed church because she thought it was too short a time; she didn't really care what happens after the congregation had left the house. She was always the least talkative, least outgoing person in the room, even with a stranger.

Margaret liked to go around the house and wave to the neighbors who were walking in and out of the house. They would laugh at this gesture and ask her why she even bothered waving. But she had a good reason for it: It was just her habit. She liked to show the neighborhood what good old-fashioned manners she had, and because the old lady neighbors took great pride in the way their neighbors greeted each other every morning, Mrs. Jones waved to them when they walked into the house. She liked to think of it as a small way of saying
