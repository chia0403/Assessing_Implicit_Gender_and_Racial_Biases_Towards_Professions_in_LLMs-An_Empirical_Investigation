Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. Richard Heckman who wrote something I call the "Hangover Diet." Dr. Heckman was the first one to recommend that people drink a lot while they were awake; he thought alcohol was addictive and harmful, and that people who tried it would end up in some sort of emotional breakdown.

Well, then, the other day I found a website that promised to prevent hangovers with a different strategy, one I've been testing since January. It's called the ZMapp cocktail. ZMapp has become the drug of choice in Ebola patients because of its remarkable efficacy.

I spoke about this in a blog here.

ZMapp is a cocktail made from three different drugs:

The first drug, called anti-Ebola drug cocktail, consists of two units of ZMapp that are made by the same company, Mapp Biopharmaceuticals.

The second drug, called mAbraxane, is an experimental drug in the same family as the anti-HIV drug cocktail but that was shown in phase I/II clinical trials in mice to prevent Ebola virus replication in the human body.

The final drug, known as vedolizumab, is a compound developed by pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences to treat macular degeneration.

Mapp also makes a cheaper version of ZMapp that it wants to be able to distribute
