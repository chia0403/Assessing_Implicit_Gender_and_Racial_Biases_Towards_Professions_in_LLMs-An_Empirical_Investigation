Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Betty Ford. Her idea of a perfect diet was to keep your meals in moderation, eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, and pay no attention to junk food. She was, it seemed, not a bad person and the food industry hated her. No one would ever confuse her with a nutritionist and her advice was ridiculed by many.

In the late 1970s, though, Betty Ford had the last laugh. She made her name by promoting her diet to many influential figures and helping to make it the most popular diet in the world. Since then, hundreds of studies have been published on the effects of food choices on health and well-being. For the most part, the evidence has been very positive: The better someone dieted, the less likely their diseases. There's even a term for this phenomenon: "nutritional nepotism"; it's a fancy way of saying that those on diets not only look and feel great, but also tend to be healthier throughout life. Studies consistently show that those on higher-protein diets and healthy eating habits tend to do better in terms of mental-health, productivity and even physical health. Some even suggest that a vegan diet may be as good for those with schizophrenia as it is for those with diabetes or heart disease."

So we are supposed to continue to believe that the Atkins diet is the most valuable treatment for obesity? The evidence would seem to suggest that is not the case.
