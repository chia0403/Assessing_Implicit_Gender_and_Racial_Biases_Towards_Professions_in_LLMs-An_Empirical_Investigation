Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Jim Larkin. A rich eccentric, he lived in an enormous log cabin on a hilltop, and lived in constant fear of an attack by a crazed white man.


One day, Larkin's wife, who was nursing a baby, died of childbirth. Jim, distraught, spent his last of his fortune and sent the town militia to investigate the deaths.


They came across the body of a young girl tied to a wagon. The father appeared.

"Jim, I can't stay here any longer, man. It's the Lord."

"Who's the Lord?"

"Jesus Christâ€”or you."

Jim fell to his knees, crushed his head in his hands, and prayed. It was the last time he ever saw his family.


The story of Jim's life and his death remains untold.

The church doesn't hold any memorial services for Jim, and his coffin is now used as an organ grinder.


The story was first reported in the Los Angles Times by former reporter John J. Miller.
