Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Jack.

Jack did not really understand what he was doing at the time—he did not realize he was laying groundwork for the establishment of the United Kingdom of Northern Ireland. Not exactly an uncommon practice among stone breakers. And yet—the Irish people still speak of the man they call Jack with the reverence of their ancestors.

The thing is—Jack himself—we do not know. He never appeared in public. He did not write a paper, or do anything except in secret, and with a few like-minded people in his company. It is likely that it is the same now and the people are just as concerned with protecting the legend of Jack from the prying eyes of the outside world as they always were.

Today I do not know what it is about. It may or may not be Jack himself. Many times I have wondered at one point in my life if Jack really exists or if he is an invention of one of his colleagues or a mere story born of good old fashioned Irish folklore. I can only guess, but I do know one thing, and that is that Jack, or just about any other legend that I have heard about, has always had me laughing with the first one that comes to mind.
