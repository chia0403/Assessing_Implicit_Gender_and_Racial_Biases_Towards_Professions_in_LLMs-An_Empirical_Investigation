Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Jerry and he fell in love with the new girl he met (his girlfriend; actually, she was the one he dated all along). One day on the highway (the one that runs between two states, where I live), he caught sight of a man and a woman walking on the side of the road, both of whom looked identical. He couldn't understand why, and he began to wonder if the people who look the same can actually be two different people. What's more, he realized his boyfriend probably has a crush upon the new girl as well, but he keeps it to himself. Jerry wanted to find out. That's why he sets all his cars on fire with gasoline. Later on, Jerry gets to know the girl, so he decides to call her up and get to know her better. He tells her what a terrible trucker he is, that he's jealous of her because she has a boyfriend, and that he's a terrible driver as well. He even told her a bit about his past as well, and that, if she likes him, he'll be a lot more attractive once he cleans up his act. Now, imagine this situation playing out in the real world. The girl sees Jerry, and, even though she likes Jerry, she knows she is supposed to break up with him. She says she has a boyfriend, and then makes it perfectly clear that if Jerry likes her, she'll leave him for
