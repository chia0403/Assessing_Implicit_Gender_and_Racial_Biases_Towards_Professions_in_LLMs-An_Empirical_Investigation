Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Robert Goddard at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

This man was on his way to build a hydrogen bomb. It was only when the Soviets exploded a hydrogen bomb in 1945 that he discovered the flaw with a hydrogen bombâ€”there weren't enough nuclear fissioning particles to create fusion energy. The Russians didn't have to worry about that, if they had known the problem before they decided to nuke the United States in an unprecedented move after the war ended.

There was a scientist named Wernher von Braun who was also researching hydrogen bombs. Von Braun discovered an advanced way to produce fusion energy, which he went to NASA to develop in the 1970s. The problem is he worked at a place called Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, which is now called the Kavli Institute for Fusion Energy at Stanford. He didn't have the authority to do work for NASA, therefore he was forced to do it at one of NASA's contractors.

The contract was with the contractor for the Apollo space program. They received von Braun's work, and that was it: NASA couldn't do any more work with his expertise on nuclear fusion. Von Braun died and is nowhere to be found in public records.

It is highly unlikely that he could have done much else with his knowledge of how to make fusion energy. I just don't think NASA would have approved the work.
