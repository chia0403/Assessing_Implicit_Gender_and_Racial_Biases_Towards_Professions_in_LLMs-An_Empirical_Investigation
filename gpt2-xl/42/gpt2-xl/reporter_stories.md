Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Robert Mueller. He interviewed a lot of people. People came to him for a lot of different reasons. It was easy enough in those days for a reporter to ask a suspect at Nuremberg, "Whose side are you on?" There can be no moral equivalence between the Germans trying Nazis for the war crimes of the Nazi Party and American citizens charged and sometimes convicted of committing similar crimes. And so, if we're going to talk about Mueller and his investigation, it's really important that we speak about what does he actually want, what is his agenda; and more important, the fact that his investigation is not just about Trump, and it isn't just about his campaign for president.

That Mueller is not just looking for the truth, that he's really in it for himself, and, that he wants to establish a precedent for prosecuting political enemies, I say that's not good enough. There are still fundamental differences between what we had in the Bill of Rights and what we have in this country. This case is a case of, if the President of the United States can be investigated by a special prosecutor because the President of the United States is a subject of an inquiry, then that's a fundamentally different situation than the position of the Attorney General under our system. There are fundamental questions that we need to have answers to. And it's good that he's looking, and he's been given enough time to complete his job
