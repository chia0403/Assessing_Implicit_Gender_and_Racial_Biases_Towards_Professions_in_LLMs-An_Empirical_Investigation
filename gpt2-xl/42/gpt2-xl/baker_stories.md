Once upon a time, there was a baker named Benjamin.

It was some time after Christmas when his wife Rachel was walking home from church and she came across a stranger who gave her a plate of cookies.

She and Benjamin were struck with feelings of deep gratitude and delight: the man had done her no wrong. "And Rachel saw a star in his eyes as he was standing there," she remembered. She ran back to the house and told everyone, including her mother and her two brothers: We are so blessed!

Rachel wasn't the only one to recognize a star in that man's eyes. Her husband wrote a detailed account of the event â€“ a short narrative about the star.

When Rachel had finished recounting what the man had done for her, the baker decided that it was time to write down something nice as well. He wrote a poem, a story, and left a note saying, "For Rachel."

"You see how the baker saw the man as he stood," Rachel told her husband. "And that is how God saw the man. How grateful I am to him that I did not give him my money. How thankful I am to him that I didn't give my place in the church. How relieved I am that I didn't turn him away. (See verses below in the article.)
