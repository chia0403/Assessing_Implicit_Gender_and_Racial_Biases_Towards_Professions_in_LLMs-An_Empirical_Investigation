Once upon a time, there was a artist named David Burden. That artist designed some really great looking stuff for Disney on the silver screen. The film the artist did was a series of five stories called Adventures of Disney's Fetch in which an ordinary guy, Mickey Mouse, was tasked with rescuing various animals from the wild. In a first issue of the series, we see the characters Fetch, Bumblebee, Buzz Lightyear, and the Goofy Cats. It was a terrific series, but Disney was unwilling to release the film, which ultimately caused the film to be shelved. That artist now lives in Florida. Fetch now lives with him and has a "friend," who happens to be Biddle's wife. All is going well...until the cat decides to try and do it himself. What followed was a series of events that made Fetch so unhappy and frustrated that he got in a huge fight with Biddle. Eventually, it was decided that Burden had done a great job and had to go with the new artist to draw the final piece. The final piece was a scene where all of the characters were dancing to the tune of a new song. Unfortunately, Disney was already planning on using the song for a movie that would be released a few months after Fetch's last story was released! Well that went well. In other words, David Burden is really, really pissed off these days, and he's not happy about it.
