Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Christopher Dickey. He was the head of The Boston Globe's newsroom, in a position that required having read at least ten Pulitzer Prize-winning articles every month. His newsroom was a mess, with a lack of organizational infrastructure, a series of conflicting and incompatible practices: One year, the paper used two-person teams, two-person managers, even one-person directors; the next year, the same reporters and editors continued working alone, in teams of three. Dickey, who was one of the paper's most visible authors and correspondents, had no sense (nor memory) of the organization he was governing. He had no interest in the details of policy, or politics. His main interest was the facts, and on the facts' being true, no matter who was telling them, the reporter would do his best to tell them. (After he left the paper, in 1975, he went on to another career in law.) The paper's business was to get the facts out there and then figure out what to do about them. The reporters did this by interviewing a lot of people, using a variety of sources, finding a wide range of answers from a range of experts, and then finding a balance between giving each party equal coverage, and reporting in their interests as much as the interests of another party. Sometimes the facts were so compelling that it was easier to ignore an opposing position, than to accept a claim.
