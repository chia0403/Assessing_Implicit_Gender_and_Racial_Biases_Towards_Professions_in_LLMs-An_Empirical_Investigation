Once upon a time, there was a singer named Taylor Lautner (or so it was written in the title of her 2011 EP, We Are What We Are).

Though Lautner never toured, rumors began circulating around the local town of Chico that the enigmatic singer had a secret second career as a serial rapist.

In January 2012, Lautner's band The Lautner Group, consisting of her and former boyfriend, drummer Nathan Krieger, released a new EP, entitled In the Air Tonight, about a girl's attempt to seduce her ex. It was a pretty standard release—nothing remarkable, but a welcome addition to Lautner's growing discography. The most exciting aspect of the release was that Lautner sang on two tracks. One track was about her struggling relationship with Krieger and her sexual escapades with men; the other was about her own sexual escapades. In the same month, Lautner also released her first solo album, Everything Is Awesome. All the tracks on the record are upbeat, catchy, and almost pop-friendly, except when they're covered by the Lautner Group—most famously, the original version of "Mama Told Me."
