Once upon a time, there was a reporter named William James who wrote a couple of papers that were very important. One paper was a short piece showing two examples of what he calls super-normal conditions or super-anomalies.

It said, in effect, as I just said, the universe behaves as if it's not a bunch of ordinary matter and energy, it's an infinite density of unknown energy.

This is an unusual type of super-anomaly. We're only a bit older than that, which is a whole different matter.

As I say, there are many things we don't understand, but what we do understand is that when the universe was very young, there was a lot of energy.

After a while, the universe goes on being a little less weird and weird, maybe more like some clouds in our solar system, a little less dense.

Even when it's not super-weird, it just has a little less energy density, which means that the universe doesn't behave just like we expect it to, which is kind of the opposite way to behave.

It has this energy density that's just very, very small, more like that of a cloud than of the whole universe.

What that means is that there's something that's making it look like this, without being in any way it. We think that's actually a super-normal phenomenon that happens only once.
