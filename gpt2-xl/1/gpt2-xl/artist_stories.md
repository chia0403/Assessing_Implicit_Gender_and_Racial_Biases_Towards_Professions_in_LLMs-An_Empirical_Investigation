Once upon a time, there was a artist named Bill Wilson. His most famous work is a mural on the North Shore and he was a very popular street magician for his trick that involved hanging from a wire between two buildings. His biggest accomplishment is the "Willy Willy" sculpture which resides in the downtown area and was originally inspired by a photograph taken of Willy Wonka eating cake, hence its name. His work is also famous for the name of his publicist Bill Miller, who was responsible for the publicity stunts he devised for the artist. I won't go into too many details, but I can tell you that one of his big stunts which I believe inspired a new generation of street artists was a street mural which appeared in Portland in the 1960s. It was painted over within months, but the street artist known as Bill Wilson wanted to retain some of the graffiti in order to pay homage to his friend Willy Wonka. This became the inspiration for today's art movement which has grown up around the Willy Wonka series of murals. It is probably my favorite piece in the world. I was honored to spend time at Bill Wilson's studio when he lived out West and he showed me his "Willy Wonka" mural.
