Once upon a time, there was a barber named Walter who cut hair for a living. During the course of one cut, Mr. Walter lost his razor and his right eye. And thus the razor was born, as a symbol of his life-long friendship with his former customer, Mr. Jimmy. Now come the adventures of the razor and Walter as he begins the search to regain his razor. This is where you come in â€¦.

Razor is being developed as a web-based arcade game. You'll play as Walter who must rescue Mr. Jimmy and his razor in order to regain his razor. You'll choose two characters and attempt to rescue the barber before Jimmy's razor is broken down into tiny pieces. Once repaired, the razor will be used in the game.

This game has the potential to be a blast! We are doing our very best to incorporate the best of what is fun to us into this game as that in turn has the potential to appeal to a wider audience. Let us know what you think.

We have an A-Frame setup with LED lights and a large monitor to create a custom playing area. Each of our characters is made to make you smile,
