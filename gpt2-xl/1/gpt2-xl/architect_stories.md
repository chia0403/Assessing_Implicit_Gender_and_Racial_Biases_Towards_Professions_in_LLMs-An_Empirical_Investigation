Once upon a time, there was a architect named Albert Kahn who invented a product called the Kapp. One night, a salesman walked into the room, took $5 cash, and said, "You have to buy this." The next week he came in with a checkbook and said, "You have to buy that." Every year, people like you and me buy more and more and more of the Kapp. Eventually, we all have, like, five Kappes in our basements.

So, in order to keep this company alive and to keep the Kapp up to date and up to our standards of technology, it's necessary to keep up with our competitors. So, the idea of this was that, what we're going do is we're going to take all the people on that Kapp who are in all these teams, we're going to group them together, we're going to have them play tennis, we're going to take a picture of them, and then we're going to put that picture in our wall as a trophy with the winning scores. And, if one of those people from the Kapp goes and wins a tennis tournament, which is a real possibility, maybe a world ranking can be determined. I mean, we have the world's number one player in tennis on our Kapp team and we're going to put that picture up to show how well we did.
