Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Tom. Tom was a kind guy who loved working with his hands. As he was wrapping up one day, it occurred to him that there was a little bit of extra time left.

That was the inspiration for an experiment.

He took an extra 15 minutes on the weekend and mixed up the following four medicines together. There was no rhyme or reason for the order, but everyone that observed said his concoction worked just as well.

Tom decided to test the formula out. It worked every time.

Now that he was sure it was the right recipe, Tom continued to experiment. The following concoctions were developed and tested many times.

In the end, he decided to call it his own special little formula. He kept it to himself (some of his friends did not trust him anyway).

Tom was a gentle soul, but he was not without his own fair share of problems. Just about every day in the summer heat, he would be drenched in sweat and running out of things to do.

So one day, he told his friends and family that he was going to take a two month break from his job. If they wished to continue with his idea, he would have them pick up the slack.

But with no one willing to take the time, Tom decided to make it himself. He made the potion together and then placed his bottles into a hidden bag
