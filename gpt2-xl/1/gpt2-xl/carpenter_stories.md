Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named William Bate, and he loved playing with carpenters' square blocks...

A square block is a square shaped table-like object. With a bit of practice, you can bend it to the shape of nearly any object you can imagine (this is one reason why the blocks are so popular for building things). If you can bend a square block to fit over a barrel, it will probably fit over anything it's not supposed to fit over.

If you can't bend a square block to make it fit, the shape of the block becomes an issue. For example, if you are trying to fit a rectangular block over a square barrel, the block won't fit. That's normal. You must bend a square over a barrel because the square part of the square has an edge which can't turn. The square part of a square piece of wood has a diameter that is larger than the barrel, thus blocking that part of the square form turning.

When you get up on top of the block and start swinging the metal or wood back and forth (either up and down), you will get a better idea that the round block fits this rectangular barrel. Just as you'd expect.

As usual, if you are stuck on a mystery and need a solution, I'm always happy to help. Just drop me an e-mail at:
