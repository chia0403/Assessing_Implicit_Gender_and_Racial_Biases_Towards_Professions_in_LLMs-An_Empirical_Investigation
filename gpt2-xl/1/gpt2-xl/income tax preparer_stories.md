Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Bob who took it upon himself to prepare and file income tax returns for his clients. Bob was a highly competent person, and he really enjoyed his work at helping people, but his clients were becoming more and more irate with Bob because of the number of returns to which he and other preparers submitted. To avoid the burden of filing his own returns, Bob decided to hire a very competent and experienced public revenue agent named Frank to file clients' return for him. Frank was a skilled tax preparer in his own right, and he was well paid to do so. Nevertheless, the clients became more annoyed with Bob, complaining and pointing to his poor record-keeping skills as a reason that he should do the work of a tax preparer.

Frank never claimed that he was competent on his own, nor did he ever say that he was better at his own job than Bob, but he did claim that tax preparers don't file returns because they think they are too dull. A number of people pointed out in response that tax preparers are supposed to file taxes, regardless of how they feel about what Bob and Frank did. So Frank asked, why did his clients insist on having him prepare their returns?

Bob decided to find out, and he hired Frank to prepare his clients' returns. Frank, who did nothing but file these returns and make copies of the income tax information, was actually less skilled than Bob
