Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Richard Ponder who was a terrible job candidate. He had been in the hospital with a bad case of bronchitis, the virus that causes pneumonia. A nurse told him that he couldn't start taking the job until he had a few days of rest. Ponder was worried that he had missed the end of one of his classes, and when his assistant refused to tell him which week it was, the first-year teacher went back to class and was fired. He sued, and a federal appeals court upheld his grievance. Ponder sued his assistant, who settled out of court. The school district paid back his fees.

This didn't make Ponder any money. But it does make me wonder how different that same situation would have gone if he had simply told his assistant how much time he took in class: "Oh, I was taking one of these half-hour, fifteen-minute slots. My assistant thinks I was taking five of them," he might have said. He might not have lost, but he might have paid back and never considered suing again. The law is hard on those who do that kind of thing.

The same logic extends to the situation in Kansas. Ponder told his assistant that he wouldn't be able to make it to one of the classes he missed. His assistant explained that it would cost Ponder more than $1,000 to return the teacher's money or to buy
