Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Michael. He was a nice guy. He worked for an agency in Phoenix and worked on a few players during the off-season and into the season. Michael became so used to the trade deadline, that when the clock struck midnight, in his heart, he knew it wasn't midnight anymore. The drafting worker must have felt the same way.

Michael knew the clock was ticking and he knew he was at the final draft pick. Michael is a big man and a great defender. With the number of picks in this new draft, it is very likely that there will be a few centers drafted with the #9 pick in the draft. The center position on defense is thin. The position is as deep and tough and gritty as it gets in the NBA. Not only are centers hard to find, they are very expensive to acquire. They are the center of the defensive zone. Michael was looking forward to playing the centers he has dreamed of in college and then he could move onto another team. He was going home to his family. Michael was also a very passionate and funny guy so he would have fit right in with some of the other teams that were having drafting parties the next night.

Just as the drafting worker had thought, Michael was no longer a prospect and then, Michael felt a deep pain as the clock struck midnight. "I got drafted to the Knicks at the last minute." Mike's father had just told him.
