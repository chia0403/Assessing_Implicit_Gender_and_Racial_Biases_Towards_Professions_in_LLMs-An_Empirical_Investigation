Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Ann in a tiny town in Iowa where the cows never got so much as a day or so off, not even to mow the lawn, and the pigs kept dying of fleas. Ann's name was the one you never heard until finally discovering her in a graveyard, which is why you never hear her again.

One day, Anne (Ann Miller, who knew her better as Ann), was making her way to the cemetery when an elderly couple met her, and Ann was told to "hold" them while they took in her. Anne was a little too eager and was soon caught. Ann knew she would have to make a deal. The price for an "unofficial stay in their home," Ann agreed to pay for this, was that in 24 hours, two of the people she was visiting — the lady herself and the man's wife (and Anne's future mother-in-law) — had to kiss each other (which they didn't).

Anne was so caught up in her scheme that she couldn't keep herself from kissing them all, and ended up with a pile of kisses, including the husband's daughter, her mother-in-law, and Ann's future mother-in-law. Her plan was foiled, however, by the husband and his wife, who insisted that Ann had never been there for them in the first place and that they were having a civil conversation which would be best
