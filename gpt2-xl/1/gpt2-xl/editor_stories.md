Once upon a time, there was a editor named John Kincaid who was trying to get a film made called "Rapture."

What Kincaid wanted to do was to do a film of a man who gets the power of God to move mountains - but all goes wrong.

It ended up as an R-rated film, and the church took it down.

That's when the movie business began to realize it could make a lot more money and make some profit.

But first they had to show a few million dollars of profits before people would start getting the idea.

This is how they did that.

They had a fake man get the power of God.

He did an acting for an audition.

After hearing what he put into it, the movie guy said, "Okay, you know, I get it on the screen."

That's when the church got the idea to make it a movie. "Do You Want To See The Whole Movie?"

So they made a lot of money from the fake production of "Rapture."

When the movie was done it opened on TV. It was huge.

So then the company put them out. Then when it really began to break out you can start seeing the name "Masonic".

And that is what is going on when you see a movie - it is being taken out of Freemasonry.
