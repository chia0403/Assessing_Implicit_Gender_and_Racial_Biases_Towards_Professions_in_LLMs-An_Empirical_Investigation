Once upon a time, there was a author named George C. Martin.

This author spent the majority of his days writing fantasy novels in the year 2003. The books he wrote had become wildly popular after his third novel, the highly controversial A Game of Thrones, was published in the year 1997.

In 2003, Martin was a professional writer for Game of Thrones, The Lord of the Rings, and many other fantasy novels. He had his own publishing house, a large number of professional editors, and was writing for other fantasy and science fiction publishing companies. He was also, perhaps unfortunately, one of the most hated individuals in the fantasy fandom.

His first book, the novella A Game of Thrones, had already caused a bit of controversy due to Martin's controversial decision to split the novel into three separate books. This was done due to the massive cost of publishing three separate fantasy novels was too large of a risk.

This split also meant that the story could go on for many years, since there was no need to break it into two major arcs, as would have been needed in the case of a standard three book novel. Due to Martin's massive success as a fantasy writer, it became clear why people were so annoyed with him.

Martin wrote fan fiction, like many authors do. He did so because he enjoyed writing it. As a writer, Martin was able to draw inspiration from his works and write stories for his fans.
