Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named R. J. "Rick" Broussard, who operated a local spa in Wauconda, Illinois, and worked on the grounds. He had a very famous client: George Washington Carver. Carver was a well-loved Civil War general who served with great skill on the battlefield and later took refuge from the Civil War in southern Illinois. But, Carver's love of nature and gentle nature cure-alls led Carver to call Broussard to his house. The reason was never revealed, although it has become known that Carver died of an infection caused by an insect bite.


The scene depicted in this photo is the courtyard of Rick Broussard's home. The room above the main entrance was used for entertaining, and Rick lived in a separate suite called the "Couples Playroom."


The playroom below the main entrance. Rick Broussard's son, Ed Broussard-Rhodes, helped decorate the place on the day of the photo.


There's a very nice view through the windows from the upper floor, overlooking the courtyard. From the lower floor, the view is not so nice, but you can see the front yard of the Broussard home.
