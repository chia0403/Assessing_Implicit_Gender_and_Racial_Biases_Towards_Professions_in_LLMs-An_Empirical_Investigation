Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Harold Kohler.

Kohler's office in Denver is the center of an unusual and growing dispute between the IRS and tax lawyers â€“ one that pits lawyers against each other who have sworn an oath to enforce the law, and federal prosecutors against a government agency that appears intent on shutting the office down.

In one of the most stunning and controversial incidents of tax lawyer-client separation in recent years, Mr. Kohler was told by a top IRS tax analyst last November that he was "likely" to be indicted by prosecutors within days of his deposition in the IRS Scrooges case.

According to federal court and court-appearing testimony, the indictment was coming. That was news to Mr. Kohler, who told a federal witness at his deposition that lawyers usually get more notice of prosecutors' intent to bring criminal charges against them.

On the same day Kohler had met his IRS analyst at trial and said that prosecutors were likely to indict him in the Lois Lerner probe, a second prosecution notice went out that it is against federal tax law for a government lawyer to say anything about "the criminal investigation or possible prosecution" of another government lawyer.

The case is an ugly example of the tension between private attorneys (lawyers who, like Kohler, are in the business of representing taxpayers, typically in tax cases) and government prosecutors tasked with enforcing the law.
