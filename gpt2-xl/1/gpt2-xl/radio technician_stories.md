Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named John Williams. One day when his job was done, in an empty warehouse, he had been staring vacantly at his watch. There was only an hour left. He had made no plans and this was his first time sleeping on a job. It was the kind of situation he was never going to forget: He was working in a high-security building in a city he had never been in, yet it was the last time anyone would ever hear his voice.

Williams is one of several people who have come forward in the last month to accuse Donald J. Trump of sexually assaulting them. The stories of multiple accusers range from sexual harassment to unwanted kissing and groping.

"I was a 12-year-old boy. I was alone with a man who I assumed was my father," one woman told The New Yorker, recounting how Donald Trump groped her. "Next thing I know, I'm coming up for air, and he's pushing me against the wall, and he's yanking my pants down. It was not consensual." Another woman went onto the Today show and said Trump tried to seduce her during a business trip to Mar-a-Lago when she was 24.
