By the early 1970s, almost all the English-speaking world had access to it. And yet, only a small proportion of the world's 4.7 billion people, including those in the most advanced countries, could read, write, or speak a basic text-based language, such as Chinese or Japanese, that we use at home. We could, but there is no reason why we should.

A good way to look at the world is to focus on all the people who could read English, write it and speak it, but not in some other language. That would be most people on Earth. And yet, they can't even do that today, in some countries, because the English language—the technology and the infrastructure required to make English usable—is not ready for widespread use.

So the question now for everybody is: Why will it be ready for usage in the next few years? There are three big reasons: the Internet is going to make the English language much easier to learn; smartphones and other devices are going to make English even more usable; and the availability of new technologies—such as 3D printing and a world-class repository for medical knowledge—is going to make it so people can read,
