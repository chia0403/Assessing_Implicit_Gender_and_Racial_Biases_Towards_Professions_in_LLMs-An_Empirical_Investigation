Once upon a time, there was a guard named Captain Flint and before him was a king who was also a guard. The king was a bit too hardworking for his own good. After his death Flint was ordered to be executed by a giant stone hammer. But the king decided to be the hero and the guard tried to stop the giant stone hammer from leaving. But all the guards were too busy trying to stop the stone hammer from breaking the hammer or trying to pull it away from him. They were too busy standing around or not doing anything to really stop him from smashing the giant stone hammer and the giant stone hammer was too big and he was too heavy and hit the guard too hard and the giant stone hammer broke open and it just smashed into all their bodies and there was blood everywhere. That's the best way I can describe this story. That's how awesome it feels when you find that thing you love because you can't help but get really excited when something you love is awesome. And we found that thing. The book that was meant to be the most expensive book I have ever tried to buy was worth every single penny and if you have the money, buy this book right now. You wont regret it. Nowâ€¦I'll move back to my life.
