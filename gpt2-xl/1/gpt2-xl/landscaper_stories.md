Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Benjy. He didn't like working on the lawn, so he decided to fix a little something up.

Benjamin Franklin, we salute you for your ingenuity!

Benjy started by using a hoe and raked the lawn. He then used tweezers and scissors to carefully cut the grass. And then, a little ingenuity came out; Benjy used a saw to slice a tiny window into the lawn. He then carefully used a rope to pull the window out!

The end result?

Benjamin Franklin and his little cut-and-cover scheme.

No one was around to see Benjy's genius, so he just covered up the window with a tarp.

Benjamin Franklin, what's wrong with your lawn!?

No one knew Benjy's plan of operation so no one cared and the window eventually fell down as well.

I know this won't matter. There's no harm in a little bit of fun here and there. However, if any sort of punishment comes your way, the last thing you want is your neighbors yelling at you. What'll they think? You're a dirty rich jerk who stole part of neighbors' lawn!

Oh the irony.

Thanks to the man who gave me the inspiration to tell you about Benjamin Franklin.
