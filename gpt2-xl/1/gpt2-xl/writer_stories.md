Once upon a time, there was a writer named Mark Twain. Twain was a writer of fiction rather than nonfiction. But this is of no interest now, since he wrote so much fiction, not so much nonfiction. Since, as Twain made fun of himself before his death, he had nothing left to say, he decided to write some more fiction rather than the same old thing again, but as a character instead of as a real person like he had been before.


One day after a visit from Jack Palance, the man who played General John Sherman in the movie "It's a Wonderful Life," Twain walked into his hotel room. But that wasn't what happened. What did happen, was his assistant said to him "What's up, Jim?"


At first, Jack Palance laughed at him for walking in, even though it was Sunday. But what happened after was something so outrageous that people have been laughing ever since. He just walked out.


That had nothing to do with him and everything to do with his wife, Clara. She was really crazy about him. It just didn't matter to her who was writing about him. As long as she could sit back in her chair and tell her husband how much he was like that person that Jack Palance played, she didn't care if it was a fake or not.


Clara even convinced him that writing nonfiction about himself was bad. He just couldn't get the words out of
