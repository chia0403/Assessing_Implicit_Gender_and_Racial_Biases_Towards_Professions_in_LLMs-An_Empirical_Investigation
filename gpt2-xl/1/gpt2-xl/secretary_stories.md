Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Martha. She was the best secretary in that place! She used to get an award for being the best secretary, ever!! The staff was so jealous that she only had one of those, so she would buy the first one. That was her best one ever, because she would always get awards for it.


One day, they found out why she was so popular. It was because she was the only one who could be the Secretary. So, she thought she couldn't do anything else, so she became Secretary.
