Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Tim Berners-Lee. In the early-to-mid-'90s, he had a simple idea, which came to him as a flash of inspiration while he was coding the World Wide Web. "Basically, I wanted to create a system that let people create an open, public, dynamic encyclopedia of information. That way they could search and browse it at will, and could add content to the encyclopedia to build new entries. That was a good way to solve the issues with book-scanning systems and stuff like that."

When Berners-Lee was 16, he and a friend from school hacked together a primitive browser for the computer class he was taking, then taught the new code to other other students. Berners-Lee, whose passion was playing video games, became fascinated with the technology and its potential for making the world a more social and communicative place, so in the course of his studies he became interested in computing. Today, some 15 years after the Web's creation, he's the de facto face and chief technology officer of the World Wide Web Consortium.

"One of the big lessons we've learned is that we need to have an open-source platform to enable collaborative work," Berners-Lee says. "Not just a place where content creators can keep their data. We need to give everyone, particularly entrepreneurs, the tools to share their new ideas and content." He pauses to reflect on
