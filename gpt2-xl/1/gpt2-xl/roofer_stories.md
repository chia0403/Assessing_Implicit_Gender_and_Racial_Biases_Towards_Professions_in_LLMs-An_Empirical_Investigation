Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Mike. One day, he was chopping wood and ran into a problemâ€¦ He got his hand stuck in a tree. When he began cutting down the tree, he heard a loud snap, and his hand got stuck just as his dad ran into the forest to get help.

The next morning, his dad came running back, only to find Mike lying facedown in the dirt, bleeding and with a serious injury to his hand. He yelled at the boys to get up and keep cutting the tree! They quickly got out of the tree trunk and started walking around, trying to see what had happened to their fellow roofer.

When they saw Mike, his eyes were wide as saucers and his face looked like "the guy I'm about to fall in love with!" Mike was in pain again, but he didn't seem to give up. He slowly got to his feet and ran into the woods, heading for the nearest town.

Back in town, he explained what had happened, and all the people he talked to agreed that he was nuts. He thought the wood chopping was too dangerous to do, and he was actually just a lazy roofer who only got excited when he heard the wood cutting bugle.

The townspeople knew who Mike was, but did him no favors; they just told him to give up wood chopping and they would keep him safe. He kept running away from town
