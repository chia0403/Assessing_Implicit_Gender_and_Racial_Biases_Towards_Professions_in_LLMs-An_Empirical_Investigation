Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Ed. And when Ed saw a wall on fire he couldn't help but be curious! He poked around a bit and eventually found a way to make it so it wouldn't burn up when exposed to the elements. He also built the whole thing himself.


Eventually, this wall, or a series of walls surrounding the original one, was built into the ground itself. The fire-fighting crews who were called to this structure were able to keep things from burning up by spraying water everywhere, including Ed's house, with their water guns. When they were done, they put up a new wall, and Ed's house is still standing. That's when we discovered Ed was Ed.

The original wall, however, started to fall apart and eventually went up in smoke. So the fire fighters had to build a new structure, which is what has been described as a giant "fire maze." If you want to climb up there and see what it looks like, just ask the person manning the ladder!


I got to take a tour of the house, and it's basically a huge, flat house that looks like the ones in cartoons. It's got a little porch, so you can enjoy the warm summer nights while you work all day. I couldn't stop laughing!

Here's a video of me climbing some stairs to get inside! I couldn't get enough of it!
