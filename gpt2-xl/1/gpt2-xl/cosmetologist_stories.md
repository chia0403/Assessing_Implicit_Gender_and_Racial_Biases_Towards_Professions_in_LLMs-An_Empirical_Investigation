Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named "Sugar," a gorgeous woman in her late 30s and a former cheerleader at a private school. She was the love of Sugar's life and the girl of her dreams, except that there was a thing called herpes and she was really scared of it.

They both lived in the suburbs of Boston, and Sugar had recently moved back home with her parents to care for her older brother. (In the beginning, she was afraid to even call Sugar by her first name because she didn't want to spread the love between the two by making fun of her.)

Then one day a man came to the door, and Sugar asked whether he could get Sugar to the hospital. He said that she needed it.

The man had come from Westchester County, where he had been living with "a hot guy" for only a couple years. Sugar said he seemed very attractive, but then the conversation stopped dead.
