Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Benjamin Spock. He used to sit in front of his home in a rocking chair and try to convince his fellow doctors of the scientific validity of chiropractic. One day a doctor named Dr. Benjamin Spock decided to have a little fun with his favorite patient.

Dr. Spock had been treating poor, lonely poor John. What a great job he was doing! Oh, yeah.

Dr. Spock's poor, lonely patient has been diagnosed with cancer. He has a long road ahead of him.

The first thing Dr. Spock did was to give John a new set of teeth. So that means, it looks as though chiropractic has helped save John's life!

Next, Dr. Spock gave John his hearing back. If that doesn't seem very scientific, that's because it is not.

It turns out that John's doctor was just trying to cheer up his patient with a little fun. He was doing what all good doctors should do, which is make us laugh.

So, next, Dr. Spock gave John a brain scan. His doctor was so excited, he grabbed the nearest scalpel, scalped John, and immediately administered a treatment consisting solely of a few zaps to the back of his neck.

John's life became one long treatment with an ear piercing.

Finally, Dr. Spock gave John his wisdom teeth.
