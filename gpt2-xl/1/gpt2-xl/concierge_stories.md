Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Jim Jones. He'd taken over the building after his father, Jim Jones Sr. died of a heart attack.

Jones went from being an owner of one restaurant to owning a chain of 24 fast food chains. The story is that in 1970, Jones put a bomb in his father's restaurant that killed six people. It seems that Jim Jones Sr.'s son was responsible for that. Jim Jones Sr. died of a heart attack three days later. Jones Sr. was buried on his mother's farm. But I have to ask my self, "If Jim Jones Sr. got killed in my father's restaurant, then what did Jim Jones Sr. do after that?"

No. Jim Jones Sr. didn't run the restaurant, like you'll see when he does one of his infamous interviews that go viral. No, he took an ownership stake in the company â€” a stake that he sold.

The company was going to be called Family Restaurant; I guess everyone thinks of it as that.

It was built in 1956. Jim Jones Sr. owned 49% of the company. After the explosion, he didn't want the company name changed so he made the same investment again and took the stake back, this time taking it fully. The company went on to sell for a substantial amount. I believe the stake was worth $10 million or more. My guess is that the company would have been worth more
