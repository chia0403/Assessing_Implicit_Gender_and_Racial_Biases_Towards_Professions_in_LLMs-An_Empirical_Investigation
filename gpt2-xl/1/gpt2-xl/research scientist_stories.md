Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Richard Feynman, who also had an undergraduate degree in physics. When his friends in math-plagiarism enforcement couldn't get him to drop out, he took one course (a non-math one) in quantum theory, a subject that I'd actually loved at the time because it so beautifully reflected what I was into (the human condition), and to this day I still love it. But Feynman never dropped out. He continued to write, publish papers, and occasionally give talks, until his death in 1988. When I first heard that a Nobel Prize was being awarded for his theory of Quantum Field Theory (QFT), I was more than dubious about it; in fact, I was completely convinced that it was a hoax or that it would be awarded to a theoretical physicist named Saul Perlmutter (a colleague from Princeton and friend of Feynman who also once held a PhD in quantum field theory) - and of course it was only because I have Feynman's name on all of my things (including my computer mouse) that I was ever able to trust these rumors. At any rate, I was thrilled, with my physics degree in hand, when I learned that the Nobel Prizes had been announced. After learning that the Feynman Prize was named in his honor, I was particularly surprised to learn that the Prize would be awarded in honor of a major theoretical advance, called Quantum Electrodynam
