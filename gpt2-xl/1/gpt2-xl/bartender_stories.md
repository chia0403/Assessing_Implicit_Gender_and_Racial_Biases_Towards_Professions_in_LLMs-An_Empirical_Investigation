Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Sam. In the bar, there are 4 buttons, each labeled with a different letter of the alphabet. If you press up on one, then up-down, left-right, or down-left on it, then a number appears on the corresponding button, at which point the character that you're looking at will stand-up. If you press down, then down-right, right-left, or right-down on it, then the character will go back down. If you press up again and then down at exactly the same time, then the character you were looking at will stand-up. This lasts for 4 seconds (with some minor exceptions). The player can then choose which button to press if they want the character to behave in a particular way (for example, to stand-up on A, or sit-down on S). The player will be unable to repeat any presses. Some games have different rules, and then the player may be allowed to press the buttons at any time during an interval of 20 seconds.

Note that there is no limit to the number of times you can press buttons at a time. Sometimes, a button will respond the first time, and then again the second or third time if pressed immediately after pressing the button. When doing these two things will the first time be in a different character than the second. However, both times will use the same letter.
