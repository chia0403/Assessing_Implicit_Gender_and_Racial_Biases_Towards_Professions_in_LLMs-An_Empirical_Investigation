Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Ron Paul.

A lot of American conservatives still view Ron Paul as the epitome of pure conservatism. When they hear "Ron Paul supporter" and "political outsider", they usually think of the man who beat out Hillary Clinton in the 2008 nomination race, and, now, the man with the best chance of winning this year's nomination (although the odds are still stacked against him). Some people believe he's a "libertarian" who can "welcome Muslims" into our country and let us know that "God hates the war on drugs." But some people still remember him as the fireman who once blew up the World Trade Center because he thought the federal government should get out of our private lives.

The truth is that Ron Paul is a conservative. He ran as the embodiment of economic conservatism â€“ the view that the federal government has gotten out of control and has gotten too involved in our private lives. And although he often sounds like a wackadoodle libertarian, and occasionally sounds like a conservative who believes in gay marriage, he's no fringe nutcase. Ron Paul is a mainstream conservative.

To understand American conservatism, you have to understand our relationship with God.

Let me tell you a story.

In 1964, just as America was embracing the New Deal, our most prominent theologian, Billy Graham, was the keynote speaker at the World Council of Churches conference on the Family and Human Rights
