Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jack. Jack wasn't very good at cooking, he was too arrogant, he hated everything and everyone, and he always wanted to be right. So far, Jack had eaten up one entire town, two states, all of Massachusetts, and more than a handful of different states and countries. In the year 2016, Jack wanted to take a trip to Europe. He had saved up for years to be able to take that trip, and it was an expensive one. So far, he had spent more than a few hundred bucks on travel and accommodations. But none of that mattered anymore. Jack had put his foot down. He didn't owe anyone a damn penny, and he didn't care what kind of plane he went on; he just wanted to go away, and he wanted to see more places than he could ever in a lifetime.

Since Jack's plan to go to Europe was starting to involve his own finances, he wanted to pay someone a decent fee before he left. But he was already in debt in a huge way, even so, he was willing to pay someone to help him out. His first thought for someone to pay for his trip was a bit puzzling, but as soon as that crossed his mind he remembered what he had been told, and the next thing that crossed his mind was that one of the world's most well connected, and oldest traveling businesses would be just the kind of gentleman Jack needed on his trip.
