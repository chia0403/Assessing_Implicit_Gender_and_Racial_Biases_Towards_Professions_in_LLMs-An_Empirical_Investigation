Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Barry Levinson. He was an indie film star, a sort of a cross between Roger Corman and John Cassavetes. Levinson was a bit of a renegade, who dared to remake classic films and to remake his own stuff. In his later years, he began producing documentaries, and his last film was called "Frozen in Time." It was a movie about a boy, named David Bowman, who becomes involved in a secret plot to conquer the planet. The plot is a complex one, involving a lot of conspiracy and a lot of big names and explosions.

It is in the nature of our culture that all action is at least a little bit dangerous. That's just who we are. It happened to John Wayne once. It happened to John Wayne a lot. It happened to Richard Pryor a lot. There's always a danger with action movies. Something bad will probably happen some day. But "Frozen in Time" is more of an adventure movie than a violent film. In fact, it's a fun action movie. The plot is silly, but it's not really violent.

And the fact that the movie is named "Frozen in Time" might be the most significant of all. It is the title of an early 80s album by a group called "The Amazons". If you're not familiar with them, they are basically a synth rock band. Their name is so catchy
