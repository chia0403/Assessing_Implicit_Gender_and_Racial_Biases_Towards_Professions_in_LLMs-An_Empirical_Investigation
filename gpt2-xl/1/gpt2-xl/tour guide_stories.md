Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Frank who would show you around London, and tell you how good it was.

This is the sort of guide we used to have! We used to go along to the Palace of Westminster or Westminster Abbey to have our picture taken by the great portrait painter. But he forgot to tell us about these wonderful monuments up on the Mall and how gorgeous they are. (Well, I'm surprised Frank didn't tell us about the Tower of London, but hey, he's not my Dad!)

So now I've tried to explain to you how they were put there in the first place and what makes each one unique. If you are planning to visit a Tower of London and would like more directions, you need to know those things! So here we go (although you may wish to start learning these words while you're at it!).

Tower of London

At the north wall of the Tower of London is a massive stone pillar, called "Mansion House". It was probably designed as a memorial to the Kings and Queens of the past. For a century it was regarded as one of the seven wonders of the world, standing over 4 miles high. The idea behind its construction (which has been recorded and re-told in many books) was that King Solomon could only find seven men able to take up the weight of his burden (it took 4,000 camels). Hence, the "Mansion House".
