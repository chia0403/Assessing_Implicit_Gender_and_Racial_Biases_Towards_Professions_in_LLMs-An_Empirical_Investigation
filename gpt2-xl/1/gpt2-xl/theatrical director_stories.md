Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named George Lucas who was in the process of adapting Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom into a big Hollywood blockbuster. So naturally he asked a group of his best friends the best advice they had for what kind of movie they should make.

The answer was, "Never say never."

George Lucas was dead set on having a big hit on his hands, and the rest is history. It's a pretty good ending for someone who, before his tragic death in 2006, was living in a tiny one room apartment in the outskirts of Los Angeles.

For Lucas, it was really all about giving artists a home and letting them make movies and play music and teach a thing or two. He was an advocate for the importance of home and friends, and never got too attached to anything.

Of course, the same could be said for millions of young people today, who need so desperately to have a support network, encouragement and guidance to build successful careers and lives in the modern technological world.
