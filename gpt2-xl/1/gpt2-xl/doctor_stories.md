Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Who. There was a lot of speculation about his character: Was he going to be this sexy character, or this brooding figure? Then that character got to be even sexier! Dr. Who had an enormous fan base because he could do two things with women: He could get them to sing and dance on their hands or toes, and he could get them to put their face in his groin. We call that "flirting." Well, Dr. Who's sexy part in life was probably getting him a lady to get close and kiss on.

That's how he got that hotness. It's a little difficult, because, of course, women are attracted to other women. But what made us love Dr. Who was that he was a real person. He could talk to people, and tell jokes, and make people laugh. So this guy, that really was a guy who did interesting things, and had fun with women, and got them interested in science. We wanted to bring that personality into our show. We wanted the female characters to be really likeable. We wanted them to be funny and smart.
