Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Walter Hill, and he had a reputation for being a masterful storyteller, and a keen eye for detail. This is how his final film script for Pulp Fiction begins: "A.G. Burnett, my assistant, and I were going down an alley at night in L.A. late one night, and there was some type of sign I'd never seen before. The sign read, 'Treaty Room'. If I ever find out who wrote this, I will kill you. I will find out where you live, and you will pay me back, I tell you."[10]

Pulp Fever came out on VHS in November 1992. It was nominated for two Academy Award Awards: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Score. Quentin Tarantino won and the Best Original Score went to Hans Zimmer.
