Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named David B. Wasserstein in Brooklyn.

He was there at home, just as he'd been forever before, reading the Newsday (NYP) morning edition. It was 11:10 am on October 23, 1983, and David was sitting at a breakfast table in his modest little one-bedroom apartment â€” still very much the kid you met on the streets of Greenwich Village.

A few years later, David was out walking his dog, a short black and white dachshund named Stella, as the sun was coming up over the borough of Jamaica. He heard what he describes as "a high-pitched noise."

"I pulled Stella out of my pocket and looked behind me," he recalled. "I could see smoke coming up from the building of which my building was the top floor."

David was stunned. The blaze had been deliberately, fiercely fanned by some 30 neighbors. The smoke was filled with flames. There was smoke pouring out of the window on the left side. David did not know what to do; his mind went to the fire alarms in his building, which had been disabled hours earlier when the building next apartment to that building caught fire at 1 am.

David and his neighbors knew the smoke was not coming from outside the building, from his neighbor's vacant apartment above. But it was as black smoke. David had been accustomed to seeing only white smoke
