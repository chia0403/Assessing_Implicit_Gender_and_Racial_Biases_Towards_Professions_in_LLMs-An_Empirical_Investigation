Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Robert Dabney who carried a bag of chicken wings from West Virginia to Maryland.

One night, as the trucker crossed the bridge from West Virginia to Maryland, he was approached by a trucker named James Brown who asked him, "Did you get everything on the other side?"

"It was only a few days" later, Dabney recalled. "I had to turn around and go back."

"Just one more day and he would have got away," Brown added.

That's the old story.

But there's a twist to the story.

The truck driver, Robert N. Dabney II, was never accused of stealing.

Brown was sentenced to 55 years in prison and served 30 of them. Dabney was charged with two counts of theft — and was sentenced to 41 years in prison.

When he is released in 10 years, Dabney said he plans to do some reading and write letters to his two sons, who were only about five years old at the time of the alleged crimes.

"I have two sons now who don't exist on this earth," Dabney said. "They live on a lot of memories — all those memories where they rode in the back seat when there was no room for them at the front."

The Dabney family also lost their home, the Dabney farm
