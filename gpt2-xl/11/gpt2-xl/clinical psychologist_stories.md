Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. Ruth who helped find effective treatment for people struggling with their fears and phobias. I will go ahead and assume that she and her clients had never considered gender dysphoria to be a true fear, and that the idea of transitioning was alien to these people, and therefore they couldn't understand why they were uncomfortable with their bodies.

Of course, that's how it goes with the trans community. Many may experience the term "transgender" as a way of describing a gender they're not comfortable with, but that doesn't make the dysphoria any less genuine: it's their bodies they're uncomfortable with, not the bodies of others.

I was immediately convinced the individual meant only to be referring to the feelings expressed by patients whose bodies didn't match their gender identity, so I quickly wrote a post about this mischaracterization and, later, linked to my story. Over time, though, I realized that I was making a very poor argument against gender dysphoria in general â€” I was arguing that people experiencing those feelings aren't actually "transgender" and actually experiencing gender dysphoria should be dismissed because it's "unjust."
