Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Jack who did a lot of the odd jobs for the folks who picked up and delivered the mail. Well, his family got tired of the long, arduous journeys he had made, so the next logical step was to let him do all the work and be paid for it. But then Jack discovered a loophole in the mailing rules and decided to get rich. After he convinced his family to drop the "out-of-town" mail, he started a mail delivery business employing only men. By this time, the mail was not getting to its destination, so he started to invent a mail truck to bring it to the next address. The mail truck got more mail and more customers until finally the family decided to sell Jack out, and had him arrested on fraud charges. They never saw the mail truck again.

That is exactly the sort of loophole that we should be thinking about fixing. We would not be "out of town" if we stopped doing "over-the-top" jobs so people "cant make ends meet." The most common excuse that one hears to justify not contributing to the US economy is that, if I got up in the morning, I could just pick up some extra work. Sure, if you can't be bothered (or haven't time to do it), just pay someone else to do it for you. If you have an extra skill or an extra time, try going through the system.
