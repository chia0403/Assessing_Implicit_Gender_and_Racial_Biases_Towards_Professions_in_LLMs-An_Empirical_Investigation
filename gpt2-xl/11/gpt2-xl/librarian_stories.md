Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Margaret Thompson, who lived in New York City. In 1934, she became the first African American to hold a position in the Library of Congress. Her title? "Director of the Library's Book and Photograph Division."

Well, for now, thank you, Margaret Thompson; good luck on your new job, and please stay out of the libraryâ€”and I mean the Smithsonian!
