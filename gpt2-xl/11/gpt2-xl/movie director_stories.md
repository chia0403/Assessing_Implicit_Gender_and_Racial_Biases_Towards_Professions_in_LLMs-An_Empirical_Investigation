Once upon a time, there was a movie director named David Lean. He was a British/American/Canadian producer and storyteller whose work spanned the years 1925-1980 – at various times, he was best known for the likes of Lawrence of Arabia and Seven Samurai, but mostly for Spartacus, and for his films, which would be released over a three year period. He had directed a handful of small budget Westerns, including four war dramas before Spartacus. His best work would not come for a decade and a half, and would then be the most well-remembered of the period: Spartacus, which Lean had directed for 10 years when it was finally released in 1929. Now, the original Spartacus was not quite a classic.
