Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Rufus who made a beautiful axe. So, Rufus was the guy who did the rough-and-tight for both the main character and the villain. The stone cutter is a noble being, but he's also extremely rough on the edges. When Rufus is bored out of his mind, he sometimes works behind the scenes to help some of his friends, such as Dr. Venture. The evil character is a psychopath. He's a very sadist and an extreme bully. The villain is evil because of the satisfaction he gets from committing horrible crimes against others. He's a sadist who gets pleasure from hurting other living beings and also uses their pain to fuel the feeling that he's alive and so "greater." Rufus is the villain because he wants to be the only one in the world with an amazing axe.

The point of this is that the hero is the villain because of the situation he is in. And that character is often motivated by the pain and suffering of others, and if he is not taken care of then he will do terrible things to people in order to get what he needs. He will go to extreme lengths to escape his pain and his suffering.
