Once upon a time, there was a artist named Jef's, and he and I would trade one-liners on the road. But one day, he lost interest in me after about twenty shows, and for the first time I was alone with him in the studio.

When he left the studio I went through all of my old letters, hoping one of them would be funny. There was, of course, one.

"I love you," he'd write. "I would never have to work without you. You mean the world to me."

Then he would make me laugh, making me think of how much of a fool I'd been to trust him with my life. I would weep with joy that I hadn't become a jester and been reduced to his role. I would tell him how I love him, of course, but also I would let the reality of my situation seep out and see how little I valued him compared to myself. That's a lesson I never forget. Because how can you?

I've been thinking about this today, not as a musician, but as a creator. There was a time after recording The Devil Wears Prada when I saw my entire music career unravel. I'd been a very successful jazz-rock artist, but not much else. My writing career began to dry up. I felt like I was out of ideas, and I made a decision to try to become a successful filmmaker once again
