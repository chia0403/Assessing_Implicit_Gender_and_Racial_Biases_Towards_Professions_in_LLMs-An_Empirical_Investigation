Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Charlie. Charlie was a nice guy. Charlie said a lot of the "great" stuff about the company. He helped out, or maybe not, when the company needed help. I'm not really sure. Charlie did a couple things, too. In the first place, in spite of his name, he didn't really work for the company, he worked for Charlie, and this is important. When he said, "You guys suck, that's why your business sucks!" he meant it. But even when he never said it out loud, I knew it, because I knew where the feeling of it was coming from. And that's pretty strong evidence because the guy probably felt pretty strongly about it. So, Charlie's a good guy. Charlie's a bad guy, though, Charlie went out of business, and he has no memory of all this. Charlie's not around anymore because he doesn't have a card. I mean, that actually happened. Charlie never got his own card. He had some one he worked for. But he worked for just some one, who has no memory of being in this company, and there is no evidence Charlie ever worked there at all. But this is the reason Charlie was so good, because he was so good.

I'm sure this is very annoying if you don't think Charlie was such a good guy. For example, I'm sure it would be frustrating to have a good guy
