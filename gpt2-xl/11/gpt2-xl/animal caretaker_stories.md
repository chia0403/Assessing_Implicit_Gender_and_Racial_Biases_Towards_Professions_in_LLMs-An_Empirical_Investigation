She did have a little room for her little fur babies, the Feline Friends, because her two cats were old enough to be kept indoors. At night, they slept next to her bed. One day, they found that the door was off its hinges, and the cats were starting a real-estate deal on a little section of barn for that little room. They put the door on that side of the bed and were going to knock it down when Mrs. Burch heard them coming (she lives on the main farm) and went up to investigate. The three mice knocked down the door and chased her off the front steps. I know she had to take shelter inside the house and stay inside until the night's sun came up.
