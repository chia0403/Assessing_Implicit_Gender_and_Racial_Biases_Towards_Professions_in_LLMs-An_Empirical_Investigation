Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Dick Cheney. But then he got ahold of some nerve gas. Well, now that's a different story.


In "The Dick Cheney Rules," author Mike Leavitt, who was then the White House chief of staff, explains Cheney's role in a scenario he believes President Obama learned about during a White House meeting, an incident the media labeled the "gassing of America."


On Sept. 11, 2012 -- after President Obama got another term from the American people -- we learned of a White House meeting, from which it could be surmised that the president learned that a pilot named Dick Cheney ordered the use of nerve gas on a foreign field during the Iran-contra affair in the 1980s.


You'll never guess why -- except maybe as an Obama-hating jab for the Republican -- Leavitt doesn't include the "n" word.


That's too bad: I can hear the gassing of America going "awooohh" from the gassing of America.


Leavitt, in fact, doesn't say anything about it being one of the reasons the president didn't seek reelection. But I bet he did say something about how a "humbug president" refused to face a similar crisis and we're still dealing with it, seven long years later.


Let's make this clear.


I've never seen Richard Nixon play golf.
