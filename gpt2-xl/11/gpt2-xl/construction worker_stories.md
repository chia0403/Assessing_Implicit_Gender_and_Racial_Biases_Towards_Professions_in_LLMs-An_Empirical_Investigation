Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named John who was fired because of his inability to use a computer. And he decided to work as an Uber Driver, using the money he was owed from his old job and doing his best to pay off the remainder of their severance. But when John's income plummeted, his ex-partner turned into an Uber Agent, and now they're robbing and killing customers who were supposed to be paid.

This story is told in the first person because it is a true story, but because of the structure of Netflix Instant by way of The Killing, The Killing can exist as a stand-alone thriller when it comes out on October 9th, just months before The Killing arrives in theaters. Instead of a slow burn, Netflix Instant will provide a very satisfying series of twists and a series of revelations that you'll want to wait for.

This is why every person reading this review will have been a fan of The Killing's prequel, The Bridge, as I did. So, on that note, let's not make this sound like I'm complaining or whining about The Killing. I loved it. I loved the ending. I loved the character development. I loved the way it was handled.
