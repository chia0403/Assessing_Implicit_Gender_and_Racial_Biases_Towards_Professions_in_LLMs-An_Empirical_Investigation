Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Ben Carson, who believed that his cure for all of our ailments would be by applying his special, hand knotted "chiropractic" to his face. But in light of the fact that his cure was not only ineffective but downright dangerous, he gave up the practice.

Since then, we've come to the realization that some of us are born with spinal cord disorders. These disorders are called Spinal Seizures. Most people don't realize this, and if they're even aware of it, they may not be able to properly treat or even recognize what the syndrome is or who they might affect.

So, I'm really glad to publish this article today entitled: "Spin the Spine Syndrome: Why It Matters and What to Do About It," which aims to provide a brief overview of the Spin the Spinal Seizure Syndrome and some of the resources you'll find helpful in the treatment of Spinal Seizures.

Here's the bottom line: if you or someone close to you is suffering from a Spinal Seizure disorder, these resources can go a long way toward finding relief and/or addressing the issues that can lead to the Spinal Seizure Syndrome in the first place.
