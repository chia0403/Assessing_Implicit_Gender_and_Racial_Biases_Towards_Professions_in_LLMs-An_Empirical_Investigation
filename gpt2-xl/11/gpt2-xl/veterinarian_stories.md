Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Tom Williams. He taught us all a very important lesson: that a single day of antibiotics killed most every life in your body.

Dr. Williams was one of the most respected vets in America, and he ran a practice in Florida that was respected by his peers for its humane care.

One day, Dr. Williams was out for his walk when he saw a stray dog in the parking lot of a local pet store.

He took the dog to his clinic, and then gave him antibiotics.

Almost immediately, the veterinarian said the dog had no pulse.

The poor dog was then put on a respirator, in a medically induced coma, and eventually died.

The next week, a man on Facebook posted a message titled "Tom Williams. I have a dog that died from antibiotics," and many people commented on how unjust it was that a poor stray dog should have to suffer for the actions of a veterinarian.

Unfortunately for Dr. Williams, his own actions brought shame upon him.

It started with the "Tom Williams" Facebook page. That page posted a picture of an injured labrador named "Toby."

When someone commented that Toby was going to die unless he went to the clinic, Dr. Williams responded with this comment:

I did what I was supposed to do. My clinic is only 90 seconds away. If this happened to any dog
