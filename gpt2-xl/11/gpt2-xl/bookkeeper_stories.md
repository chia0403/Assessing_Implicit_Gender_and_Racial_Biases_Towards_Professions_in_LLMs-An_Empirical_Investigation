He lived in an old home on the outskirts of the town, where he worked in the basement counting and calculating the money needed to keep the entire town supplied. Cade's wife was always late taking care of her mother and the couple lived a mundane life â€“ but Cade always thought his life was a bit more extraordinary.

One day, he found that his wife had died. So what did this mean for him? Well, in a fit of anger, Cade had set out to find the culprit behind her death. But, Cade did not stay in that life for long.
