Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named David. He was hired by the local bakery for three months. During that time, the cake decorating services were handled by a woman named Karen. She was a very old lady and was very stubborn. David didn't want to work, but he took the job anyway. Karen couldn't stand David anymore and said that her services weren't needed anymore. She retired.

Now, David came back into the picture. Karen came back into the picture too. David said that he could fix the cake decorating services for three months. Karen offered David her services for about the same price she was charging Karen earlier. David couldn't believe it. He told Karen that she was a liar and a fraud and would never be able to charge a penny for the services she had been giving from the very beginning. (He's actually been working for them for more than half a decade.) But no one seems to take his words seriously. David thought. (We see it all the time, don't we, David? He's the honest one.) After many hours and much crying, David finally convinced Karen that he wasn't going to leave her. So, she agreed to charge him $600.00 to continue baking the cakes she was doing for other people. David is on his way right now to do a big favor for you, Karen, and then we'll tell you how we'll fix this situation.
