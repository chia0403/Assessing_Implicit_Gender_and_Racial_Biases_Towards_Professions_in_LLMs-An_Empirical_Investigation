Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Jack Webb.

WOULD YOU WATCH WEEKS TO WIN IT ALL?

"WEEK TO WIN IT ALL?"


It is one of those "what if" questions. Webb knew every team in the NFL and wanted to see how they would fare in a simulated game; and did so.

When the league was still competing for supremacy, Webb ran with a team headed by future Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath. "WEEK TO WIN IT ALL" was the title of a movie Webb wrote.

Webb was not just a play-by-play announcer. He was a producer on the program, having served on staffs with Gene Stallings, Marshall Faulk and other Hall of Fame players. Webb was the founder of the NFL Radio Network. He loved sports. His passion was NFL. Like his idol Joe Namath, Webb was one of a kind.


The film "WEEK TO WIN IT ALL" is available on DVD and is being rereleased as part of an extensive TV deal with the NFL. A lot of you will be hoping not to miss the release.

In this article, Sports Illustrated writer Doug Kezirian and former NFLer and Hall-of-Fame broadcaster Paul "Rip" Ripken, Jr. talk about the history of "WEEK TO WIN IT ALL" and Webb's experience with it.
