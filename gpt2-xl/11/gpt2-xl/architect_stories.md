Once upon a time, there was a architect named J.E. Cuthbert, who created a remarkable model of the modern city designed for the National Cathedral in Washington. One of the most fascinating features of the Cuthbert plan of the late nineteenth century, if not the very early twentieth century, was the system of high-rise and apartment blocks, called'mixed use developments', with different uses but for nearly the same housing types which still thrive today.

Cuthbert thought high-rise buildings and housing units in high-rise structures made cities more efficient and were better suited for the modern American city. They were designed to be affordable to the working class, affordable to African Americans in the west where there was a very low proportion of black people, while making much bigger money per square foot for the middle class; affordable to the white and affluent.

This is the model of modern American residential housing which has persisted in most American cities through the years.

That same model of high density with very high levels of use of mass transit and streetcar systems by the working class, is what is so lacking today.

Most public education, even elementary education, is delivered on motorized or monorail systems with no public buses, with the majority of children, even elementary school students, being on a bus system by the time they reach middle school and even by high school.

In today's world, high density is no longer the answer.
