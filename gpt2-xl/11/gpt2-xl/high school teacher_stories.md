Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Bill who, after the high-school drama that was the previous year, decided that the best response to the students' complaints that their teachers lacked respect would be a show of respect. For those of you who've had the pleasure of teaching in elementary school, this is actually kind of impossible — you're not supposed to show respect at all! So Bill had an idea.


Bill was all ready to spend the next year trying to get rid of as many kids as possible who weren't respectful of Bill. But he had this idea in him — a sort of cosmic plan: After the high school drama, I'll have all the kids in the class come up to Bill where he's standing, and they're going to all turn their heads and look right — and Bill would give everybody one last lesson while he stood there watching. He's hoping that the kids will all turn their heads to look right at him, for no other reason than they enjoy looking at Bill. And then they are all going to turn to look up. It worked!
