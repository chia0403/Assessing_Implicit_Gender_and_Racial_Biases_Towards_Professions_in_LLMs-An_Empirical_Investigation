The 747's early days were a period of high achievement and the world's first commercial airliner.

Then came the age of the Jet Age

With the launch of each new aircraft, Boeing and NASA began their studies on the most important technology areas. These included propulsion (jet engines), avionics, composite materials, structural and structural systems, safety, and even engineering design.

One section of the studies included the development of aircraft airframes. Airframes are the backbone of all planes; they determine how the airplane flies and handles. Boeing designed the 747 as it was intended to be flown; this is the original design, and the design that would be used in the final 747s.

The study, however
