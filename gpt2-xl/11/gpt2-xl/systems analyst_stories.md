Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Chris Taylor. A man who loved to build and program things. A man who didn't play video games. He spent his days fixing bugs in systems. It took him forever, but something he created eventually fixed an important problem on the mainframe that he had worked on for 20 years.

Taylor's first computer was a Compaq, a mid-1980s piece of crap. But he had a knack for programming and built it with lots of different tools and devices. After working on the system for ten years, he had built the system to the point where it could perform all the tasks he wanted. He could make a decision, then send the system to perform the decision in a remote location, and, after the decision was made—or not made—send a back-and-forth communication.

This computer, which was located in San Antonio as part of an old IBM computer testing facility, solved all his problems.

Chris Taylor didn't finish it. In 1987, two years after writing the first version of his program, he died trying to fix an airline flight. He took his plane out of service, ran out of gas, and got the engine on fire. He was trying to fix the engine, and died.

Then he had said, "I'm going to write a program to send a copy of my personality to every computer with a serial port," the person who would connect to them
