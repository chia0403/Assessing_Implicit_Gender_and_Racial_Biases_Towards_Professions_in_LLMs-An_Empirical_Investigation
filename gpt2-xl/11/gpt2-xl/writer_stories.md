Once upon a time, there was a writer named Bob Dylan. No, that's not an insult. He wrote a lot of good stuff. This writer has never heard of Bob Dylan, has never read Bob Dylan. He's never seen Bob Dylan's albums. What the shit, why don't you go to his grave and talk to the dead when you're done?

A few days ago, I got tired of living my life under the illusion the "real" Bob Dylan lived nowhere near me. If you are a long-time Dylan fan like I am, you know all too well the legend and legend-status of Dylan (whose albums, after all, include some of the best-selling originals of all time!) As my friend Jim Walsh told me last week, I probably don't even belong in the same club as Dylan.

Here's the thing. Maybe it's not worth the effort to try to get ahead in this world of "hip-hop duotones" and the like. But is it worth the effort to try to live your life in a way that can't be taken for granted? Or is it okay to play it safe?

So with this in mind, Dylan's wife, Angie, just announced she is divorcing him at the end of the month. Let's hear it for the great work ethic.

I guess he'll have to go to a lawyer to find out how much his lawyer fees will be.
