Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Joseph who had a pretty good reputation in insurance. He could look at the world from the opposite side, and he knew how to judge people. People would try and get his business.


But not Joseph. People didn't want someone who had an opinion other than money. And he became pretty angry with the people who would pay money to read about someone else going to a great convention. He'd take this other guy from a city 10 hours that he spent driving out there, he'd show up with his wife and take his wife out, she'd give her best shot, then he'd leave her to die in the car because she wasn't good enough. And Joseph was like, "You're not good enough."


But then this new agent came in, and Joseph was like, "Oh, that's nice. What is it about you?" I really liked him, but Joseph couldn't get any new business.


The idea of someone who didn't care very much about doing your work and just liked seeing what was on the other side that you weren't seeing. This guy thought the rules didn't apply to him, that you don't have to get paid for doing your work and that you can choose your audience based on who you want to do business with. So now it's his job.


So the guy's gonna get his day in court, right? So he's gonna go to court
