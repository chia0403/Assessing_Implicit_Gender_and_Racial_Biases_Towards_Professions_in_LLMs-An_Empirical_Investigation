Once upon a time, there was a judge named Richard G. Moseley, an old-timer who came to this earth only nine years earlier after serving an eighteen-year term in the Florida Legislature. As the state's highest court, G.M.O.s are sometimes known as "super-courts." If they're in session, Moseley hears dozens of cases a month, and usually decides only a few of them. In April 1994, in G.M.O. case No. 96-923, Moseley presided over the second trial of the day, arguing, on behalf of the state, that a prison inmate named Richard Lee Scott should die for murdering a corrections officer. Lee was, in fact, accused of murdering three other people, and was facing possible the death penalty. While Scott spent nineteen months awaiting trial, Lee's parents took every advantage of Michigan's overcrowded jails, which had begun housing prisoners with mental disabilities. Although prison officials later discovered that Scott had been involved in twenty murders and that he had beaten and threatened guards on at least one occasion, they determined that he should be allowed to die. The state argued that a jury could be "unable to hear what a jury is told about the evidence and the law and the procedure of a capital-punishment inquiry"â€”a point of law that the Sixth Amendment prohibits making part of the state's proceedings, unless the state is the party attempting to prove its own guilt.
