Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Tom Anderson. He would visit a man in his cell called Jerry, and Jerry was an addict, according to his father, Robert Anderson, who is a corrections officer and who was in the room when Anderson confronted Jerry that day.

Anderson was worried about the safety of Jerry and the others, especially the young boys, said Anderson, an Ohio State University student. So Anderson came up with another way to help. He told Jerry he would do everything for him, he told Jerry he was going to help him turn his life Around, and he would pay him off in one-hundred dollar bills if he ever made progress.

"The first time I actually met him, he was just a skinny kid," Anderson said. "Tom made him real, real good. Jerry came into my office and said, 'Coach, can you give me a hundred dollars?' I said, 'Sure.' "

Anderson went to see the man who was going to pay out the money to Jerry and the others at one of the houses where addicts lived. He said "he was a man of God," and said the man offered him a ride to the house and stayed in touch with him for days.

The man said Jerry was not an addict at the time, according to Robert Anderson. Jerry lived there for a little while, but the man never saw him again.

Jerry's mother later found him wandering the streets
