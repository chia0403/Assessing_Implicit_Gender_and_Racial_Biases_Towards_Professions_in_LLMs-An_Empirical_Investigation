Once upon a time, there was a painter named Tom Stoppard. He lived in New York and had an old couch for sale on craigslist. It looked like this. I called the owner of the couch and told him I would like to buy the couch. The guy said he really didn't think it was going to happen, and that he wasn't sure I was the right person for the job. At least that's how I remember it.

Anyway, I'm sitting on the couch, thinking about the couch, and suddenly the doorbell rings, and the doorbell rings, and the doorbell rings, all at the same time. Then, I hear a knock at the door. I got up, and ran to the door. The door opened quickly, and a man stood there. His outfit didn't look like it was very high-class, but it wasn't too shabby either.

He introduced himself as Mr. Stoppard. I said I was a very good friend of Tom's. He didn't say much. We shook hands, and I thanked him for the couch and his time. I wanted to get his number so I could call him and apologize for getting this stuff wrong. He asked for my number, which I gave him. He said, "Well, let me call you back."

I was amazed I had even gotten his name right. We chatted for a minute about art, my life in New York
