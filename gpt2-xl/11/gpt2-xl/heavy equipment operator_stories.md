Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Danny who worked at a truck factory on the outskirts of the city that supplied the city's industries. One fall day, while he was loading heavy equipment into the truck, it began to get stuck on a frozen river.

This was a common occurrence at that factory. It was in the town of Nalga, which was roughly 150 miles from the state capital of Elko, in the west. It had an unemployment rate of 90 percent. Most of the residents were immigrants from Mexico or Central America and most saw little chance of working outside their home regions in the mining and logging industries. As a result, the factory was one of the few places where locals could sell their work. The city was a place where people worked hard and played hard, and that made it a welcoming place for the undocumented.
