Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Dan. He was friendly to the community as a whole and everyone enjoyed seeing him on the road. Eventually, Dan lost it, decided to strike out on his own, and the town got progressively less friendly to him. As he was driving alone one night for the first time, in the throes of a mid-life crisis, a car pulled out in front of him, smashed into him, ran over his leg, and dragged him for a short while out of his car.
