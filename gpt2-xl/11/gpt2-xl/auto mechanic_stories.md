Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Bill."

"Bill?" It's the least I can do for helping the world forget about Bill. He's had a terrible time.

Curiouser and curiouser, I tried every name under the sun for the family's other daughter, but no matter what I said or said incorrectly, she always stuck to her first name, as if that were a constant and irrevocable part of her identity.

"And now there's Charlie."

I didn't know what to call her so I just took off my glasses and said "Charlie."

Charlie stared at me, blank with shock and confusion. I didn't understand why she'd react so different to my first name.

"And now there's Megan."

This time she looked right at me and gave me her full attention.

Megan looked a little like a dog, which might explain why she's such a docile dog.

"This one's Sally." I said, not realizing that that's the last name of the family's youngest daughter. Sally was the middle name, which confused her further. She looked at me for a second, then pointed at me and said, "That's Charlie's youngest sister, Megan."

I didn't know what to do. A moment later, Charlie jumped off the truck and ran over to me and asked if I had a dog in a wheelchair.
