Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Thomas Trenchard... he had a wife named Sally by the way... but when the war broke out, they decided to be married... both had the same idea... but when it was war... a lot of things would happen... so it wasn't really a married couple. But in time... when Thomas had decided to help out at the town smithy... he got sent off to war... and his wife left him to start taking care of the town house... and the farm just went downhill from there... you might not like his wife but at least you know that we need you in the fight! And now this... this is the way to keep it going! There's a lot of jobs to do! What's yours?
