Once upon a time, there was a professor named Robert J. Sawyer, whose lab would have the misfortune of having some of his mice. So, when the mice moved someplace different from where he expected, he went to his home computer to see what the hell happened.

From what he saw, it appears that the mice did not make it far in their travels before they fell asleep, but even when they woke up, they just kept falling back, unable to find their way home, but mostly just wandering in circles. It's not too different from the mouse in the video at the top of the blog post.

The researchers believe that the mice could have fallen asleep due to a change in the way the mice are used to sleeping. Most people wake up very early to eat or exercise, so that is an unusual sleeping schedule to begin with. They are also used to going to their environment in short bursts so that they can catch up on sleep if they're still running on adrenaline.

It should also be mentioned that this study was done in lab mice, which is a different form of sleep compared to a cat, dog, and so on.

I'm sure that one day there will come a time where people will look for better ways to help you fall asleep, since it seems the best you can do is to take as many naps as you can get away with (and try not to get up too many times). And it's very possible that
