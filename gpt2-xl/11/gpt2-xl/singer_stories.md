Once upon a time, there was a singer named R. Kelly and he was really popular... R. Kelly didn't deserve this [abuse allegations], but now he can't escape from it, either. The people who are mad at him, they're mad at us. People are like, 'I don't like him, but whatever,' and then when the music stops, they're like, 'I wish the music was always on!'"

Kelly's attorney, Christine Lepera, says there will be no trial, but adds that he plans to "continue to fight this case vigorously."

There will be no trial, but there will be much legal activity.

The alleged victim, as part of the settlement, is seeking non-disclosure of the settlement terms in any criminal prosecution. She wants her name and the settlement money to be protected from public disclosure.

She also wants any future charges dropped and is asking to be allowed free legal representation.

But her case, in some ways, is emblematic of the ongoing nature of the allegations against R. Kelly: The alleged victim does not want, nor does she really even want to see, the alleged perpetrator going to trial.

"He has already got a big, fat cheque from his attorneys," she said of Kelly.

So what?

Kelly, 54, has spent more than 20 years in the spotlight -- a career that even earned him an Oscar nomination
