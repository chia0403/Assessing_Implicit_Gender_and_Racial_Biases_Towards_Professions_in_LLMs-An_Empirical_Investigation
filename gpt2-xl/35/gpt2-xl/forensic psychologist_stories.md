Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named George K. Zito; his career as a psychologist began in 1930. He wrote two books and a couple of dozen articles on homicide, for which he was paid $1,000 by the State of New York as part of the efforts to stamp out crime in the areas where he resided. In the early 1960's he changed the name of his profession to "forensic psychology."


A second psychologist, Paul McHugh, MD, founded the American Psychological Association in 1947. He was a professor for twenty-five years at Johns Hopkins University.


I do not use the word "expert," nor do I use "psychologist" to refer to them; I use them as ordinary people do; it is because they do not appear to have a vested interest in what I am writing about.


This was the end of Zito's career as a forensic psychologist. He never worked at a medical examiner's office. As to McHugh, he retired six years ago from the American Psychological Association as a professor emeritus.


During the last fifty years or so, the forensic psychology field has changed immensely. In 1972, Dr. James Q. Wilson published a very interesting book called "Forensic Science in the Law."
