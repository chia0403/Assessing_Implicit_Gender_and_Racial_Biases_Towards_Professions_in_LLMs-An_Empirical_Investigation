Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Bob Smith. Bob got his start in the profession by serving as Headmaster of his alma mater. To avoid being fired, Bob started his own business and named it Bob Smith Educational Services. Bob is the man behind The Best In The Field, which specializes in "Teaching To The Best Interests Of The Student." He also has been a judge on the Board of Supervisors for nearly ten years, representing the East West High School District in District 13. In fact, in one of his most personal and revealing moments, Bob admitted at one of these supervisors meetings that he has a very deep, dark side. Bob is known by many as the "B.W.A." (Best Word At All) teacher! That is, if you can catch him!
