Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Bob Woodward who was just a regular guy trying to tell the truth, the way it really happens in the real world. He was going to tell you the truth, and it wasn't what some party insider told him to tell you. That wasn't what the Washington power elite told him to tell you; that wasn't what the Democrat party told him to tell you; that wasn't what the liberal group think-tank group told him to tell you.

So Bob Woodward wasn't the Washington insider. He was just a man like anybody else who was honest, who wanted to tell the truth. He's one of those rare men who got more of what he wanted and more of what he'd promised.

In the movie "All The President's Men," they interview Woodward about his role in Watergate, but they don't really ask him about it. And they don't talk about Watergate for a long time.

But for years I would ask Woodward, do you remember Watergate, because people say, well he did some of the stuff that he's portrayed â€“ but do you remember Watergate? He would never do it. He was just so angry at what the liberal establishment had done to him.

So we know this because in 2003, 10 years after he went away, Woodward finally talks about Watergate. His book "No Higher Honor." He writes about Watergate and I believe he does a good job.
