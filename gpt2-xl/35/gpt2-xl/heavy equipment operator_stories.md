Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Mike in Michigan who's "life began to change the first time I put down a heavy-duty tool," he later recounted to me. I was just another stranger on his back, working on a heavy metal pole for eight hours in the summer. I started to enjoy it a little more. Then Mike saw a girl working the same job. "I got a kick out of seeing her struggling with the same tools as me," he wrote to me. "I guess that's how life begins."

At first, Mike and Julie worked the same job in the same city. But eventually, he took a second job in another city. In a way, I think it was this experience that sparked a new life for both men. Mike had more freedom and Julie's work started to feel more real.

The difference I think Mike and Julie felt was that Julie's job meant she actually got to be paid. Her work was meaningful to her. I wish what Julie was doing wasn't more valuable only because it's easy. But it is. Work is hard. And making yourself valuable to employers is a huge part of getting good at it. So if you're not doing it, that means you aren't really doing it.
