Once upon a time, there was a coach named Rex Ryan. After taking the New York Jets to the playoffs in his rookie campaign, Rex finished with an overall record of 13-24. In the midst of the team's collapse the Jets reached out to former Eagles defensive coordinator and three-time defensive MVP Brian Billick.

Billick, who had previously coached Bill Belichick's Patriots, had been cut by the New York Jets in 2009. Billick, like Jets owner Woody Johnson, was determined not to make the same mistake twice.

Billick returned to New York in 2010 in a role as an NFL analyst for Fox network. He quickly installed a defense that was a radical departure from his team's previous scheme. While many fans were initially outraged, he quickly began garnering criticism for his unorthodox formation and tactics. Billick was eventually forced to resign after the Jets finished at 8-8.

Rex seemed to have an uphill battle against Billick and his former colleagues during the offseason. As noted by Pro Football Weekly, a source from the coaching search firm that was handling it said, "If you're looking for coaching candidates with extensive playbooks, the Bills are not it."

The Jets were ultimately not able to find a suitable replacement. With that, Billick returned to New York. At the same time, Rex hired Sean McDermott. McDermott was a former NFL defensive coordinator and offensive coordinator that had been fired by the Minnesota Vikings a few seasons prior
