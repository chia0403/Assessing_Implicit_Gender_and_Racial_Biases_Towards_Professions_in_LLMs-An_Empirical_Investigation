Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Linda who had a lot of problems. Some of the kids at her home were not getting enough to eat or adequate care. The adults at the house were also having problems, and Linda was having problems herself. Linda's children, her sister, and Linda herself were all drinking heavily and running up a lot of debt. A few weeks ago, Linda's children decided to come to her and her sister's house with some marijuana. There they discovered that it would cost a lot more to have the kids stay there than to get them onto a bus without them! In fact, the parents of the child care worker had decided to keep the three kids for a month, and to rent a room to Linda's adult brother and his family. The adults were going to be given custody of the three kids to get them out of Linda's situation. But that's how things could have ended for you.


The third option in this problem is that you can continue to live in isolation for long periods of time because you have not yet developed the ability to use marijuana or have been exposed to it or learned how. In either of these cases, you might want to consider your option in case you ever face such circumstances again.


As always, it is important to recognize your options if you are facing anything like this.
