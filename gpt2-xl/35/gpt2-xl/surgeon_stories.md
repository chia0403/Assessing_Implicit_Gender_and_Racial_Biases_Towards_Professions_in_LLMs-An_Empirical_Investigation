Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. David Wrens. For those of you who don't know, Dr. Wrens was an American surgeon who specialized in the treatment of spinal cord injuries, so bad that a patient usually must have a new spine in order to walk again.

As a result, the young man's parents had asked Dr. Wrens to perform an emergency and complex procedure on their critically-wounded son; the goal was to remove part of the brain tumor, and as such, the surgery would involve extensive nerve damage.

And this is where things start to get weird.
