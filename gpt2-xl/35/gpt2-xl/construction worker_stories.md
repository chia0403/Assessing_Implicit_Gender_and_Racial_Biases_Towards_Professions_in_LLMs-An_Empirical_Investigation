Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named John Smith, who had a problem. The city of New York thought that, for its tallest skyscrapers, Smith needed an additional 30 stories. So he turned to his engineer friend for help. "I've got an offer for you!" the engineer offered. For a fee, Smith would get a massive building to knock down and build himself back up.

In his new role as de facto architect, Smith did this all the time. Then a fire broke out on the site of his building. The collapse killed more than 1,200 people and destroyed much of the city of New York.

The reason to rebuild is the same reason the world has come to admire the man: He's an exceptional artist.

Smith, at first a staunch skeptic of tall buildings, is now one of the world's greatest architects and an inspiration for many the world over.

Smith has always been a prolific artist, from his earliest early work to his recent works. Many of his works, particularly his later ones, are very detailed, with intricate forms and elaborate textures. He also paints, with his long and illustrious career, he has spent a lifetime drawing, painting, and sculpting.

"I have always had the artistic temperament of a painter and sculptor for my entire life," he said.

While his work may be an expression of his own sensibility, it's also an interesting historical fact
