Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Sallie McFadden. As my mother later related to me, as a twelve-year-old with one of her childhood pals, Dr. McFadden went up to her, and the boys could only watch, as she turned her back and then pulled open her pants and bent over. The doctor had something in his hand. She was not only a woman but an elderly woman, and was bent over half-naked. The doctor was on the last stage of a technique known as spinal manipulation. So the kids on the playground had some control over Dr. McFadden, and the doctor was a student of such techniques, and he took it all in stride, just the way we all do with our parents nowadays, and the kids were very excited."

The truth is that chiropractic exists to create as little pain as possible, and its history is littered with failures to provide this. The medical communities have had a long and complex search for treatments for conditions that have the potential to be serious; patients that have been sick enough often need more than a simple checkup. "That's in addition to the pain," says Hahn. "I'll give you an example. If someone is dying of cancer and they have a lot of pain, chiropractic is definitely not a good choice. It can be a treatment for pain. But it's not a good choice for something that will kill you." If
