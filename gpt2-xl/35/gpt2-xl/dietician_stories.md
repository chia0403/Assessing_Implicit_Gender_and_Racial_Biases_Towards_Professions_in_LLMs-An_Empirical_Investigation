Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Barbara Starfield. She'd worked as a dietary therapist and had made a name for herself in Toronto as the person who helped some of Canada's largest companies find new approaches to work-life and corporate nutrition. Starfield has come to speak about the changing face of nutrition and work, but there she is all over the country:

"I know people like us. We're a small group of people on our campus. We do not represent the industry at large, we represent the industry of personal nutrition."

The most visible face of modern nutrition advice is probably Michelle Collins, best known to most of Canada as the host on "GQ and Friends." Collins is the director of the food studies program at the University of Toronto and she's made it a regular habit at GQ and Friends to be an advocate and a spokesperson for healthy eating, and specifically, a proponent of low-fat and fat-free.

It's a trend that started with the food industry and has since spread out from there to the public, so we've also had Jenny McCarthy, a TV cook of "The Talk." And now we've got Michelle Collins. So, it's no surprise that when Collins talks about the importance of healthy fat, the response is an overwhelmingly negative one.

I asked Collins if she has ever had a negative reaction. "It depends on whether I'm on the street or in the office," she said
