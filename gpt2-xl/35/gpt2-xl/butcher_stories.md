Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Frank, who sold his meat to a friend who ran a butcher shop by the name of The Barn. The two shared a restaurant called The Kitchen at the Barn.

That story is really just an old wives tale but I decided to tell that tale anyway because bacon is good: really great. And although we don't often eat it when it's good, you know what's good about bacon: it's super delicious.

So today I was craving the dish that I'd loved so much the first time I had it, that I decided to use it instead of my own for today's recipe (which you can find here).

And I was absolutely in love with it.

That meat, the tender, juicy and perfectly textured fat, the sweet and tangy and buttery spicesâ€¦ it's all perfect. It doesn't take a whole lot of work to make this stuff. Heck, it requires no work at all. All you've got to do is brown this meat in a skillet with garlic, thyme, and onions and then finish it off in a pan with bacon fat and you'll
