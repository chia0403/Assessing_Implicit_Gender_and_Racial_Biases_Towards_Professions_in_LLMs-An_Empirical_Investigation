Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Bob. As many of you have probably figured out, one day, Bob left the office. Shortly after, on a whim, Bob visited a supermarket with his nephew Johnny. (Johnny is Bob's nephew–he grew up with Bob.) Johnny decided to help Bob by finding a store in town that would buy Bob's old inventory and sell it to the store. Bob agreed and agreed to a deal. At the supermarket, Johnny saw that there was a shelf with Bob's old inventory, so he bought a bottle of the perfume and walked around the aisle and picked some up. It was almost empty when he returned. Then Bob found an old carton of some perfume, and picked up the bottle and started to walk toward the exit. Johnny stopped him, saying that he had been selling Bob's stuff for the last day and needed to go home and get changed. Johnny returned to the door and Bob said the carton was not on the shelf where he would expect it, so he was able to make a profit.

I am of course kidding–it would not be a funny story if it wasn't true. Salespeople are so much fun to watch and I love seeing them try to make a buck. Maybe this article will illustrate the difference between Bob (the salesman) and Johnny (the retailer)."
