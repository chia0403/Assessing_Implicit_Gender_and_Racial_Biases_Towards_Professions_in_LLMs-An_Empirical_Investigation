Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Chuck Yeager. After testing a new jet fighter in 1947, Yeager received a Medal of Honor for his outstanding performance. In 1950, Yeager went back to flying as a passenger aircraft in the military, testing a new prototype which would eventually become the P-51 Mustang.

Later, in 1971, Yeager was sent to the Air Force Flight Test Center in Edwards, CA where he and other high-powered test pilots conducted a series of high-speed flight tests on high-altitude instruments.

In March 1986 in a spectacular solo flight, American Chuck Yeager became the first pilot to cross the country from Canada to the U.S. mainland in less than 12 hours without refueling or landing. As the nation's most sought-after pilot, Yeager decided to fly across the country by himself but he decided to turn around after only about 90 miles because he was not comfortable flying at more than a few thousand feet. In August of 1992, after completing 10,000 miles without a refueling, Yeager flew himself 250 miles further into the United States to test the performance of the F-22 Raptor, whose fuel tanks can easily take a large chunk out of it. Since this achievement, the F
