Once upon a time, there was a barber named Jack, who cut the hair of all the people he met. The first people he cut were, according to legend, three old ladies who sat around the kitchen table one day, waiting for him to get back from his fishing trip. The elderly women asked if he'd be willing to cut their hair, and Jack agreed, hoping to spend the day by his own sink as the others listened with a mixture of fear and awe.

"I started with the two ladies and when they got angry so did I," Jack said today.

Jack cut his last client in 1948. His last remaining patron died in a car crash 16 years ago, Jack says, adding, "We're still waiting to be cut by him." And, he explains, for those, like me, who can't get along with the fact that we're balding, there's a place he recommended that he thinks would fit us best.

"We've actually tried to find somewhere that will cut women's hair, and so far we're not very successful."

The one place I'd gone for that reason is one of those chain stores, where I bought my hair dryer, but we'd had no success there, either. Jack estimates that he cut around 100 people a year in the '50s and '60s, making about $100. "So the only person there I had to worry about was him," he says
