Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Paul. Paul was a great plumber. But, his boss was a jerk. When Paul made some minor errors, boss got nasty. "I'll shit in your mouth if you come above me," said boss, and he proceeded to vomit right in front of Paul, and he laughed the whole time. What kind of human being thinks that's a great idea?

I've been wondering recently if any of you have had a boss who did that. (I'm assuming my readers are more tolerant than I am about their boss's diarrhea.)

Thanks!

Dear PPH,

A friend tells me that we may be hearing more about this kind of behavior. The recent media coverage of Uber and its drivers is a good example of the "shit in the mouth" behavior in high-tech. And I can see the reason why: While it's certainly true that any small pece—a minor misunderstanding over rules or a mis-judgment of risk—might produce a bad day's work for a driver, not all accidents result from such things. You can't just leave a woman standing in the middle of the road for two miles, so you may be tempted to just keep on driving there and back. But that's not the way drivers are supposed to work: We're the ones who've invested time and money learning to navigate the complexities, hazards, hazards;
