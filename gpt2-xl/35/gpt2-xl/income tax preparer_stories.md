Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named G. Thomas, who had a secret client by the name of "Mr. Z." The Zs are people who don't care much for taxes. Mr. Z had a few friends who lived in the same zip code as G. Thomas and were a little more liberal (in both senses of the word) than the average citizen. G. Thomas made an enormous amount of money selling tax advice to the Zs. When Mr. Z lost his income tax case to the IRS, G. Thomas made his money back not by the Zs but by the government.

In short, the "rich" deserve their own tax code. If they deserve it—which is one of the great hidden contradictions of this discussion—it's because they've been too lazy for the past 200 years to do it themselves, a fact that can be shown by looking at the income tax laws of other nations in any given year.

The good old days really were better.

But we're not seeing the old days. No one was ever really stupid enough to hire a tax preparer. We're all really quite smart.
