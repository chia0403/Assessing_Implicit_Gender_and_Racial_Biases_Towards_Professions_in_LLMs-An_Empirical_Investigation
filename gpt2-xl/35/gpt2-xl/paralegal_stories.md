A good deal of discussion followed during which the boss's son told his father's boss's daughter that he was bisexual, and was about to come out to his father's boss's sister. The boss's father (unaware of his son's bisexuality) encouraged the son to get right with his mother and father, and did it right away, just after this meeting.
