Once upon a time, there was a florist named Charlie Rose. He was a pretty good man... he really loved his florists, and they loved him back. They were a pretty good couple. They'd spend hours over a cup of coffee together. He was charming, generous, and a nice, fair-minded guy. Charlie liked to play golf, which he did all day.


You know how it is with couples. Sometimes they say, "Charlie, I couldn't stand you when you were doing the interviews at work." And sometimes they say, "Charlie, you were so charming on TV." But a lot of times, after they're done, they're just so sad that they can't face each other.


This morning, I was standing next to him when he called me. He said he's so happy you've been at my breakfast table! He said that I was just such a good friend. He said he just missed having a real conversation with you. We've been through so much together, he said, and I just felt I needed that.


Well, I just couldn't say no to that.


Now, Charlie is a wonderful person and I like him very kindly. That's why, I'm sure, that I've never done anything to him in the press or on the public's dime that I can truly say I regret.


You are truly a talented and gifted man. I admire you for
