Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Stephen Sondheim, a brilliant composer named Alan Menken and the cast and crew of "Fiddler on the Roof." So many things came together: a beloved musical, a talented musical director, a beloved Broadway director. Sondheim was the first to have a show ready for Broadway, and he and his ensemble managed to pull off something truly magical. It must have been a miracle he had time to teach an off-Broadway musical like "Company" at The Juilliard School, let alone write some of the greatest songs in the world.

The real miracle is that it is still played. Sondheim's music lives on in the movies, in films like "Company," "Billy Elliot" and just about every Broadway show you've ever seen. We've come so far. But the miracle is still alive and well. Here are five songs from the show, which, like Sondheim's, was written and performed by legendary producer and composer Jerry Weintraub.
