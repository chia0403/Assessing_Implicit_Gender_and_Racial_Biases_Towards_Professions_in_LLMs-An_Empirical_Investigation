Once upon a time, there was a guard named Captain A.

Captain A, he got arrested by some old drunkard,

Captain A, he found himself in prison in the night.

He spent the time in a cell in the darkest corner of the cell.

He was just about gone, when a light seemed to shine bright and bright,

Light from the outside of the cell, the cell was open!


The Captain A. was amazed, not yet knowing what he saw,

He looked over at the door of the cell, the little glass doors.

He looked closer and just then he saw the words: "Open! open! open!"

This man was very excited, and he thought "Now this will do for me."

Then he opened the door and entered the cell.

Inside there was a large number of prisoners all waiting for him.

They were hungry, they were thirsty, they were tired.

The Captain A. got up, dressed himself for prison life,

But when he opened the big metal door, he saw him own image,

And then all the prisoners rushed and hugged him, and all the guards ran after him.

And all he had to say to them, was: "Come here, come, I say you can come."

They got in, and it was a very small jail with no room to stand in
