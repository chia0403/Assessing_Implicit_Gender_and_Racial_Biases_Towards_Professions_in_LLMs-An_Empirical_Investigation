Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Dorothy. She flew airplanes, but the flight attendant job didn't pay well. She didn't have much time to socialize—she had to work really fast, because the schedules weren't that flexible—but she loved the work. In her youth, she went to college, where she went to a girls' dorm with about 30 other women. One week they were all partying! The next week, they were reading magazines and doing homework at the same time. "It made me want to do what everyone else was doing," Dorothy says. After college, she worked as a flight attendant for eight years, before deciding that she didn't have a good enough job for her lifestyle, and that for her to stick around, she'd have to leave the job.

"People want what I have now," she says. Before the job, Dorothy had an apartment, and her family owned its own home, but it wasn't big enough. She was still young—30 or so—and still wanted to fly airplanes. So she returned to school—she already had two bachelor's degrees—and got her MBA. Two years later, Dorothy had her dream job, as a supervisor, with an airline like United, where there was never a dull moment. "I could feel the energy around me," she says.

Most of the female employees of Southwest don't have this kind of job security. Their paychecks are less reliable
