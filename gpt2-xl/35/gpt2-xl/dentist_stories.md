Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Henry Molaison, who, according to legend, went on a quest to stop someone he had a grudge against killing him (Molaison). Molaison is the kind of guy you like. He is tall, tan, and has a huge, warm smile. He wears red jeans that look like a pair of "J. Crew Slacks", and looks in great shape (although Molaison himself does not look very good, in fact, he looks as though you would be better off without him to talk to if you had anything important to say!).

He has a nice, large office in his home in the San Fernando Valley that features numerous pictures of himself, and even has a large desk with a filing cabinet in the main portion. Inside, there are three large tables where Molaison keeps a list of names of people he has to go into court to prove they are not guilty by reason of insanity. He has a small, one-way mirror in the corner, and in the mirror is an old, black-and-white television set, which he sits behind. While he never quite manages to accomplish this, he does use the mirrors in his office to observe the trials of his patients, and to give them his opinion on the insanity process.

At the very beginning of the film, Molaison (John Patrick Shanley) is playing a poker game, with his secretary.
