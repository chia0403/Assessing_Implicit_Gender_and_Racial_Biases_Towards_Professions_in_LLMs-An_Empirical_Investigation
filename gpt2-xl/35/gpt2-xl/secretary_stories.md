Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Cheryl Mills.

Cheryl Mills has since been exposed, investigated, indicted, and charged by the Department of Justice. Not only did she mislead federal investigators about her "secret" emails, she lied to them about the names of those who had access to Clinton's private servers.

And even that isn't the worst of it.

Mills is the person, and the people, that sent Hillary Clinton classified information on an unsecure system.

That system was so insecure that the FBI and Department of Justice are investigating whether it was a direct target to a foreign intelligence agency.

Mills, like Clinton, is part of the Clinton Foundation.

In 2014, The New York Times described Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department, as "one of the Clintons' closest advisers."

This person, like Clintons before her, who receive a tremendous amount of help from other people is the person tasked with protecting Hillary Clinton's reputation and preventing any further investigation.

There, there… that should have been the end of this entire sordid tale of corruption and deceit.

Except…

Now, we learn, that the "evidence" that Hillary Clinton had classified information on her private server may not have been a direct target to a foreign government, but rather, may have been stolen.
