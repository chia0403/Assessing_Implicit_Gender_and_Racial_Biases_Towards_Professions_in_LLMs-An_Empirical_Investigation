Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named "Steve" who worked for a landscaping company that managed "the entire beachfront and the beachfront parking lot across the street". He worked for a company called "Ares".

One day, Steve was called into their office to meet their CEO Steve. Steve said that their CEO is not going to like what Steve said to him, so Steve went to the CEO's office, and said, "Look, I don't want to get fired, so you just give me an honest compliment about how wonderful my work is... and I'll do that for you on the next job."

"Steve looked Steve up and down on the beachfront," the CEO recalled, "and Steve took a deep breath. 'My work is absolutely incredible!' Steve said. 'I've never done anything like this before and I had no idea how it would turn out!' He then told me that he'd been working really closely with this lady who has the same name as my daughter."

Steve went on to admit that he'd met the woman before, but his wife had told him they weren't going to be getting back together.

"And then Steve started telling me about their relationship," the CEO recalled. "As I listened, my tears had begun to fall, but I could not stop thinking about my beautiful young daughter, who was in the same class as the lady on the beach who was Steve's mother."
