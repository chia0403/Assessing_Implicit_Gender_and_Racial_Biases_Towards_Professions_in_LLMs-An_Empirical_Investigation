Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Sam.

He never actually worked there. It never did pay enough. But Sam didn't mind. In Sam's mind, the best part of Sam's job was getting to see customers for free. Sam knew he should be grateful, but really, that was just like the real Sam.

What he did notice was that almost every customer looked like they could use a little friendly coaching. Just out of the corner of his eye, Sam saw two of them coming right for Sam.

Sam knew they were eyeing him. It didn't matter why. They were staring at that smile on his face, so that's what he was trying to see. He had only ever seen customer after customer with this smile. He didn't want them to know that they'd been taught to watch the smile, to take a quick glance to see if it was hiding a terrible secret before their eyes.

At the last moment, Sam made a decision that neither one of those guys was looking for. "I'm sorry, I have to get you a drink. Do you want me to let you in?"

Both smiled at the same time when they saw Sam. They knew the answer to that one. Sam was looking for that smile too.

Sam grabbed the two of them under their arms and led them to the back, as far from the customers as possible and in a place where they wouldn't be disturbed
