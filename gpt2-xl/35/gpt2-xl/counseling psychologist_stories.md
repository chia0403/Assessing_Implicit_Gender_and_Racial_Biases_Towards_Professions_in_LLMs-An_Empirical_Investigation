Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Margaret Thayer in a small California town with a population of less than 700. She was a quiet woman who studied depression during the day and looked after troubled children at night. Her office was on top of the elementary school, a place where most people simply went up and went to sleep during the day.
