Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Mr. Smith. It was said that he kept a small business, on which he earned his living by writing a yearly journal by which his employees could keep a diary of their salary, expenses and other matters of concern to them. At first Mr. Smith began keeping the journal on a small scale, using it as an aid to help him keep track of the receipts and savings of every employee. As years passed, however, things changed.

One day someone came into the small shop to meet his wife. She asked him "Is there anything special about us? I've had a lot of trouble finding you." Mr. Smith paused for a moment, and then asked "How does the child stand in it all?" She answered, "Oh, we make do."
