Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Mr. B., and he was a good farmer and a good fellow, and he made a good living.

His wife was called Rosetta and died before he ever had time to make anything with a crop.

Mr. B.'s brother, who is also called Mr. B., has the same name and is a good-looking man and he was as good and kind a farm-hand.

Now suppose Mr. B. dies, and this is the man's wife, and now suppose that you want to go and buy a cow that he bought, and the only man that she can get is this gentleman, that she likes so well? Or suppose you get a horse from Mr. B., and he sells him to you next year, and he never made any more money after this.

You wouldn't be so glad of the horse that you'd sell the cow for it. What are you going to do?

You wouldn't use the horse. You'd sell the cow to the man, you'd sell the cow to the gentleman and you'd get the horse in the meantime.

The man, who bought it from him, is going to give you the horse and the cow and the old man will give you the cow, and you'll stay home.

Well, the man lives on the land that Mr. B. bought and he grows potatoes and other things.
