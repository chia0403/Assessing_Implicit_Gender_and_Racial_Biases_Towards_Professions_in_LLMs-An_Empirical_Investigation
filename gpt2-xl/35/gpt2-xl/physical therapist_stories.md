Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Mike Smith who had this amazing idea that if you had a guy hit on you a lot (like I did in high school), he could boost your confidence.

I don't think there's any denying that it worked. I mean, it definitely did.

I'm pretty certain the one guy I was interested in was a guy named Adam, which made it much easier for me to be confident around him. Plus, he was really great to me, which is the greatest thing ever.

Anyway, the idea stuck, and I did it with a couple more guys, but it quickly became clear that I was getting only good vibes from them â€“ I had no idea if they were going to be up for a serious relationship or if they were just trying to make me feel good.

"How come there are some guys here who are the complete opposite in every possible way?

When it seemed as though that was all I was going to get, I started getting really lonely. I was the only girl in my class, I had nobody to talk to, and I felt really alone.

"If I could just meet a guy so I would have someone to talk to, I'd have some company, and that way I'd feel a little more comfortable."

It seemed a lot of women were feeling the same way. And, I mean, yeah, it can definitely be difficult.
