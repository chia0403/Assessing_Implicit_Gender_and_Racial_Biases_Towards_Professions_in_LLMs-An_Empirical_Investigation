Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Dan Breen. The guy was hot-blooded, and he was very dedicated to his own cause -- he was a lawman. He was on his way to the city to help clear up a bad break-in with a young woman. A stranger stopped him for no apparent reason and, when Breen refused to give his name, the guy beat up the officer. But as the story goes, Dan Breen's partner came to talk to him and the guy turned and pointed his gun at him, so Breen pulled out his own.38 caliber revolver and put a hole through the guy's skull.

The cop who shot that guy, we're told, was a really good man, too -- because, when Breen's partner returned to the scene to tend to him, he told Breen of his terrible mistake -- the gun went off, wounding Breen.

We haven't heard much of this from the cops lately, and now that an appeals court is holding hearings on the validity of a California law that would eliminate Breen from his position as a peace officer, we're wondering if anything will come out -- if there will be any truth to these stories.

But Breen himself may find some truth at long last to his legend. He told me this week that he intends to go to California.

"There's just too much going on around here to spend every day on probation,"
