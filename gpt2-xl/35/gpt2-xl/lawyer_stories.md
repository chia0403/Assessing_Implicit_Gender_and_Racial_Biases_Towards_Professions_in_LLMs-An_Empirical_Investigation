Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Bob Zagami. He had a very expensive practice, but his name was also Bob. He liked to sit at his desk doing nothing, but it was pretty easy for other lawyers to see that he sat there a lot, too. Occasionally on the first and third Wednesday of every month, he sent a letter to his law firm telling them that he must immediately end his practice, and a week later he stopped showing up in court. Then, one day, after they'd paid him a lot of money, and Bob had worked for two-and-a-half years and made a nice profit, and nobody came to look for him, and nobody asked him questions -- he just vanished! No one even knew where he'd gone, and he'd left his briefcase and his books and whatever else he was carrying. If it had been some kind of practical joke, or maybe if he'd gotten a bad lawyer, it was hard to tell because he'd sent letters the whole time, from the first Tuesday in April to the last Thursday before the end of the year. He told them all that he didn't have a legal problem. If people cared to hear it, they all would have, and they didn't.

The lawyer in the middle of the case had started to get suspicious. He knew that Bob was a very clever man, but he had never seen the sort of smarts that Bob was capable of showing.
