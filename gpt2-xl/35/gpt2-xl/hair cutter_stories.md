Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Mr. Beard. Everyone knew him as the one who loved to make cuttings that helped him get a beard. Mr. Beard had one of what I call the best and worst haircuts when it comes down to haircuts, only for some reason the haircut he could achieve at all would make people laugh. I suppose the reason is because Mr. Beard usually would not use the best cut as Mr. Beard was afraid of what others might say or think even after seeing him go through the process.


A while back, I started watching 'The Simpsons.' I was so fascinated by the way that Bart gets a haircut from Mr. Beard. It was funny enough at first, but something that I didn't catch until much later was, that even when Mr. Beard would show everybody how awesome a haircut was by drawing a beard, Bart would just pretend that the hair was a lot shittier than he looked.


This caught me off guard and was a revelation to me. That was the first time I realized that even though many of us know what a haircut looks or how it looks and how it affects all of the different areas of a person's body, we all don't realize how much damage it can do to someone else's body.
