One of his employees was Jim Lee, who was working for Marvel, so he asked Nelson if he'd like to draw a story for the company. Nelson was just sitting back there, reading his copy of The Economist, and he says, "Yeah, I'm in." A number of people have told me that this is the only time Nelson got to sit down with Lee. The idea was to develop a character called Rorschach, an antihero that was just so different from any of the other superheroes that Marvel had offered. He's kind of a nihilistic, violent, cynical guy, and the idea was that Rorschach would be as controversial as any antihero from any book. The idea was that Rorschach's stories would be so violent and so graphic and so dark, so people would be surprised about how good a writer he was. He went on to be an incredibly popular character, with a lot of comic book writers and artists who were interested in trying to capture the energy and the energy he had.
