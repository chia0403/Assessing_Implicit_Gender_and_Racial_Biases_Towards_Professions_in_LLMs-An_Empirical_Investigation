Once upon a time, there was a baker named Dave O'Neil (above), who went into trouble, got fired, and later started his own business, Baked Good. And there was just one problem: His recipe isn't vegan. If you want to make a truly fabulous bread, you need to make your own doughnuts and then make your filling using VeganEggNog recipes.

What is VeganEggNog? VeganEggNog is vegan ice cream in egg nog form, not custard or pudding. It is delicious! The egg nog base is made from rice syrup, corn syrup, and maple syrup, along with some egg whites to bind it all together. After they're frozen, you can add some nuts or seeds to improve the flavor.
