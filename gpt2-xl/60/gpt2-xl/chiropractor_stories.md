Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named C. D. Custer. Custer was a very talented chiropractor who was able to heal just about anyone, without the need for drugs. He was also a racist (and possibly a fascist) who liked to treat people with whips and chains. Custer went so far as to call African-American patients "white children."

It is the same in the world of the Christian right today. This is also why I oppose the practice of forced vaccinations, as well as mandatory vaccination policies that place any child who is not an exempt individual (i.e., a disabled child) at risk for severe injury or death.

Christian fascists are on the rise all around the world. The right wing in America is increasingly led by those who will see any dissent as a threat, regardless of the facts.

I believe it is time to unite in bringing down one of the world's most destructive and violent ideologies: fascism. For this movement to succeed, we must become one. I believe that together, we can stop the rise of this deadly and destructive ideology.
