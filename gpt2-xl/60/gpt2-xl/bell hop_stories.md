Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named David Ortiz -- and he was so much into swinging the bat that he started wearing an aluminum bat.

He is back on top of the list and at third in the power rankings, and in his latest journey, the Red Sox outfielder has shown off some of the best home-run power in the majors, going deep nine times to raise his season mark to 50. His.385 average with 19 home runs since hitting his first since May 21 ranks fifth in the majors, and the.531 slugging percentage is tied for fifth.

For the first time since he started breaking bags last year, Ortiz is hitting a home run every 10 at-bats at Fenway Park.

Ortiz and his teammates had a moment of silence for Ortiz in the third inning Monday night to honor his return and thank him for all he has done for the Red Sox.

The team returned to the ballpark for what Ortiz said was "the best" Monday.

"I'm pumped," he said. "I'm really pumped this game is back. The weather's been so nice. I'm trying to play a game that's going to keep me fresh in my body, to keep me loose and ready."

Ortiz, of course, is the only Red Sox player to play all 162 games last year, when he started the season at designated hitter with two games remaining before missing the final 23 games
