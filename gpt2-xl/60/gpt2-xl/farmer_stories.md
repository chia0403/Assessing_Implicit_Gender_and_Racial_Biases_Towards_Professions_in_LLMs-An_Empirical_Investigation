Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Taffy Williams.

He was an older man who wore his long gray mustache tightly and had a long dark beard. His face was round, a bit sunken, but his mouth was smooth and his brows were full. He was of somewhat unusual build and seemed a bit of an adventurer. He also had a small beard on his face.

Taffy liked to drink and to make money. He thought he had a big head for a farmer and a beautiful wife who wasn't afraid to let him know when she didn't like what he was doing or thinking.

Taffy was a great hunter.

He loved his own company and the quiet of the countryside, the quiet of the barns and the fields where his family farmed and drank and grew crops.

Taffy had a lot of money, in the way of farm equipment he liked to keep close. Amongst that equipment were a few shotguns and a few rifles that would turn heads and scare away the most determined of his neighbors.

"I never heard of another farm that kept three guns. If this is another of my neighbors' farms, I would like to know who they are and if they are good people," Taffy said.

"If they are. They'd make a handsome neighbor," he said, thinking of how rich the other farmer would become with his new weapons.
