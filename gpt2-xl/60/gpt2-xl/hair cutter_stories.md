Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Dave who tried to be a great hair cutter. Every haircut left him wondering if cutting hair was a waste of his time.


And so Dave decided to be a haircutologist.


"I'm a real hair cutter," he told himself. "There's no way I make a living off it."


Then Dave met Debbie and they fell in love.


As they talked, they realized that they'd both found their calling in life.


He saw the power in giving a person another chance.


She saw the power in giving another person hope.


So they decided to run their own business and share the love they shared at Dave's Place.


They knew that the two of them needed their own shop, and they planned on having their own staff.


With those decisions, the story began.
