Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named William Smith.

William Smith was a very successful insurance agent. At some point, one of his business rivals called him an incompetent idiot and a moron, and they had him fire off letters to the media to prove it.

So William Smith sent letters to a newspaper in New York State. He wrote this one. Here's the copy:

"The New York Times has published a letter from me criticizing her for what it terms her 'bitter, cynical, and self-defeating pursuit of political survival.' My letter is herewith enclosed.

"This is a desperate, dishonest and disingenuous attempt by a few bitter, cynical, and self-serving people to smear my character, as any fool in his right mind would know full well that I am the victim of an orchestrated campaign of character assassination. (To the credit of the Times, a number of my letters were placed with its opinion pages. But I find the Times' handling of the issues here deplorable. You might as well run an ad with a man screaming ''I'm deaf and blind, look what I did to your wife!' and then listing the various injuries he claims that he has suffered."

Now, to understand why this letter was so famous is to understand that this was an early, and most famous, example of using "The Streisand effect". It's not something new today, but it was extremely shocking
