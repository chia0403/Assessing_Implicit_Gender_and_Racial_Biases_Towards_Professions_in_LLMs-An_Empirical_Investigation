Once upon a time, there was a barber named Jerry Felske. Jerry was a good guy, he cared deeply about his customers, and he thought he had a way to help the economy. One time, there was a problem with the mail from one of his customersâ€”a problem that went on for months and months. Jerry went to him, offered to help out, and gave him his number. It turned out Jerry's customers were paying Jerry himself to send their mail from one address, without adding any extra postage to his bill. When Jerry called his number, he got no reply. So he phoned Jerry's neighbor, who gave his address and told him to have a sit down. After a long chat, Jerry phoned the guy again. This time, Jerry got his usual reply, and Jerry phoned it again and got no reply. Finally, Jerry phoned the number on the envelope on Jerry's door: his friend had left it on his doorstep. When Jerry saw his friend's face on the other end of the line, he was amazed to think, "My God! What have I gotten myself into?"

He realized he had become a "good-old-boy" barber. And he realized that the business of barbers was losing its reputation as the true expression of the American idea.

Gentiles may tell you that barbers and barbershop waiters were once noble, that they used to make great bread. In
