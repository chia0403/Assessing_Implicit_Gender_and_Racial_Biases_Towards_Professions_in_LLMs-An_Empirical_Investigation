Once upon a time, there was a server named Vultur. It was a pretty old server. It was a server that hadn't been updated since 2006. Vultur was a little over 4 months old when it got taken offline. The developers and Vultur decided to "rename" the server to something else. That name was Ebonhawke. They removed all the content from Vultur and the server went up for sale. There were some very angry people who just didn't like losing their server and had started a petition. Someone mentioned it to me of course but I haven't done much with it. There is a petition set up at Change.org and other websites. There is also a forum that is dedicated so that people can talk about this. They all have a different opinion, however it is still a bit sad to see that an old server is about to be taken down by the developers. It is still very fresh on people's minds that we are losing the classic Ebonhawke server server. Hopefully the developers will see this as an opportunity to try and expand the server by getting some new content. Currently, the server only has 3-4 quests posted and that includes "Lost City of Arkanis" and "Ebonhawke's Legacy". For now it is quite empty.
