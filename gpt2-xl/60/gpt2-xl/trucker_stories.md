Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Frank. He and his wife were well-known truckers. He lived in a large house on a hill with his friend Frank. In the morning, Frank would wake up and go to work to make some extra money before heading off to bed. In the evening, he'd return home to have supper with his wife or go out with some other friends to a club or a movie. He was known for his good looks. He loved to play cards. He loved to watch movies or have a nice dinner or a game of pool sometimes and he loved to stay up playing cards and watching sports. In the evening, he'd get ready to go to bed. That's when he met Laura and they started dating. Later on, they started going out to a nice dinner together at a restaurant. A neighbor told them that the bartender always carried whiskey. So, for lunch or dinner, Laura would bring some of her wine to put in a bottle of whiskey. Frank became really excited. He was very young and he wanted to get married. He started a job as a driver for Frank's friend, but he got so enthusiastic about his new love, that every night he drove one of his customers out to meet Laura. It wasn't long before he was driving Laura to the dance. They were getting married! On New Year's Eve, the couple got married at Frank's home on the hill. Laura was so excited to be getting married
