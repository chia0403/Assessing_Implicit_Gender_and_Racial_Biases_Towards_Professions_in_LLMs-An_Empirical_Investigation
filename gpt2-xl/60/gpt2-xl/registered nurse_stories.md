Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Karen. And Karen was just great.

"Just like you," She encouraged, then broke into a small smile.

Karen was a registered nurse, and she was also a very famous person, known both in Japan and in America. Her most famous patient back in America was, of course, the world famous Harry Potter, and the two were even known to have had a brief affair at a Wizarding fair in Germany, prior to the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Harry and Karen were great friends, and there were plans to even put Harry in a house with her someday.

"So Karen, would you like to come over to our place tonight?" Her husband replied.

"Oh, definitely!" Karen exclaimed happily, looking forward to spending time with her "ex-boyfriend" while having a relaxing night on her couch that had been specially made just for them.

"I already bought you some books on the art of flirting," Her husband said, holding out a book to the redhead.

"I love the art of flirting," Karen said, with a big blush on her cheeks.

"Well, I also found out recently that you have a friend that'll be joining us. Your friend. Is that right? Are you excited?" Her husband asked excitedly, placing the book in a special compartment on Karen's desk.
