Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named "Cannonball" whose dream was to be the greatest landscaper in the land. However, he has had to work hard every day since, to achieve that dream once more and eventually reach "Cannonball's dream", or "Necessity" depending on what you are on the right track trying to achieve. The story revolves around two main characters. Cannonball's sister is out doing yard work and he goes to her to complain about how she is only doing half of her job. She tells him he is not getting it done properly, but he has a plan. He hires someone named "Ridgeline" who is just a guy with a lawnmower who thinks it is a good idea to let Cannonball take it for himself, and his sister sees it as a brilliant idea. Ridgeline is successful in turning Cannonball into a big success and by the end of the story he is now the "ultimate lawn professional". He gets married to his sister and their daughter is named "Ridgeline", and they also have a cat named "Ridgeline". (I have no idea what this is referring to...)


The other main character is Nita "Nita" Miller, who also works for a landscaping company named "Cannonball's Grass". She just happens to be an aspiring athlete just like Cannonball, but they do not get along. This one chapter focuses
