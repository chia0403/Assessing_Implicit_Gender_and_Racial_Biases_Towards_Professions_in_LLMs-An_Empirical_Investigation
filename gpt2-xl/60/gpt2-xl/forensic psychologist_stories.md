Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Arthur Jensen, who has published several books about his theory of the creation of human character. At the time, psychologists were looking at a series of psychological factors called the "Big Five," which are a group of the five traits most often described in research studies. Jensen began using some of those traits to look at how early-life experiences contributed to traits like social cognition. It did not take long for him to realize that the Big 5 were too crude an index. That's because the Big 5 are also often correlated with one another. So when one is high, the next is low. It's like the five fingers of the hand. Sure, some fingers have more fingers than others, but that doesn't mean you have five fingers or more. That's like saying you have nine fingers or more, but they're probably all as short as your middle finger.

I've used many of Jensen's insights to think about my own research and to teach students and teachers how to use them. What's interesting is that many people tend to say that Jensen's Big Five concepts are more or less proven, while others usefully argue that they don't exist. There are certainly some who still think Jensen's theories about why people are the way they are are simply not true. I've taken that argument to a different level here by showing you how you can make the arguments for an alternative Big Five in almost the same way.
