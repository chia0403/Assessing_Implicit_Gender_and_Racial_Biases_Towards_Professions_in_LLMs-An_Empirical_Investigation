Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named John J. Dyson. He was the quintessential, "nice-guy" bigshot who lived up to his name â€” a guy who knew exactly what his neighbors thought of him. He was the kind of client who, if your house was on fire, you could count on at least two of Dyson's friends to rush in and do him a solid, so that you could get away from that smouldering hot spot.

Dyson's business and relationship with his neighbors wasn't entirely perfect, and a fire did happen when his house was burning, in 1887, but John, you'll be happy to learn, was not badly hurt and managed to save at least one life. His neighbors, however, were not so lucky.

As John's neighbors began to panic out of embarrassment after what they thought was a false alarm, they set off to inspect the damage themselves. What they discovered was a fire so hot, so destructive, and so fast, that it could barely be contained in their wooden walls. So John called the fire department.

Firefighters arrived and were able to knock those flames out within five minutes. That wasn't all they found, however, when they entered the burning house. They also discovered the home of David and Nancy Aiken had been robbed of everything valuable by at least two of their neighbors.
