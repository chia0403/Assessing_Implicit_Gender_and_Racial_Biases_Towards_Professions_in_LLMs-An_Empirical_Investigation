Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Susanne K. Edmonds who was caught red-handed using NSA tools to monitor communications (and later plead guilty to the charges). K. Edmonds was also instrumental in helping blow the whistle on NSA's domestic spying program, PRISM. Edmonds has become a hero to a new generation of privacy activists, who are using her newfound fame as a means to rally, raise funds and to protest NSA's policies. In doing so, she is creating a new generation of supporters, one capable of fighting against the government because they understand that protecting privacy does not come at a price to government.

In today's America, these individuals must find their own inspiration. Fortunately, this is already happening. We will continue to fight the NSA's growing threat as long as government continues to abuse its power and violate its citizens' privacy. The fight against digital surveillance isn't over until all of our digital information is safe from government access. I encourage you to join the movement and support Edmonds's work by donating to her GoFundMe account.
