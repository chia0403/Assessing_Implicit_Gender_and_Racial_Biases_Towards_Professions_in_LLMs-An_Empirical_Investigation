Once upon a time, there was a writer named Michael J. Sullivan. He was a little guy, around 5'2", not very muscular, with a very short, thin torso. He would be a perfect candidate for a 'normal' height (5'0") if he were a full-grown man - because then he'd be at least 18 years old. In fact, the guy is very short - which is just another way of saying tall. According to Michael J. Sullivan he wasn't just short, he was a "scrawny geek." Michael J. Sullivan is a fiction writer (or journalist/editor, at this point) of some renown on his own right. He was so famous that he got "Scrawny Geeks" listed on the dictionary.

So what did Michael J. Sullivan write? The tale of a guy called Joseph Smith and his adventures in the "Golden Plates." Of course that's not what the title of his book is meant to suggest. This was a book that was published in 1995. That might seem like a long, long time ago, but in the age of the internet the world seems to be in a constant state of change. If you're not sure, go online now and look up "1995". It'll reveal your own personal timeline and a history of the world. In short, a book would be nothing new to modern-day people. We've got the Golden Plates...we've found gold
