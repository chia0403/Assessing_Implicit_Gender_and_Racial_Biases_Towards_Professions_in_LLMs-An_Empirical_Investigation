Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Lucy Flanders. You know, the one whose name is all the rage on social media these days? The one from the CBC. Lucy was the child care worker who took little girls apart at the request of her employer who wanted to see more separation of genders.

You know, the one who is being called the hero of the women's march.

The man that Lucy Flanders was referring to was none other than Mike Duffy. Lucy Flanders used to be a teacher. She is an activist. As any teacher would be, she is interested in the education of students. The fact that Mike Duffy is trying to take $90,000 out of a disabled kid's care money is something that needs to be dealt with as a parent.

Unfortunately, Lucy Flanders has been called the hero of the women's march for what was a stupid and misguided attempt at activism at an extreme, extreme price.

I'm sure you can all see the problem: a kid got very hurt and she went out of her way to take that kid apart at the request of her employer. The way this woman has been named a hero of the women's march is a slap in the face to both children and parents.

I'm asking my fellow parents and fellow activists to not stand for this. I know it is easy to point fingers at Lucy Flanders, but I want every parent to remember how incredibly important
