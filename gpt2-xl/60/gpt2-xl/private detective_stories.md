Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Peter Venkman who played a good guy (I don't care which color of pants you had that day, he definitely played a good guy) fighting crime by any means necessary. Sadly, due to some terrible casting choices, some of the stories were a little thin, so someone at Disney decided to put together two completely separate films (The Little Mermaid and The Sorcerer's Apprentice) and pretend that they were one big thing (the only problem, of course, was that this was pretty obvious since there were two separate stories that were set at the same time). While this story was in production, the cast of The Little Mermaid also had to come up with two completely different movies. Here is a story about that movie productionâ€¦

The story begins when the Evil Queen discovers that the Sultan must go to the Great Barrier Reef to find a Magic Crystal that will end her reign and allow her to escape to the Crystal Underworld. Instead of returning to the human realm to save the human princess and save her prince, the Evil Queen decides to try to escape by way of the underwater world called the Crystal Islands (or "crystal islands" if you're from the UK). To get the Crystal, the Sultan sends his servants to two different islands to steal two things: the Unicorn Horn (which can summon the powers of the underworld or the underworld king) and the Crystal Egg (a crystal object that can bring a human form to a Unicorn).
