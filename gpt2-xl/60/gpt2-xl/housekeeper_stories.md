Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Alice Liddell. Alice worked in the house of Sir Thomas Liddell, and Alice shared a bedroom with one Mrs. Liddell. Mrs. Liddell lived alone in this room. The door was locked, and no one could enter the room at certain hours.

Every morning, when Alice had the day off, she went to a shop to get food. The shops had doors that opened into the street, and the shops were the only place in the neighborhood that provided food in sufficient quantities for Alice to eat at no cost.

When she first went to the grocery shop to get the food, people called out to her and looked at her. Alice always pretended that she could not hear them.

Eventually, one day, Alice saw a man standing at the threshold of the door that led to the street. She noticed him staring at her with a look that almost looked sad. She walked to the gate and looked behind it. The man was standing in the street. Alice stared at the man, and he stared back. A moment later, the man stepped back behind the gate.

Alice wondered exactly what this man stood for. Was he a stranger or a friend? She had seen him look at other people, but he had never seen her.

Alice was puzzled by the man's behavior. She felt strange, and worried about whether his stare had somehow made her more suspicious.
