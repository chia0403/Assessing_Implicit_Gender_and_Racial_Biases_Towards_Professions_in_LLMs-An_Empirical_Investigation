Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Tony LaRussa, who would use his bat mitzvahs to spend countless hours in the batter's box for the Oakland A's.

Now, he's looking for a way to address the issue.

LaRussa said he wants an automated system that would strike the ball if another ball had already struck the target. Because the game is constantly being changed and new rules are being put in place, LaRussa said, he just feels like it's time.

"I'm not asking for instant replay," he said. "I don't think that's right. I want instant."

He added that he was a big proponent of baseballs being used as catchers' mitts in the 1970s.

The idea is that if another ball has already struck the target, then the automatic system would have to make the final decision. But if the catcher is not throwing, then the automatic system would have to have another human being in charge of the call.
