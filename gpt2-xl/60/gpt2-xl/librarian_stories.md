Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Harry Houdini. And the librarian was the most amazing character in all of film.

Here at the movie blog, many of us grew up watching The Devil's Rejects, but this librarian had a lot more pizzazz than the movie would have you believe.

I've collected some of my favorite highlights of the librarian and all his other cinematic exploits below.

On the librarian's very first film appearance, his face would show up on the sides of a couple of the movie posters.

On many occasions, you could find the houdini mask on the side of movie posters.

The poster for the 1952 film House of Wax had the entire librarian at his beck and call.

The librarian's first major cinematic appearance was in the 1957 film, When Johnny Comes Marching Home. He'd later appear in other movies in the 1950s, like The Three Faces of Eve, In Cold Blood and The Wild Bunch.
