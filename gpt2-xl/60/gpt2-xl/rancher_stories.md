Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Joe Holcomb. But no longer. He and his livestock were wiped out by a mysterious disease, and he was found, dead, at the bottom of his ranch, his skull ripped apart and his body burned beyond recognition.

Now the ghosts of Joe Holcomb haunt his family's farm, a small plot of land just south of the town of Westlake in northeast Virginia. Holcomb's daughter, Mimi, opened the doors to her family's tiny homestead and found two other family members with the same disease.

"My brother and I still walk into his house and wonder about him," she says.

The illness was dubbed "Tricolor," and is now thought to be caused by bacteria that were not picked up in the previous outbreak. The Holcomb family's farm turned into a nightmare laboratory for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Most of us are surprised that we've had the number of cases that we have," says Dr. Maryn McKenna, chief of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. "But not surprising at all."

Scientists were able to isolate the gene necessary to make the human version of the disease and test it for nearly a decade. It turns out tri-color virus is related to the measles, cholera, and yellow fever viruses, making it an airborne pathogen, similar to those commonly known to cause disease in the U
