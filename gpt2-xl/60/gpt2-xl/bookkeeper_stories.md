His son, Tai and grandson, Ani lived in Kailua. And Nai also had a son: Pua.

Shaka and Nai were very old and couldn't move around, so what they did is they made Nai write up the things that happen to them in a book and put it in a chest. Every month, they got together and read the book out loud to share the things that had happened to them.

Every few months, the man's son would grow a beard. That's what everyone in the community called their grandson Nai Tai as a way of saying they missed the old man.

One day, they heard a noise that was out of character for their quiet neighbourhood. When they investigated they found that there was a person in town who had decided to build a big house and a big farm on top of the old man's old house.
