Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Harry Dresden who loved decorating his office and living room – that is to say he had the most ridiculously awesome office/living room/etc. in the whole world. I, for one, wasn't familiar with the concept but eventually found out that this man's work was simply magical. His bookshelves were filled with books, his closet was filled with clothes, his car sat in its parking spot because it had been made with the highest quality materials, all the time his work was as beautiful as ever and it was all due to their care and attention. He was a great man who loved to decorate his space because he was very artistic.

However this is not the case today – I'm afraid your office sucks. Not because of you being Harry Dresden, or even the simple fact that your office just really sucks, but instead you have no care at all. Your office is not just a boring storage room where you just keep your things and you will forget about it in a week, but rather your office sucks because you do not care – or do you think you do not care?

Here's some examples of Harry Dresden's office, which is just so well done in this picture. You're welcome.

You use the door because it opens out to a lovely view of the Boston skyline.
