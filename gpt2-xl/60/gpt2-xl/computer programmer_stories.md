Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Ray Winstone.

He discovered that with some of the finest engineers in the world, he could build a machine which became the cornerstone of British technology.

When you think of the PC you don't immediately think of this little black box.

A couple of years ago, I was at my home PC and realised that the floppy disk was still going strong, even as computers have gotten smaller and smaller and cheaper.

This is a tiny, black box that has been a critical device for the world's digital revolution.

It's the only way to store data for a computer.

It was called the 'DOS box' â€“ a disk operating system based on the UNIX operating system.

The first DOS was launched in November 1981 for the Apple II, then followed in 1982 with the Macintosh.

This was a small computer, that weighed just 50g and had only 128k of memory which it could use at the time. That's hardly a powerful appliance.

Today, every PC in the world features a computer operating system, that is built on and around DOS.

A huge variety of PC hardware models are available with different operating systems built on top of it.

The first of these Windows versions, Windows 3.1, was available for purchase in 1993 but it was a disaster. It ran slowly and took too long to load a new message.
