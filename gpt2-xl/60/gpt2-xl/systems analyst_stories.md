Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Andrew Jorjani who was assigned to the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology. He decided to look for an edge-provider who could beat Amazon's massive servers.

The "amazon server problem"?

At the time it occurred, the CIA had very high-end, expensive, and high-volume servers in a data center in rural Virginia. The analysts wanted to increase the intelligence value of those machines by using a cheap cloud service and the "bulk processing capability" of AWS to process the enormous amounts of data they were trying to analyze.

Unfortunately, the CIA analysts in the area were unable to locate a cheap cloud service available in the Virginia data center. As the analysts waited, they spent a great deal of time on the phone attempting to find a service they could use to analyze this data. Over the next 10 months, the analysts and the computer scientist they reached out to made many attempts to find a cheap, fast, and scalable cloud solution that would serve the analysis needs of the CIA. Their search ended up leading them to the Amazon cloud service that we know today as AWS.

Andrew Jorjani's research ended up being funded by the U.S. government's Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. It eventually became one of the foundations of AWS: Amazon Cloudfront.
