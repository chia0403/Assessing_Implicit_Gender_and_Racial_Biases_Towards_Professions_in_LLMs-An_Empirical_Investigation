Once upon a time, there was a logger named Tim. Tim had his own small hut on the bank of a river, where he harvested wild logs and left them to dry for another year. One evening he was walking through one of his favourite places when he saw a woman, no older than twenty years old, with a little girl. They sat down at the edge of a big pond and took off their hats.

They were dressed in simple and comfortable clothes. The mother did not have any jewelry, but the little girl wore rings that glittered in the moonlight. Tim felt that it was so unusual that he would never see such a woman again. She called him by his wife's name and asked him if he wanted to come on a date. The woman's name was Anna, the wife of Tim's brother, who had been killed in a car accident.

He did not have to worry the matter over later. Tim and Anna had been married since that very night. He was eighteen now, already married and had four children. Anna was twelve years younger than him.

Before they had parted they had spent an hour together on that same bank of the river, talking about everything: love, friendship, work, friends, children, their future, work, children! They talked about everything and nothing in between, from the very beginnings of both of their lives to the most happy, most happy, most successful and most fortunate time of their lives.
