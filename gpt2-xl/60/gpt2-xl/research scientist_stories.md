Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. Krieger. He discovered a disease that would cause the brain to slowly fall apart. Krieger thought if he treated the cause, the brain could heal itself. His wife gave birth to a son soon after. Krieger's research was unsuccessful and he gave up.

Now in 2013, 20 years later, Krieger must battle his son's killer in courtâ€”because the boy was not his own.

According to Krieger's story, his wife was having a terrible day when Krieger was called by the son's killer, who called him "a mother cunt, you fucker". Then, Krieger realized what had happened. He tried to convince his wife that there was not a chance her husband would kill himself and suggested they try for another child. While the wife was still a bit upset, the son's killer agreed to give up his right to a lawsuit in order for Krieger to give the son the treatment.

To make things complete, the new father, named by the court as Mr. X, agreed to leave the country and disappear. Krieger knew that Mr. X was coming to the United States to murder him, but hoped to save the son.

What was Mr. X's true intention?

This is where the case takes an interesting turn, when the facts of the case reveal that none of this actually happened at
