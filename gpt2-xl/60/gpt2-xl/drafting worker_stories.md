Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Timmy, who met an evil troll named Malice.

Trolls, remember?

Malice was a troll that liked to eat other trolls after he killed their loved ones.

That's basically the gist of their relationship.

Anyway, Timmy spent his days drafting draft cards into a game called D&D 3.0, which was basically a Dungeons and Dragons-themed version of Risk on acid. And you were forced to spend money to do so.

You could pay your friends to take part in that particular draft and buy cool gear with their winnings, as Timmy discovered to his horror on one fateful morning. And Timmy didn't think much of it until he woke up one morning to find his friend Riffie trying to carve his initials into the back left of his head after the game. Riffie just thought that was the coolest thing ever.

He's totally still alive.

The rest of the cast was even worse:

Dorothy Fields (the character who could just not act like a character)

Martha (who was just the worst)

"The Lady" was the main bad guy, who was basically a man who had become human and hated humans but still liked to hang out with them.

That's basically the entire bad guys in the first D&D movie!

Riffie and
