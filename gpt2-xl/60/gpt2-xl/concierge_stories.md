Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Mrs. John and here's her storyâ€¦

When the Concierge and I first met we were both young and looking for a job. I'm happy to report that I got the job. After working for six months I found out she and me have the exact same blood type.

For the past six years I have worked at your neighborhood diner, with the same man, and the same woman. Mr. John has had a difficult relationship with his wife for a while now, and he told me that if God wanted me to stay at the job I would have to quit.

For some reason Mr. John has recently said he needs to cut down our rent and take away my health insurance. This has me worried, because God forbid any one of your employees could do any actual harm to the diner. God forbid! I'm worried that one day I might need to make you some kind of offer that is so fair that you would come over to check it out.

Just a minute, I need a minute to think.
