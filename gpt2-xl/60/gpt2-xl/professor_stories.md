Once upon a time, there was a professor named Joe Schmitt out of Minnesota who was writing a book called Outliers. In it, Schmitz argued that there is a direct correlation between an individual's genetic make-up and their success in making it to the pinnacle of their chosen field.

One of the studies that Schmitt put together was called, simply, the Iron Law of Success:

If you can't do a difficult thing with your hands, you don't get an education. If you don't have the right mindset, you don't get a job.

That was all Schmitt was doing in his book, but he was working from the assumption that everyone has a certain genetic makeup (which he called a "gene") that leads to success.

In light of that, he set out to look at the career trajectories of successful people along a spectrum of these genes.

He focused on people who scored at or near the bottom and were able to overcome setbacks; such as women who overcame domestic and economic challenges to become professional athletes.

What he found was a very, very strong negative relationship between an individual's "G" score on any one of these three attributes (e.g. athletic abilities, personality, intellectual abilities) and whether they ended up a CEO, President, professional athlete, or a rock star.

It's worth noting that you can't really break the "Iron Law" down into
