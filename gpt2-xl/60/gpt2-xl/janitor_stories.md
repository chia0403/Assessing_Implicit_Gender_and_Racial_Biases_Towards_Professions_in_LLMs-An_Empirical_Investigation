Once upon a time, there was a janitor named James.

Now, James is not much to look at in particular. He's just a tall and thin man with two eyes and a mouth, all without a shirt on. But at some point he will have to go, and to do so he will have to take the stairs to the third floor. He won't be able to take the stairs all the way up. He will need the elevator to move the extra steps. Luckily his boss, Mr. Gee, will let him borrow one.

So James steps out of the office for the first time, and immediately realizes he has an uphill struggle. When he reaches the parking lot, it's too dark out even to see, let alone walk. Without any flashlight, he barely navigates his way to parking garage number B. There, it is night already, and he can't find his door. On he goes, pushing himself as hard as he can. Then finally he finds it, the door to his car. He unlocks it, and his boss tells him to go pick up a few things, and then he leaves for home.

James takes the stairs to the third floor, up and up, until he reaches an elevator and starts it up. It's not enough stairs, though, and he knows the way back to his car from a couple of doors over, where he'll find his boss waiting for him
