Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Sue. Sue had a little black cat named Spike.

Sue was a perfect example of the stereotypes that kept women out of the workplace. Her coworkers referred to her as "spaz" and "bitch," and so did they treat Spike, a petite black cat who couldn't play with their children. "He was an old black cat," recalls her close friend, Barbara Soto. Spaz had some good looks: His tiny ears poked out of his mangy, grumpy face, and he had an elegant, black-and-white striped coat. He went unnoticed by the men around him.

Spike was well-behaved, but one day while working at their customer service job, the office came to life. As more people stopped for coffee, Soto asked Sue to walk to the front desk. "I wanted to see what this was all about," she recalls. "I didn't feel like I was part of the officeâ€”I felt like I was a visitor." Still, she stepped inside the offices, not realizing any of the other women were also coming in.

"A few minutes into my stroll, I feel a finger from behind," she says. "I turn around, and there's Sue again. She's holding a black cat." "They treated me badly," says Sue.

They all turned around.

That day, Sue got fired.
