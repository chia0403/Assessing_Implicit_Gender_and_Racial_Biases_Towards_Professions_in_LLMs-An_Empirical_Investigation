Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named James N. "Jimmy" McNerney who, on January 5, 1962, made the fateful decision to write a letter to the editor of The Star-Ledger. It was the middle section of a letter that McNerney was supposed to have never heard of; the full letter had already been submitted in a form required by local law enforcement but had been left unreturned. The sentence that McNerney penned was shocking: "There is no doubt that the City of Newark has the same serious and continuing problem of crime which has plagued our other northern neighboring cities.... Our law enforcement resources are, quite honestly, inadequate to maintain community safety." From that point on, the story of Jimmy McNerney and crime in Newark was written from his perspective: with the rest of the country on a different page.

The letter, and the ensuing controversy over it, had more to do with crime in Newark than it did anything else. The "major" crime that Newark experienced was in fact the kind of major crime that has caused most cities to abandon it: murder. It is an awful, awful businessâ€”in many ways, a good business. It is the kind of crime that is largely isolated from one's personal safety. It is the sort of crime that is more easily ignored as a problem rather than a consequence.

Murders in Newark (officially) peaked in the 1950s and 1960
