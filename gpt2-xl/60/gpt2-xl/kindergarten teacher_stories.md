Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Yuka. She had a strange, quiet, and shy personality. In addition, she was a terrible artist who struggled throughout her entire career until she just couldn't hold it together. With a career that would be on par with a terrible artist, she became a teacher of this little, unnamed kindergarten school.

This wasn't a school for bad kids anymore; they were now a school for the best of the best; all of the brightest in Japan, all of society... It was like a school of giants instead of a school for kiddies. No one wanted to lose to the class clown, nor to some kid with glasses. Yuka thought that's all we were, a tiny class of kiddies, and she had no plan to change that.

But even she had trouble holding it together at times. That's how her student body had changed. Every week, two new students arrived to the school. It wasn't that they were different in any way, they were exactly the same. There were only two differences: their names were Shinobu and Yuuto.

That is how the story begins.
