Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Debbie, who would make up all the stories about how you could do certain things to a plane that you had planned. Debbie talked about how you could have your legs on the armrests to change seats, or how you could have your neck held up with a towel so you could sleep. That was Debbie. But Debbie did not travel with Captain Dave, or with Flight Attendant Sally. And so Captain Dave went back to his seat and slept, and was awoken by Sally and informed by Sally that she would be sleeping with him. And the two of them sat there and tried to sleep. It was a wonderful way to start the day.

They did not know what would happen next. They had a very long flight. Flight 77 would finally be here when the time was well and truly ripe. But at a certain point, Flight 9 would start and they would begin their long trek from Seattle to LA. And, it seems, Captain Dave and Flight 9 took on some of the same passengers when they began their trek. At each stop the seat of "flight attendant" changed. Then, shortly after 11:15, there was a moment of clarity, and they were ready to make that last push. It happened in a way that made the people in the back row smile, and the pilot laugh, and Captain Dave began making a last push toward their designated seats. Flight 9 seemed a long way from Seattle to Los Angeles
