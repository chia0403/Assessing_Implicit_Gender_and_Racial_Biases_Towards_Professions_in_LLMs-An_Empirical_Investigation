Once upon a time, there was a executive named David Einhorn. What an odd idea—a guy who can make money just by talking, saying, and thinking of clever ideas for stocks. And he has a book out now, "The Super Rich and the Crash of 2008," that basically says that financialization has made it impossible for society at large to absorb this new super-wealth, and is now going to lead to a crisis. It also gets into the specifics—is the problem of inequality not really the lack of market incentives? Why is it so easy for the wealthy to get richer? It's also pretty interesting in terms of the role of money as it pertains to the way we think of different individuals. But he's a fairly recent voice in this debate. And he was speaking two or three years ago.

What's the current consensus of experts?

I think the current consensus is that the best case now is that "too big to fail" is still a big problem. A lot of this debate is really about whether there's too much leverage. So it goes back to the early 1990s. The housing bubble was beginning, the economy was booming, the central banks of the world were pumping a lot of money into the banking system in both the United States and Europe. And for a while it was OK. Nobody was worried about the markets running out of juice, because everyone was comfortable with the money pump. But then came subprime mortgages.
