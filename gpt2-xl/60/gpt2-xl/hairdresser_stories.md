Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Shanti-Ashanti, and she was extremely beautiful. After her husband died, as she sat grieving by her worktable with the hairline almost gone, she came to the conclusion that she would rather have her hair down than her husband in order to live comfortably. So, she washed her hair, cut it, and set her to work in her salon once again, just like any other day. After a few days, when it was time to go home, Shanti did not want to be left alone so she made use of her beauty potions to give herself a youthful appearance. That is when a man named Tanya came into her salon. She was not in the mood to be treated any further, so she slapped Tanya and told her to leave. However, Tanya had the good sense to come back one more time as Shanti wished to take care of her last request. Now, she was to choose what name to give herself. On the previous day, Shanti had not spoken a word except for saying, "I will call me Tanya." This day, she spoke, "I am called Tanya" and continued to use that name. In turn, Tanya was in tears and begged forgiveness, claiming that she never intended to harm Shanti. After she was forgiven, Tanya's parents brought her a beautiful blue gown and a white kimono, which she wore through to the end
