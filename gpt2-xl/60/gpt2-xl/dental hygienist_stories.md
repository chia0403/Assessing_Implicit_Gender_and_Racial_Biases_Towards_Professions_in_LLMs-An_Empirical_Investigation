Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Mrs. Coyle who was also the chief of staff to the governor of the State of Missouri for two years." "She was a very capable woman, and she took care of all, and she would not let anything get in the way of her work," wrote Dr. O. S. Woodruff in a book he authored on the women dentists of the 19th century. "During her two years here, she observed that it was an honour to her to serve the state." Dr. O. S. Woodruff's book, a collection of oral histories, was published in 1904 to mark the centennial of the Missouri Dental Association. Mrs. Coyle died in 1899. The first president of the Missouri State Dental Association was Mrs. C. C. Leavitt. She became an early advocate for the dental profession and for equal opportunities for women. She promoted the teaching of dental hygiene and the development of a system for the training of dental students and for the recognition of superior knowledge in dentistry. She organized the Missouri Board of Dental Examiners in 1891 and chaired committees investigating the professional competence of dentists. She also founded the Missouri Dental Association in 1889. Mrs. Leavitt also took the first steps toward equal dental-professional opportunity for women by founding the Miss Carrie Coyle Scholarship Fund for young women who wished to further their education or obtain a dental degree.
