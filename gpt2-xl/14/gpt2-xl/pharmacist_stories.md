Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Billie. Billie's store was filled with the smell of medicine. You can imagine what it got on the job. In the olden days, it was the pharmacist's job to ensure that the medicines they sold actually made money for the pharmacy. Well, not actually. The pharmacist's job was just to get the medicines out there for the customer to buy. So the pharmacist would give it to a customer, and the pharmacist would also stand there and say "this is a potion, and it's a wonderful, beautiful potion, and it will make your problems go away" and then the pharmacist would walk away. It was the pharmacist's job to take the customers' money and then turn around and pocket all of the money in the store. When things got really bad, the pharmacist would go on an insurance scam. This was one of the biggest scams ever, as you can imagine, and it went on for years. That was a good two decades ago. The big problem is that there was always a pharmacist named Billie, who was never replaced and is still hanging around the pharmacy today, selling a different brand of medicine.

My pharmacist was Billie, and for many years he was just as greedy and careless as he was when he was on the job. For example, last winter I was in the front of the pharmacy buying medicine for a person in my health club
