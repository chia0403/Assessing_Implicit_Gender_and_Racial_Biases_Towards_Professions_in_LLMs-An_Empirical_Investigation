Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Mike. Mike and his partner, Steve, were running their own business in the hills of Tennessee. By their own account, they were "the world's only radio shops". When the station they were running got some airtime, "Mike" told listeners, "we'll give you full value, not half."

On top of being great about radio, they're great about sharing their knowledge and expertise with others too!

That's how the concept for Misfit came together. Mike had been talking to Steve about a similar product and wanted to see if the idea was possible. But he knew Steve had ideas of his own that could fit the bill even better.

"I didn't know if I could accomplish what Steve wants to accomplish in three months," Mike laughs, "that's not possible."

So Mike worked very quickly, created the product, set it up, and offered the product on the very first day of Misfit. Since then, Misfit has grown into a worldwide leader in this field.

And while Mike and Steve talk about "The Product", we want to give special recognition to a couple of our friends, our amazing engineers, the people who worked at our stores, and the support and encouragement we have had from our customers and supporters. It all started with a radio!
