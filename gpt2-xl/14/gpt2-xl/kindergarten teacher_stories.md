Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mrs. Ritter, and she taught a few of the kids there how to run the playground. After one of the kids fell and rolled to the ground, she told him to pick herself up and come to school tomorrow morning. Well, as luck would have it, that particular teacher was also the principal and Mrs. Ritter's husband. A few days later, the principal's wife came by and told her husband about the accident. She said that if she saw the broken-down kindergartner, she would show him mercy. The principal's wife and the kids decided to get together and have a little fun. They went to Mrs. Ritter's kindergarten and got ready to trick the kindergartner. As soon as they got to the playground, Mrs. Ritter looked at each of the kids in turn and said, "If you let me roll you onto the ground, I'll let you roll off." As soon as she said it, the kindergartner felt a little tingle of electricity throughout his body. He looked up at Mrs. Ritter and said, "I know. I let myself roll!" The kids ran out of the school, laughing, as the teacher ran back in, her eyes full of tears. The boy fell and rolled a lot on the sidewalk, getting many splinters. It was later revealed that he had tried to kick the ball over the fence before he was tackled by Mrs.
