Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Dr. George Prentice in my hometown of Greenfield, MA. I enjoyed the drills and lessons that Dr. Prentice taught and found it a fun little exercise I could participate in because as a young boy I loved to lift weights and wanted to be good at it! I remember that a lot of time he'd spend working on the same technique over and over again before allowing us to work on it during the day. Eventually, Dr. Prentice became exhausted of working with an overly frustrated group of kids and pulled the plug. We never got to work on one of these methods of training, but I could still see the benefit he helped offer me and wanted to get back to it. When I decided to go back to college, it became a dream come true because there were so many different options available and I really wanted to train like Dr. Prentice did. I went off to my first class thinking that I was about to walk into a classroom of 10 year olds getting their hearts ripped out and instead was greeted by an entire roomful of 30 year olds looking to learn and grow together. We trained with more intensity and a focus on technique instead of just the lifting. This method allowed us to learn more than one weight in order to increase our repetitions and eventually gain stronger and more defined muscles! I have always been able to focus on the movement of each rep and work on improving technique and strength.
