Once upon a time, there was a professor named Richard Noll in the philosophy department. He was famous as "the most articulate critic of the relativist school" of thought. So you would think that this would put him in good company. Unfortunately, it appears that's not the case.

In his article "The Myth of the Good Professors," Professor Noll takes a page right out of relativist philosophy textbook, the work of Walter Lippmann. He makes a series of false claims about a professor at a University of Chicago named Paul Bloom, and shows how these falsehoods infect his entire article. He even claims that these "professors" even influenced Lippmann.

While I can appreciate the argument presented by Professor Noll for why he shouldn't even listen to Bloom and therefore has no reason to respect him or those like him, that's not the purpose of this piece. Instead, I am going to focus on one single false claim in Professor Noll's article, an assertion that is not even remotely relevant to the problems confronting us so today. In doing so, I hope to help expose the underlying irrationality of Professor Noll's argument, which is then used as a jumping off point to attack Prof. John Mack and anyone who disagrees with him.
