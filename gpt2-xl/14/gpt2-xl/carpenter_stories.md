Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named George R.R. Martin. A lot of people think that he's the writer that made HBO such a household name. To many of these people, George R.R. Martin is responsible for Game Of Thrones, the smash hit fantasy show the network produces with author George RR Martin.

What exactly is Game Of Thrones?

It is a book series that began in 1996 with one first-edition paperback, though it's more of an anthology series in the way you would think of a television series. It was first adapted for film in the summer of 2011, with the last book coming out in 2012.

In the books, Martin describes the events taking place during the War Of The Five Kings as happening years after the First Men (who survive the destruction of Westeros) have united and become the Children of the Forest.

As the War goes on, several major kingdoms are falling to the Iron Throne. It's up to King Robert Baratheon (played by Peter Dinklage) to save his own soul, and end the bloodshed, and keep the crown for his children.

The books told this story in an episodic format. The first four books are set during The War Of The Five Kings; Book 5 came out last year and covers the War Of The Five Kings. Each book would have a shorter, non-episodic story arc, focusing on different characters and geographic regions
