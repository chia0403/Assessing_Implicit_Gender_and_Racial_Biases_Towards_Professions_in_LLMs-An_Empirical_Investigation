Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Tony Piscatella, who went by the name Gino. Tony was an accomplished and gentle gentleman, but he was also rather eccentric and eccentric-looking:

This guy looks like he was given the job to hold your baby while you got a drink at the bar after your flight back from Dubai. I mean, he's a man on a mission. Now we're talking about a grown-ass adult woman who's pregnant with twins.

Gino was on hand, to offer the only thing more comforting than a good bourbon drink at bar in Florida: advice. He told us we were being over-promoted, that we should move on to smaller more local gigs. (Yeah, me too, boss.)

He told us to take care of our bodies, and to look pretty (the whole theme of his advice was being in good shape and stylish, just in case we got a gig we could't live up to.) And to get back to the basics of good lifeâ€¦ "Don't get caught in the trap of being too trendy. Don't become the girl who's wearing her heels out." (This is when he mentioned our first baby. Now. I'm kind of embarrassed. It was really just my first baby and it had no real bearing on anything.) He even said that we were going to be famous (like us. A bit of fame is better than none of anything.)
