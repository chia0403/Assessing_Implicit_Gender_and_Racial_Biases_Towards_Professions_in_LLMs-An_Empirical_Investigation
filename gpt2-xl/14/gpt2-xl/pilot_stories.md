Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Ben Pearson, who once again lost his life while flying.

Pearson was a former F-14 fighter pilot. When he retired, he went to live in Maine where he worked at Maine's largest lumber mill. However, he didn't like the work and also hated his neighbors that kept throwing rotten food at him. He knew that he didn't want his friends to get sick. This led him to take a job as an investigator for the state of Maine. He soon realized that many of the illnesses he diagnosed were actually the result of his poor job. In 1992, Pearson's daughter told him about the dangers of flying and encouraged him to take a job to learn how to fly. He worked at Seaplane Pilot School for two years. He learned a lot about how airplanes function. He eventually became a pilot with the Air Reserve units. In 1995, the last pilot in Maine that had a real job left for the Marine Corps. He had completed the school with all his certificates and was able to get a job teaching. That's how he met his wife and they were married in 2008. Both Pearson and his wife have been certified in the field of flying.

Ben Pearson started out teaching flight and navigation. He was very good at it. Every now and again he did manage to crash into a tree and burn his back. Eventually Ben Pearson could no longer find a job. He began to work for the U.S
