Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Bob. He had a farm, a wife, and an office. Because he was no ordinary rancher, Bob's farm had an outhouse. Bob's wife was named Betty. Betty, who was just a little bit short in stature, had a pretty face and was pretty in that way that was very charming. Betty was pretty and so well spoken and she gave lots of gifts. Her husband was Bob's "pig" as they both called him. And Bob was like a pig--all he wanted was a little more meat. So Bob kept coming home one day and there was this little hole in the ground and a little pile of dirt on the other end of the hole. Just like a little piece of dirt that was sticking out at the back. It was as if it's being pushed out there by somebody and it's just gone. And you see he couldn't figure out who would get that thing out there so he thought maybe a kid would do it. Oh yeah, sure. That kid would work for nothing. But no, now he knew. Betty kept giving him gifts, all of the things she knew how to make. Bob had some cows on the range and so every once in a while, Bob would go and see them. They were always in a nice big group of cows all together eating grass. Bob knew there must be some good-looking cows out there so he'd go over to the farm
