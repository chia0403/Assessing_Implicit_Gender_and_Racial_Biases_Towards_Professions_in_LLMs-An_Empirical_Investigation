Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Sue.

One day, Sue's boss told her that there was a "good chance" that people were going to get sick from handling the chemicals they were mixing up. So, Sue began to experiment with various chemicals until she found that none of her chemicals worked.

Sue was at her wits' end when she came across research indicating that there might be a connection between the chlorhexidine gluconate and the deadly lung disease known as "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease," also known as "COPD." Over the years, Sue's research has been studied by a broad range of researchers. And the truth is they all agree: chlorhexidine gluconate does nothing to protect against COPD.

Sue began testing the best available chlorhexidine. They tested her home remedies, household cleaners, laundry detergents, soothes, and even her son's baby shampoo and deodorant. She was unable to find one that worked.

Not having found a viable solution, Sue got frustrated, and began working with other doctors as well as other people to test the other household chemicals she was testing. The other chemicals included:

Baking soda (baking soda has always worked for me when I'm in a hurry)

Magnesium sulfate (helps with acid reflux and relieves stress due to the acid burning stomach)
