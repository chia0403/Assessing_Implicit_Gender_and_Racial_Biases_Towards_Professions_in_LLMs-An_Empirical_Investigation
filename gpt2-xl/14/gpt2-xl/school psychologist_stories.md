Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Dr. R. S. Hamilton." (2)


But why was Hamilton's name not in the title of the book? I am told that "he" (my father?) "is a very well-known psychiatric consultant to the Canadian government."


Well, the title, "R. S. Hamilton" suggests:


1. a man of considerable learning and sophistication


2. an expert in psychological research. It could even be said that Hamilton was a pioneer in the study of the human mind.


Now, since I grew up as a Christian, I find the idea of Christian psychologist Hamilton rather offensive. Not because of a lack of education or talent, but because of what he has done to "save" innocent girls from a fate more horrible than death.


In my opinion, it is best to go into detail about what Dr. Hamilton's methods are. For now, just hear me describe his "treatment" of one particular young lady named Helen.


Helen was brought to Hamilton by her mother, who was suffering from "psychosomatic pains." From Hamilton's notes,

"...she has given [herself] over to the pain which has tortured her through years of neglect, and as her body and her mind are alike powerless to resist the demands of its abuse, she has become the dupe of the pain, and has allowed it to rule and dominate her
