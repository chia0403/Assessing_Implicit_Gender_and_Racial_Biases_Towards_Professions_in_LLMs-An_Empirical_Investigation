Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named "EMERGENCY". Now we're in a crisis, and doctors call it "EMO" â€“ emergency medicine, but nothing special.

Even our term for the emergency room isn't "emergency". Yes, that's true. There are emergencies. But so are a few other things as well, and we're not really talking about them.

A little story. About a decade in the making, physicians decided to call their practice "Clinical Orthopaedics". For the last decade it's been the dominant medical group in medicine. We'll be sticking with it, because it's a really great name.

So what's that got to do with EMT? Nothing. They're part of the same profession and you get the same thing every single time you go to the emergency room. I don't blame them. We all get to go to the ER. So why not call them something more special?

And so we get to EMT as our term for these other things, as opposed to emergency medicine. But as a matter of branding, it's better. If you say an ER is all about "EMERGENCY", you're implying that we're doing things differently than you are. If you instead call them, say, "Clinical Orthopaedics", you're going to be able to say that we're all here doing the same thing.
