Once upon a time, there was a executive named Bill Gates. Now, Bill has changed his mind. The man who was once the richest man in the world has changed his mind about climate change. And when he did, I knew it was time to stop giving a damn.

In February, shortly before meeting with President Trump, Gates revealed he believes humankind is driving climate change and said that to avoid future disasters, we need to invest in clean energy technology. The following month, in an appearance on 60 Minutes, Gates said we must all take personal responsibility for our carbon footprint; we have to stop treating the planet like a commodity and start making a difference.

"If we don't change, I just don't see a lot of opportunity for us," Gates said. "I see an opportunity to build a civilization that's so peaceful, and we will be an oasis of prosperity on this beautiful planet, but at the same time we need to figure out how to solve the climate problem. We need to act fast. It's a really big problem and we might not have enough time."

The man with a plan to solve the climate crisis is here to tell you exactly what to do. And not just to tell you what to do, but to take your mind off the planet by telling you exactly how to do it.

In the video below, Gates shows you how you can become an environmentally friendly citizen and save the planet at the same time.
