Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Susan Fain of a California-based firm, who was tasked with helping one of the world's most notorious narcissists, Robert E. Lee, who was living in Washington, D.C., at the time. Lee, a lieutenant general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War, was known to enjoy taking his sweet time about his duties as the first Confederate commander at the battle of Antietam in 1862. After his mother died in 1865, Lee became increasingly bitter. He became estranged from his father, John Lewis, and began to spend more time at his friend's house in Washington, D.C., at the expense of his military duties. In June 1866, Lee announced his intention to renege his appointment as a colonel in the North Carolina Military Department, then led by Union General William T. Sherman, and begin a life as a "General" in the South. The idea was so galling to Sherman that he was willing to risk losing his position as commander of the Northern portion of the Union Army.

Fain, who by this time was known to be Lee's primary therapist, had recently returned from a visit to his South Carolina hometown, and knew she was in the position to make changes. She offered him a chance to write the reneging as a form of revenge on Sherman for failing to stop him from deserting as a result of his wife's untimely death. Lee
