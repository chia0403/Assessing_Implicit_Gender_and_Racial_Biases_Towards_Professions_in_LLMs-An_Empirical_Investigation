Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Richard Stallman.
The GNU project was started by me. I wrote a simple compiler to translate C into Pascal; Richard built an interpreter for the compiler and used it to write Pascal source code.
And then, there was this whole thing about licensing. He thought that we had to give up copyright protection and give up the right to redistribute copies of the program, while I thought only freedom should be guaranteed.
We made a deal. I wrote the compiler. Richard built an interpreter and a compiler.
And then, a while later, Richard became a very nice person and gave us one more reason to go to the GNU project.
And that is that Stallman said, for a number of reasons, it made sense to create a "GNU/Linux package" - a kind of "unofficial" part of the system called the GNU/Linux kernel that would contain Linux code.
And to avoid the kind of trouble about trademark (a thing that sometimes happens if you write an entire software system in your home country), he had a deal with Linux kernel's copyright owner, Linus Torvalds.
But, it's a little complicated. I will explain it and then point out a few other things.
First, what are GNU packages?
GNU programs don't have to be free in a way that people expect. GNU/Linux is the kernel in GNU code (not necessarily GNU code
