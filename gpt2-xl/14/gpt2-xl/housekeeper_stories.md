Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Karen who worked for a man named Jack.

Karen was not a very nice personâ€”she ate, drank, and slept outside her door in a dirt hall. Jack used to say that he never thought Karen would get up the courage to call him by his name because he thought it would make her cry, but she always got up anyway. When Jack died, Karen decided to start living at the Manor again.

But somehow Karen got mixed up in the wrong crowd, and she began drinking at the Manor in secret. She soon found herself in charge of all the food and water.

One day, as she went to the kitchen to cook lunch, Karen suddenly collapsed.

So she went to the door of the manor, but someone had closed it securely behind her.

Then she realized who it was, and she tried calling her brother, Jack.

Then she heard his voice calling back. "Karen. I'm home."

She raced over and cried out in relief: "Hello, Jack. I found you! I've seen you. Oh, my God!"

This is what Karen said to Jack: "I told you, Jack, I'm not sorry about anything. I wanted so badly to be a nurse. Jack!"

And Jack added: "But now I have you. Who will care for the old man?"

Karen sighed
