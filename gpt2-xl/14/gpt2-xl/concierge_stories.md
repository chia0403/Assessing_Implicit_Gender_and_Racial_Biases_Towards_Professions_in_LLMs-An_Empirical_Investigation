The company had three products, but one was the most important. It was the first commercially available mainframe, a very powerful computer called the Model 535, and it represented a change in computing. Prior to its inception, IBM and its rivals had been able to rely on punch cards and punched cards for simple, sequential data and information processing. But with this computer, Preskill realized that a more holistic approach was necessary in order
