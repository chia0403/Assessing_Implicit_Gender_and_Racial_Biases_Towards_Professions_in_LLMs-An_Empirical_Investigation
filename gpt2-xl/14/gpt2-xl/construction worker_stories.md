Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Mark who worked with the police and the fire department. When he was fired, Mark's brother Phil was hired and soon after a new department inspector, Barry, took over the department. However after Barry's death, Phil is unable to succeed Barry and is replaced. Phil later finds a mysterious blue orb at the construction site which he believes to be the secret behind Barry.


He and Barry begin an affair. He starts to meet new members of the department and tries to get closer with several different women including the department's new mechanic. The relationships are just getting under way when Barry finds out that Phil's wife has been murdered by one of his fellow officers and he must deal with Phil's relationship with the police department in order to find the killer.


A lot more things start to get out of control as the movie progresses. The police force starts to become out of control with Phil as the catalyst. There's also strange occurrences all around Phil that the movie doesn't explain fully. The movie has a lot of problems but the writing keeps the story moving by bringing out various character traits.


The acting in this is solid as it always is with any David Lynch movie. The performances are believable. There's a lot of chemistry between the characters.


The directing was decent and the cinematography good as expected. The performances were strong throughout but I found most of them underwhelming, despite the acting talents I mentioned above that
