Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Fredo in the U.S. who invented the cocktail, and it is said that he did it in honor of the owner of the Bar. The name was later taken by several bartenders, who then went on to help spread the cocktail as many times as they could. Unfortunately the name was only so useful given that most bar owners in the U.S. weren't too keen on the concept. So bartenders changed the name and bartenders changed it back.

In the late 1930's a few bar owners in the state of Illinois started making a similar cocktail called a Four-Seven. The concoction involved gin, rye, brandy, soda water, and lemon juice (all in the same glass). The bartender gave it the name Four-Seven because of something being brought on at the bar which was also "Seven". The original version was actually quite different, as this legend explains:

"In 1936, a young bar owner was going through some minor financial difficulties. The owner, in a fit of desperation, was forced to sell one and only one of his brandiest and best valued bottles of liquor to a bartender named Fredo. The bartender, not believing the bartender would actually pay for it, sold the bottle of gin back to the owner on the assumption that the price of lemon juice was quite low at 7 cents, and refused to pay the 7 cent tab for the bottle of gin that had been lost
