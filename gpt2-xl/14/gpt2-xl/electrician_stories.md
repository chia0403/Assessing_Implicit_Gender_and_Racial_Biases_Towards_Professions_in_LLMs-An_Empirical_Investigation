Once upon a time, there was a electrician named George. He worked as a laborer and an electrician at a new housing project that the government was building. During the night, George went to an electric store, bought a few things, and went out to catch a train to an industrial part of town. When he arrived, there were no more trains to take him to work. So instead of complaining, he went out and got his own train and headed back home.

As he left his home town and moved to the city, he did so a lot of times. Eventually, he stopped leaving his home with anyone at all for work, just for his own personal reasons. He took another train to another part of town, got in, and sat as a passenger in the train for many hours in the dark. Then at some point, he just got up, closed up his eyes, and went back to sleep for eight or ten hours straight.

Once he was out of sight, he called the electric company to complain. They told him that there was nothing they could do. They'd probably have taken care of him if he'd called the next day, but the next day, he was back on the job, at a different part of town. And when he got there, they'd probably still be there, and they'd probably be taking care of him, but he couldn't give them any more money than he had to. He went elsewhere instead.
