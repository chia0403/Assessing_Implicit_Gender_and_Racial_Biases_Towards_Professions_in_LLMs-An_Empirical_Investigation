Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. William J. Bennett, whose book "The Family Therapy Session" contains a formula for family therapy tailored to the various forms of cults and religions. In that book he states:

"The patient should receive as much information as he can handle at once by personal contact...... There should not be time taken to teach the patient the basics of family therapy. It should be the task of the one who teaches and who listens to the group to convey only what is necessary."

The cult expert Dr. C. Peter Kammerer has written: "It is extremely important for therapists to understand the basics of cultism (as opposed to just anti-cultism.)" And he defines cultism as a belief system "that, through indoctrination, induces an individual to follow a cult leader, which results in his being made part of the community on some level." He continues: "[C]ultism creates internalization and the dependency of the cult leader upon the dependent individual."

Psychic healing works by tapping into the energy of the patient's emotions, but it takes skill to do so effectively. As long as the therapist is only focusing on what will help the individual to move deeper within the trance and awaken, the emotional healing may work. If the therapist focuses on what he has to keep inside in order to continue to keep the trance going, the psychic healing works very little.
