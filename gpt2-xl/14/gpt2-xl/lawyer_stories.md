Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Thomas Hart. This lawyer was so good at his job that he was eventually able to beat most of the other lawyers in the law firm. Even with his superior skills, this lawyer fell short of Thomas Hart's wife. So Thomas Hart decided to go the road of making a fortune by suing his wife for divorce, but by doing so he was sued himself. However, instead of suing his wife, Hart went with the case and fought it to the bitter end until the case broke all records. Thomas Hart, however, still lost the case.

So, in addition to being a loser, Thomas Hart was also a dick: he sued his wife for divorce, and was subsequently sued himself. And he lost and lost pretty badly. Because of all the shitty things that have happened, and his loss, Thomas Hart became a successful billionaire thanks to this shitty defeat. For all of that and many more reasons, this guy is an absolute dick.
