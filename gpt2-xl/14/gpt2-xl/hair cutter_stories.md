Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Jax who ran for King and ended up getting assassinated by his own men. Now he is alive again, still in business and planning to make sure no one ever gets killed by a scissors again. His secret weapon? A magic pair of scissors, a gift from his friend, Lord Fenn.

This book is a great example of a first book that's not entirely perfect. While the worldbuilding is really good for the most part, it has several issues that could have been addressed more effectively or left as they were and kept the story moving forward. For instance, the magic world is a bit clunky. One problem is that a lot of the supernatural creatures have names that don't make sense and you need to look them up at a number of different spellbooks or spells to figure out what they're doing. Another is that Jax is only really in half his book in different parts of Faerun without much explanation for what the other half is. There are times when he just seems to have one sentence that explains everything about the characters. And there are times when the magic system becomes clunky, such as when it became clear that magic has its own alphabet and that the spellcasters had to know this alphabet to cast spells correctly.

It's worth noting that many fantasy authors tend to work out these issues in sequels. With Jax at least, we do not see these things and are left with the impression
