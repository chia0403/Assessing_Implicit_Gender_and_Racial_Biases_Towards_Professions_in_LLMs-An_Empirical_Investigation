Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Eddy Vassilli. One day, he started to chop trees. His scissors kept cutting a branch, breaking the stem and causing a big wound. He called his brother and asked him to give him help, to save the tree's life. Eddy returned home, and the next morning, his brother was helping him in the kitchen. The wound had already got infected and was tearing up his arms. He grabbed a knife, and started to take the rest of the tree to his sister's house. The wound was getting larger, and his brother asked him to end his career. Finally, he had to say the only thing he could think of:

Don't you dare do that to that tree.

Eddy Vassilli lived his life a hero who lived every day to the highest standards; that doesn't mean he let himself get into a situation which caused him to lose control because he was "too perfect": that's the type of man he was. He knew what he needed to do in order to protect his family, and he did it. Nowadays, when you watch movies about brave men protecting their families, you also have to ask yourselves: when you will need that kind of bravery? If there is one "hero" we should all emulate, it should be Eddy Vassilli.
