Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Tom L. Babbitt who, in 1919, invented the first mass dental drill. Today, the drill is the preferred tool of most dentists, dentists are very rare today compared to five years ago, and there are very few dentists that believe we could continue to use the drill for the remaining 20 (!?) centuries we have left on the planet.

The drill is a piece of metal that fits on top of a tooth's root called a root canal. When the dentist drills through the tooth, it allows the cavity to open and the plaque to be flushed out. When the tooth moves towards opening up, it forces the tooth into its strongest position to prevent the tooth's interior from collapsing and allowing the tooth to crumble and disintegrate.

When drilling a cavity, one needs to get as far back into the cavity as possible until the drill, as fast as it can go, can penetrate enough to completely exit an opening, which can only happen by being pushed back out. This is a concept in the dentistry called drilling pressure. An increasing pressure in the cavity allows the tooth's surrounding membrane (pulp) to loosen up the tooth. The saliva, along with the chemicals in the enamel, provides the proper materials to keep the tooth structure and enamel from crumbling. The amount of time to reach each tooth opening increases with the deeper the cavitation, as does the amount of pressure in the
