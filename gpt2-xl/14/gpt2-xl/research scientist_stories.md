Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Jurgen Schreiner. His work was all based and based on research. He believed strongly in the power of scientific evidence to justify scientific beliefs. He believed that the best method of evaluating theories is to try them out under conditions that are as similar to the real world as possible. Then, he would see what happened. Jurgen Schreiner was an amazing scientist who believed, not only in his research but in the power of his methods to demonstrate truth.

When a new theory comes along, it takes years of work and millions of dollars to create and test. After they have proven that their idea is correct, then other scientists are supposed to spend years testing and showing that other theories are invalid, or if the theory is invalid, that it might not even be a good theory. After all of that work, they still can't see the truth or show that it is the right theory. There is something wrong with the process of science. And the solution is that they spend a lot of time on the theory that was proven correct. And the other theories are then never even heard a second time. And that is a very bad thing because it is like the old saying of, that the best laid schemes o' mice and men often go to waste.

The old saying, "the best laid schemes o' mice and men often go to waste" is a quote I read, something in the New Testament
