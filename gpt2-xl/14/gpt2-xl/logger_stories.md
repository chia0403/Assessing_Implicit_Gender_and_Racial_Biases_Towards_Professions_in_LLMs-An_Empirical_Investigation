Once upon a time, there was a logger named Peter. Peter wrote an awesome system for logging application results. When I wanted to test my application, I ran my code through that system to see what happened. I liked the system so much, I wrote it into an application that was the starting point for this article. The application is a simple system for sending email with multiple subjects from a system server. It's not very complex. The most complicated part is setting up your email server and registering a handler (the email client application) to retrieve and parse the messages from the mail server.

The system is configured with a handler registered to parse the responses from the mailbox server (e.g. using a Java message parser). Here's the handler, in its final form:

public class EmailHandler implements ActionListener { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { Message m = e.getXml(); try { if (message.isType(Subject.MESSAGE_TYPE)) { m.setSubject(new Subject(message)); } } catch (NoSuchElementException e2) { message = null; } catch (ClassNotFoundException e3) { message = null; } catch (MimeTypeNotFoundException e5) { message = null; } } } public void onMessage(String... messages) { messages.forEach((message) - > { // parse the message into a Subject String value = message
