Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Michael Hastings that lost his life in an unfortunate car crash. It's been months since he died of an apparent suicide.

Hastings, of course, is one of those people that the media just doesn't bother quoting on any issue that he touched. If we knew who Michael Hastings actually was, if there was evidence of misconduct here, or if there was anything to do with the mysterious demise of Michael Hastings, these media outlets would have talked about it in a matter of minutes.

That is how little these media outlets care about his life and that he was murdered just adds more fodder to make sure there is no real investigation into his death.

If Michael Hastings were alive today, we could see a very different media reaction on the other side of the story.

Here's what happened with Michael Hastings that resulted in the death of his life. Not only was he the recipient of various awards and honors throughout his career, he was apparently close with a number of intelligence officials, and that's exactly what got him killed, while the media has chosen to keep its mouth shut for the last month about the death.
