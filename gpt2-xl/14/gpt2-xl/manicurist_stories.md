Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Karen. But, like many manicurists, Karen had never had much practiceâ€”her technique, though simple, was not one that had been taught to most manicurists in America. The way she handled her customers, her choice of colours, her cut, and her consistency all worked against her success, so after Karen started taking her customers in to try her work for the very first time, her boss kicked Karen out of her salon and forced her to work as a nanny, leaving Karen with no way back into the profession.

The more Karen worked as a nanny and the less she tried, the better she got at her job, but she never forgot how much she'd struggled for the little opportunity that might have eventually allowed her to go back into manicure, pedicure, and styling. As time passed, Karen worked in her car and used a credit card for her business, working 40 hours as her clients went to pay her bills, but still wishing that one day, she could try and take back her dreams. One sunny day, just after she'd gotten her feet wet with cleaning services, she got a call from her sister.

Dawn wanted to hear about Karen doing a pedicure and styling. Karen told Dawn about cleaning houses for $10 an hour (this was a "realistic number" so Karen kept repeating the offer to Dawn over and over to gauge her reaction),
