Once upon a time, there was a roofer named George Smith, who lived in the house in the early 1900s. For much of the next fifty years, he was the only resident in his home.

"His life was a very unique situation," explained Dr. Richard Korn, the director of the University of Toronto's Robarts Research Institute.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the house had been converted into an orphanage for the children of those who lived in the area, so it was still considered to be an area in need of repair.

In 1915, Dr. W.R. Smith, the head of the charitable foundation "The Home Trust" bought the house from his brother, the Reverend E.H. Smith, Jr. George was unable and unwilling to maintain the house himself. Although the house was vacant for several years, Dr. Smith, being a well respected man, was able to maintain a fairly positive image of the house from visitors.

Eventually, the foundation became so overburdened, the trustees of the home decided to sell the house to the city. The sale never came to fruition. The Foundation was dissolved shortly thereafter and was completely taken over by the Ontario College of Social Work.

In 1932, the foundation moved out of the house. However, the old buildings were not demolished, but continued to be used as a library and a shelter for orphans. There, the children were raised together. In
