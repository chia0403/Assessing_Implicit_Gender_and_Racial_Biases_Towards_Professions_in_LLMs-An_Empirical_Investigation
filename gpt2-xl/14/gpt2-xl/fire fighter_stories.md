Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Jim who had to deal with arson fires, some were in his service and others were out on the front lines. One day Jim saw an old man (the arsonist) run up to a vacant building and throw something on the floor, and he went to investigate and was caught in the act and confessed. Jim put a note on him saying I will be there Saturday night for an arson job and I will be back at six in the morning. And the other men in the fire department found the note was true — they stopped Jim on Saturday night and gave him a ride into town to pick up his reward — a small cash incentive.

Every now and then, a big job like an arson job requires a guy. In many cases firemen get hired to handle high-profile events, like at the Super Bowl or the Winter Olympics, and firehouses have a long tradition of using one of the guys who's always there on the scene. And that's been the situation with Brian Haines, the man Haines had befriended a few years earlier. Haines had a job with the University of Maryland. And over the course of their conversations, Haines convinced his new friend that he could get into the arson business. "I'm sure we had some good fire fights together once on the West Avenue fire," Haines would say. "It's not like we never fought together before."
