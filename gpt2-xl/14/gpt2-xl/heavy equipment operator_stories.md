Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Bob. A local shop that Bob worked for wouldn't accept part of his pay, so he didn't bother to check their paperwork. He then stole three heavy equipment trailers, along with the tools they were tied to. The tools got in the mud, the trailer got crushed underneath a semi-trailer, and the owner lost everything.

This story made its TV debut on the TV series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in 2009 as part of the "Lose It Faster" episode.

The show was originally going to star real-life "loser" Robert Kondo as Bob, with former "Wack Packer" Jeff Ross as the shop owner who discovered the trailers were missing. But Ross later said he was too embarrassed to be seen living in an RV, and Ross ended up in tears.

The original trailer-tampering episode drew a lot of negative attention toward Ross and the show, most notably from the RV Owners Association of Hawaii and former "Wack Packer" contestant Steve "Macho Man" Randy Bach. In 2008, Ross went on the Oprah Winfrey Show to defend his actions.

The TV show made a few other attempts to revisit the original episode. In 2013, there was a reprise of the tale, but the cast members weren't the same. And in 2015, "Wack Packers" superfan and Facebook friend Chris Seiler appeared on
