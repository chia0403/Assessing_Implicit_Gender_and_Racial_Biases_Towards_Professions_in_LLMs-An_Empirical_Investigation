Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Richard Gellin. He did not know what he was doing.

The very next day, a patient arrived at the hospital with two of his children in a car seat. He opened the car door as if he were going to pick them up. Instead, he jumped over the counter, and tried to wrestle away the toddler with the car seat by kicking, clawing, and throwing it on the floor. An urgent call went out to all emergency room doctors. Someone reported that the man was attempting to get into the operating room to get his children out.

And so, Dr. Gellin walked into the emergency room, and after a short examination and some "check-ins with his colleagues," Dr. Gellin decided that he must be the aggressor. He immediately went to the operating room and grabbed the toddler with force and began to administer an injection, the injection that would end his life. His fellow doctors watched on as his colleagues did everything but let him pull the trigger.

When Dr. Gellin walked out of the operating room, he called 911, reporting not only his crime, but the injuries he sustained. He reported bruising on his arms, some broken glass in his eye, and more. He was taken to the hospital's hospital in the same way he was in the pharmacyâ€”and his injuries were even worse.

After his arrest, Dr. Gellin was arrested
