Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Joe, who, upon hearing of a cat who was being attacked by a bear, devised a simple plan to bring the bear down. As he spoke, holding a meat cleaver in one hand, a knife in the other, a bear was slain by his cut.

The bear was a great fan of cats, and even though he was the size of a bull in his natural habitat, his enthusiasm quickly turned to fear once the new arrival came knocking. As a result, it takes a lot to bring Joe down; but to take Joe down you must first make him afraid.

In essence, Joe the bear was the poster child (or poster monkey) for the approach that is now commonly referred to as "fear reduction." When the science was first coming up with a way to train animals to fear humans and other animals, many feared it would be used to turn pets into fighting machines, as happened in the case of Joe.

In fact, many of the techniques used in dog training at the time were developed and put in place after being used to teach fear reduction in cats. These techniques have gone on to become staples in dog training today, but some trainers now believe that Joe was the first animal to be trained to fear.

Unfortunately, after being shot and blinded by Joe, Joe had to retire from the veterinary profession. His family went back to the farm and kept Joe alive for a few weeks in
