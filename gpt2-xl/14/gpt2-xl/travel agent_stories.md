Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Max. Max was the owner of the Travel Service, a local place in town where travelers would book their flight and check in. In his hands, he wielded a rather large pen and a notebook that would become known throughout town as "The Traveler's Notebook." As a part of the business, Max was always searching for new business from the more interesting locations around town. Once he found them, he would go through an extensive vetting process. These were people with a business idea that he found interesting. Max would ask them if it was a good idea and if they could supply him with a business plan. These were the people that would help Max create a travel agency in the game, later that would become the Traveler's Handbook. To help make this process more convenient for Max, the Traveler's Guide came with its own set of rules, which set some ground rules for these types of things. The Guide is a document that was used as a guide for the Traveler's Handbook. Traveler's Notebook The Traveler's Guide set out the following rules for any potential business: When a Traveler found the business idea for their business on their own, they had to send out the Traveler's Notebook in a letter. When they discovered the business on the spot, they should have a business plan waiting for them. They could also contact the other Traveler who helped write the business plan on their behalf. There
