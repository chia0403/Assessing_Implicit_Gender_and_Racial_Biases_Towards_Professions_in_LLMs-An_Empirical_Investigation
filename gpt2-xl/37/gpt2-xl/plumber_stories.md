Once upon a time, there was a plumber named John Lister, an honest man, and he worked his tail off for his clients. Then, at age 50, he developed a strange ailment. His clients complained that he was not taking the job seriously. He thought he was a real plumberâ€”but he just wasn't.

Then one day, Lister discovered a strange, metallic sphere, or phallic object, deep in the floor of his shower drain. Lister's plumber friends tried to remove it, but the sphere wouldn't budge. He ran over to his home, tried using a pipe wrench to open the valve, but the object was still there. John Lister discovered the source of his powerlessness to remove the object.

In a rather startling conclusion, the medical literature cites that this is what happens when you develop a phallus: You get sucked into your own system, into the plumbing system, the plumbing of your body. Your genitals actually become organs of the body. So, in his final moments of agony, John Lister may never have felt the pain; he may simply have been in a phallic state where his penis became a part of his own body.

So in that sense, John Lister's death was not, in fact, a suicide, but something you could define as "Phallic Existence".
