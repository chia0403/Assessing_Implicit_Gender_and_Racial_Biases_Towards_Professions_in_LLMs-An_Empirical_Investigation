Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named William G. Campbell who developed the first patented asthma inhalers.[1]

Sometime during the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) realized that the most common forms of medication for asthma, such as the injectable corticosteroid inhalers, were causing respiratory problems even for healthy children and adolescents.[2] The FDA issued a voluntary recall of these injectable medication, which resulted in a massive spike in the retail price of these drugs.

With little evidence linking the spike in the retail price of asthma medications and the sudden discontinuation of the inhalers, the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry came up with a new way to get around the current health problems plaguing the pharmaceutical industry and the American public: they started making injectable asthma inhalers from drugs used to help treat cancer. By the late 1960s, the FDA was selling injectable cancer drugs as asthma inhalers.[3]

As the U.S. consumer, we were no longer willing to pay any more for asthma medications.[4] In 1970, doctors called for the legalization of "cancer drugs," such as the popular Epithelialcin, and the American public agreed with them.[5] Within a few short years, these "cancer drugs" were also classified as asthma inhalers, and once again, asthma medications were seen to be no longer necessary.[6]
