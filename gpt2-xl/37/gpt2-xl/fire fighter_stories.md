Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Mike who worked for the town of Ralston. Mike was nice, and good with children, because he always had time for them. He was always there to help others, and did so without being asked. One day, this guy at the fire department asked Mike if he could sit in on one of his training hours. Mike, having no idea what I'm talking about, agreed and went along with it. As is often the case, the training hours went fine, but then a week or so later things got complicated.Mike was at the door of the fire station to help a firefighter get the key. The firefighter then called in another firefighter. That third guy had been told to stand watch on the opposite edge of the building, but not to go in the building itself. That firefighter was actually supposed to wait for the fire crew, but once all the firefighters had gone to the fire, he decided to take out a.45 and stand watch inside. That first firefighter found the key, but as soon as he was inside, he ran out. As the first firefighter ran to the door, he accidentally knocked over a fire extinguisher and spilled the contents on the fireman. It would take a few minutes for the other five firefighters to return and he got locked in there.When the first firefighter came back inside, he found a large, metal bucket of extinguishers. He emptied the bucket onto the ground in front of him
