Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named John Koppert. One day a man named John Koppert had a patient who was experiencing terrible discomfort in his lower abdomen. The problem wasn't too difficult to diagnose, given that Koppert practiced medical physics and has a degree in physics. The problem was that Koppert didn't know what to do. There was nothing Koppert could do to stop the pain and after a couple of days of examining his patient, Koppert was forced to admit that he wasn't sure how it was happening, only that it was something. After a few months, the pain began to subside, and Koppert was able to take his patient off of anti-inflammatory medication that might have caused the problem. The patient's life now improved. And, despite the pain, his sex life improved as well. So, the Kopperts decided that it was time to start a company. They built a business around this idea and started their own company. By this time, John Koppert was a successful entrepreneur. He was able to start another company as he saw fit, this time called Medical Physics. And it was a successful business (which led to others). But he couldn't just quit his day job and start a company, not if he wanted to keep the family business going. So he taught himself a couple of new things.

The first thing he learned was the importance of communication.
