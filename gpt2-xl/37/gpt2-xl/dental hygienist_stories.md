Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Dr. J.R. "Big Daddy" Ralston. He was born on April The First of the year, was given the name of the biggest toothbrush in the world (yes, like those fancy ones you get for your birthday), and he used only that toothbrush every night. You could buy toothbrushes at the grocery store all the time, but Big Daddy didn't just buy them; they were given to him by his dentist mother's friend, who was a witch, and the witch would put the toothbrushes into her magic bag, which Big Daddy would take to bed, then have to get up again all by himself. He used only a single toothbrush, and used it until he was ready to go to bed, then fell asleep to dream of the toothbrush. He was given a new one by Aunt Sue, but to keep him from seeing it he had to keep it under lock and key—which made him so mad every time Aunt Sue went to look at it that he was ready to smash his room down, leaving no trace whatsoever. To keep from seeing the toothbrush again, Aunt Sue hid it inside his trunk—which he kept under a stack of blankets, so no one could find it, then put the trunk under his bed. Big Daddy's room got a whole lot bigger as a result.

This is how we should be feeling about Apple. Big Daddy
