Once upon a time, there was a artist named John S. Travolta who became one of the top selling stars in Hollywood in the late 1980s. The year that Travolta opened "Touch of My Hand", we got a preview of what the star would be like in 1993. The trailer was created with high profile actors, John Travolta included, like Sean Penn, Elizabeth Hurley, Matt Dillon and Robert De Niro, but there was no dialogue in the trailer nor anything from the film.

On the set of the Travolta film, a very tired-looking John Travolta asked "Where's this all going, Chris?" as Michael Biehn arrived on set. Travolta, who recently spent five hours in a helicopter taking photos after his wife was shot in the head by an intruder, continued into the trailer, to where Chris Tucker, the one who was supposed to be shooting Michael Biehn while the trailer was being filmed, was sitting on a couch, playing video games. Travolta began asking around what all was happening on set.

To the surprise of many, Chris Tucker, who was on the set at a video game shop, showed up, along with several other actors, and began asking questions about the film. Chris Tucker is in good shape, so he was just glad to be seeing the Travolta's trailer again. Chris Tucker then talked about how much he enjoyed shooting
