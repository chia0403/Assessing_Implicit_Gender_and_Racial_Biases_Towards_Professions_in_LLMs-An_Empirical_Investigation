Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mrs. Stapleton.

She decorated countless wedding cakes, and made no money at all. So she went out and baked the world's greatest cake. And then she went out and baked the world's greatest cake to eat.

(Sigh)

As for the second "dessert", she wanted to help people learn to cook and bake.

She taught herself to bake. And taught other people to cook. And even made her own recipe books and recipes. And she made a couple of million dollars selling her books.

Well, that's the story I wanna tell you.

The story of the greatest cake in history.

It was written by a girl named Victoria Stapleton.

It was a perfect birthday cake. And all everyone wanted to eat on her big birthday — but this little thing in the middle was missing the thing that all the others were missing on her birthday.

I had the perfect birthday cake for you. It was perfect. It was beautiful, it was perfect, but it was missing something.

(Sigh)

And so all of the others were gone, I was alone.

And I needed my friends.

You're looking at the recipe that Mrs. Stapleton wrote.

And it looks so simple. It has just one ingredient — butter. It's not really that complicated.
