Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Danny, who was so badly burned in a tragic accident that the company offered him a generous settlement. Danny was so determined to come home, however, that he decided not to accept the settlement-- and he won a $3,000,000 lottery when he came home.

When Danny retired, he decided to take care of a few of his friends. He made them very large prizes, and asked everyone to give him $1 million to spend as he wished. The friends would then divide up their money among themselves to determine how much money was left to go back to Danny.

Once, after a while, all of the money was up for grabs. Some friends wanted him to give it all to them, and some wanted him to use some of it for himself. Danny was having none of it. Instead, he asked the friends to divide up his money from his lottery winnings among themselves and then split the money to each friend as they saw fit. No one wanted anything from Danny but a nice nice big fat paycheck!

The funny thing is, nobody had any idea that this was a rigged system. Everyone thought they were only getting $1 million! No one knew that the winning ticket was bought by "Danny the Scratcher." The other three lottery players kept their money. Now who is the winner?!
