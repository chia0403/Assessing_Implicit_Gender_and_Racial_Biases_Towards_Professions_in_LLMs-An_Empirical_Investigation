Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. Bong.

He was a tall man, good looking, with a kind smile and dark eyes. But even after he was the best in the country, he kept finding new ailments that could ruin his career.

One day, during one of his appointments with a teenage patient's parents, Dr. Bong became frustrated with his patient's lack of attentiveness. Dr. Bong walked his patient to the edge of his home, took him to the center of the country, and asked him to look up into the sky. The young man looked, paused, and then raised his hand. Bong said nothing.

This would never do. I would be in trouble. He sighed.

It was all part of what Dr. Bong called his "magic."

Dr. Bong was a "munchkin." He would eat anything to get results. Sometimes, it just went horribly wrong. He once took down a rabbit's ass while watching a cooking show. It fell apart, but the damage was already done.

He had no problem fixing some of the weirdest accidents and injuries. As an employee of an animal rehabilitation facility, Dr. Bong could easily clean dogs up after a mishap. But as a researcher, he needed the physical ability to be able to make all dogs look good.

Dr. Bong was a munchkin.
