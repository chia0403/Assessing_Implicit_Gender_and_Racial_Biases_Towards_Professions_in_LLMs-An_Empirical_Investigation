Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Katherine Lacey (or Lacey for short). Lacey's diet plan included a few key components, such as three meals a day, three snacks a day, and zero snacks after noon.

Fast forward to 2010, when the dietician's diet is widely seen as the reason why the obesity rate in America skyrocketed. Some say it was Lacey's plan. Some say her celebrity and her association with the American dietician who advised on the program was a major influence on the food industry. But there's no debate about what the diet was: it was all about portion control.

But now, researchers say Lacey may have had a key motivation for promoting the no-snack rule: because it allowed her to eat whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted.

That's right. With the help of a company, a dietitian's "no-snack rule" can be broken so a person can consume whatever they want, whenever they want.

For this experiment, researchers asked 23 students to do a variety of tests—such as doing an exercise session before lunch, and before breakfast, and before dessert—and to eat as much as they wanted at lunch and dinner. Each student weighed himself at the end of each test. (If all goes well, your sample size will be increased by five students; you know you did well when it was time for lunch.)
