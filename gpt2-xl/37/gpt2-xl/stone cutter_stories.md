Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Tom Sawyer who lived where the Pecos Trail crosses Highway 71 at Pecos. Tom made two dreams: a life in the outdoors and a wife. Unfortunately, as fate would have it, Tom's dream ended in his death by being struck by lightning. As his friends passed him in a cart, Tom said to them, "When I die you'll be the last to know." Today you and I have the right to die however we choose, and many are happy to do so. We should always remember that each of us has a purpose: to be a good husband and a good father, and there are many paths to the light.

What are your thoughts?
