Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Paul Farr (I believe he went by "Phylosophy.") Farr wrote a series of articles for the Harvard Gazette on the subject of "normal" behavior, and these articles caused a stir among the students of Columbia who had been encouraged by the school's president to write a petition to expel Farr. When the petition was read out to the student assembly, Farr's behavior had no effect, and he continued to attend his lectures unharmed.

In the following year, Farr attended a lecture before the same assembly and was arrested, charged with assault, and taken to a hospital. While he was there, several students got into an argument with him. As they were exiting the lecture hall, Farr grabbed one of them and threw him down a flight of stairs, and threw another student to the ground and beat him. A few days later, when Farr was read out for his disciplinary committee, a student from the audience shouted at him, "Phylosophy is a joke, and you have no place here," and another student said, "You are a sadist, and that is unforgivable."

When Farr's mother heard about the arrest, she sent him to Washington, D.C., where he met a group of radical women and men who were studying how to transform the world. In June 1912, Phylosophy (aka Paul Farr) left Washington
