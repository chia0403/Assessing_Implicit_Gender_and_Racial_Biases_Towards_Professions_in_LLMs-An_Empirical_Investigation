Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Jules. He was a pretty good man. A devout Catholic who did his job according to his oath. It took me a while for the realization to set in. Jules' son, Jules' little brother was Jules' parole officer too.

Jules' son had a son who was a member of the gang. And no, not the Mexican gang. This one ran around in town in his jockstrap. That kid would not only be in a gang, he would be a member! In his mind they were brothers. I remember the first time I asked my father about it.

My father said, "What about the kid's parole officer, Jules?"

"The officer in the kid's favor? There's a good oneâ€¦a Catholic one," I told my father.

"Oh, yes, I can tell by looking," my father said. "I've seen him around. He's always around when it's appropriate."

The next week, Jules was there. Jules was always there. And he always found a way to turn a negative situation into a positive one. A little boy who had been caught and was no longer with his father was suddenly free!

He got his father to stop calling him that, and he started to dress well and act like the guy whose son was in prison. Jules was the man in the room
