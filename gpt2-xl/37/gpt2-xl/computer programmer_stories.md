Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Paul Allen.

Back when computers were still a thing, Allen discovered that he didn't want to just code software. He wanted to build it. It felt like it should be a good challenge. The world had failed him so far and he thought it was his turn to do damage.

But that day, Allen decided to start with a few simple programs. The first program was built in a programming language called FORTRAN and used a few basic instructions. The program used arithmetic and storage. It was basic, yes. Then Allen began to add the language to make it more powerful. Using FORTRAN, he added functions for manipulating math data, making it more powerful. For example, BASIC didn't really allow for the addition of numbers but FORTRAN allowed Allen to do that.

Paul Allen's first business, Microsoft, was built on his success in creating the above programs and selling them to other people. His team developed BASIC but it was never used in any product. After spending years tinkering with the language, Allen realized he wanted to build his own computer language based on a language that he already owned: a computer he'd made himself.

Allen used his own language to create a programming language - BASIC. When he realized how much time he had already invested in BASIC, he decided to build a programming language as well. The program that became known as Fortran came from
