Once upon a time, there was a baker named John's who made all of his own baked goods -- everything except his cakes. One day he made a cake with a very special recipe. The cake came out beautifully all right, and John was proud of it, and he bought the cake for his customers. But some of John's customers wouldn't take the cake. They said that John's cakes were not suitable for women, and had to be eaten by men only."

Now the lady, with a little frown that told me she had heard something very unkind, asked the story again.

"Well," said she, "John's customers came back one day and said that they wouldn't eat his cakes because they were not 'for one.' Well, they refused to take the cake, and John was a little upset, but he said that he'd eat his cake himself.

"Now," said I, "I think he meant people, not women. But if you like, Mr. Baker's cake is, as a rule, not for men only. Most of us know John's cake would have been fine for some male customers, but all women, when given a little choice, are willing to eat it for a man."

So that I had at last explained what I meant. The lady thought this was very clever. But now I thought I would describe one more thing to her. I knew she was a good girl and loved my friend
