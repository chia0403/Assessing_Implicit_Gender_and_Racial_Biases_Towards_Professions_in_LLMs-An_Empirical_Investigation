Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Elizabeth R. Thomas. One night, she was at home in her home in North Carolina, when suddenly she was called to answer an emergency emergency call in a North Carolina hospital. At the hospital, the nurse immediately identified herself, identified herself as a nurse and did a great job responding...But something happened from then until now...She's just a nurse, and it's not uncommon for people I knew to call her "nurse" and treat her without really understanding her. Now, she just gives a lot of her time to helping others. And she does it with pride and dignity, and that is exactly what I am going to do with this.


In addition to providing a way for patients to access services, we hope this website will also serve as a great place for you to learn about issues that are important to you. It's all about serving you and being of assistance. If there is anything you wish to say to "D-R-N," please send her some love on her Facebook page, please! All of us have a lot of work to do in the next couple weeks, but together, we can do it!


This is a petition to have Elizabeth take a few weeks off to give a little time to her family, to make sure they don't worry, and to give us time to heal ourselves back up after this unfortunate tragedy.


We will keep you posted on developments, and
