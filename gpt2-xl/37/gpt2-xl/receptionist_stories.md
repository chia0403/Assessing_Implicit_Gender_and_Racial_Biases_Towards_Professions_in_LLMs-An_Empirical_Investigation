Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Maria on the TV comedy She's All That. And, as it turned out, her husband was also an ER doctor — but that's not true. He just happened to be one of the stars of the show, but Maria wasn't one of the stars. When she found out she'd gotten a job, she was ecstatic. "I came from a huge part of my life where I wouldn't do anything, because I was afraid of something … I had a fear of having these conversations with my husband. 'So, the doctor comes every afternoon and does your bloodwork,' or some shit," she told the Guardian. "When I left the hospital, all I could think about was, 'Does this mean my doctor never comes home?'"

You might think that the TV show would have a major influence on the job of an ER doctor, but it wasn't. In fact, according to the New York Times, "the stereotype of the ER doctor has been quite malleable in the years since She's All That" was canceled. Maria's job isn't that great now, but at least she can sleep at night.
