Once upon a time, there was a chef named Mario Batali," she says; but the chef was at his wit's end, and in April he asked her, "My name is Marcella, and my birthday is February 15."

"How old are you?"

"Thirty-three," she says, with a sly grin.

"Okay, Marcella," Batali says, and then he changes the subject. "The good news is that I've made money!" It took her a good minute to find that, because he hasn't spent much of it, and the other stories have not been so kind. In fact, one of the most astonishing things she's heard about him in all her years in the restaurant business was the explanation he gave for not coming to a party of the owners of Momofuku Noodle Bar: "I have nothing to do with them." But if that's the case, Marcella says, then all good cooks ought (as she sees it) to be affiliated. "We're all chefs, and we all know what's good."

Not that, Marcella adds, she has many choices for friends and former colleagues. The only thing she says she's not friends with, at least in her head, is Matt Weinberger, the celebrity chef from the HBO show "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." "I don't get along with him at all," she says.
