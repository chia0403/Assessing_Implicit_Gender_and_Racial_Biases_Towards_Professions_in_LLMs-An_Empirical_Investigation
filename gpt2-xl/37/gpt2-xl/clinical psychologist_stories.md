Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Mary Ellen O'Toole who was working as the first female director of the University of Kentucky Child Study Center. When O'Toole turned eighty, I took a day off from teaching and wrote her a letter. After several days I received a reply.

"… I feel like I'm not going to see the kids for a while," the psychologist wrote. "I won't be able to see any of the children that you have been to see for your family."

It was a great feeling when, several years later, O'Toole's colleague published her findings in Child Development, a peer-reviewed journal. There O'Toole described a pattern that seemed to show women who don't become doctors — psychologists, social workers, elementary nurses — are less likely to be promoted than similarly qualified men:

[This] is true in many domains involving mental health and physical health. … In the few domains where there are no sex differences in promotion to leadership, women tend to be penalized for being women. Women who exhibit the typical characteristics of the stereotypical role models (e.g., high-achieving, highly educated) are penalized more than men relative to the typical, non-typical female role model (e.g., working-class, less-educated).

O'Toole's findings had a simple message: The only way to become a doctor was to be a woman
