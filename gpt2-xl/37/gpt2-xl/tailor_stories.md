Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Ben Smith's shop in Baltimore. For generations, Smith has been the shop's top-selling garment. He's known for making perfectly tailored coats and suits that the owner said was better than if you had to wait six months to get it made.

But lately, they're outselling Ben Smith as well.

"It used to be that the suits we made would sell out immediately. People would buy them in the shop and it would sell, and now we get orders from other stores that have been waiting weeks for delivery," said Smith.

Most of the customers are tourists and international customers.

"They're coming from Europe and South America and they're just in town, so we're able to sell it just like we would anything else: the coat or the suit or whatever," Smith said. "I've been in this business for 36 years and never had anything like this happen."

Ben Smith's owner told 5 On Your Side he started getting calls about 10 or 20 years ago.

"So we started doing a little marketing with the jackets and the suits and getting a buzz going, we finally got a big following and just the quality of the suits and coats that we make has improved every couple years," said Ben Smith's owner.

He's started keeping an approximate count of how many suits he's made over the years. That number now stands at over 2 million.
