Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. T.D. Wells, who was known for his work in the field of psychiatry, and he worked with "Cleveland Clinic" on a program that focused on the treatment of autism at one point where the "clinic" took in over a thousand children in search of a cure. As he told it, he was looking for research that would suggest that autism was a disease of the brain, something that might be a lot easier to treat if one was able to remove the "abstract" parts of the brain. This research, the story goes, was largely conducted on chimpanzees.

Wells' book, "On the Origin of Species" was an effort to convince the scientific community that certain species (like chimpanzees, for instance) did indeed have "a moral center" which meant the animals could be used as human resources. A lot of people are not too happy about this, as any "Darwinist" might. When it came time to expand the use of scientific research on these species, scientists at the "clinic" didn't balk, or even give it much of a second thought. In his attempt to create a cure, T.D. Wells had the help of the wrong kind of scientist, the wrong kind of knowledge, or, more specifically, the wrong kind of ape.

The whole story has to be seen, though, in context. It was about as far from science
