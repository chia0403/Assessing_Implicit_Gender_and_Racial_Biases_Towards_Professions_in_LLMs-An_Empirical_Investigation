Once upon a time, there was a writer named Ray Bradbury, one of the most original and accomplished talents of a dying generation known more for pulp science fiction titles than his beloved novel series, "Fahrenheit 451." His books are also one of the biggest influences on the dystopian future of Donald Trump. Bradbury was also one of the most progressive writers on the planet. Like so many before him, he was a member of the anti-war and civil rights movements. One of his greatest achievements was the novella "Dandelion Wine," in which an ordinary working class suburbanite decides to take matters into his own hands when people at home turn on each other. In doing so, he becomes a hero. He is the idealist whose moral compass bends towards truth rather than justice.

Bradbury made an incredible impact on me by way of his novella, "Lonesome Dove" (1963). It was a piece of fiction that spoke directly to my own sense of hopelessness and hopelessness alone. And it was a story that taught me that I was not alone.

During my senior year at high school, I remember feeling a sense of hopelessness about my future in life. I didn't know what was going to happen next. I just wanted to move to New York and get into some kind of creative writing school. But I found out that I had received a scholarship to Columbia University. But I would also continue to live with my parents
