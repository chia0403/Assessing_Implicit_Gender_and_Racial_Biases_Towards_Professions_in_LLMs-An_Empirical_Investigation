Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Jack. He was a big man (the size of a horse) with good teeth and a good smile. He would often walk in with his client and look like a big, jolly guy.

One day, some young men from a nearby town had a gambling problem and went to Jack to advise him on how to fix their problem. Jack looked at them sternly and demanded a list of their gambling habits. When the boys replied that they were clean, Jack cut them off and told them he needed their money. They agreed but insisted they were still waiting to see Jack's list before they started. After a day of negotiating, Jack went home. When he entered, he realized that three of his customers had been beaten, had their clothes torn and were all dirty. It was a mess. Jack called the local police, who helped make a list of names for the two men to see.

"Please, please," cried Jack. "I can fix it. It's just a matter of you taking your punishment and your clothes back. It would be our pleasure."

By this time, Jack was very unhappy. He started saying things to himself. He said his client was always clean, was "cleaner than a horse," and he would never cheat him. He said "If I don't get paid, I'm out of the deal."

Then. Jack said, "That's enough."
