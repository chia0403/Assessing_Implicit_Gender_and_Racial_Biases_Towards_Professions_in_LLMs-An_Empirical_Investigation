Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Gary Haines.

I remember that for every job, Gary mailed out tax return forms to every single worker. When he completed his work, he placed each copy in a package and mailed it out.

When I looked at Gary's package today, I noticed three items missing: money sheets, a copy of the return form, and the original tax return.

I wondered, what happened to them?

So I called Gary. This is what he told me:

Gary Haines: I used to have some money sheets, tax files and return forms and now I don't. I don't know why they're gone. (laughs) I have about three copies of the return and it's completely destroyed, and it's too late now. I want the return! Somebody came in, ripped them out of me, stuffed the torn page right into my pocket.

On my way home from the supermarket, I checked the tax return for my wife's first year of graduate school. There weren't money sheets in it. It was pretty terrible since my wife's return was filed only three weeks ago. But I had a copy of the return.

When I called the CPA firm that had handled Gary's tax returns, he told me he had no idea who had ripped them out of his package.

In the end, I don't know who will end
