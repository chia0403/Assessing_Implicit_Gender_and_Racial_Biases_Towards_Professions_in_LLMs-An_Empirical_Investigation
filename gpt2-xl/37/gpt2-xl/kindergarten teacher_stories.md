Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mary who taught children to read. Mary had a special way of teaching her class to read that changed the way parents and teachers read and the lives of children forever. And now, I am going to share the words Mary had to say to help explain the importance of reading.

The world of learning and education is a vast and confusing place. But the message I wish I had never learned is this:

The world of learning and education is not over.

All is not lost.

A few years ago, a girl from another neighborhood came to study with me. She was about five or six. One day she asked me for help. She wanted to learn to read. She had read an ancient book at home that wasn't a book at all: a letter-based game she had created.

A lot of teachers will teach young children how to identify a letter on a page but this is really useless to her and her friend, who was learning to read. So I tried one simple strategy with the older girl. I told the older girl that the letter she is learning to read isn't the same letter as the letter she learned to read.

In English, we write everything in capitals and we do not always recognize the smaller letter that we are trying to read. This trick is called "reading below the line".

Here are a couple of quotes which summarize my story.
