Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Frank, who didn't like his mechanics that worked for the company and made his frustrations quite clear. Now, he's all but retired, but after coming to his senses, he decides to take his frustrations out on a little boy. This is how the ending of this short film plays out.

1. The Humbug by Tom McCarthy (2001)

You would think having a little girl named Holly coming up as a teenager, and then a little boy as well, would put a damper on it. Well, it didn't. It made Humbug even greater, and the ending to the film does, too. This short film is so good that after you watch it, you'll probably wish a bit bigger things had happened in it. And that's the whole point.
