Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Bob who loved to design posters. He would do them for different companies, and it was awesome! There was so much variety out there and they were always so well-built and well-laid-out. Some of the best, though, were the small posters that you had to display only in specific locations, because the bigger ones are too much weight! I had been a graphic designer for over 24 years, and I was finally getting to put a design out on the internet once in a while, but that was very limiting in a few ways.


First, I didn't believe that I really had a voice that I could speak to. I had been in print design and advertising for over 20 years, and I had been a graphic designer for most of that time, too. I thought that I had an "A" to speak to, and I took it for granted that people who saw my work knew to "see" it and I was never "seen." I also thought that if someone really liked me and my work that they would buy my posters. That's just not true!

I have a lot to learn, but I'm excited about seeing what happens over the next 15 years or so. The beauty of this business is that it has lots of twists and turns, so there's lots of room for me to grow and learn and grow and learn!
