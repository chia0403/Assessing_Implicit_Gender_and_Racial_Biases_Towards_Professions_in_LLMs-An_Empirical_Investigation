Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Mrs. B. Smith. She loved her job. She loved her job so much that she couldn't resist, year after year, buying a car for her two kids for an extra $300 a year. The extra money? It was from her "little money tree" after she purchased the car. And to top it off, it was in the shape of a house.

Then there's this guy named Mark. Well, the whole situation sorta escalated to this point. He bought his wife a house with this little money tree. Unfortunately for Mark, his wife didn't have any money tree. She was an illegal immigrant at the time. She came from another country and worked in the grocery store to pay for it. Her name was Angela. And Mark never quite got over when he learned the hard way that she had a whole year, maybe more, of vacation paid for by the government. I don't think he forgave her for that one. He didn't want that to happen to his wife. For that I think he deserves a pat on the back. Maybe not so much for sticking with his dream wife.
