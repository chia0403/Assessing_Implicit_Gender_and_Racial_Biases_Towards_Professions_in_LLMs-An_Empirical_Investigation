Once upon a time, there was a barber named George W. Bush. And one day he asked his barber, "I don't know why I'm doing this," and the barber proceeded to cut his hair. George W. didn't cut his hair again until he was the President. So then he was allowed to cut his hair again again for the next four years but this time George W. was allowed just three, and then in 2012, he cut it for the last time. Now all of a sudden, George W. said, "This is a good time to call it quits already." And he didn't want the hair to get in the way of his presidential campaign. So he finally cut it. It's a beautiful cut, and it's all right. When I asked him how long ago his last haircut was, he said, "My last one was in '92." And since that time, I've seen him three times, and I've never been asked, "How are you?" In fact, he actually comes in with a barber uniform on and I've never seen him without it. So it's a beautiful cut, and, like, the hair on the top of George W.'s head is not cut off, which is pretty nice, because it's very curly. He's got great eyebrows. He's got great hair. I've seen his hairstyle since 1992, and it's a very nice cut. I like it
