Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Peter DeBoer.

There's nothing wrong with that, as a professional of any kind I can imagine most realtors and salespeople could do no wrong; but let's face it, no one really knows what really goes on behind the scenes: who negotiates, who gets called and told to show up at closed houses, what the deal gets done, what the terms are in a sale, who actually gets paid.

According to the New York Times, this was one point in DeBoer's life that made him a good candidate for the most lucrative real estate job in the world, CEO of the company that was once called New York City's real estate commission (now known as the New York City Department of Finance).

The job involved convincing the City to give him and his fellow commission members a bonus of $15,000 per year, which he then spent on "big-ticket real estate purchases" including, on one occasion, his then-girlfriend Rachel Chusid's $2.3 million Manhattan apartment.

This would give the commission so much money, it would actually save the City money. The commission would get so much cash that it could just pay its taxes (of which there are many), its rent (again), it could buy new equipment (the commission has over 650 employees and a fleet of luxury vehicles), buy new cars, and it could even hire more staff
