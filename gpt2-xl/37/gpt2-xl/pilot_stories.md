Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Donnie Bach who had a bad day… (we had a good day)… and flew his plane (a Cessna 172) crashing into a cornfield. While the pilot's injuries were minor, the plane was nearly destroyed. The pilot did not get any compensation for the damage (no compensation), and he ended up with a $60,000 airplane that, quite frankly, can use a little TLC.

So, while this story is fun to tell and has some pretty good dramatic payoff, the sad truth is that this is a pretty common occurrence (and why is it so damn difficult for pilots to get compensated for a crash of this magnitude) and the compensation received is quite insignificant. The Cessna 172 is a well-regarded aircraft that gets up into the low 90s and climbs well on most runs. If you can fly it well and can land it, it should be able to hold up to the damage (it had some major damage to the engine and some minor damage to the landing gear). What's the problem? There are multiple problems with compensation.

The first issue is the difficulty in quantifying what a plane actually weighs. Aircraft weight depends heavily on aircraft configuration (airframe, engine, oil, fuel, etc) and aircraft weight is always variable. With that being said, it's a reasonable assumption that the weight of a Cessna 172 at landing is somewhere in the neighborhood
