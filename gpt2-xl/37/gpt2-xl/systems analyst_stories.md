Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Brian McClendon, and he discovered a series of oddities in the behavior of the world's money supply over a 16-second interval.

The most relevant of these oddities was that money is not exactly like regular money. Instead, it behaves more like a currency, more like a commodity than like money.

This kind of currency would not necessarily be in constant demand either, since it cannot be created by a central government. The more currency in circulation, the less the relative purchasing power of the currency (i.e., the amount of currency in circulation multiplied by the prices of goods and services).

This is the case when you buy something with dollars: the dollar is still "fresh" because it was still "new," so the more money in circulation, the less dollars you have. The same is true when you sell something for dollars: by the time the dollars have been exchanged, they have lost their purchasing power.

For the system analyst, this is a problem because the government has access to all the available dollars, either through spending to finance spending (and spending causes dollars to circulate faster) or by printing new dollars.

The system analyst's solution to this problem was that the government should only print new dollars as needed because money should not be in circulation in quantities that would have an effect on the value of the currency (i.e., more money in circulation equals less purchasing power).
