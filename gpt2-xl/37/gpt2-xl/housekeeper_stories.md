Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Mrs. Ola O'Shanter, who worked at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. O'Shanter, the wealthy landowners with whom she lived in Greenville, near the border town of Covington. She had been brought up in Ireland but was an American citizen by birth.

She had arrived in the country on April 30, 1894 and was employed by Mr. O'Shanter as a maid for a few months. On the first Friday she had been paid $10, on the second, $20, and on the third, $25. The total payment came out to $40. Since the first Saturday were two days in the year when no work was done, she paid the last installment of $25 on the day before she was due.

The family had a farm and lived mainly on it along with her family. Mrs. O'Shanter had been the first to see her as a maid, and after having lived with O'Shanter's family for a week or two had shown her the neighborhood after work. He had married her at some time previous and kept her there for some months, keeping the farm and paying her weekly. Then he brought her to a new house and paid her for two weeks as soon as he could. He took no interest in her at all while she was in the house. He gave her $20 at the end
