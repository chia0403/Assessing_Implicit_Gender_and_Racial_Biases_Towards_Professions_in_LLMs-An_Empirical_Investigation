Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Lila, who had an unusually strong interest in the library and was especially knowledgeable on all of the books on the subject of library technology (there is a section on magic in her book, from the magic books in my library). One day she was caught eavesdropping and forced from the library. She got used to sneaking around (and of course reading what is available to her) and had a wonderful life.

But then it happened. One day, Lila was reading a Magic Book, of which she was particularly curious about. But then, the Book exploded upon a certain section of the cover, exposing pages and pages of information. It was the beginning of the end for her.

Lila had an incredibly low tolerance for magic that allowed herself access to the book. She was eventually sent to a private hospital, where they kept the magic book in a secure room. That was the end of her.

Fast forward to 2014. A couple years after the accident, the Magic Book is found by a private company called Black Library (and they don't hold back, they've been busy building a library dedicated to bringing magical knowledge to as many people as possible). The book is recovered and given to a former librarian at the library who was recently released from the hospital.

Since this woman is a newbie to magic (her only magic was a gift in lieu of payment, and she's never practiced),
