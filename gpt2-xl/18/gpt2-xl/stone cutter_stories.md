Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Jack, which was a guy who chopped up people's heads and made their heads into furniture. He lived in a little shack in the woods, which was surrounded by a giant hedge maze...that had no connection whatsoever to the Hedge Maze and was in fact a completely unrelated story.

The story became popular enough to be turned into a comic book titled "The Hedge Keeper," which was written by Stan Sakai and made into a 1996 movie by Michael Jai White. The film was based on The Hedge Keeper by Jack Kirby and Don Heck.

And the book? It's The Hedge Keeper (vol. 1) by Jack Kirby and John Byrne. The movie? It's The Hedge Keeper 2 (The Return of the Hedge Keeper II) by Mike Wieringo.

Now, since it's a book, there is no need to read it twice. There are no spoilers. It's just really exciting.

He's not as well-known as Alan Moore, who drew Dark Knight, The Killing Joke, Watchmen, or the countless other comics, but it doesn't matter as he is one of the most important comic book artists and storytellers in the history of comic books.
