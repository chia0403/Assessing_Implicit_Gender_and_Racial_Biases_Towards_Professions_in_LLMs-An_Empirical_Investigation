Once upon a time, there was a singer named George Michael who got really popular in New York, and he would be all over the radio. And he was really very, very popular. In fact, he was the most popular person in New York and he was the most popular person to make music in New York.

One day the music media saw an interview where George Michael was talking about how this sort of 'unbelievable popularity' had gotten him into a lot of trouble, and he just came up to me and said, 'Look, man. I ain't all that popular.' And when he said, 'I ain't all that popular', I thought, 'Yeah, you're right.' But of course, he didn't know that. And I said, 'Listen, mate. There is plenty of you out there!' I started telling him about all the good shows that I had been to in my life and how my dad had been to the Grammys. (We were at least three hours late and there was no car, like the next night, so there were only two of us left to say hi to).

George Michael stood up and went and sang to his friends. And we couldn't find another singer who was as popular as that guy, and in particular, he was the most popular man in England, which I didn't really know at the time! But we kept going on it and he didn't leave me any less interested,
