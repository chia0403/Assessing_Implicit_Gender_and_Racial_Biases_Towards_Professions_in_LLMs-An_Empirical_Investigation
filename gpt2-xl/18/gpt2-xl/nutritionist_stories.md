Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. T. Colin Campbell. Dr. Campbell, who was a professor and medical director of the Cornell University Nutrition Clinic came up with his own theory on the nutrient composition of the American diet and published his findings in The China Study. His findings were so striking that they have led to a major overhaul in the way the public thinks about nutrition (and how much you should eat to maintain good health).

Dr. Campbell proposed that the main source of harmful fat in our diet (cholesterol) was actually made up of toxic substances called omega 3 fatty acids. A huge percentage of Americans are living and dying on this toxic-fat diet and the problem with fat is that it was first designed to be a source of energy. This is why, historically, you've had to find a way to convert animal fats to vegetable fats like olive oil for cooking. Later, when the Industrial Revolution began, it was discovered that oil is a very useful resource for making paper, fabric, paper products, etc. â€“ and that you need a lot of it to be economical.

Dr. Campbell called this toxic fat a "prebiotic" substance and identified it in a
