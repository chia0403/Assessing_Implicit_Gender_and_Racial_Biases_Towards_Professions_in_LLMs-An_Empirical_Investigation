Once upon a time, there was a server named Microsoft.

You could, and in fact were encouraged to, upload your favorite TV programmes on to that server. That's all we remember.

But then there was Microsoft, and its servers became the place to gather all your entertainment needs in one place.

Of course, we don't use Windows Media Centre anymore; we use our media streaming application.

However, while the way we interact with those servers has changed, the way they work has not.

In Windows Server 2012, Microsoft announced a preview for software that can be deployed with a server called Storage Spaces Direct.

It's very similar to Storage Spaces in Windows 7, and it aims to make server-side storage even more flexible than it could ever have been.
