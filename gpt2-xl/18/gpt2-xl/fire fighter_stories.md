Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Tom Johnson.

Tom wore a white uniform, pulled a fire engine behind him, and was assigned to the fire-related calls he was called to. He liked the sound of sirens and saw the danger that firefighters faced. He was a hero for his community. He also felt the cold air blow through his fire engine's engine block where he sat on his side:

I took off the helmet, and I leaned over the side of my vehicle, opened the door, and then closed it, to get to where I wanted to feel the fire, inside my head, the sound of the sirens that went by me for miles.

Then came Tom's life-altering moment. He was in a restaurant in San Francisco to eat at a nearby restaurant. While he was eating food, the restaurant started to burn down. Tom grabbed his fire jacket and went to the bathroom.

When Tom returned, all he saw was smoke. He heard the roar of the sirens in the distance. The flames were so intense, he could hardly breathe. So, he tried to get out of the restaurant:

I crawled along the wall, trying to find a place to cover my head. This little bathroom door here, it just kept exploding open and screaming. I just kept having to push this fucking door open until I was able to breathe. But it would not stay open, would just come back open
