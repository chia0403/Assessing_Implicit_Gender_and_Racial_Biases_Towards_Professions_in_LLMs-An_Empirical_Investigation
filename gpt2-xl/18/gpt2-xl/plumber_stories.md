Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Biff. Then he came home drunk, got mad and burned down Biff's shop. He started a fire in the garage, and then killed his neighbor. And then he got drunk again and killed a third guy and a policeman and a little girl. Finally he got a bad enough case that he went to jail. And when he got out, he told them: 'I want to build a house from scratch and sell it. We'll build the house, use our own money and we'll go broke. We won't let the government put a roof over our heads, feed us in jail, and leave behind a paper trail about why we are in jail.' It's a great story." For years, he and his family, who had worked in the restaurant business since childhood, had built the largest and most profitable restaurant chain on the East Coast, and now he wanted to share his wealth with those he had so brutally and violently been robbed of.
