Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Joe.

And sometimes he liked having a lot of cats in his yard because they kept cats in their own houses and he could give the cats new homes wherever they wanted to go.

One night Joe found a little orphaned litter of kittens in his yard.

It wasn't much to look at, but Joe didn't care.

The kittens were very hungry and scared, and they were too young to be left at home, but Joe, sensing that the kittens would make wonderful pets, picked two very young kittens and brought the two of them in his own house.

He taught them how to sit, and how to leave the litter box, and he got out all sorts of toys to make the most of them.

The orphaned kittens lived happily in his house until they grew old enough to be left at home on their own.

When they grew up, one of the kittens decided to go for a walk.

When Joe asked him what he wanted to do, the orphaned kitten replied that he wanted to go for a walk.

So old Joe gave him one little leash with two little collars and told him all about the neighborhood where he lived.
