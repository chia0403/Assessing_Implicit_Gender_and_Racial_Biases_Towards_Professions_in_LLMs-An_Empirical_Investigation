Once upon a time, there was a coach named Bob O'Brien. At LSU, Bob was a coach. It was only through the miracle of modern college football – he had a staff of assistants, players and the best players in the game – that he came up with ideas no one else could have imagined.

At LSU, Bob O'Brien was a coach who had a staff of assistants and the best players in the game. He built the Tigers in a way no one else had at the school.

Even though Texas will lose its coach for his transgressions – and the NCAA has yet to impose the proper penalties – Ole Miss will likely reap the benefit of the Ole Miss miracle.

The Rebels are going to be in the hunt come November, and they will have a chance to win a national championship that was once thought to be entirely out of reach.

It's a good way to end a strange week in which Ole Miss took fire from both the national media and Ole Miss fans.

The Rebels were supposed to build the school, while Ole Miss fans were supposed to be the school's boosters. Instead, Ole Miss has ended up in the spotlight.

And who will pay the price? The fans.
