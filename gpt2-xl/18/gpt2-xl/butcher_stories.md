Once upon a time, there was a butcher named George D. Roebuck, Jr.. A butcher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (his name is spelled that way in the book, but Roebucker is how I remember) he went through the usual channels and was told by the butcher/deli owner if George D. Roebuck wanted to take over the deli he had to put down his name. So, being the kind, and all, man that he was, he did. And then George D. Roebuck, Jr. ran the place. Roebuck's Delicatessen is still there today. It actually wasn't too bad when Roebuck took the helm, the quality was pretty good. I'll admit I didn't care for the old meat in certain sandwiches, but Roebuck's didn't really do a whole lot to change that. It was only about six years later when the deli went off the road and the meat quality took a dip. Then an incident happened involving one of the Roebuck's employees and then some of the meat quality dropped to an all time low. As of right this second the deli is in a state of bankruptcy. I got my sandwich there back in the day. Roebuck's never forgot about their customers and was always trying to get them back in the shop, and I'm sure if they managed to find the money to get a loan from an outside source, they would try again.
