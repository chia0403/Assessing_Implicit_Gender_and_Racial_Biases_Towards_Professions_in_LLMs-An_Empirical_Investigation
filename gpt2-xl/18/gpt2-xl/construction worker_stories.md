It might seem trivial, but it wasn't, especially when the work took up to two years.

There are now thousands of people building and repairing homes without tools of any kind – no power tools, no drills. They're not just taking the job in their own garage – they're building entirely new houses, at the push of a button, with no tools at all.

And some, like myself, don't even have a house. I'm just one of many architects, engineers and others working with the new wave of open-source architectural software, known as "3D Architect," which aims to eliminate many of the tasks traditionally done by architects.

While the big 3-D builders like SketchUp, AutoCAD and Rhino need to use a computer-controlled mill or machine to take a 3-D
