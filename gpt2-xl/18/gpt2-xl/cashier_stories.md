She has never worked in seven years and lives with her mom, two nephews, and a dog in a one-room apartment in West Seattle. Her landlord owes her $500.

Charlie didn't get laid off. She was a victim of the recession, and that caused her to suffer a stroke and end up with a disability payment of about $14,000. It was the first in a long line of hardships she'd face after suffering a brain injury.
