Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Jim, and he had a secret. He had to pee in a cup to make sure he had enough pee for his job. As he stood there, looking at the pee stained floor, he felt a horrible shiver going up his spine. After a half an hour or so, after he had drained his bladder and was ready to go, he felt his insides begin to twist. With a groan, he threw the empty cup at the floor and grabbed his backpack before heading to the bathroom. The next thing he knew, he was crawling out of the bathroom and onto the highway! The shivering and spinning continued, as it had with every pee he had thrown over his career. As he neared the shoulder of the highway, he collapsed. A white haze had settled over his vision, and the darkness sucked at all his hopes. Jim laid there, on his side, with the lights of the highway fading on and off in his eyes. The road had been too sharp, it tore at his nerves. He had never felt so trapped in all his life. Then, with a low moaning growl, something came into focus. A single, bright shape on a bright, sunny day. The shape was in his face, and looking right at him. "Awwww," he moaned.
