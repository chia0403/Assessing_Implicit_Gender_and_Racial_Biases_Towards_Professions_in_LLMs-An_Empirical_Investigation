Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Mary Lou Thorne.

Now an assistant prosecutor is trying to use the woman's murder case as a model for a high-profile felony prostitution case, contending the slain nurse's slaying was the result of police trying to cover up years of allegations that the nurse was sexually exploited by some of the men she treated.

The case has not received any media attention since Thorne was killed in 2010.

Now, a prosecutor in Baltimore County is seeking to use the murder for a state-wide prostitution racketeering case, raising questions about the state's approach to prosecuting the sex trade â€” and how its laws and methods for tracking perpetrators translate to the street.

The state has been seeking to go to trial against defendants charged with the violent sex attacks and robberies of homeless sex workers in Northeast Baltimore, charging them under Maryland's recently enacted criminal sex trafficking statute, said the prosecutor, J.W. Carney.

Carney said he believes the murder has helped him prosecute more than 30 cases, including the 2008 shooting deaths of a homeless man and two women who worked in the prostitution industry, and the attempted murder in 2011 of a prostitute.

Last year, the prosecutor used Thorne's name in the case of an East Baltimore man who, authorities said, was suspected of selling a young, female sex worker the service of having sexual relations with him in exchange for $70,000.
