Once upon a time, there was a executive named Eric Schmidt who wanted to figure out how to use the internet to help save the world. He was a member of the National Academy of Science, who put together this conference.

The National Academy of Science was not a huge organization. It was a bunch of experts. And there were many experts involved -- engineers, biologists, sociologists, economists -- everybody with a major understanding of how to build the world. Because Google, which is really great at building the world, asked them to figure out what it really takes to make the world better. They did not actually ask them what it takes to save the world.

So, this conference called the Inclusive Progress Report. We took the best experts in the world. We listened to what they had to say.

Schmidt's team was headed by Peter Suber. What he and his team have done is develop a way of ranking the progress of countries on a bunch of metrics that matter to people. So, for example, the United States has long lagged behind Germany in health care, so Google ranked the health care in each country in terms of how good an average American has it. For educational attainment, most people would say that the United States is pretty much the most educated country on the planet
