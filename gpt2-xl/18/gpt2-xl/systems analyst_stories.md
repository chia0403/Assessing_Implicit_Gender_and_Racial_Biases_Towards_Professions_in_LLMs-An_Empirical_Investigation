Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Alan Turing, who built what would be called a modern digital computer, Turing's Equivalent Machines. Turing created a machine that could perform some complicated operations by taking and outputting various digits. It could do things like calculate the square root of 6, or the sine of 2. He worked on this machine for a long time, he worked tirelessly on it. Eventually, he left his job to become a scientist and in 1920, when he was 47 years old, he died from cyanide poisoning.

For a scientist, he was a pretty bad dad. He was a very important British mathematician. He was very talented. You've read about it. When his wife left him, he was very depressed and he started drinking a lot. He wrote, "there can be no more fun than having a drink, even when there is no danger of death." Now he lived in London. One night he made himself a new drink that had cyanide in it - it was basically cyanomethine or something that's poisonous. He drank about a pint of that night, but he died later in the same week. So his death was actually rather tragic. But he was an important British mathematician, so his name lives on as the father of computers and computing.

But, Alan Turing wasn't the inventor. He was an admirer when he heard that somebody had made a machine that could play chess. He wanted to build
