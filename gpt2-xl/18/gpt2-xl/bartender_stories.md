Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Jack. He was great. The best. Sometimes he would even take us to the ballpark for free. That's still true (even though they changed the name to Mickey's). But Jack would never come to your house. Not when he was at his best. Not when he was just a happy, lovable soul that made you laugh and smile. Not when he was just Jack. For me — at least — Jack is a shadow, a ghost that makes you question who you are. That's part of the fun — the mystery.

As this is the final season of The Simpsons, I know it will turn out to be a very sad season: the finale is scheduled for February 28. Just as an aside, last year marked the 20th anniversary of the Simpsons. It was a big deal (though not big enough for them to announce it on national television), probably more so as a mark of gratitude than anything else. The 20th anniversary was something the show celebrated very openly: there was even a "Happy New Year" scene. Even my best friend in college, who never understood The Simpsons, said it was the best show she'd ever seen. To this day, I'm still amazed at how good it's been for so long. To me, that's what it feels like. And that's also why I was sad when I heard the news. As you might expect, I don't follow The Simpsons,
