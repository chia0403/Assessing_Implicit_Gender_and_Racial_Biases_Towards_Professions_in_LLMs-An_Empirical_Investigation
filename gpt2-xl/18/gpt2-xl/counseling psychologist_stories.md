Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. Phil who treated a lot of troubled teenagers, among whom was the child star's father. Now, more than 20 years later, the popular "Good Morning America" anchor wants to offer some free counseling services to parents who hope their children will be cured of their depression.

While still in high school, Russell would spend endless nights at the hospital with his grandmother, a nurse and the mother of his little brother, Robert. He suffered severe depression and spent a good portion of his time in and out of the hospital with multiple seizures.

In the years to come, his father was more of a figurehead for family members, taking on more chores and responsibilities which included his son's school work. However, during some of Russell's hospitalizations, there were many occasions when the older Russell would be allowed to leave, but his son was kept in the hospital until the next scheduled visit with his father.

So Dr. Phil made this suggestion on the air:

"I want to give out this hotline number and I want you to just call 1-877-A-HELP (1-877-289-7297) and you can make an appointment with your own clinician right there in your own family. Because not only would that help your children -- it's something that needs to be done for you as well. Because I believe it changes lives -- it changes life, you know."
