Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Judy who would encourage us to keep an eye on ourselves. She said a woman who had been faithful to Jesus would never let one of her children die.

At the risk of being redundant, one can think of a woman who is faithful to Jesus and is an ever faithful mother if she has an obedient son of her own. Then how can one tell that child that one day she and that son should give him up to the Lord? The child who understands this will say no.

When God puts His Word and His priesthood into our minds and hearts, we must make choices to live by them. That requires us to know better than anyone how to keep them. We cannot have our eyes peeled only for some reward out there on the other side of the veil.

No one can do this alone. We each will have to choose the things of God through Jesus Christ. That is our ultimate privilege.
