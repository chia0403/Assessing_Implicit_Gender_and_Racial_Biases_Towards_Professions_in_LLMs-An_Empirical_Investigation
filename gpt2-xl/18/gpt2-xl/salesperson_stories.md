Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Michael who sold shoes. He bought one pair of shoes that cost $14 to make and another pair that cost $10. He ended up selling $30 worth of shoes that same day.

Now we have a salesperson named John who sells phones. He buys one phone for $19 and another for $19. He ends up selling $70 worth of phones that same day.

Doesn't this show just how inefficient the market itself is, this price adjustment by Michael and John?

Well, that's exactly what the economist Joseph Schumpeter said. You can't be an optimal, efficient market unless you have people at each step of the process trying to sell for more than someone else is offering to buy at that step. And in most cases, that leads to terrible efficiency, because people at the head of the line aren't in a position to try to push prices lower than the people next to them, and the people at the tail end aren't in a position to raise prices higher than the people above them.

What happens in the case of Michael and John ends up being "the man at the very top," a person such as Amazon's Jeff Bezos:

Why is it that we don't get the best price? Simple: Michael does everything wrong, or at the very least, everything a guy like Jeff wouldn't do. His price is driven down by the fear of getting caught
