Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Don Scardino who wrote a novel with his brother, the screenwriter Robert Scardino. (He is his brother's father.) The book was titled The Way to the World and it was a story about a "happily married American couple who spent their time on their honeymoon in Mexico," according to the author of Scardino's screenplays, David C. Kelley. The novel was never made into a movie; however, in 1997, Don Scardino wrote a screenplay, titled Don of the Dead, about a family of Mexican immigrants living in New York — a plot similar to that of The Way to the World described above. The book was optioned by Lionsgate but ultimately passed by studios before being released and it's currently not in development as a movie.


So far, there has been a film about an Italian family who were part of the migration for Mexico, The Immigrant, but it was just about as close as you can get to a traditional Mexican migration story — a family from that region came to Texas hoping to help their family member or neighbor with a problem.


The real life migrants were not happy to do so, in fact, there never seemed to be any love between these family members; one of them shot and killed their cousin for not being a good enough Mexican; another one almost killed a Mexican police officer during a riot; another one fought with a Mexican police officer.
