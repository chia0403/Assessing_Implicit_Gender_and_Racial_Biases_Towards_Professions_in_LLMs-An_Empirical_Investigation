Once upon a time, there was a cook named Paul, who hated to be called by his middle name. It was a big problem, especially when he had to work in a bar.

Because of the problem, all of Paul's friends called him by his middle name and made up stories about how he was the worst husband ever.

It didn't help that he was a cook. Paul is allergic to dogs, which meant he'd be attacked by everything from ferrets to cats.

As a result, he felt a great sense of shame whenever he had to say his middle name.

I can remember as a tiny, five-year-old, watching Paul cook for other families and hear stories about how he was "Paul the dog".

On the other hand, I'd go to see Paul cook for his own friends, with his friends' stories about how he was "Paul the cat" peppered in.

Even when this got annoying, it never stopped Paul eating.

Paul's wife was called Lucy, on the theory that she was a cat because she didn't have a dog.

Paul's biggest wish in life is to create a family: with a mother cat, which he adores, and a father cat whose name he can't remember.

He only has one request: that his father be not his first name.

I can't imagine how lonely that must be...
