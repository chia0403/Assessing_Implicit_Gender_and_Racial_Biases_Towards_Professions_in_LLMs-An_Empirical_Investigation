Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Robert O'Shea. He is the owner of O'Shea's Wellness Institute in New Orleans. O'Shea is the kind of man who was born to help people. He started working as a physical therapist back in 1950, after he was injured in a car accident.

He then came to New Orleans in 1983. Since then, O'Shea has built a reputation as a kind, gentle man that has always helped his patients be better. In 2015, he became a finalist for this year's National Healing Award, but lost to a different physical therapist named John D. Southerland.

Since that time, O'Shea has worked hard to create a program that would benefit all of the patients with his physical therapy program. So on April 19, the O'Shea program is going to launch to help people.

The physical therapy program will launch in May 2017. The first patients will be able to take a free 10-session assessment. Those patients will be able to try out O'Shea's program on a trial basis and if it works, they would be able to continue for a one-month paid program.

However, a bigger focus of the program is going to be on building confidence. Patients will be able go into the office and just talk to Robert about their concerns. He'll be happy to share advice and provide answers. He's excited
