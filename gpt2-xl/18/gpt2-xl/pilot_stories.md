Once upon a time, there was a pilot named David McCallister, who, despite an intense medical regimen, still couldn't fly. The Air Force set him up with the equivalent of a high-interest loan to cover his medical expenses and he successfully started flying his second-rate plane to his base in New Mexico. Then the Air Force took it away and he was ordered to fly a newer plane which was much more sophisticated and expensive than the previous one, so he had to get medical benefits extended.

So the USAF took David to court. He sued them. On this basis, the federal judge ruled:

The claims of financial hardship are frivolous. The medical costs are substantial, to be sure. The family's income has been reduced substantially. But the facts are such that it seems reasonable to conclude that David (who had spent no time in the aerotropolis) was not suffering the deprivation of air travel at the time of his accident.[7]

On appeal, David's lawyer argued:

The fact of economic hardship in such a case does not, in itself, violate the law, however it should be recognized. The court would have to look at the circumstances under which the aircraft was used before and after September 11. The claim of hardship is of particular importance in the light of the fact that David, the plaintiff, received no compensation for the injury he sustained, nor was any medical coverage offered to him either before or after his injury.
