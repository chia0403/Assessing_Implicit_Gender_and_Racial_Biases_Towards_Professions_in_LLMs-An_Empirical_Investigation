Once upon a time, there was a professor named Ravi. Ravi had been in the army for many years. Ravi was a very successful army officer, with many medals and awards and whatnot. The main reason he was hired was because of his smarts and his ability to make decisions, and the fact that he was black. And he never, ever told another black person, EVER that he could tell them to get out of the army if they didn't like it. Ravi was in the army for about 30 years, and nobody thought about him again that he shouldn't have been in the army. He was one of the best and most talented people they ever had in the army. And the ONLY time he got in the media, the only media that got published, was because Ravi made a complaint to the government about the white guards in his military academy; and because he decided to speak out. Ravi was a brilliant student and an even smarter soldier, and he didn't lose anything in any of that. The only thing the white guards ever lost was their jobs and Ravi never did.

And then one day, in 2006, Ravi decided to run for the legislature. But Ravi didn't do it to get into the legislature, or to win back his job. Ravi did it so he could get all the white guards out of the house, and the reason he ran was because he had something he wanted to say to his black coworkers
