Once upon a time, there was a farmer named John. Now John is dead, and there once also was a farmer named Harry.

Well, there's a thing in the world called Harry Potter and there's another thing in the world called the Dark Arts. And, well, a wizard by the name of Ron Weasley was also a member of the Dark Arts. So you see where this is going.

Well, the story of Harry and Ron and the Dark Arts, however, will take more than one chapter to tell in this novel.

I hope you'll join Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and their friends on their epic adventures throughout the lands of the known world in this beautiful novel. And if you love fantasy or history, or both, then I highly recommend you will buy this fantastic and unusual volume from a company named Orbit books.

Buy it!
