Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named George H. W. Smith. For many years, he carried out experiments in surgery and anatomy; and in the fall of 1854, he published the results of his efforts, in a book entitled: "Experiments on the Anatomical Anatomy of the Human Body." In the process, he introduced the word "syphilis," and established certain principles of classification, including the classification of the different congenital diseases, in relation to the various classes of syphilis. These days, this particular piece of information about the disease would seem almost irrelevant, but back in 1950 this was not the case. This was the era of the "gay rights movement." Prior to that, there were many people who felt that syphilis was not a disease, but a social problem, because of what they described as the "fag lifestyle." However, when people began researching and discovering that certain types of venereal diseases were caused by sexually transmitted organisms, these same people quickly realized that not all the diseases were caused by the same kind of organism. This led to an interesting discussion at a national meeting of the American Medical Association, called the Conference on the Biology of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, which took place in Orlando, Florida, on April 14, 1950. During this conference, Dr. Smith, after announcing that his book with the name "Experiments on the Anatomical Anatomy of the Human Body", was now out of print
