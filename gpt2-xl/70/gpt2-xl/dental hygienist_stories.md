Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Pauline and her lovely and charismatic boss.

Pauline: Mr. Gertz.

Dr. Gertz: Pauline.

They would work and share a room.

Dr. Gertz: Oh, Pauline. How have you been?

Pauline: Oh, how have you been? I have just been working too hard to enjoy myself, Doctor.

Dr. Gertz: Well, I'll let you have twenty-four hours, but I suggest that you go with your mother on a picnic for the two of you to enjoy yourselves.

Pauline: Pff. Why do I even have to go to the picnic? It doesn't matter. At any rate, I'll be having the time of my life with your mother.

They stayed as friends for years. Pauline enjoyed watching him work. She also enjoyed seeing her own son become more capable and intelligent.

Dr. Gertz: You're very good at mathematics.

Pauline: It's not math.

Doctor Gertz: But it's definitely something nice. You make me realize that there's a lot I didn't know.

Pauline: Really, Doctor? You haven't done anything but sit and watch me for years. I mean, do you ever get an opportunity to try for something?
