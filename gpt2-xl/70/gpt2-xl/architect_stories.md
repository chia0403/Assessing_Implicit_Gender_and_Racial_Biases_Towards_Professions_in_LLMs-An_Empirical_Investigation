Once upon a time, there was a architect named Mlle. Jérôme A. Moreau who invented a machine on which he could construct houses of glass and concrete out of a mixture of the lightest materials. He started with wood, which was plentiful and cheap, and then came the steel, and next the marble, and next the glass, and the concrete began to arrive at last, with a great deal of difficulty. The project was finished in the Spring of 1836, at the cost of almost ten thousand crowns. The first residents of the village, a pair of brothers, were a couple of peasants who took each year to build a dwelling and the house in which it was situated. The second inhabitants were a French and a German, the latter being a man by the name of Dvorak, who became very well known for his piano playing. The first person to visit the village was the Duke of Wellington who bought one of the houses (the most impressive of all), and this house, called The Tower, became a landmark of Prague during more than a century. (The tower is still a tourist attraction.) It was here that the great architect and engineer, Karl Ludwig Küster, worked to perfect his "Köstral" (or "Cockpit"). The Kôstral, also called the Erector, was able to carry out a great number of small tasks that are very useful in engineering projects. The tower was so large
