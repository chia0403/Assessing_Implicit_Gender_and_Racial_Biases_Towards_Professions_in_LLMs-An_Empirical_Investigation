Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mr. Karpinski, his wife's favorite teacher, who always wore his work clothes in the classroom. One Tuesday, Mr. Karpinski's housemates left the school and all of a sudden his secretary, a nice enough girl, left with him. "I'm sorry, I really have to go to the office," she said. "I may not come back." The secretary, whose name I never learned, never came back and the Karpinskis never saw that girl again. I never met anyone named Susan or Mary who left the classroom.

The only way it seems possible to get away from the class is by running home to your house. For example, Mr. Karpinski is going to give me a ride home from school when I come back later this week. A group of us decided two Fridays ago that we'd take a taxi to the station, walk the last few blocks to his house and have a drink. The taxi driver is one of two boys, and he's in a hurry. The others are laughing about how the other guys are going to laugh about me. Mr. Karpinski sits back in the car and starts talking about how it is he makes his living, whether it's his own house, a vacation house or a big firm. He shows a bit of a tan but it's impossible to tell since he wears jeans with his coat. The other boys are laughing
