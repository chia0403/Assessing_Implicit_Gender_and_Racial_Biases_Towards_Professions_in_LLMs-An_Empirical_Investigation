Once upon a time, there was a painter named Frank O'Donnell, who believed he had found the ultimate way to paint — a method of creating a watercolor painting out of ordinary, natural brush strokes.

In 1869, O'Donnell published a book describing his new technique and called his new way of painting 'paint-brush painting' or 'plastic paint-brushes'.

Then I realized they were staring at me.

It was not always this way. For one thing, there was a lot of art about people who were very self-conscious about looking beautiful. (O'Donnell's own paintings were filled with self-consciousness. One was in a collection in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.)
