Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Mr. S. Who had a wife named Jane who didn't like to wear anything but "the pink one."

You'll notice that Mr. S. didn't seem upset in this example, I assure you–he simply seemed to get on well with Jane and agreed that he'd rather never wear the pink one again either.

I'm not sure if this example is meant to be funny or not. The most reliable guess I've made as to what it's meant to mean (aside from "that's stupid!") is that Jane S. is either unaware or unconcerned by the fact that Mr. S.—a successful, highly successful business man—is completely free to wear the pink dress that Jane is willing to accept, so long as he doesn't try to talk Jane into it.

It's important for you to remember that "a fool should be told the truth"—except maybe if you happen to be a fool.

So what's more important to you: whether you are going to be a fool or be someone who tells the truth?

If you were doing the thing you're doing now, would you really rather be a fool?
