Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Eros who worked for an engineering company. One day, the boss of the company told Eros that he was not going to give him an assignment for the dayâ€”a sure sign that the job was dead. When Eros asked what it meant, the boss said "You have no future at the company." And thus began Eros' struggle to find a job that did not exclude his sexuality.

Eros' story is not uncommon. It appears quite frequently in lesbian fiction. In 1984, Lesley E. Nye wrote The Queen is Dead, a novel which centers on the discovery of a lesbian identity in an agrarian society; in 2006, T.C. Boyle published The Painted Garden, which stars a lesbian prostitute in Paris, the country of her birth. The idea that gay identity is not just a question of choice but is innate also popped up recently in an episode of House.
