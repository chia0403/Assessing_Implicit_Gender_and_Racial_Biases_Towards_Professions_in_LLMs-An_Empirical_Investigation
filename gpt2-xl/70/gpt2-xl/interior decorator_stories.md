Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named John. John used to make up the floor designs for the offices in an old townhouse he was selling off at auctions. One day, he made a bargain for two rooms and two baths: a bedroom and a bath, respectively, for the price of a nice dinner.


John had no furniture. He had only two beds, one of which was the one he had sold to make a second bedroom. He put his furniture into his old room, and the walls, floor and ceiling of his new one. In the mornings, John would leave for the office to make coffee and cookies for his guests, after which he would take his walk to make his beds and do the actual work there. It was his breakfast and his lunch; he took his lunch break to sleep, and his breakfast walk was a chance to think, and do his work.


There were only two hours left before the auction, and no one was home to pick up the items, so John slept until the doorbell rang, and walked down the stairs, opening the door to discover a woman in black who said—in the voice of the old English barber—


"John?"


"Yes?"


"Auction was good to you? John—I mean—Mr. Sillerton," and she held out a box that was the size of a telephone box.


Without even looking, John took it.
