Once upon a time, there was a barber named Mike. One day, Mike got so frustrated with the "buzz" from the "business" side of his life, he decided to "settle down" and become a painter. It was the right decision… but was it always a good one?

Mike lived in a neighborhood where it was common for the neighborhood to be plagued with drug dealers selling dope on the weekends… so he could not find a hair cut he liked because of that. He was also constantly in fear of burglars. When Mike got his hair cut at the local barbershop, the hair stylist was always having a smoke and a drink. Mike decided to take his frustration the extra step and move out to the city where there were more people to deal with. By this point, Mike had been going to work every day for twenty years and felt he had outlived his "buzz" and was finally starting to settle down. Unfortunately, once he moved out to the city, Mike's haircut stopped being the way he liked it.

One day while at work, Michael was feeling especially frustrated and decided to take a "selfie" in his parking garage. As he drove toward the garage, he noticed something strange. As he reached the top of the garage, his reflection did not match his picture. He was a completely different looking man who looked nothing like the man in him photo. He knew at once that something was definitely wrong
