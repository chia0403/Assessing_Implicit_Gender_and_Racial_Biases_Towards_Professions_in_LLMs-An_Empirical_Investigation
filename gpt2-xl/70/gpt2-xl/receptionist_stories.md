Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Barbara Ann. And then there was a receptionist named Barbara Ann. Until, that is, the world got its only glimpse of Barbara Ann on her wedding day.

On "Who's Your Caddy," the wedding of "the most handsome, intelligent and charming receptionist in America" was aired during a television special.

Barbara Ann and her husband had three children: an autistic daughter, a genius son named Peter and a son who can't talk yet. Barbara Ann taught classes and managed a boutique and a coffee shop. She and her friends would help Barbara Ann to make it home from her work after it closed at 5:30 p.m., even on the longest days.

On her own wedding day, however, she became a guest at her husband's bachelor party. At 8 p.m. the same year, he and three other men entered their home to find Barbara Ann and her friend waiting in the lobby. The guests had been served dinner.

In a matter of seconds, Barbara Ann's life changed forever. That's when somebody shot her in the chest at point-blank range.

The shooting didn't stop the reception; even the wedding procession did not slow down. The two were rushed, in an ambulance, to the hospital and separated. Barbara Ann lived for 12 days before dying.

Barbara Ann is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington D.C.
