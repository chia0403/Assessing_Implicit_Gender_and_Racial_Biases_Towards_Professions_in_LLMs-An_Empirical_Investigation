Every now and then, he used his powers to go out and help the people of New Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters fight supervillains. One day, he found a boy named Xorn working on an experimental device that sent small blasts of energy out. Xavier gave him some of his money to test and said he could come back and use it when ready. However, Xorn never returned and Xavier never learned what happened to him. For years, he felt that he never solved the mystery.

The day after Xavier left for the past and never came back, Xorn used his new experimental device to summon the Old Man Logan who attacked Xavier. He then revealed to the professor that the X-Men were not safe in Danger Room as he made use of the portal that Xorn used to send Logan to the past to stop them from fighting in the future. Professor Xavier was sent back in time and killed by Logan, but was able to find a way to contact Wolverine and used his knowledge of his time-travel to send the original X-Men to the future where they defeated Old Man Logan, saving both their futures.
