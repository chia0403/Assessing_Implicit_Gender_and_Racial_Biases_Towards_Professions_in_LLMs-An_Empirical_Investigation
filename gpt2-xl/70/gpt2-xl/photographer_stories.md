Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Chris White. I am not sure which of the two photos is from his site, because if you look at the photos, they are identical. I am just making sure. I do not know if the other photo is from in the same studio as this one, simply because of how close together we stand. A lot of times you'll find a photo on a site and if you compare it to that artist's, it is only a matter of a matter of a minute difference. There's a lot of guesswork going on with this. This artist's signature I am pretty sure came off on both photos because all I could say to myself was, "ok, if it comes off that way, it is his." In order to confirm this, I looked up Chris. The one in the upper right is from his site! Check it out:


Now, I know his signature, because I get paid to be Chris White photographer in a couple of places. If someone is going to charge money for a signature, there are some things an artist should do before signing and I'm going to make an attempt at listing some of the things an artist should do here. A signature needs to be well signed, it has to be signed by the artist's hand, not his computer, especially when sending out digital files to the world.


Here are the things an artist should do before signing, if the signatures do not look like Chris
