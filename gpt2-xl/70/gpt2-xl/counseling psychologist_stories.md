Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Mr. Pinkus, who made you laugh and cry as you listened to his stories. Nowadays he's dead, so I take the time to thank him for making me laugh. This is his story.

Background: Mr. Pinkus made himself famous a few months ago with the release of his latest book, A Casebook for Survivors.

"It was around the height of the sexual revolution, and I was the only guy in my town with a doctorate in psychology. I worked for years as a therapist, but it was hard to find clients. I began putting out a newspaper ad and I'd contact anyone who seemed to deserve a laugh. By the time I got to middle school, I'd filled my home with so many funny cases – or they'd find their way into the school library – that the counselor started threatening me with expulsion if I didn't do it in class. After all, nobody wants to be the doctor who's never funny. So I made my own fun-page, got rid of all the useless stuff, and started filling the pages with cases."

After making his mark in the school's drama club, the counselor eventually tried to get him to focus on working full-time with students with mental disorders.

"It was too much work, too much time. I didn't like that lifestyle so I quit. I spent my free time writing and editing more medical humor
