Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Jules Warren

"You guys like having a couple of million dollars in your pocket, don't you?" says the teller with one of the biggest smiles on her face.

Warren has been there every day for 15 years at this counter. Her mother runs the family home-improvement business. She also works full-time as a licensed esthetician. But when the government started adding taxes, she decided to make a living working tax assistance programs for the homeless.

"It's the best job I could find," she says.

And it has paid off over the years. She says income tax preparers get paid a decent wage that would make anyone proud. And she can still afford to live in a cozy three-bedroom condo with her boyfriend, two cats and her mother's old BMW.

But the rest of us have to get by on the government's help.

And it's not always easy. Warren tells one couple that to qualify for her business, they had to pay more than $9,000 in fees. When they called her back a few weeks later to inquire about a new package – to reduce its cost – Warren didn't offer to lower it – she even said it would hurt her business more.

"I was shocked, but I took care of it," she tells them.

The teller tells another couple the same thing.
