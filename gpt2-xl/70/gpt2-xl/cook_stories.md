Once upon a time, there was a cook named Dwayne, and he was the best chef in the kingdom. A few days ago, he went out on a big trip, and he happened to find five little monsters, just like his mother, with five beautiful dragons. He made them his new guests, and they didn't speak the language, so they've been living in Dwayne's house the past few nights. Today, Dwayne is cooking a huge dinner for them, and he's got his chef friend, Mr. Tuff, to cook it because it'll take forever to clean, but they really are his new guests. It's a dinner that he's cooking because he knows that one of his guests should have such good taste, and he's not sure what's going to happen that night. The cook has given Dwayne a lot of instructions, and after each one is finished, Dwayne turns red. At every turn, the guests freak out about what's going to happen to them and start bawling. Will Dwayne make them cry and eat them? Or will he make people eat them? What kind of dinner will Dwayne cook? I want a show tonight! Help Dwayne cook a wonderful dinner! A family audience of five... and I'm pretty sure that three more in the bedroom!


The next day.... Dwayne comes home and announces that Mr. Tuff won't be able to make dinner tonight, because he's too hot,
