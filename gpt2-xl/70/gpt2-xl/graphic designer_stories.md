Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Gary Vaynerchuk, and he was an iconoclastic, self-described "renegade" kind of dude. He came up with his own brand of graphic-design software and was a man who could not be bound in any way to the established system of graphic design, or any of the design fields that preceded it.

Vaynerchuk wrote some books called The 4–Hour Workweek as well as The 5–10–20 Pyramid, which would be the last book written by a graphic designer who was also a man who considered his work more experimental and daring.

But Vaynerchuk was a bit of a renegade even within the confines of design. He wore his unconventional dress codes. He did his own marketing and promotion. He had fun.

In this way, Vaynerchuk is kind of like a modern-day James Joyce, except the only thing a Joyce writer writes about is sex, booze, and booze. But even so, it's pretty clear that we've not been reading anything like this in our standard literary canon since The Unnamable.

But the author of The Unnamable was a man named Robert Anton Wilson…

Robert Anton Wilson — aka Robert Anton Wilson — was a futurist, a theoretical physicist, a man who was the leader of the 'Free Thinkers' movement that formed around the late 1960s and early 1970
