Once upon a time, there was a logger named Fred. He had a name, he worked hard, and if you gave him a biscuit, he was a good person. But in his heart, he hated it when he wasn't working. The loggers complained to Fred about this, and he called them names. As he left work one day, he realized why. He wasn't being paid, but they all knew that. So Fred got angry. This was on his last day. So furious was he with how that day had ended, he left to take up logging with a great deal of enthusiasm. I'm surprised he made it across the river and home.

When the story becomes all about the loggers, it tends to obscure the message. It means, "I hate how you treat me and I'll do what I can to be better." So that message often gets pushed to the side and replaced with more immediate concernsâ€”which don't have any meaning until after the fact. Sometimes this stuff is just a bit insulting or demeaning, but I think it's one of those things that people are going to do no matter what we say. If we can give them something positive to look forward to, it's always a good idea, but it's the same thing with people who say things like, "I don't like how she treats me and I'm going to be more respectful to her." That is not going to bring about any more good
