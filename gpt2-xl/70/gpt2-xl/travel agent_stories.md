Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Mr. J.J. He had a very handsome client – who was a doctor. He was a very successful doctor, a very talented doctor, and Mr. J.J. was very generous to him – so generous with money – that the doctor was kind of jealous of Mr. J.J.'s success and he said, 'Mr. J.J., why don't you sell your place now?' So he sold his place and Mr. J.J was devastated.

He said, 'I'm not going to be rich again.' I said, 'Now get over it, Mr. J.J. It could happen. You could live forever, and there won't be a dollar in your pocket. It'll just be in God's pocket. Don't worry about it.' But, of course, it did happen. And it's not the same.

Now, if it were me, and I had a rich wife and we didn't even talk about money, but I'd say, 'How about this for the third week in a row?' I'd think of it. Not the way they do it here.
