Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Michael Gagne. The man was a regular at the local drugstore, so if you wanted to talk about the benefits of smoking that day's morning smoke you were in good company. But when Dr. Gagne began to smoke he found his attention was distracted. The same thing happened to him when he began to use alcohol. His attention was distracted to the point that he was a bit impaired before he even woke up the next morning. In other cases in which someone has had a concussion or another brain injury from alcohol it can be very difficult for the person to recall that they were ever drunk or high. However, since Gagne's memory is intact, it is possible for him to remember his first memory of drunk driving. What was it? It was driving home from town to visit his mother. He remembers it clearly and doesn't believe someone else took him to the wrong house.

We don't know if Michael Gagne's symptoms are unique in that he has an intact recollection of his first drug-related memory. Although impaired memory of alcohol was considered a sign of a brain that was heavily affected by the injury, a lot of people were not able to recall a first incident of alcohol use. But Dr. Gagne still doesn't think he had his first memory of alcohol before the injury either, but thinks his memory could be restored if he gave the alcohol a rest before remembering it.
