Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Mrs. Tindall. Mrs. Tindall (her last name hasn't been reported) was a highly productive library worker who used her considerable resources as a librarian and retired teacher to provide education for many students. She lived in a very nice house with her husband and children. She loved her children and they loved her. But she also loved her husband, but she felt she needed more time with them and eventually she married Mr. Tindall and they lived happily ever after.

She was pretty well known in the community and was well respected. Mr. Tindall was respected to the utmost extent, and was thought of a successful businessman with a deep commitment to his work. Mrs. Tindall also had four children. She wanted more time with them and eventually she did marry Mr. Tindall who also desired a great balance of time. When Mrs. Tindall died at the age of 85 some 30 + years ago, some of her children, including three grandchildren died with her in that last decade of her life. Those children (if they are still alive) would love her very much.

But now there is a problem on the horizon. Mr.Tindall is in his late 80â€²s and he has not wanted his wife and children to have the time they really deserve over the last decade or so. He would rather spend that time with his four grandkids, perhaps even
