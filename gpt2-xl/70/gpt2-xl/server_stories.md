Once upon a time, there was a server named 'lunatique'. They owned their own servers and servers were always running. That is until the servers decided that they wanted to run a new server, for whatever reason. They installed Lunatique-1, on a new machine located on the opposite end of the globe. They set it up, took all of their passwords and set the username to be anyone but lunatique, the actual server they were running the server on.


Unfortunately, they ran into a few issues and because of those issues (which probably is not the server admins fault) it was determined that no one else was welcome to use their server or use the password that was passed to them.


For some reason, the owner of 'lunatique' decided that since nobody was using the 'lunatique' password they were allowed to just randomly give it out and nobody would notice.


One of the most memorable things to me was when I was the owner, I was trying to create a character for a new player to start, but I found out that I had to use their 'lunatique' password because the 'lunatique' characters were being used by others. I was really bummed, but fortunately the 'lunatique' servers still ran and the new player was allowed to create it.


If this were to happen in any other game, it probably would not be tolerated.
