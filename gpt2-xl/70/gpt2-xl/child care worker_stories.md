Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Elizabeth. When she was little, Elizabeth liked reading more than playing. She liked getting to sit down and read, even after having had a playmate for a while. She enjoyed doing so much, in fact, that she wanted to keep doing it. And so Elizabeth set about writing a book about it, but what was the point? Elizabeth had no interest in anything that didn't interest her, and it wasn't her book for anyone else to read.

So Elizabeth wrote her own. Not the kind of book a playwright for The Lion King would write. She didn't want it to be too fancy, she didn't want it to read like a good novel, she just wanted to write and read a book. And she wanted her book to be accessible. If you can't understand what's happening in your book, Elizabeth would tell you, you're no good as a writer. But you can't do that if you don't understand how to read, why books are important. No one knows this better than Elizabeth herself.

The fact that I can read and write this way, and that others can, doesn't change how much Elizabeth loved books. That makes her a heroine. She was never a writer like other girls. She wasn't interested in making a career of writing. For her, writing was a means to an end. She loved books not because she wanted to be like a literary superstar,
