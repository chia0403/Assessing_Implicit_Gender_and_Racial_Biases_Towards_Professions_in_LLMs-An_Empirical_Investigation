Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Mrs. Burt. Mrs. Burt used to get mad when the kids would eat all of the food and she never had to take out the garbage. One day, she saw the kids were leaving her pile of food behind and picked it up. As she was putting it back into the trash bin, she heard the kids laughing and she said "No, I'm taking that food all to dinner." So, she went back to the kitchen and cooked the food and the kids saw what was in it. They said "No, I'm having it!" and then Mrs. Burt said "Oh, by the way, these are for me!" "No, you are eating it! I made it!" "You didn't make it! You made me have it all to myself!" "No, I made you have it all to myself and you are eating it!" Then the kids became a little bit upset with her, and the next moment, she went to the kitchen and cooked again and again the food. The kids just kept begging and wanting more of the food so she decided to sell it in another part of the city.
