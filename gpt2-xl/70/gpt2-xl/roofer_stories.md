Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Phil Bledsoe who owned a few things that you should try. Like Phil Bledsoe's house, which is located in Chicago's Gold Coast.

When the roofers left for their annual vacation, they left out this surprise for their family. The house has a little secret entrance that only Phil knows about, and even then he won't admit it to his family.

This house has two secrets, but the house was not designed for one of them. We've been keeping you up to date on how to find this secret doorway on Google Streetview.

So if you're a roofer, this one is for you.

Bonus: Here are a few more pictures of the home, including what it looks like on the inside!
