Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Carl who had worked at a garage for a few years - and never, ever had the opportunity to get rid of a car. Carl, too, was looking through the inventory when he came across a new Mercedes.

Carl took the car home and began cleaning it up and working it. It worked great until his boss, Mr. V, came back in and said, "Hey, I have your car. Go home and unload it from here so I can have my name added to the odometer."

Carl refused. He told them to sell to a garage or his house will burn down. He insisted that Mr. V pay him for the unloading.

This got to Carl's head. He decided that this would be his undoing. His mother, who was never home during his working hours, was called to pick up the car.

Mrs. V saw the new Mercedes sitting outside and thought it was her car. Carl saw his mother coming, and shouted at her. He took a rifle and shot his mother point-blank in the back of the head (though the bullet ricocheted and grazed her neck).

Carl followed in his mother's footsteps, but his method was much simpler. He simply went around the garage with his rifle, killing every car in the showroom and setting the store's tires ablaze.
