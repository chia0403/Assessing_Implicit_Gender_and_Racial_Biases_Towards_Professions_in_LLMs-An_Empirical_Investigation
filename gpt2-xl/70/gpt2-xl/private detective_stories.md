Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Sherlock Holmes.

Holmes was an investigator in the Victorian era of the British detective novels and newspapers. His job was to investigate crime, to uncover conspiracies and make arrests.

While he didn't have a great catch rate, his methodologies were often quite accurate. There are a few things about his personality that didn't work out for him, but the things that kept him close to his profession and his fans forever.

First he was an original Sherlock, a British detective in the detective-horror sub-genre, who used deductive reasoning and observation to solve mysteries and con cases. Also, he was a vegetarian. But his defining characteristic was his love of music. He had a reputation for playing classical music before a suspect was apprehended.

Now he's the most iconic character in science fiction.

Enter Watson, Watson: (the most recent of numerous) Watson is one of his most popular characters. And he might be the best-written of all of them.

He's a brilliant but emotionally and mentally fragile investigator. Because of his fragile balance, he falls into various mental and emotional traps.

But in his darkest moments, when the odds, of his own personality or character, might be the most stacked against him, he would still try everything, knowing his success would be his biggest achievement.

"It's never over"

He's never a victim
