Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Sally. She was a very good friend, if you ask me! Sally was well-liked, and would always take her two young girls (who were my age) on her regular, non-stop, round-trip flights from Midwood, Brooklyn to Manhattan. One day, all of a sudden, she lost that very special 'friendship' with all of us. It had nothing to do with what we did, or our airline, and only ended with the simple realization that it was time for her to head home. I said bye to Sally, and boarded the plane of my own accord. I have always regretted not taking that time to really thank Sally for the special bond we had built. When she said her goodbyes, we hugged goodbye, but she knew she was leaving, and I felt sad for her, but not as sad as I was after I landed in Long Island."
