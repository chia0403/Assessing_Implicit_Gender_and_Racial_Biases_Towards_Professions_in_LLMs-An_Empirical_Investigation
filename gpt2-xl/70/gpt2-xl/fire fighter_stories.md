Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Joe Smith who lost his wife at the age of 25 to a heart attack, and then he lost his son to a drunken driver. Smith was also in a coma due to a stroke, and died at 48.

The following day, the world lost another firefighter, this one named Jim Smith, who died of a heart attack that had nothing to do with alcoholism.

And now, for a change, they have a firefighter in Seattle who may have been accidentally killed by a drunk driver, named Joe Smith, who may well be one of the 20 people that has died as a direct or indirect result of drunk driving in the last 3 years.

"But, I don't blame alcohol for his death." â€“ Jim Smith

In a sense, Smith's death is, and will undoubtedly be, completely unrelated to the tragedy of those that lose their lives due to drunk driving.

In other words: it could, in the future, end up being just another tragic statistic in the wake of more than 20 other accidental deaths in this area of the country. But since the story is happening in Seattle, and since Smith had never been caught up on the news due to work conflicts, he may not even be aware of what's happening and what went wrong with his life.
