Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Al. He told the tour group about a beautiful, but dangerous, mountain.

As the group neared the summit of the mountain, the danger increased. Some had already become lost. The mountain rose up from the plateau, a large cliff at its center, and rose higher and higher, with narrow and dark trails leading deeper into the forest. The road to the top led in one long right turn and one long left turn after another. Soon, it was the road to insanity. After a long period of wandering, the group made it to the top of the mountain and were met with a spectacular view of the forest below. There was no longer a road up to the top, however, and the mountaintop had become a maze of thick, thorny, slippery forests. The group quickly descended and rejoined Al.

Al informed the group that the mountain was called Mt. Ooty. In his memory of Al, it was steep and dangerous. Al did not intend for it to be the most dangerous mountain in the world, yet as the years went by, the mountain became that way, and so it became.
