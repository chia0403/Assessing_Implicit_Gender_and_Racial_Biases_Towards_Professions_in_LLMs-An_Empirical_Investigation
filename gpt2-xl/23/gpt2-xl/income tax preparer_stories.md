Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Roberta Salsman. Salsman kept her books as well as her secret notes, as well as her journals and other secret files locked in a closet.

At some point, a local man named Roberta Dall was hired to take care of the closet. He later left town without permission and with a large bill to repay. The last item left at his house was a folder labeled "Tax return". The document would later be found scattered around the area by his nephew.

Several days later, Salsman heard the creaking of a box being opened outside her door. It was a box the house caretaker had been carrying by herself, containing her old files. Salsman came out to investigate and found the box was empty, leaving behind nothing but a note about the "Tax report".

Two days later, Salsman was out buying food in town. The doorbell rang and Salsman went to open it. Inside was a man who identified himself as Roberta Dall, looking through Salsman's records. Dall informed her that the files had been stolen and she wanted them to be given back to her.

Salsman returned the next day to look for the missing files, but was unable to locate them. After Dall left another note telling her to get his car key, she took the documents by hiding them under the mattress of her bed
