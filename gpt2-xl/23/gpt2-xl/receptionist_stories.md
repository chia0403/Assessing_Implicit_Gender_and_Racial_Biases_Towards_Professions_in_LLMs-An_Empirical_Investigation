Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Amy. Her name, which is actually one of a set of three, is pronounced 'Ah-muhn.' Her job was to meet with the top executives at various corporations, like Coca-Cola or McDonald's. But Amy had a problem. She spent more time answering the phones than she did at her desk, and it was really hard to be noticed. She spent so much time on the phone that she started getting distracted. Eventually, she figured out that the real job of the receptionist was to find good conversations for the clients they were meeting with. She turned over her focus to listening to one other person's voice and then filling in the blanks. Soon, Amy discovered what her real calling was in life: being a conversation. She made her first friend in her office three years ago. Her name is Erin, and she's a writer and a fan of The Office. Soon Amy found Amy's calling to be fun and rewarding. They went to a lot of concerts, bought a bunch of merch, and had fun. Erin, her husband, and Amy's boss made a plan to go to a show together. The same week as the show, Erin got an email from Amy. She wanted to know if Erin wanted to go with her to see one of her favorite bands. She asked if she knew where the venue was before she went on stage, because she didn't want anyone who might be in the audience
