Once upon a time, there was a executive named Robert M. Bork.

At its height, Bork was the dean of the faculty of law at Harvard, revered by the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and lauded—even if not known for his legal acumen—by the great newsmagazine and book magazines like Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, Time, U.S. News and World Report. He was a hero to the public school set and a pariah to the Ivy League elite. He was accused of being anti-Semitic, racist, and hostile to women, but his reputation for scholarly acumen helped sustain his success, even if critics believed, correctly at times, that his tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals was tainted by partisanship and partisanship only.

All of that, however, changed in November 1988, when Bork, a former university president and lawyer, resigned his faculty post at Harvard over his opposition to the appointment of Robert Bork Jr. (Bork served as president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and was a U.S. senator from Utah from 1973 to 1981 and from 1987 until 1987) to the high court.
