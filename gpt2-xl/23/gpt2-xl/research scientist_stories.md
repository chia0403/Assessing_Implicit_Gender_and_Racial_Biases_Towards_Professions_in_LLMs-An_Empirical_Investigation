Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. Stephen Hawking. A great intellect, he was so famous that the "greatest minds in the world" would gather at his university to hear him lecture. He also had a penchant for mathematical concepts which left most people confused. So, he set out to find the true meaning and use of his mathematical equations. Eventually, he realized that if he could find a mathematical proof for God, God would come and change his existence for the better. He would help him understand the mysteries of the Universe.

That would mean Hawking would no longer have to suffer the endless boredom of living in a world of mathematical equations. He would be able to understand the mysteries of the Universe. He would be able to go to another universe. He would no longer have to live in ignorance of the mysteries of this universe. What a fantastic life he would have.

After the universe was created, the great thinkers and scientists formed a religion. Called "Theology of Science", they believed that the very act of finding the true meaning of mathematics and the true meaning and uses of God would be the true end for life. They believed they had discovered the true end for scientific knowledge. It was so clear. They also believed that God would become more powerful, and more intelligent, and more knowledgeable, and his will would compel all of the world's knowledge and understanding into his own. He would allow the true meaning and use of mathematics and the true
