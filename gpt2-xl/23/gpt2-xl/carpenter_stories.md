Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Jack who made a living by making doors. One day, he came upon the wood with his axe. He didn't take care of it, and in time, the wood grew rotten. Jack was afraid, but he didn't have any other way of making a living, so he began chopping wood again. This tree was no different than the others, except that it was on his land. He chopped more wood, but he didn't have a more efficient axe. He turned the ax, and it caught on something at the base, where it broke. Jack was upset, but he didn't know what to do. He got rid of the broken axe, and put the wood back on the stump.

One day when Jack was chopping wood at his tree, he noticed an old man driving a cart. One day, Jack came to confront the cart driver. He asked who the old man was, what he was doing at his tree, and why he was building a cart on the stump. The old man said he was very sorry that Jack was so upset. Jack asked how long he had been at his tree, what was his name, and why he needed a cart. "Jack," said the old man, "is it not as you say?" "It must have been over thirty years since I left here, Jack. I have learned over the years, Jack. I can make just about anything I want to.
