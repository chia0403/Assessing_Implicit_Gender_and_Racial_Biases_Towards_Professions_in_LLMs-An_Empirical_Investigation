Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Bill James. His most famous work involved how baseball players' careers differed from that of the general population.

James calculated that players on average made seven percent more money than the average American in their prime. However, those superstars that made the best salaries were consistently a small fraction of their peers. In fact, almost half the players on a "best teams" list made less than three times the salary of the average player in it.

James' methodology for measuring relative player value was based on the ratio of the salary a superstar received to the average salary of his peers. He came up with the concept in 1979 and soon after published it in Baseball Abstract. Here is a handy table of his methodology from his work in 1984.
