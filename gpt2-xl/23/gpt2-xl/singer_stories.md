Once upon a time, there was a singer named Rammellzee, like a raccoon with a guitar inside its mouth. It was a big deal in the '90s, with a video for their single, "Mama Told Me To," that went viral. Then Rammellzee changed names and disappeared from public life, so the song faded into obscurity.

I have a problem with it, like, Rammellzee would not have gone that far. They might have gotten one or two Top 10 hits, but those ones would've been so random (like in the style of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda") that they would've been overshadowed by the other big pop-rap acts from that decade.

Rammellzee would be my favorite contemporary pop-rap artist, for sure. But don't expect to walk into any of their shows now â€” they don't play anything like that anymore. Rammellzee, bless its stupid heart, had that voice that you want that can go anywhere. And now Rammellzee has a new voice, and a new singer. The result is an album that takes a song that you thought would be about a raccoon but ends up about a girl named Rammellzee and drops it behind the scenes of the rap world.

If I'm being honest, a lot of the time she sounds a little more like T-Pain. She kind of sounds like he does,
