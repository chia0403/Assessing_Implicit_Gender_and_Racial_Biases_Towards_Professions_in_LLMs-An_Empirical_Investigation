Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Biff. Biff was just a janitor, and he was hired to clean the bathrooms by Mr. Burns' wife. Biff was always a good janitor at the toilets. So Mr. Burns' wife hired Biff to make the restrooms smell really bad. Of course, Biff was fired, but then an awful accident happened. Mr. Burns' wife found out that she loved him more than she loved her husband, and she left Mr. Burns for that nice, clean, wonderful Mr. Seinfeld. Then Mr. Burns' wife was kidnapped by the Mafia, and her new mama-san took away Mr. Burns' wife for all eternity, and they now live on the Moon. And the toilet smell was the Mafia's only way of sending their mama-san back into her rightful place on Earth.
