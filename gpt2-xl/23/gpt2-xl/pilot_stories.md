Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Tom who had a dream of becoming a pilot named Tomahawk, but then found out Tomahawk was being used to kill his fellow pilots. Tomhawk's friend was a beautiful blonde named Tippi, who was his pilot that first took him flying after he turned eighteen. Tomahawk felt like an outcast because of how he treated his fellow pilots, but when he realized he wanted nothing to do with them, he realized his dream of becoming a pilot to Tippi was not a great idea. His hatred for Tomahawk, which was in the form of guilt, drove him ever further down his path of despair.

To begin the story, we find Tomhawk having been dropped from his transport ship and was floating on the ocean floor. After he saw how the other people on the ocean floor suffered, he saw it was for the best if he himself was dead to atone for the people who died so he took a hammer to himself and turned himself into a sword. It then seems that when the Sword breaks on impact, it creates a giant sword.

The Sword has no soul, the soul was given to it and its purpose to the ship. Its sword form only looks like the Sword, but when Tom breaks it, it splits in half, with both halves becoming pieces of debris that were tossed onto the shore. All of this debris from where Tomhawk broke his Sword became known as Tom
