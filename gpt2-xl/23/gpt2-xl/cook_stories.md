Once upon a time, there was a cook named Bill and his four children, all women. His wife worked for the government and they had no kids of our own, but he loved the children and cared about them. They were very popular at school.

But after the children grew up, Bill tried to make amends and help others. He opened a restaurant. His employees liked working at the restaurant. But they didn't like seeing their boss get rich. So he decided to run for the county council.

For example, when he was running, he gave a big gift to the school, and they got a big budget boost. You know, everyone got money when Bill got elected. But he didn't think his workers—because they were women, his workers—should have gotten all the money. Why should they? He was just trying to do good for them.

So he got the guys in the shop to work for him while he went off to the county board meeting dressed as a woman. It was a fake election. Bill couldn't run as a woman because there weren't any female politicians alive when he was running for office. So he dressed as a woman—I have no idea where he got the wig, which was very expensive—and went down to the county meeting dressed as a woman. He dressed as a woman while people were counting the votes. But he got kicked off the county board. He got his name off the elections board.
