Once upon a time, there was a writer named Michael Connors, and he wrote two short stories called "A Ghost in the Fire" and "A Woman on the Edge of the Door," and nobody read them. They were about the same size as this book. They were so small there was no way to fit them on the shelf. They were like tiny little stories about a tiny little man on the edge of the door. And then I heard that there was a movie being made of both of those stories, and the book became a sort of a prop in the movie.
