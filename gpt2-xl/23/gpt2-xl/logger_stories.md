Once upon a time, there was a logger named 'T. J. Kirk'. Once upon a time, there was a ship named 'T. J. Kirk' - a very, very small and very, very tired ship that did not have enough time or room to hold more than one man.

There is only one more chance for this to happen before the ship goes out of service. If we had an open race, of course, we would be in business with this man.

All his life, he has been thinking of the future.

He knows that everything will be all right.
