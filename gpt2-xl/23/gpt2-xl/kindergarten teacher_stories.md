Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Betty Davis who taught at the elementary school at 710 S. Union near downtown Los Angeles. She was a teacher before she was a public figure; she went into education to fight poverty, to make her family more secure. She was a little old lady, but she was a beautiful woman, very tall, a big personality, a fierce woman.

Now she had to teach a sixth grader with a learning disability. So Betty taught the kid how to read, he studied hard, he didn't flinch, the kid read out loud all the time. When he got to high school, he was reading at the eighth grade level. So Betty moved up to the seventh grade, he moved up to the eighth grade, and then finally she was teaching in the ninth grade. She was a wonderful woman. She always had a smile and looked cheerful. But she was a little old lady as it turned out. But this kid had done her a great favor.

The parents of this kid told Betty that the fourth grader was going into the Army, and it was time that she came back to the school. Betty wanted to stay here, but she didn't want to leave a fourth grader. So she said, "Okay, I'll come back here. I'll find a way to keep this kid. Why don't you tell me who you're going to the Army for? And get a uniform for him
