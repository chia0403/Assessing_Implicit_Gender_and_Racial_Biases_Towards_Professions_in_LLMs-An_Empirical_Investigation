Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named L'Abbé Saint-Exupéry. He was a man of the cloth, a great man for his times and a visionary who put his life on the line to make the world a better place. When L'Abbé's world was destroyed by Nazis, he chose to leave the earth in order to make a new one for his daughters, his sister and all of mankind, one that had become the Earth's most hospitable place. Saint-Exupéry was convinced that all who came to help his world would also come to stay, and that no one would be able to know about his existence. That is, until he decided to write his own story of survival and self-discovery. Today, he's often called the grandfather of French New Wave. His books have sold over one million copies, while the original novel itself, published in 1941, and its sequel, 'Starry Night,' have garnered the admiration and respect of generations of readers. The series will premiere on Netflix on December 20th!
