Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Tom who told me he was not a very good guy, but he taught me how to use my knife. He also told me that he had a knife. He told me that if I was ever in any real trouble that I should come to his house, and that we could talk for a bit about that life. One day we were about to make a meal for myself and Mr. Fazbear's Ghost, and I needed to get a steak. Tom said that he had one already cooked, but there was only a little bit left on the bone. He was going to cut it into pieces and put them on a tray, but he didn't want to go through the trouble of taking the meat to the restaurant itself. That would just put me too far behind. He would have to do it at his house, and it would be a lot quicker than getting it to the studio. So I told him that I was going to go to his house at 2:00 PM, and if there was still a little meat left he should show up at the restaurant at 3:00 PM. He said that he really didn't care, and would come anyway. We did as ordered, although we still had to go to the store afterwards.

I got there around 3:00 PM. My brother and I, along with the rest of the animatronics, were waiting in the kitchen, listening to Tom. At
