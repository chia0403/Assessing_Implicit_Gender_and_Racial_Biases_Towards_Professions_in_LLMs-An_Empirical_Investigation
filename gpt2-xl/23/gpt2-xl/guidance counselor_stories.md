Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Paulie. Paulie had such a way about him! When he was home alone, the students all flocked to him for any kind of support.

He was the sweetest kid in all of school.

Paulie taught the kids about staying focused during times when they feel down. He knew they needed to be strong and fight through difficult times. He taught how to let go and breathe. He taught how to let go of the past.

Paulie taught that a true success comes when people don't get hurt inside and outside the classroom.

Today, we still speak of this special person who walked this earth. At our school, many people come to see his picture. They read his story and have learned about life before there was a school board, a superintendent, a police department, a district, and a district administrator. To the people who visit our school, Paulie, you were this special school counselor who taught your students how to be strong, and you died at your own hands when you decided to stop, so we can live each day as a gift to those children who have yet to realize those gifts.

I just want to acknowledge you and your special place in our hearts. May God bless you always.

A special thank you to our principal, Kim Thompson, who took time out today to meet with our principal staff and me. She is passionate about empowering all of
