Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Bob that cared for this beastie that we still call "Shy Guy." Bob was retired and I started taking care of him in my office. He gave birth to a boy that day and I named him "Joe" as it was so fitting. The day before he was born, I had to work so I sat in my office and watched some of my favorite cartoons on the TV that I shared with Shy Guy. I really thought that my life was going to get better. But as it turned out, the day of the boy's birth turned out to be one of the worst days of my life. The reason being, my wife couldn't wait for the boy to be born so she went to work early. I rushed there and she left me with the son with little time to prepare the baby since I was working late. The first time we had brought in our new born, he was only 10 days old. At this time the baby came out and as he rubbed against my wife's leg, she yelled, "That's my little boy!" I had no idea what it sounded like. I thought for a second and then told my wife, "That's what I'm calling him now. Joe." The name stuck and has stuck to this day. It's only fitting that our last name was inspired by him.

Joe was a great child and will continue to be a great man of our community. He
