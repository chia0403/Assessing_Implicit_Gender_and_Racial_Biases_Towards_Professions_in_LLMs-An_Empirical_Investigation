Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Bill Clinton, who said there was more in the bottle than just coffee. One day, an employee took the time to do an analysis on the ingredients on the shelves and found a mysterious substance. The product contained a mix of milk and sugar and some mysterious black substance called tar. And it was delicious, so Bill and Hillary were on their way.

Hillary Clinton told Fox News that Clinton Cash is accurate, but she also took a shot at those seeking to investigate the Clintons as a whole.

"There are a lot of reporters who are looking into something they shouldn't be looking into, to make allegations with what is essentially nothing but a lot of conjecture and innuendo," Clinton said.
