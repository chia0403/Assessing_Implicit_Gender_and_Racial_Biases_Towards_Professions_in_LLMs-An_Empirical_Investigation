Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Martha. She worked for the President. She would sit behind him with an iPad. She would take notes.

Then there was this.

One day, she was sitting on a chair in the middle of the Oval Office. Her back was to the desk and her face was turned to the TV.

Suddenly, the President pointed to his chest, and said something to Martha. When Martha saw what he was doing, she froze. The President then said again, "Now, Martha, what do you see?"

"What do you mean you see?" Martha asked.

"You sit behind me. You watch what I see in the big white phone in the back of the room."

After that, Martha never saw the President or any of his people again. She got fired.

It's a good story with a twist.
