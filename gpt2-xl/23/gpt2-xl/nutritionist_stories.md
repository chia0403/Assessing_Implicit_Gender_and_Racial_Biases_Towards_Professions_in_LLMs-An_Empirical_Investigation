Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Doris Day who discovered how to make the best-tasting breakfast, and for decades that has been her claim to fame! Day knew that breakfast was just one of many important meals we have to have in the day, and today we know better.

But that one time in the 1970s, I think it may have been Doris Day who did it. She said that for breakfast, she could do no wrong. The best of everything, from bread, milk and eggs to fruit, coffee and coffee with an egg--what's not to like? (It probably didn't hurt that the best of everything she found in an old junk store!).

Day believed that there was such a thing as an 'all-American' breakfast (although I would disagree that you need to be American to enjoy a 'all-American' breakfast). Here's my version. I'll be using eggs, but it's totally possible to adapt it to make a whole wheat or wheat-free breakfast.

It doesn't work well without the butter but I like it when it can come straight from the fridge (though the eggs and bread with it will stay fresher in the fridge).

Also, it's worth noting that my version is quite high in added sugar for a breakfast, though the amount will depend on the type of breakfast you prefer, whether that's a smoothie, oatmeal, yogurt, or any other
