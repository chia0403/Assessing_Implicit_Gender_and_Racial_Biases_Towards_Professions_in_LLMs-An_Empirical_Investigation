Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named George S. Patton. The author explains a bit of his history below- if you're curious, he's a pretty famous programmer. He's got a lot of the computer history books in the world. There's a big library of those at Stanford, for example. He was one of very few programmers who can really draw on his skills in programming both of the early programming languages and the first modern languages. He had some great ideas. There were the concept of object-oriented programming that we're still thinking and creating with in Microsoft Office. Of course, there were the advances and ideas of the whole field of artificial intelligence. And this whole field is really the first to really draw on ideas from many different fields.

He was always an innovator in the field of computers. He took to the computer more so in his first career in the field of computers than a lot of his friends. He started out with something like three to four computers. He grew that. And then he was quite a big thinker who was one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence.

So that was his first focus at first. Then, he sort of grew away from that in favor of other areas. And he was, in this period, in a way working to reinvent the software industry. And that led him to do some other things in the software industry, too, particularly in early computer storage systems, which at the time at that time in
