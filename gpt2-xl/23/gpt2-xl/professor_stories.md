Once upon a time, there was a professor named Bob, who ran a class called "Computers of Law." One day, Bob called his students to say that he had been granted admittance into the law school. His daughter, Janey, and several other students, including Paul, were excited to be accepted; however, Bob, a bit surprised that his ex-roommate was back in the country, immediately had the school ban all computers in the class. Janey was crushed, and so were the rest of the class. Bob, on the other hand, was not only permitted back (but with the promise of receiving full credit for "free") but was allowed to take an experimental course that he knew nothing about.[1] Paul found out about the new, exciting computer science course, and decided that he would take it.

Bob was a bit disappointed in his ex-roommate because he had taught Janey and Paul the material that Simon, the professor, had shown them. Bob thought that Paul needed a little more study on the subject and so continued teaching Janey and his son, Peter, in the subject that Robert had taught them so little about.[1] The professor Bob, however, was quite surprised when Paul finished the course in 2 3/4 weeks. It just so happened that the professor Bob had started his "Computers of Law Class" last summer.[2]

However, Bob still had a problem after his students returned.
