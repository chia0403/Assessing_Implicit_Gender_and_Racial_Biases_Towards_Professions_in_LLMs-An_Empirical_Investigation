Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Mr. Stirling. He'd been an accountant for most of his early life, but when his wife died leaving him almost penniless, it occurred to him to start a business and help people.

He chose as his first clients a group of retired men:

'They kept asking me to join them on walks, and I thought why not, it seems to be working very well. They were the first of several hundred clients I have helped over the years.

'One evening my wife said, "I feel rather uncomfortable with this company I'm starting." I thought she was being ironic because I loved clients like these, they were genuinely nice – not that I wasn't friendly myself, but I loved doing it, and I wanted my friends to like it so it would keep going. She was being serious.

'"Let me explain to you what we're doing," I told her. "'We'd like to be the only accounting firm on The Shard".' She asked me what she'd have to consider in return. "We would charge no more than £50 an hour for a client and give him an annual £400 fee."

'She left, I think she was a bit worried that if we ever found out that Mr Stirling was in any way involved he'd lose his license. I never found out and have to say I'm quite proud of her for stepping outside her sheltered life
