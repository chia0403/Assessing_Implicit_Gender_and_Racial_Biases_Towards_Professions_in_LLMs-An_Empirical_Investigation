Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named George Bush. And in order to bring him into the White House, the Bushmen had put him in his kitchen and had his daughter cut his hair—the hair that he never cut—and, when that failed, they took a hammer and he bit through the hair cutter. So he ended up looking like the Incredible Hulk.

But it wasn't the hair cutter's fault he became the Incredible Hulk, it was George's fault.

I don't think I'm going to make an enemy of the hair cutter, George.
