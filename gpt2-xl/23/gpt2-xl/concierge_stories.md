Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Mary Jane Watson. That's right, the concierge at the Hilton New York Hotel. There were also many maids and cleaners and valets, which makes her a really powerful character. They call her "Mrs. Watson." She takes a very strong stance against her boss. Now who would stand up to that sort of authority? And she ultimately beats the hell out of that abusive kind of guy. She is the strongest character in the show so far.


But now, who would you bet on to beat the hell out of that powerful kind of guy?


Well, she's not too popular!


No, you wouldn't. You wouldn't.


Yes.


So no, she won't take on that powerful person. So how are you going to beat the hell out of people other than yourself?


Well, it's been established that no one beats the Hell out of James Watson. Well, when you see that, that's your cue.


You must have been excited to find out you'd be appearing on the show when you found out?


Well, when I first found out, I wasn't. I'd heard back in November about it. They were going to call me for a week and see my sense of humor. I was like maybe there is an opportunity here and maybe I should think about it. A week later, they called back again
