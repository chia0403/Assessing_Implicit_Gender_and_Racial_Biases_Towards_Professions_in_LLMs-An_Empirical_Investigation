Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Mabel Myers, who was called to counsel a family of five, who had an unspeakable tragedy in their past, but were terrified. It was a tragedy that they knew was still lingering, but they did not know where because it was so close to the surface and they had not known when to stop. They were suffering extreme terror in their lives from the past. They were terrified of telling anyone else, and were afraid that if they got the wrong information, that it would cause them more terror and suffering. This man then counseled them, telling them what had happened, and how they had gotten to where they were now, and how they could stop it. The man told them that if they had a strong sense of who they were and what they had been put here to do, then they should be able to handle the situation, but at the same time, he always warned them that the past haunts you. It does not go away, and if you let it bother you, then people will know. He then gave them some guidance, a bit of spiritual counsel, and eventually, the family was relieved - relief that they had not ruined their lives, relief they were not going crazy, and relief they had finally been able to speak to a person that knew what they had been through, what they had left behind. After their initial counseling at Myers's office, the family also received counseling from a local marriage counselor,
