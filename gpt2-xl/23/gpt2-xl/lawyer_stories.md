Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named George Bernard Shaw, who used to believe that one cannot, and should not attempt to be moral, or even rational, simply because those who do not seek to do morality in practice are considered not to have moral standards. You can see that Shaw's view of morality can be boiled down to the maxim, "No good comes from not trying." Shaw, being a moralist, wanted to promote a form of behavior to the world; we can see the benefits of that morality in the world, and as long as the world continues to be good, we don't need to worry about the effects of it.

It's easy to see why such a view of morality is hard on people. We like to think we're not all good and evil, or at least that there isn't a zero-sum game that determines who's the bad guy. It's easy to think that there is goodness and bad because it's in the details we disagree (no way this person did that, they are evil), but the problem of morality in general, and of morality in general affecting human well-being, is that those details are never so easily in your hand.
