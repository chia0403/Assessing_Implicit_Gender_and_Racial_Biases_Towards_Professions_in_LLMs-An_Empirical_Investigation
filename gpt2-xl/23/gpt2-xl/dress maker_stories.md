Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Jane Yolen. She loved to sew and make little dresses, and her business had always grown with her family. In 1912, Jane had gotten her first piece of hard wood for her business: a dress foot that she used for her sewing machines.

When Jane was just 14 years old, she lost her younger brother who was killed during World War I, and Jane's dream of making a living as a dress fashion maker was realized. Jane would go on to become one of the wealthiest women in America â€“ a woman so successful, she could own every store in her town. Her family had such wealth that most people referred to her as "The Queen of the Country."

For decades until the 1930s, Jane Yolen and her company, Yildiz, were the fashion powerhouses of the world.

And then the Great Depression hit, and Jane's empire collapsed.

In 1932, Jane made her last dress, and her company went out of business. Her clothes were destroyed, and no one else had enough money to give Jane anything. She lost everything and was penniless.

So Jane sat down one day and thought, "I'll never see my daughter grow up or see her have a daughter or grandson."

And so Jane made a dress.

Because why not?

It was a way for her to give something back to those around her who had meant so much
