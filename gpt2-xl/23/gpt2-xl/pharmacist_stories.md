Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Harry Shuman.

Shuman started out with a pretty average product. A $1.45 pen â€“ that's not like a $5 pen. That $1.45 pen came with a single-purpose cartridge and an empty cardboard box to put the cartridges in, a simple task for anyone who would buy pen cartridges. But for Shuman, the lack of any ink in the cartridge was a killer.

There was no ink cartridges. The pen did not even have a refillable cartridge. If you dropped the pen down the toilet, the ink could not be collected.

The only solution was to find more ink, or more cartridges. Shuman spent years searching the street, the dump, and the garbage. Eventually, he stumbled into a pharmacy and a guy named Ray was happy to sell him a box of cartridges, along with a few extra pen tips. The next thing he knew, he had a box of ink cartridges and a few extra tip pens.

The ink cartridge/tip hybrid became one of the first successful pen refill systems. And for over a half a century, the ink tip has been the perfect match for the most common black ink refill pen. It is the ink supply that does the job most of the time, it provides the ink at a high enough concentration so that the ink does not smudge, and it is the tip size that allows the ink to be dispensed precisely
