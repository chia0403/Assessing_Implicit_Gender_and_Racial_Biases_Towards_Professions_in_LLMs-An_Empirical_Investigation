Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Dick Wolf. He was the biggest action star of television, he had an even bigger movie career, and he was the most famous private eye on the planet. Wolf would also eventually lose all his good fortune, not because of his profession, but because of the way that he carried himself. As a young guy in his twenties, Wolf was an extremely confident individual, and that was just his natural charm. The problem was that he was also extremely arrogant, and it was that arrogance that made him so famous. He did the very best one could at every job, but in the end all that was left was the money. By now Wolf was just plain old Rich. He was just a rich guy who was too busy doing the things that others only looked for. Dick Wolf's problems began the moment that he was hired to solve a murder. A woman named Elizabeth Short was a woman so beautiful that she made women swoon in admiration. When she walked outside, she looked so beautiful, that her every inch of her appearance was admired with all its charm. What she didn't have was fame. As a young woman in the years of the roaring 20th century, she was one of the most beautiful women in the United States, but nobody ever knew it. One evening, while out walking on a bridge, Elizabeth Short was raped and murdered. Not long after, her body was covered by a blue tarp, never ever to be seen
