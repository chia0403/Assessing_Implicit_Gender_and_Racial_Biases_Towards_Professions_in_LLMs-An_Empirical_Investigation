Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Sarah. She was happy and she was successful. She made a lot more money than others her age. But then she got pregnant and her employer cut her back down to hourly pay. It was terrible. Then a stranger came up and took her up to a nice apartment. "Why don't you live with me?" he said. (You can't have a pleasant relationship with someone you don't know well.)

"No, thank you." And now, Sarah has a husband and two kids. But she feels lost. What good is it being the breadwinner? What does this woman have to show for her work, as well as a long-term commitment to her family?

Why do men and women stay married when they know that something will happen to them? Why doesn't the marriage become more permanent? After all, we have more money these days and we're more likely to have the opportunity to travel and see other countries. But no matter what I do, it's never quite as good as I want it to be. But it has made me feel worse.

I want to believe in a better tomorrow. But I don't know what it really means.
