Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Harry Bailey. His life was a series of unfortunate events which caused him to start working on his land with the goal of running it more like a horse ranch. He eventually became so concerned with this that he decided to make a series of investments in the livestock industry, and he soon came to the conclusion that since no one was really willing to take a large amount of money away from their farms just to keep it running, maybe he'd rather just get the other people to do it for himâ€¦.

Harry became very wealthy in no small part because his son Jack was hired to run his land as Mr. Bailey, and the boy proved to be quite the asset over the years. After Jack got out to become a banker, he sold off Harry's stake in his business, then his farm stock was sold off. Today, the company still owns and runs a number of different properties, not the least of them being Harry Bailey's Farm.
