Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Susan.

At the time, Susan lived in a small town in North Dakota when she lost her father and her mother and grandmother. The local newspaper said that it was an "isolated tragedy" and that Susan needed to support herself while she did everything she could to save them from coming back to her.

And, as a self-employment woman, it didn't take long for Susan to realize that her ability to pay for new clothes would be an absolute disaster. Susan put up a post on the local clothing swap website asking the local homeless people for donations because she couldn't find any donations. Susan had to sell some clothes to pay for the items in a thrift store for her own clothes. She also gave away her clothing at a local donation center.


Susan and her husband spent nearly every waking moment putting themselves through college and working hard to pay on debts. Susan had to earn her bachelor's degree somehow because she had no income on her husband's retirement savings. She took out loans to pay for it but the bills went unpaid due to his inability to work. Susan's mother, who was dying of cancer, kept her current job at the nursing home.

Despite a family that struggled to survive, Susan never forgot about their dad and never let it get in the way of her life goals.

Susan wanted to be a nurse.

Susan wanted to make a difference in other people
