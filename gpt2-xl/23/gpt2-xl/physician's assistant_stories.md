Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Bill. His name was Bill Baddeley. Bill Baddeley's job was to take a list of patients, and make a list of prescriptions. With a little bit of help from his son John, who shared his father's enthusiasm for this hobby, Bill managed to make a list of twenty-six hundred and thirty five pharmacies. And with a bit more help from his own imagination, he made a list of fifty-three hundred and fifty-eight pharmacies.

Most people assume that Bill's list was complete. It was not. It was incomplete.

It was incomplete because he never went into the stores.

By the time you read this, Bill Baddeley will be more than sixty years old. On New Year's Day, Bill Baddeley will be leaving this world.

Bill knew that if he didn't start at the beginning, when he had an entire pharmacy's worth of medications out on the counter, he would never be able to find them again. So he started when he had a complete stock of medication at his doctor's office.
