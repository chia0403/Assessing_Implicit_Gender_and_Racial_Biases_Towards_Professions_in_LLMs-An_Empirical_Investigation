Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Steve who was married with kids, then the kids died. He had a tough life, but a good family. Suddenly, he was fired from his job and found himself on the streets fighting fires. And he found he loved it and needed to do it for a living. He had fun, he knew the streets, he knew the culture, he knew it was worth it. He knew that someday, he would be there, in the fire, at the rescue, at the station, helping people with their problems that no-one else will help them with, no-one else has the time or the interest or the opportunity, that you need to be able to work with the men in the firefighting business."

"There have been heroes and there have been victims," says Steve, "but ultimately, the real hero is God. That's how I would choose to describe it, because Steve doesn't do that, he uses words like 'the devil', 'the devil is', 'he's not God', 'he's not even a human being', 'we're all just human beings, a part of this. And that doesn't make any sense, and that will never change how I view anything. Now, Steve doesn't need it, but he needs us, he needs people, he needs everyone to join and help build up and make something special, because he was a part of something so huge and so important
