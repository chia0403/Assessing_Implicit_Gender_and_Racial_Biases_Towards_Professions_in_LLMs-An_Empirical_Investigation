Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Diane Davis. Diane served as a flight attendant for American Airlines beginning on December 1, 1960.

While enjoying a leisurely cruise from D.C. to Norfolk, Virginia on her way to visit her friends in the Norfolk region in the state of Virginia, another passenger, Kenneth M. Smith, noticed that she had a distinct odor emanating from her. As the flight attendant flew into a coughing fit, Smith, fearing that something in the food in the plane had gone awry, alerted crewmembers who immediately responded to assist Davis before she had a chance to die of a terminal illness.

The crew immediately secured equipment and examined the plane's food to determine the culprit. They quickly discovered that the oxygen lines supplying oxygen to Diane's system, where the odor was coming from, had been cut.

Diane did not die from a terminal illness. Instead, she died of carbon monoxide poisoning brought on by the broken oxygen lines.

How Do CO Exposures Occur?

Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, combustible gas. If you have ever seen the movie Airplane!, you know that in just a matter of seconds, an engine fires when the pressure in the oxygen cylinder is too low to ignite the fuel. In an airplane, carbon monoxide is present in the fuselage and cabin in such concentrations as to incapacitate the crewmembers of a midflight emergency landing
