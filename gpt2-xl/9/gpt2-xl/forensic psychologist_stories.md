Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Edward Fudge. She said she had never been to a professional conference. She did the math: the hour-and-a-half event had cost $400, including speakers, but the work she had done on the conference was worth at least three times the cost of the program. She wasn't even sure if the talk she gave was on that particular topic. It was a psychological event, not a neuroscience or an economics conference, one she'd been planning for months.

She asked a colleague: "What does it mean to be a forensic psychologist?"

Her colleague said: "A forensic psychologist is someone who cares about the crime victims and their families."

"And if you're in the wrong, what are you going to do?" she asked. "I'm thinking, You're going to spend time in court arguing that you're in the right? I'm not interested in doing that."

She wanted to work in a field that was different from her field of clinical practice. There was no other field – at least none that met her needs – besides forensic psychology to help her, and no institution had a training program designed for people who knew nothing about science or expertise or the legal system. Not only was there no program. There wasn't even a name for the field other than forensic psychology.

I was shocked. When I'd first moved to California, when I spent years studying law
