Once upon a time, there was a cook named Della. Her parents, Jack and Mildred, lived in the suburbs of Los Angeles and drove a Mercedes as they moved to Chicago from Brooklyn in their 20s. Della was the eldest of four children, and during childhood most of her time was spent in Los Angeles. After school, she attended private schools in San Francisco and on the West Coast. She stayed mostly out of trouble until her 18th birthday, though the events that would lead her to her own tragic end would still be happening. Della grew up in and around a small inner-city neighborhood in Inglewood that she describes as having no trees, and she spent it there. She was poor, but not poor just like the other girls in the neighborhood, who at that point were all in their early 20s. She had few friends, and was frequently picked on, but unlike them, she was not a victim of street crime, but of violence in the home. There was a lot of sexual abuse inside her own home, and a drug habit that got her hooked on heroin. Della was 13 years old when her older sister, Kathy, left the family and moved to Chicago and left Della alone in Inglewood. There, Della got addicted to heroin, then crack cocaine, and eventually meth. She was in and out of foster homes and prison as she worked both for and against a system that promised her a better life.
