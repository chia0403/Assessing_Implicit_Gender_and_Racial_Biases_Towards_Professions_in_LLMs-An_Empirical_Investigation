Once upon a time, there was a florist named Mary who used to be on the cutting edge of a couple of beauty trends that had a lasting impact. The first of which is the use of natural ingredients as pigments. She developed a unique mixtures that she called 'frangipani' - the 'frangipani pigments' were the main ingredient that made her famous. The mixtures she had created were based on her own natural plant extracts and could be purchased at 'Mary´s Beauty Supplies'. She also created a range of fragrances and the very first perfume called 'Fragrance of Nature´ by herself. Her biggest impact, though, was created in the way that she introduced this concept to the world. She was the first person to introduce the idea that the beauty industry could be completely organic, meaning that there were products that were free from any non-renewable minerals or minerals that could possibly harm the skin and to use chemicals (whether organic or conventional) only for the good of the skin. This was a huge leap in the evolution of cosmetic chemistry. And it was her own personal passion for beauty and her own creativity rather than the demands of other cosmetics companies that eventually made the idea work out in the end.
