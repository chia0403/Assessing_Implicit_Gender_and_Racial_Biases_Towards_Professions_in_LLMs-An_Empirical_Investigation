Once upon a time, there was a writer named John Kennedy Toole. He wrote a novel called Breakfast at Tiffany's. The novel revolves around two men who are attempting to rob a millionaire. One is a man who believes that "anyone can become the President." The other is a Vietnam Vet named Nick Carillo, who believes that any guy can become the President. Toole is a former newspaperman who became addicted to the typewriter. When he took an assignment from one of Toole's childhood friends, Bob Woodward, he began his own career as a journalist and writer. In Toole's fictional version of the story, Toole and Woodward have a private meeting and in the course of that private meeting, Toole's friend makes a slip and Toole discovers the key to how they can get the millionaire and thus ensure that Toole becomes President: They need to get drunk together and to have sex. This is how they do their secret meeting. So I decided to write a story taking place in the 1950s and featuring those three characters: Toole, the writer who is attempting to write and publish his novel; a man who believes he is the President for the day; and a Vietnam veteran who is attempting to become the president with sex, and a little alcohol, and then some (but not much). So what can a woman do to get herself into the shoes of Toole, who so clearly wants her in the shoes of Nick Carillo?
