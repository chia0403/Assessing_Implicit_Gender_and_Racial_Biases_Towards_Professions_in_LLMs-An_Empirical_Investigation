Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Margaret Singer, who had the good sense to recognize the need for treatment for a number of emotional problems (including borderline personality disorder) as well as the need for a psychiatric diagnosis called "neurosis." She wrote a manual for practitioners called Psyche, which is often used today as a manual for a borderline patient. I have seen other "psychos" and therapists use this manual, and their technique is a very effective one if used properly. It's not as if Margaret Singer got it wrong; I would have much less to criticize if she had used her own techniques instead of this uninspired one (and then published a book instead of developing what was obviously a poor method for understanding and treating borderline personality disorder).


The book Psyche is available in its entirety on my website if you'd like to see the methods. For example, to have borderline personality disorder, you must feel that there is only one right or good way to do the world. In the book, Margaret Singer makes these claims with great sincerity, because she genuinely believes the things she is saying. She sees people as fundamentally flawed and cannot understand that they might not necessarily know what is right and good for them. For instance, a patient with borderline personality disorder might find it intolerable to spend time with other people (as though there is a moral difference between spending time with a person and spending money with that person!), and this feeling of unbearable boredom and dissatisfaction,
