Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Dr. John C. Bennett.

Back then, there were only about a dozen pharmacies and Bennett was the only pharmacist whose products could be found around. When he wasn't at work in his lab, he'd often be seen wandering the streets of town.

There's no telling why he chose to take up this wanderlust, but people say he soon fell in love with the place and decided to settle somewhere nearby: The St. Joseph River Valley.

He made several trips into town to find a place he might settle. One day, he saw a sign, "Medicinals Without Bars." For years, the sign had read "Healthy Meds â€” Without Bars." Bennett decided the sign was a fitting motto, so he adopted it.

He's also known as Dr. Bennett because, during his wanderings, he would go to the St. Joseph River and collect plants. In one of the most famous stories of the area, he'd come across a snake's tail. He would have no idea that those tail-flanking leaves belonged to the serpent from Greek mythology, the Hydra.

It's hard to fathom at this point why there are no bars still, or what would have motivated this man to go through all such trouble for something so banal. We also can't imagine why he called himself the "doctor" (the title of his early pharmacy), but some speculate
