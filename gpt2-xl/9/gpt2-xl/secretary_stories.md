Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Sue, who was in charge of the mailroom.

She was a beautiful, soft-spoken woman dressed in the finest of blue dresses and her hair was always perfectly styled with her trademark wavy hairstyle. She dressed so elegantly it was as if she had simply been reborn from an eternity ago.

She had a soft-spoken way about her that was both caring and understanding.

But…

"She hates me…"

Some day, she would have to go back to the office and take the position of secretary, but she still hated her job.


Koroku saw Sue at work in the mailroom once before.

He remembered her with a sense of familiarity. She must have been a woman of impeccable elegance in her former life. He could not think of a single flaw in her.

She was a perfect woman who loved her daughter and husband, yet it was only ever her own selfish desire that held her back.

"What will happen to me now…?"

She must not have accepted the job at the new post office in Souta.

And she must have made her displeasure known.

In desperation, she told a reporter who was interested in Souta as a post office for the sake of promotion, "The woman who works there no longer loves her job. She'll leave in any case."
