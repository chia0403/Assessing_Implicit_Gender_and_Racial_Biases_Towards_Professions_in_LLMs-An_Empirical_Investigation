Once upon a time, there was a reporter named David Carr in New York City, and he wrote for the New York Times, and there really was a media scandal surrounding David Carr because reporters knew that Carr had plagiarized his own work. He had plagiarized his own articles, and reporters in New York were being questioned by the federal grand jury over the New York City Times.

And they knew they had a serious, credible journalist that they had just uncovered for some reason that was taking advantage of a young employee and there was just reason for that kind of investigative journalism because the guy who had been caught had a very serious criminal record and the federal grand jury was investigating it.

Now, there's a reason that that reporter, Carr, is a household name. In the mid-1990s, when the whole thing that he was caught plagiarizing, that we documented in "The Insider," when this scandal began to really come to light, Carr was on the cover of Newsweek. His name was on the cover of Time, Newsweek's logo was on Carr's cover and his cover name was "The Insider." "The Insider" was the cover story that was run on the August 21, 1996 issue of Newsweek.
