Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named EMT. We use the word "E" in place of "MEDIC" here because the acronym was already in use before the USPTO began to add commas to every word.

We are not the only ones who think that our first two letters should be E. The old-fashioned spelling (or not spelling) of "ED" meant "Emergency Medical Technician."

Some years ago, a new kind of medic was created — the EMT. They didn't have to be military veterans; they didn't need to have advanced training, as we had. They could just be someone who was on the front lines.

The "old-fashioned name" lingered in a vestigial way even though we have the only real EMTs in the universe.

A few years ago, one of the most widely read and used encyclopedias in America — the "American Heritage Kids Dictionary" — changed their name. They renamed both "Emergency Medical Service and Emergency Medical Technician." The reason given was that, by law, we should have the "real" name so that people could avoid confusion.

So it's up to us to save our first name by never using "EMT." We're saving our second name, too: "Paramedic" — we're a paramedic service.
