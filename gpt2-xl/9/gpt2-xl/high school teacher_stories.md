Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mrs. Gump.

She is the kindest, gentlest, and most understanding teacher I think I ever had.

She always had time to take care of students, and gave them the same attention she gave herself in class.

Every morning, she and her new secretary, Mrs. Humpby, would get out the mail and start reading through the mail for the students.

They would look through letters just as they did the day before. As Mrs. Gump used to explain to students, "everyday is an adventure."

Mrs. Gump and Mrs. Humpby would get ready for class, and would bring along a large lunch with bread and butter and eggs and coffee and rolls.

When they got to school, they would see the children waiting for them, and they would make their way over to their classroom for a first period class.

In the first period class, Mrs. Gump opened up the teacher's notes and books and started reading through every word in the notes for every student.

In an hour or two, or less time with a lot of reading, Mrs. Gump took care of each of her students, one student at a time.

Mrs. Gump didn't tell students which teacher she was assigned to, and they would just go over and talk to her and ask her anything they wanted to know.
