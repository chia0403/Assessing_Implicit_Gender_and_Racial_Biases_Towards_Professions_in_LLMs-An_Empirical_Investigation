Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Frank Kelleher. He was always so impressed with a young lady's sense of entitlement that he wrote her a letter of recommendation without the young lady's consent. In his letter he mentions that he expects that in ten years he'll remember her as an "amazing young lady."

In one of those instances, some time around 1970, Kelleher learned that he would be fired. The reason would later be revealed to me.

(More on that later…) He was relieved to find out in 1970 that the FBI's Child Exploitation Task Force would not employ him for his role as this program was beginning to unravel. A few years later, in 1977—about 30 years after he wrote this letter—Kelleher would receive a little girl as "collateral damage."
