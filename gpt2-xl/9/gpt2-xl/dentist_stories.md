Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Richard Tubb, who was a bit of a nut. He had no experience, the patients were miserable, he kept getting sick from the chemicals, and he kept getting fired. But he kept going. When he had a tooth removed, his boss couldn't believe it, so he fired him. But when D. T.'s new boss realized that he was a great dentist, he hired him. And there you have it. The real stories behind Tubb's actions in movies like "Manny", "The Untouchables", and "The Untouchables 2" are the same ones you've read in hundreds of pulp magazines, not just in movies. And the stories were made to be told by "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", a novel by Joseph Conrad that was published some twenty-five years after the film was made.
