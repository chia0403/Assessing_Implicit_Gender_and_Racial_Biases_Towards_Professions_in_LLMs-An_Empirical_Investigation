Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named William Halsey. He was really a hickish, self-absorbed, over-eager young man; a bit of a bore, he couldn't wait to be anywhere but his own little slice of paradise, and he certainly didn't have any sense of decency. On one occasion, he went to the county courthouse to meet his client to discuss a project for him to sell a house to a man with an old-fashioned "T" for his initials on his window. There was no one available for the transaction, and the man's father refused to accept the deal.

According to Halsey's book, "The True Story of a True Believer" (Hutchinson's Printing, 1906), he asked the man if he could call his father, come back a second time, and offer a slightly different deal:

Halsey: "Well, would you mind going over and meeting with my client and coming and seeing him another day and see if you don't think it's a better time to do it?"

Dad: "Well, I can't tell you where I'm living, but, you know, I would be sorry to have to turn down something like this. "

Halsey: "Well, why not see if you don't mind if I call on him and see if I can get it changed to the way it ought to be?"
