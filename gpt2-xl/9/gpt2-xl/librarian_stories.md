She became obsessed by reading it, and decided to devote her life to finding the book's whereabouts, eventually running across the book "in the attic" of the old library of The New York Public Library. She went to the archives of the Library to see if they had the book and they let her in on the secret.

Gail has been doing research about the book, finding out if it has been moved
