Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Frank, who had decided to become a writer. When it came time to fill in his time, the two things that came to his mind were his two sons; Frank had two sons named Sam and Dick. He was going to write a book that his sons would enjoy, so he had decided to get the boys into the writing world. With this in mind he had his sons write a story in "Little Rock" and "Little Rock II." To be fair to Frank, there was a reason for this. The first thing he came up with was Little Rock, but his readers liked Little Rock II even better. Not only did readers like Little Rock II, but the book did very well in the publishing market. It got a second novel and a television series, which Frank didn't get to write but was so proud of that he named the television series "Little Rock IV."


After Frank sold off his television series, he continued to write Little Rock series one, two, and three on the side. He even picked up the idea for a Little Rock series five and started to write the fifth installment that would be called Little Rock V, thinking that was the final Little Rock book but it would turn out to be a "prequel that would tie into the later series." This time, however, another book did make it to the book shelves called Little Rock VI, and the series became Little Rock VI-Inland Empire.
