Robert was an old man and he had a severe case of phallic cancer. The cancer had spread to his testicles, where it had caused him to lose his testes. He decided that he was finished with male genitalia and he didn't want another kid in his head. He decided that if he wanted to go to heaven he had to follow God, and so he took off his clothes and shaved all of his junk. But when he started cutting up, it didn't work. And so, he said he had to take out all his male genitals and then he told the girl he was in love with that he would have to live in sin because when all was said and done he would have nothing to live for and no one to love. In other words, he was on his own. When Robert asked Christ to forgive his sins and to raise him from death, the girl said, 'No, Robert. You'll come to me when you're ready. I know you want to die, but I have no intention of letting you rot away in hell forever.'
