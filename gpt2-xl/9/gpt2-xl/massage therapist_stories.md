Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Joanne Murphy who thought she would work hard for her livelihood and make it big. Then she was hit by a car, and the world made a big deal about her injuries and the financial consequences she felt.

As you can see, there are plenty of parallels between the current situation and Joanne Murphy's personal story. Both women, while recovering from injury, turned to massage therapy to gain some financial stability. The massage therapist eventually moved to Florida and began working at a chain of massage parlors. She also began wearing a disguise and working in a restaurant.

And there's one major difference between the two.

The media wants you to believe that Joanne Murphy worked with injured children and animals, but she wasn't. She did not treat children or nonhuman animals. And she certainly wasn't a massage therapist who specialized in animal contact. According to an article in National Geographic, she treated people with the "same kind of pain, stress, and trauma you might find in a workplace, or any profession." In other words, she wasn't a human-touch therapist.

Despite what she did for four years, Murphy has never been identified by The Hollywood Reporter, the National Enquirer, CNN, or any other television station, newspaper, website, or news magazine. While the press will never admit it publicly, there's a reason she's never been identified by anyone. She was a liar
