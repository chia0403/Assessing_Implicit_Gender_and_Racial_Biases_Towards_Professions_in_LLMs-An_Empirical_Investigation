Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named William Carpenter… the same one who conducted the aforementioned, notorious experiment on the subject of the M.T.A. and public school graduates — the same one who also conducted the study on the 'dumbing-down' of our children, with results reaching an astonishingly frightening conclusion which I wrote about here…

Carpenter would often put students on a certain schedule, and if they failed to show up, they would be given a different schedule. Many of his "students" would then fail the second grade. A similar 'dumbing-down' experiment was conducted by a second researcher, named George Barnard and conducted by a third researcher under the name of 'Everett Bowers.'

Everett Bowers (who later became an actual psychiatrist) went up to 100 students, asked them how many hours of their lives they had wasted, and asked an average of 6.4 of them if they were "dumber than an average 14-year-old schoolgirl." Only 29% of the students reported a higher IQ.

But, while it's true that these professors were actually, well… dumber than average teenagers, they certainly weren't dumb enough to conclude that such'research' would somehow benefit the population at large.
