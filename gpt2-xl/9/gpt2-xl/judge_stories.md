Mike Epps is also a Hall of Fame Judge.

First, I have to commend the judge community and my friends who have passed along this insight about Mike Epps for their willingness to share this story. It is an awesome story to tell and I hope that as people learn more about Mike Epps, they will be so inspired by his accomplishments in not only law but in life as well.
