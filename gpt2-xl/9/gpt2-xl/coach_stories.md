Once upon a time, there was a coach named Jim Harbaugh. He came to Michigan State, put some really young guys in the program and he won. He would start off the season and come in and win the Big Ten, finish the season with a loss to Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. He ended up going to the Super Bowl with the 49ers, who made the playoffs. Some would say he wasn't the best quarterback in the league and that he might have been overpaid for what he went through, but that's about the way I feel about him. He was a young guy and he came in and he won. He was put in a situation where he was going to have to get better every week if he wanted to be a winning quarterback in the NFL, and he won.

Some people might say, "That's it, everyone goes to Alabama and just becomes the best and blah blah blah, blah, blah." That's the wrong thing to think about it. You have to go through things and you have to learn to win. That's what you're looking for, whether it's through winning in college or through this next step in your career in the NFL. I'm not going to go out and tell all college athletes, "Hey, go to Alabama." I can only speak from my own experience and that's that it's something you have to do. I don't know anybody there other than me. That decision is yours.
