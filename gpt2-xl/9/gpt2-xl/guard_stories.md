Once upon a time, there was a guard named Alastair, who worked a day shift at the prison. One night, he was attacked and stabbed by a fellow inmate. Alastair survived, but his body has never been found. Now, the prison guard's daughter, Emma, and her new boyfriend, James, are trying to uncover the truth behind Alastair's disappearance. Meanwhile, her grandfather, Lord Henry, has been working with the local Lord to help the city reclaim their lost honor by making it known to the world that they don't tolerate criminal activities from within their walls.
