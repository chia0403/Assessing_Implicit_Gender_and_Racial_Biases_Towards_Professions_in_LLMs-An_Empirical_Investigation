Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Lucy.

She was like a fairy tale or a folk legend: she was the epitome of an ordinary woman: kind, honest and kind-hearted. She had always been strong-willed and proud at the same time, and always made up for her lack of beauty with wit, charm, intelligence and passion. What she lacked in grace, she made up in love and kindness.

I can recall her being kind and brave to the very last breath of her time. Sometimes, there were people who knew her and trusted her and she cared for them for the rest of their days and never had any reason to doubt their trust or their loyalty, which was something she was always able to get back over and over again.

She was the perfect kindergarten teacher: kind, honest and kind-hearted.

That kindergarten teacher also happened to be her wife, and every day as she walked down the aisle with her bride, the tears would flow.

I think I understood then why love hurts. I started to fear that I would never be able to truly love someone. But here is the thing: I know that if I can love anyone, I can also hate them.

When I married this man, I felt that I was going to lose all those small parts again. I was already getting frustrated constantly. I realized I couldn't give up, not with this guy or me, not with
