Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named John Jones, with a name like that, we could all have been friends. He was a real nice guy. He always shaved his head, and he was a great guy."

"If you're willing to shave your head, nobody notices. If you're not, everyone's going to know. "

"That was so long ago," she says. "You mean it doesn't matter, now?"

"Nobody cared about that crap in the first place."

"What was it about him?"

"Well, as they say, he was a loner…he took it out on hair, which was all he cared about, and then everyone else was forced to take it out on him. People were always criticizing him, always giving him a hard time, so he took that out on everyone else. It's what you do in your line of work if you're a loner."

"Were you there when he died?"

"No, I can't remember it…" she says, and then stops. And just as suddenly, she is laughing. "I really enjoy life right now."

"Really?"

"Really."
