Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Dr. Zervas. He was known for his love of hats and accessories. His shop was located in the most romantic, romantic place: a beautiful forest just outside of town. This city was known as Forest City, but for the time being, it wasn't the "real world" that Dr. Zervas spoke of, which was in the city.

One day, a girl named Rhea came into the shop, and immediately began her work with respect. The hat in her hands fit perfectly. She placed her order. Then, she went back to her beautiful shop.

Dr. Zervas opened the next day, and found Rhea there again. He was at work in his studio, working on his magic, studying the nature of the world.

On his way back to his shop, Dr. Zervas noticed that Rhea wasn't wearing her hat. He thought to himself, "What happened to her? Are her parents gone too?" He was about to leave, when a young boy by the name of Harry stepped into the shop.

Dr. Zervas thought back to his first meeting with Harry, just after Harry went off on his own again.

At first, Harry was so very withdrawn. He was very introverted. He didn't speak much, just kept to himself, and stayed alone in his magical room when not at school with Hermione
