Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Michael Smith. In his days as a private practice psychologist, Smith developed an interest in pornography use and how it impacts the lives of people. Today, Michael Smith is a Senior Fellow at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.

As a psychotherapist, Michael Smith has seen clients come to him for help. And at times, the help came with porn in the client's daily life.
