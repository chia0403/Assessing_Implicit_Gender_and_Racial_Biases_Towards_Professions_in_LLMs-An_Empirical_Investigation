Once upon a time, there was a baker named Jody Lee. One glorious moment, she baked a cake with cream frosting (so incredibly amazing, she couldn't even stop laughing about it). At her finest, she would bake, "a beautiful, sweet, cake." But then, one day, some customers complained because they couldn't have frosting on their cakes. Lee was deeply insulted. Her life went from bad to worse: she started to bake only cakes with sugar frosting. When Lee finally did succeed in creating two "perfect" cakes, she had sold out of them. Now she would be in debt to an extremely rich and powerful baker. She made her most treasured creations, the most expensive ones, into the tiniest chocolate chip truffles."


This is so amazing, I'm going to have to make it.

I did read something in the book that she had a dream about baking for a lady (Jody says she remembered the lady's name, but her dream never came in the book) and it turned out to be an ode-to a lady who would go on to win an Academy award, only to have her life fall apart over it.

Then, Jody writes, "Jody was deeply offended and angry. She hated her job and how her life had now turned out. She was very bitter."

I'm not entirely sure if our world is going to turn into a series of stories
