Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Jim. Jim used to come into my office and, by the end of the meeting, leave with a stack of checks from some customer. Jim was the best salesperson of all. In fact, I remember I asked him, how come you're so good at it, he said, "There's nothing very complicated about it."

I told him, there's a trick. Here's how, just pretend you're the boss saying to your secretary, hire Jim.

He said, "OK." And, the next week, there was a memo sent around the company saying, hiring Jim is a very bad idea. But Jim had seen it first-hand, so, he went and got the job without actually taking the interview. He figured the boss must think him brilliant.
