Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named William Tilden. He owned some land in Connecticut. The state gave him a grant on that land. The land was an acre or so. On the land, he cultivated some wheat and some vegetables. He didn't care. He could raise all he needed from that land. In return, the state gave him one dollar for every acre that he worked for free.

In 1540, he made an agreement with the governor of the Connecticut Colony. He would work for free for 200 years, from his grant. When he was done, he would receive $30. When he died, he would be buried on the land. But he wanted all of the land. With that, he created a monopoly. It was the beginning of the end of the free market, and it's now known as "property rights" — and it's the foundation of all government.

So as the state gives you a grant, the state gives you a monopoly. The government gives a monopoly, and you only exist because of the government's monopoly. Every time there's a change in government, somebody comes into the market. That means one of two things. Either they create a new monopoly, or they create an entirely new market that's free — meaning you don't have a government-granted monopoly.

In our economy, that's what creates competition.
