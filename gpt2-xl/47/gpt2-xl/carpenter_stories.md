Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Jim. Jim was a big boy, well over five feet tall; his hair was very white and he had a bushy beard. He had a kind heart and a gentle soul. Jim was the best friend my mother ever had. He loved animals, especially the pets she and my brother gave him. His favorite was a small golden retriever named Tuck, but he took in many dogs and cats as well. Jim was also a great writer, as evidenced by a couple novels I love â€“ The Secret Life of Cats and The Little Prince. Jim never complained about anything or anyone in his life. He always worked hard to help his mother and his nieces make ends meet.
