Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Mr. "Yammer," who spent his time watching the world go by from the sidelines, waiting for the perfect moment to go out and help somebody out. Nowadays, it'd be more accurate to say that Mr. Yammer watches over us from the sidelines, checking in every few hours, to make sure that we're on the right path.

Yammer — which stands for "Who You Really Are" — was acquired by Microsoft last year in a $26.2 billion deal. The Microsoft employees who work with Yammer consider it more like their personal assistant than a replacement for email.

With Yammer, most people use the system more for collaborative projects than for email — a strategy that Microsoft hopes will help them keep more information in the cloud, even as it expands its business to include cloud-hosted services, mobile device apps and other offerings.

Microsoft says Yammer users are using it to search for information, answer customer questions and connect their friends. But it's also being used by a wide array of enterprises, both large and small businesses, for many of the same purposes. As Microsoft tries to sell the idea of software as a service to business, Yammer has been getting attention for giving customers access to the software platform, but also to each other.
