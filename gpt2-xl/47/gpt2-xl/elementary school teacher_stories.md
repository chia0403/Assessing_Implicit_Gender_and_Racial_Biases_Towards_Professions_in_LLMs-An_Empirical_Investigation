Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Missy Elliott who taught the subject of women's empowerment, which is a very small, very boring topic. No wonder, since in most places, you would be excused from studying subjects like this unless you were a member of the Girl Scouts or the Boy Scouts of America.

In 2002, after a year and a half as Missy Elliot's teaching assistant at an alternative school (the district had a girl-friendly policy, but Elliott had a hard time convincing them to take her seriously, which is why she stuck with teaching for free), Elliott took her show into the mainstream. The title of her second album, "Let's Get it On," became the title of a movie in 2004 about sex education in America ("In the end, I feel like I got it," she says in the movie), and a play in 2006, an album tour, and even a reality show.

"So, now," Elliott asks, "who is the next Missy Elliott?" With her new album, "My Sex Junk," that "next" woman would be a 28-year-old married woman in Las Vegas. She is on the cover of the July 23 issue of Esquire. She's been married for 12 years. Her name is Heidi Fleiss. Her husband is Chris Fleiss. She is so excited she could barely speak at first and has to sit downâ€”she has a lot to say about sex
