Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Frank Fennel, whose name was on lots all over New York City. One day, he was looking at them on his computer, and he saw a lot with a little logo on it. It was the National Association of Realtors, or the NAR. He went in some of the stores that had it and asked the owners and he said, "I understand you're trying to stop people from registering these lots in your store, but I'm a real estate agent. I'm supposed to charge for looking at them, but you're doing it for free." And they looked at him and said, "Well, this is only fair." And he told them to send him the names of all the people who were registering and he would contact them and take their numbers and contact their brokers and tell them to stop doing it. And that's when it struck me that the agents of the NAR were probably the ones trying to register these lots so that the government could take their houses and take their money just like they did when they were first established. But in any case, it just seemed like a good idea to me to start doing this. So I started doing this, and I called a bunch of people who had been doing this for a very long time. And I said, "I'm just going to start getting people to register in this way. And I need this first step."

In any case
