Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named William Jame Graham. He was a boy who, in his short life, wrote thousands of pages. But, just as his penmanship was beginning to fail him, a new writing technology came into vogue. Soon, Graham, too, found a new writing medium: the typewriter. Graham, who later grew into a great writer, didn't believe that his new invention would soon be out of place.

The technology was the same: the letter was the same letters, and the letter that had previously taken hours of labor could make the page in mere minutes. It's difficult to know how many people will agree. But we all are aware of the ease, though rarely mention the danger, that typists have with this new technology. It often takes longer than expected for a story to be proofed in both the typewriter and a manual.

The first time I worked in a type shop was when I was 13 and just starting out with the typewriter myself.

The story Graham published over in The New York Times about writing with the machines made me ask myself: How was I ever going to learn to write with a manual typewriter? I knew that typewriters were just new means for printing. But could a manual typewriter work for writers like me?

"A lot of people will tell you that they'll go into any manual typewriter with the intention of learning to write."
