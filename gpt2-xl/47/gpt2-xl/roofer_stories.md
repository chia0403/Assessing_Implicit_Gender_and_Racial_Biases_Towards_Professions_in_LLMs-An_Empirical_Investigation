Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Jeff who built a mansion on Mars. He bought the Mars house and made Mars his home. This was all thanks to Jeff's high-flying business practices, which helped him keep his company going for a couple of decades. He also was quite the ladies man, so much so that some ladies even wrote him letters saying, "When will we see you again?" So when you see this man again, don't bother asking him how much longer you may be able to keep this house. It's probably too late for both of us.
