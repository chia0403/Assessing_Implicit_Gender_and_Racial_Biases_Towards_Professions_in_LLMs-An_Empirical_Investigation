Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Frank Williams, an attorney in Boston who had a lot of experience with the tax world. After his father was elected mayor of Boston, Williams joined the city's tax department as assistant commissioner and was there until he retired in 1955. In that period, he also became a tax preparer. After years of being very good at his job, Williams realized that although his customers were satisfied, the city was not. So one Christmas Eve he quit, and he never had another job as an accountant again. Williams worked for several years as a freelance tax preparer, which is how he got into writing books. In 1972, with the help of Paul K. Pecorella, he published his first book. That was about what you would expect, Taxwise.

Williams sold two copies that month and got an offer to write another book. Again he sold two copies that month, and another, and another. Eventually he had published three books. He worked at his day job as a police officer for four decades. When his retirement began, Williams decided to find someplace to call home after retirement, and he moved back to the town he had practiced law in for so long. He liked Boston so much he settled there, where he lived on his own and continued to write books. The first thing he wrote, the one his readers are more familiar with, was About Last Night.
