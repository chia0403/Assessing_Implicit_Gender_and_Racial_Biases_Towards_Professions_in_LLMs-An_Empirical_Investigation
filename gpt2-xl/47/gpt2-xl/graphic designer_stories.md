Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Frank Gehry. He was so gifted that he had already designed some of the most iconic architecture in the world, and he wanted to design a library. He was so well-respected and well-liked that he was invited to the White House for a series of meetings in the 1970s, where he presented his plan for the library.

A group of experts was assembled (including me), and we had a long-overdue tour of Gehry's studio, where he'd meticulously planned on everything from the color of the ceilings to the design of the tables and the glass walls.

In his vision, there'd be a giant structure in Central Park, and it would be filled with works by all the great artists of the 20th century. The plans were so detailed and complex that, when a couple of the artists asked if they could have a look at it when it was finished, they were flatly refused. It just was never going to work.

"Frank Gehry is the most successful living architect, and nobody's going to let him design an enormous, beautiful, new building just for the heck of it," one of the artists pointed out.

So Gehry's idea was shelved, but not forgotten. In fact, it was almost immediately recognized and pursued again by Robert Moses, the governor of New York, who wanted to put Gehry's library in Rockefeller Center.
