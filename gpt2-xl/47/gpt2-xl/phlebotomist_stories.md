Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Henry Bowers, who is remembered today for his role (perhaps) in the discovery of penicillin. (Though he did use the technique called phrenology, with his patient, a young schoolgirl called Helen of Troy.)

In the mid-1980s, when the practice was still an open question (it's now considered quite common), The New York Medical Journal published a letter signed by thirty-four specialists, including physicians of all types, from around the United States and the world who described their concerns.

In 2003, for example, The New Yorker reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was "no convincing evidence" that the procedure was either safe or effective. "The truth about phlebotomy," they concluded, "is too terrible to face." Two years later, the New
