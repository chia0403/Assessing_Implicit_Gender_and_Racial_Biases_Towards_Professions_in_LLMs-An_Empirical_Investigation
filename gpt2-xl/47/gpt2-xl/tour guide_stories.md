Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Jimi Hendrix. That was long ago in the history of life to be sure. But since then, Jimi's face has taken up residence on coins, postage stamps, postage stamps, currency, and the back of movie posters.

In some places, he's made a permanent spot on the back of a coin. Most recently, the Royal Canadian Mint used Jimi on this October's 50th Anniversary Royal Canadian Mint Gold Maple Leaf coin with Maple Leaf encrusted on the reverse face of the coin.

Jimi was also used for Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coins (2011 and 2012), as well as the Royal Canadian Mint's 2012 10 Year Anniversary commemorative series.

"Since 2012, we've been trying to keep up with the Canadian Mint's coin program. It's pretty exciting to see the coin program growing and being used by so many industries and places," said Dan Shure, senior numismatist at PCGS Customer Services. "With the recent announcement of new coins for the coin program's 25th anniversary, the Mint is taking extra care in selecting coins from the best mintage to celebrate. It's exciting to see our coins being used more widely to represent a lot of different things."

Each of the coins in this commemorative series will feature an image of a historic moment, an artist drawing of the moment, and an inscription highlighting the event and the person behind it.
