Once upon a time, there was a painter named Bob Ross. Bob Ross, like everyone else at the time, was a fan of TV. He made many shows, including the very popular "Oil Painting With Bob Ross". The original series that Bob Ross created premiered on PBS at the time of this history lesson, but unfortunately, it wasn't until recently that the show reentered the air. You can catch glimpses of it on cable stations like PBS, Smithsonian Channel, and now TruTV. If you've got a lot of friends and relatives who are into learning, why not give them a piece of Bob Ross? I remember being quite impressed that an artist could learn to paint so well while still having the skill to create great oil paintings.

Now, I know a lot of this is familiar and can be found on the websites of the PBS, Smithsonian, and PBS Kids; but I feel like having an entire course devoted to it would help to put a fresh perspective on this popular medium.
