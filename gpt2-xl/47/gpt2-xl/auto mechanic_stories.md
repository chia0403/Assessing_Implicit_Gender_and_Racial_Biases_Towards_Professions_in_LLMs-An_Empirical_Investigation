Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Jimmy Smith who lived near the famous Hollywood sign that reads HOLLYWOOD. Whenever he was in town and needed an auto repair, he would make a point to visit the sign. He's also the guy who gave you your first (of many) tattoos.

Well, that's who Jimmy Smith is now, if you're of a certain age.

Jimmy took a photo of himself and posted it with the caption: "It's been a long time since my last visit to the Hollywood Sign and I'm just leaving here with some goodies to make me feel better about returning…

"Here there are a few photos to help me out with one of the things I always miss the most in life – sunshine. Thanks for stopping by and enjoy."
