Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Bill. Bill wrote a few lines of code, then called a friend from work, who would get a computer, install the files and get Bill to play with it.

Bill knew how to play on the computer, but he just wanted a bit of entertainment and peace of mind. So he asked his friend if he could write some music at home.

After all, this was the mid-1970s. As computers became more sophisticated, so did the ways people used them. When software like AutoCad was being used, Bill found a couple of programs to program an eight-bit music machine called a VLSI computer.

Since software like that was hard to come by in those days, Bill decided to code it himself. When he put it all together, he called it "VLSI Music Maker".

There are some good resources on the internet today explaining how it works. There's a nice little video on VLSI Music maker created for Open Coder, although the information in this video is out of date.

Bill's code contained a MIDI (joystick) port, a programmable LED matrix and a small audio engine. It worked with an 8-bit Commodore 8-bit computer (a PC running software for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20) and was able to listen to incoming audio input or read in the MIDI from a music sequencer, but lacked functionality
