Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named John Snow (later, of course, known as Lord Snow). He had some strange ideas about the future of dentistry and surgery. One of his ideas was to implant dentures in patients, so that doctors never had to look at the inside of a patient's mouth.

For a while, the idea was considered very radical. The implants had to be made of solid metal, and they had to be large ones. Even so, the idea gained momentum, and people eventually accepted his plan. Eventually, surgeons invented many different types of dental implants, including some using the flesh between your own lips to hold the implants in place.

The modern dental implants are called over-the-counter (OTC) implants because they can be easily had without a doctor's prescription.

Innovations in dental implants can take many forms.

The most common are the dental implants that can be stuck into your teeth to reduce the need for filling. This type of implant uses a soft metal mesh to encase bones and teeth. A second layer is held inside the soft metal mesh with sutures and then replaced with a real tooth. (Filling the cavity, making the jaw and teeth bigger, makes tooth extraction much safer.) Dentists recommend using the most flexible dental implants and avoiding dental implants that use a hard material.

Another type of dental implant uses a soft material for the mesh, so one layer of bone
