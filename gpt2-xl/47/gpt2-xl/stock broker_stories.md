Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Joe. Joe's firm, the Firm, ran a small but profitable company, Cactus Trading. In 2005, the Firm decided to take a risk by getting into the small but important but very risky Internet industry.

The Firm's first purchase was an online retail business company called eVocado. It made little sense for the Firm to try to enter an industry where Internet shopping has all but eliminated the need for a physical store â€” but business is business, right?

The firm paid $2.2 million in 2005 for the company, and after running it for five years, the Firm moved on to acquire the company's second online retail company, BigFish, for $18 million in 2011. They then turned around and sold BigFish in 2013 for a total of $56 million.

Joe's firm spent a little more than $5 million on those two deals.

By way of comparison, the average investment a small-cap mutual fund made in the S&P 500 over the same five-year period was $5 million.

Joe's firm made more in five years than the total money Cactus was able to invest in its first five years.
