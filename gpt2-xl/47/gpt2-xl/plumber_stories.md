Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Bob who used to put on his shoes one morning, and find he couldn't get out of them! Bob came to the conclusion that his shoes needed new soles or they might fall apart. So he took his tools, threw them on the back of a broom, and came out with his shoes. He went back to his place, put on his shoes again, and found they were still in great shape even after all that work. Bob put them on and sat down to work. When he got around to putting his hands back on the broom handle, he noticed that the tools were not at all like they were before, but they weren't quite right either. They weren't really shoes, but were sort of like a pair of big tennis shoes. Then he realized that they hadn't fallen apart because the shoes were not the same size as his old shoes at all, and that his old shoes were the proper size for how he was meant to put on them. The shoe he was meant to put on had slipped out from under him. Therefore the shoes that came on after him must be the exact right size. So Bob took his tools back out, put the new shoes on with his hands at first, and then started his process again. He would put on the proper shoes, and then take the old shoes, and put them on again. The proper shoes would somehow slip out of his hands, and get stuck in the floor
