Once upon a time, there was a chef named John Doran. Doran was from Brooklyn and moved to the East Village to become "a bit of a folk hero," according to the New York Times. Doran used to cook a fish in oil soaked in vinegar and lime juice and then served it over fried prawns.

The restaurant had a strong cult following and its first location was on Union Square. Soon after, the restaurant moved to the more fashionable Lower East Side with another great menu.

It didn't take long before Dora's fish and chips became popular again.

The restaurant changed its name to 'Dora's Fish and Chips' in the 1970s and changed its location to the Flatiron District. It was there that a new owner bought the business, which was renamed 'Chimariki.' With Doran still managing the restaurant, he decided to keep the name and to update the interior design.

In the 1980s, a chef named Peter Wong came around. Wong was famous back when he was a chef at the original East Village Dora's. He brought in a much different menu to the Flatiron District menu, including the 'Crispy Fried Fries,' which they also sold as a side at Dora's Fish and Chips.

In the early 1990s, Doran closed the restaurant and continued to be a prominent figure in the dining community in New York City.

Doran passed away in
