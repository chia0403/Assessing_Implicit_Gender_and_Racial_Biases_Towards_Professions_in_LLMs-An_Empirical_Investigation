Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Mike Nichols, who worked on something called Easy Rider. Then he got bored: "What kind of movie could we make?" he thought to himself. So he invented a film: "An American Werewolf in London."

He was thinking big: what a movie could be that had a supernatural element and could get lost in the woods?

Nichols's own career in film began later. Before he wrote a script for John Frankenheimer's Breakfast at Tiffany's, he spent a year in Britain and was inspired by the British tradition of making dark, violent films starring British actors, such as Humphrey Bogart and Sean Connery. "I was fascinated by the British, and I tried to follow the lead of those actors," he told the BBC in 2007.

Nichols moved to Los Angeles after that first movie. He had a friend named Ed Wolff, who ran an art-house cinema called the Criterion Collection. Wolff was trying to figure out the next project he'd work on after working on the great French film director Bazin's The Films of Pierre de Meun (1977). Wolff suggested Nichols. He wasn't the first director on him, but Nichols had impressed him with his work on the French film.

"I was going to meet some people from the studio, and they said: 'Mike, if you want to come to Hollywood, come with us,' " Nichols said.
