Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Joe who was selling the popular TV cable and satellite subscription service.

"One day, Joe was at his desk. All was well," writes George Saunders. "And the phone rang."

It wasn't a big surprise, but what Joe didn't have was a credit card for the phone. So he gave the customer the number on the label of his hat.

"I did not tell the customer or anybody at the company that the phone had no credit card," Joe wrote. Instead, he told the customer he was sorry and that the company was sending a credit card directly to her credit card company.

Joe got the job (and the hat) â€” and made a million dollars, with 10 years of his life left on his card.

When Joe left his job, he took his hat and credit card to the bank. They didn't think it was worth taking his entire salary, so they held on to just the hat.
