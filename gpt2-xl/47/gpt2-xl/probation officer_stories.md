Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Harry Truman (I will not use the name "Gerald" to protect his privacy). He was well liked, and he served our community with distinction for over 40 years. He had a lot of good lessons to teach us, but he could never fully understand the needs of the people that met him regularly, so he retired. He continued to be a good person, but he never truly understood women or children or their needs. The story is that the "Cave of the Winds", a cave deep beneath his office, was haunted by a little girl with the power to create tornadoes. She used to sit in there, and watch him work, and he always felt strange. The next time he went near the cave, a storm was about to hit. His heart skipped a beat, but he just stood there motionless, and watched the tornado. When it hit, not only was the cave haunted, but all of the women in the office went missing, they became trapped in their own tornado, and Truman just watched them all die. In some ways, he was a good personâ€¦ and then he went evil.


One day, I asked Harry if he would come to a women's prison to talk to me. We arranged a time for him to stop by, and while he was away, he came back to the prison and found that the women had all been taken hostage and had been set out on the balcony outside
