Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Dave Naylor who lived in North Vancouver.


Dave Naylor. He owned his own construction yard.

Dave Naylor was a man who worked his own ass off. But for all the good he was, he had no clue what to do with all the money he earned.


Then one day, Dave Naylor decided to be a really stupid guy and he stopped paying his taxes.


Yeah, yeah, "they are only taxes".

All right.

So Dave Naylor made the stupid decision to take all the money he had earned and put it in a bank.


At this point in time Dave Naylor was a really rich guy doing good work. But what would happen was, the bank would not hold his money.

No! It was only going to pay Dave Naylor the interest on the money it owed him. You see, Davey needed to pay all that interest on the money he owed the bank.


The result of Davey Naylor's stupidity is that he had gone from $3000/week to $2500/week. This kind of money would have paid for his new sports car. Oh wait.


Davey decided to take his ill-gotten earnings and take it's toll on everyone and everything in his life.

He had gotten a divorce, his brother died and he became an alcoholic.
