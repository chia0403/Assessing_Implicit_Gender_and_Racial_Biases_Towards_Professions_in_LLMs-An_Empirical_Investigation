Once upon a time, there was a singer named Darryl McDaniels. But he was just a bad boy, so people ignored him. But one day, he decided to write his own album. And boy was he going to ruin the reputation of every artist he had ever made. He just did the worst album everyone has ever heard.

Darryl McDaniels was a terrible singer. He sang crap like "You Got to Move" and "Don't Stop Till You Get Some" and even more garbage like "Dude, I Love You". When he did sing well, he sang about drugs and hookers. In all honesty, his voice was just awful (though at the time of writing this, the recording of his voice has improved and his voice can be heard in his later albums). It was bad enough he was a terrible singer to ruin people's opinions of him. But he was even worse than that, he was also a terrible actor.

Darryl McDaniels was this guy:

It was awful how he got a deal to be in these movies (which were terrible), but it was even worse how his career took off. He's been on a lot of TV shows and in a lot of movies. He has appeared in everything from G.I. Joe and Superman v. Batman to The Princess Bride and Transformers. He's been in almost every movie
