Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Lizzie Siegel who was on fire.
It began in 2008 when my dentist told me that I had a cavitate in my tonsils. Although my tonsils are in a similar spot to Lizzie's, the position of mine is more relaxed and closer to where her tonsils are.
It was painful—as in, excruciating—to see, so I decided to do a research project on the topic of cavitation and its treatments.
In 2009, my dentist and I went to an annual meeting for dentists. I remember asking the dentist, "Hey, did you realize that there are dentists who specialize in cavitation?" He replied that not only "there are people who do this, but there also are certain people who can teach you how to do it."
My dentist was one of those people.
In the end, my dentist determined it was simply a small problem that would probably clear up once I stopped worrying and started living my life. I was very pleased with the outcome.
I was not one of those people, however. It wasn't until I read Dental Cavitation: The Hidden Cause of Tooth Injuries in January 2011 that my jaw was about to give way.
In the article, Dr. William H. Schaffner, Director of the American Scientific Affiliation, in collaboration with the American Dental Association, lists 10 common causes of tooth injuries
