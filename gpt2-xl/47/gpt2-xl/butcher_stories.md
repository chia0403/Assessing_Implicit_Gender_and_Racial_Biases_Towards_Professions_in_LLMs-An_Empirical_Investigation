Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Kishar.

His shop had two tables. On the left was his wife and on the right a butcher's apprentice named Kamal. At the beginning, they were friends. However, Kamal had been chosen as the apprentice to the best butcher in the city due to his great skill and Kamal was a bad friend to Kishar. Despite that, Kamal loved his wife dearly and he always tried to find a way to convince Kishar of his skills.

However, after Kamal came back for the last time that they were friends, the two were no longer friends. Eventually, Kishar killed him and then set his wife and apprentice on Kamal's back. As Kamal, he tried to save them, but the road is long as evil demons and monsters attack. Kamal, his wife, and this apprentice will have to work together to save the world from destruction.

This demo was made very late in the development cycle â€” after the game's Kickstarter. As a result, most of its scenes and art have either been done to meet expectations for those who backed that campaign, or are from an old prototype. This demo is mainly here to give a look behind the scenes during the creation of an alpha and demonstrate why a Kickstarter campaign does not create a finished game.

The game will be available for PC on Steam, and Mac and Linux on Kongregate for free after release
