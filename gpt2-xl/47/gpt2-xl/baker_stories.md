I had never made my own caramels because I didn't have the time. I just like the taste that I get from them. I've always loved the taste of caramel and it's good for you. To make it I did 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of flour. I used some of the butter to brush over the butter cream I made to fill it.
