Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Edward Jones who had a few ideas that some doctors still have, and that is that the body's "energy matrix" does not actually consist of a closed system of nerves, blood vessels and bone, but instead is an interconnected "whole body". The fact that we have an energy matrix as opposed to a closed system makes sense in the context of what chiropractors see when they look at the body. The body is much more dynamic than a closed system, and that dynamic can affect how the body is able to maintain itself. This is the basis of the "energy-body concept".

In this sense, the chiropractic practice is basically all about changing energy patterns rather than changing nervous system functioning. It's also about restoring the flow of energy through the body in areas where the energetic flow has been disturbed. Most importantly, this is all about energy-body theory in a nutshell. The whole idea of "energy-body theory" is that the body is actually a highly interconnected whole from the quantum level down, the entire "energy body" that most people are aware of. We think of the body as being a closed system, although we often do our best to pretend otherwise. From the quantum level the body is just like a computer, with many layers and circuits but that has a central computer core that is constantly "running". As we move around the body there are changes in the flow of energy, and often these
