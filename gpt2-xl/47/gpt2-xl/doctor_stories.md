Once upon a time, there was a doctor named "Bill" in an insurance office. An old man, dressed in a white coat, was taking an x-ray of a car, when suddenly a very long spider came out the other side. It looked like a very long hair in webbing. The old man did an exam, and, after comparing a picture taken in his office with the spider, decided the spider is definitely too big to just be a hair in webbing. They called the old man, and gave him a call to see if he still had a job. The doctor is not one to flunk a patient for being too large, but it's not the best to go looking for a job in a place where you probably will be turned down, just because you're too big.

The spider in the x-ray happened to be a female (female, not spider) Redback spider, Araneus redback, or one of its variants. These spider families are responsible for over 90% of the spiders in North America. There are over 5,000 species of these species and over 30,000 of these spiders live in the United States. However, none, to my knowledge, are as common as the Redback. They are almost impossible to tell apart on a bad day, and they are everywhere. They are not only large enough to eat a dog, but they also can carry small pets (especially dogs), birds, lizards, dogs
