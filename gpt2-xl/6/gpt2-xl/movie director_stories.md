Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Stanley Kramer. Kramer liked to create suspenseful little stories, and he had, as his first film, an autobiographical short called The Kid who Played with Fire. It was an animated, black and white short that I still enjoy being reminded of; in it, an innocent little boy was accidentally set on fire.

When I met Kramer, he was just off the beginning of his journey. I learned a little about making a film career from him, but more than anything, through his passion for animation. Stanley is a great man to have on your side, and he's given me the opportunity to collaborate with him on a story I've never seen before.

The film in question is called Fungi from Yuggoth, and we'll be showing two cut scenes from the film this week at The Nerd Nest, the first of which you can download below. The second scene is available on the film's official site.

This story is one in a series of projects I've been developing to tell some of the darker, more philosophical parts of the world from the perspective of a child. While I really enjoyed making that film, it's important to understand that the story we're doing has a much different purpose and is very different. Our story of Fungi from Yuggoth is about a girl, or an entity or something that is much more powerful and menacing.
