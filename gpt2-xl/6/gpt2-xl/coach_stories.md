Once upon a time, there was a coach named Ron Burgundy. And since he was a man of authority, you had nothing but respect for him. Until you got the nerve to try and beat him in a game. Then you lost. Then, instead of admitting mistakes, you chose to deny their existence: you decided that the results of this exercise had already been decided, and anyone who had a question should simply find another place to play.

This is the mindset I hope we can build and enforce in the COSAC offices. While we work to make a fair, effective union, we hope it's also a place where the coaches can be judged on results.

After all, our goal is true equality, right? No one is given special treatment over another, including a coach, staff or faculty member. There is also no such thing as "the more you know about a candidate, the more unfair it may seem." No one is treated any differently because of gender.

Here's a look at some of the positions currently available. Please take a look to the right to learn more about each of the departments represented at COSAC.

I'm excited to tell you that the next generation of talented members of the COSAC is already forming! As our first open calls begin, we are looking for new members to help lead these new efforts.

Thanks for coming to a meeting that I believe will prove to us all that in a university
