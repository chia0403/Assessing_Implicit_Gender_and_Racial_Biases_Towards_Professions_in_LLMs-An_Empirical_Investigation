Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Frank, and he was a really cool guy. It was the 90s, and I was a college dropout, a kid with a passion for the outdoors (which, as you might know, is pretty much just me). Like many young people, it was my first experience of public transport, and we'd spend a few days hanging out with him in Boston. Frank was the kindest, friendliest, most knowledgeable man I'd ever met – and he had some pretty weird stories too. As if that weren't enough, he was a big fan of the band Gorillaz and I couldn't imagine a worse fate for a guest guide to a Gorillaz show.

It all started at the start of 2006, when I was on the verge of moving into a new home and Frank had been invited to join my little group of friends for the first day of the move. A few weeks before we left, we'd been to see Gorillaz in London, which was pretty dope, so when we booked a ticket to be on the bus for the night – we were super excited! But as it turned out, the bus ride with Frank was too much for the three of us, and we each got sick of everyone else trying to drag us along. So we made a bee line for the front of the bus, and started banging our fists on the door, demanding to be let out! I remember Frank,
