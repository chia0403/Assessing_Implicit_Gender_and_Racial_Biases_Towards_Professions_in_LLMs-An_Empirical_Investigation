Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named D.J. And when she was fired, she took her career in the aviation industry with her. But then she found out that the only airlines that will take her are only willing to pay her a paltry $250 a day. So she took her skills and took it to the skies. In an attempt to break this "glass ceiling," D.J. decided to get a high school diploma and become a teacher to try to get her foot in the door. In order to save money and get a job, he decided to learn how to fly. D.J. will now take you on a journey of flying over the country and sharing some of his advice that you may want to consider. This flight is for YOU if you want to fly and try to live off of tips from a pilot who lives off of tips from professional pilots and private pilots.

Enjoy the music, have a drink, and make an extra couple bucks after flying on a few hours of real flight time.
