Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Tom Dominguez who had a pretty good head on his shoulders. He knew what he did, and when he couldn't afford to do anything else. So, when J. Edgar Hoover saw a case he thought he could solve, Dominguez took the hint and opened an investigation. And he didn't waste any time: He picked out, or rather lured, his target right out of town. In fact, it didn't take very long. Dominguez's first victim came very early in the investigation, and as soon as he discovered who his target was, he immediately started pestering everyone he knew, looking for any and all evidence of the man's criminal activity (all it took was a few phone calls on a Friday night, after the bar closed, and a couple of suspicious glances from the ladies of the evening). In a week, he had a full dossier on the wanted man, and even put on a phony, phony name and badge (his real name is John Dominguez; his badge is the badge of a detective, and can't be used in a crime). When Dominguez was ready to get the guy, he called his contact at the US Department of Justice, and told them about the case. He told the DOJ they'd thought of something.

To quote the DOJ press release:
