Once upon a time, there was a baker named Sigrid von Trapp. It wasn't until her death in 1876 that archaeologists began digging up clues about her family. They discovered an 1853 book called The Life of Sigrid, the last known autobiography written by Trapp, who died at a young age of 35. Trapp wrote that she was adopted by an aunt and uncle in Budapest and married to the cook Otto von Trapp, the man her mother had had for nine years before she married von Trapp. Her mother had died when Trapp was 18. The marriage went on for a short time, but when Trapp refused to sleep with Otto, he returned (again, according to family lore) with a third man. The two divorced. Trapp got the job at the Surnenburg and lived quietly for the next twenty-five years. In all, it's estimated that she lived to be 89 years old.

Otto was never allowed to see Trapp, but he did get the occasional glimpse of her on their wedding anniversary. Trapp wrote that because both had been ill, Otto had never had the time to come to visit on their wedding day as a bachelor. This was probably because Trapp got around by driving herself around with a little horse, a donkey, and a pig â€” Otto's own pets, apparently. When Trapp died, the family was left with nothing. After this, there was nothing but confusion to follow.
