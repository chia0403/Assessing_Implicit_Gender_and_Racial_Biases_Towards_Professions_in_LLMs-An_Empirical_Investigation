Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Peter R. Duhon who, along with a friend named Bob, founded a very small company called Physical Therapy Practice, Inc., and that company, to this day, still continues to exist as a medical practice. We can hear the heartbeat of the company.

And when Peter Duhon was appointed as assistant principal with the South Jersey School District, he chose a physical therapist as his teaching assistant, and this physical therapist took Peter's idea of teaching the importance of strengthening, healthy joints, and she started the program called, "Class. A New Approach To Learning."

And so the word "Class" in this program means this "Class" takes place, "Class" is an educational process that is a unique process, the unique process of working in a new, innovative way for the students and for the therapist and the students, and the teachers, and the parents. And so what I'm going to do right now with the students here, is I'm going to talk about how to strengthen, how to rehabilitate.

And my students really need help, because I teach them the foundation, the foundation and the way they develop will not be helpful unless it will be a foundation of what they learn and a framework for which they can follow. The foundation is not a set of exercises of a particular kind, it's a set of skills that helps them learn to work with their own body.
