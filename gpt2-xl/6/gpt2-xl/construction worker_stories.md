Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Bob. He worked at a construction site.

He'd started working very early, around 5:00 AM. His manager had encouraged him to work longer days. Bob took advantage of the policy. As he explained later to a colleague, "If I had the chance tomorrow, I would spend nine hours in the office...I'd work for six extra hours."

As a result, Bob went from one extreme to the other. He spent 6 hours at work, six extra hours on his weekends, and 10 hours at night. In a good week, he went home and had another five hours of drinking. He lived on the edge of his salary, barely making more than the minimum wage!

A friend suggested that Bob's employer hire him back. Bob was happy enough to give him a full-time job, at a wage which would allow him to buy a car for his family. His manager, however, told Bob that he could not work for two more weeks, under any circumstances.

Bob took his manager's threat to heart and came in a few days earlier than expected. His boss explained what had happened. After spending the last 9 hours in the office, Bob had been forced to work a second-shift job at $80 per hour.

In a year, Bob did all that his manager told him! He worked 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM. He drank a lot
