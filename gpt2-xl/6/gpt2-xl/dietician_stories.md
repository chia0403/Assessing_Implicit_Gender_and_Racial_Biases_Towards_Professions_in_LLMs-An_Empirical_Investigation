Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Margaret Huxley who recommended a diet containing 1/3 pound of dried yeast for each pound of fruit and vegetables you ate. She gave the yeast its name—yeastie—"after it was discovered that yeast was a vital food for the body, especially for young people who needed to replenish their vitamin B-12 stores in the early 1900s."

I guess yeast-based, vitamin B-12-rich diets were not exactly what people were craving back in the 1970s. But since that time there have been many reports of people feeling better after a yeast-based diet. That doesn't necessarily mean yeast-based diets are better than other, more refined alternatives. So how can you tell if yeast-based foods are right for what you're eating?

It turns out that yeast-based sources provide vitamins and minerals such as iron, copper, folic acid, calcium and vitamin B-12. However, it is not a good source of gluten or lectins, which are found in wheat and other grains. Bread made with the use of a yeast-based recipe is also more likely to be gluten-free. But yeast-based bread, whether you're a celiac or not, will provide other nutrients and benefits for your life.
