Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Shishido (pronounced SHish-eh-ro) and he was the number one supplier of flesh on this island nation of Japan. His shop was the go-to shop for both beginners and veterans alike. He'd be the one to recommend the right cut of meat, usually the prime rib, because that's when they used to have the freshest, juiciest and tastiest cuts. He knew the best spots to cut the meat and how to make the perfect cut, the meat that the master would be proud of, and he'd tell you what the next special cut of meat would be.

Because he was always so damn sharp, people would follow him everywhere to get their butcher's cut. And because he was a legend, he attracted a massive following, many of whom were devoted Japanese American parents who just wanted to do their little hearts out to have a piece of the meat Shishido himself provided. That's because there's actually a whole fucking other guy on this island named Shishido. That guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing and I'm going to tell you right now without hesitation that if you're a parent who thinks this guy's not good enough for your kid, you're doing it wrong. Not only is he definitely good enough, he was made famous for the better part of two generations, and so his reputation was more than earned. That guy is better than Shish
