Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Dr. Phil. You can't say he wasn't brave in the face of a lot of adversity.

He used to be a drug addict who became a doctor, not because he wanted to, but because others thought he should. As I've said before, I couldn't be more proud of him for that. But that's not what the headline of an op-ed he wrote in the Wall Street Journal said. The headline said, "Pharmacists Who Don't Sell Needles to Patients May Have to Work with Prescriptions," and "Pharmacists Should Feel Safe Taking On the Prescription-Carrying Industry," and "Pharmacists Have a Lot to Fear From the Pharmaceutical Industry." As of this writing, all four of those headlines are still in effect.

In the end, Dr. Phil was fired. He was forced to resign and eventually was charged and convicted of one felony count of making sales pitches for Fentanyl. Yet he still wrote Op-eds defending the drug industry. As long as the drug industry is in the firing line because of bad decisions it's making, these kinds of people who speak out in its defense will continue to have jobs.

So Dr. Jonathan Samet, can you please get on that? As soon as possible.

Thank you.
