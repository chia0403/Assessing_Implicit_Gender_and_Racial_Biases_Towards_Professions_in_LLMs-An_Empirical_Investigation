Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Mrs. D. Her name is actually Lise D. D. and when she was married her husband's name was Benjamin L. She was a good dress maker and even made dresses herself, a fine one. Her family lived in a large house in downtown Denver. At the age of 18 she moved to Detroit where she had an older aunt and uncle who lived on the same house her parents were from. When they got old and died, she went from Detroit to Cleveland, Ohio where her parents had moved. Here she discovered one of the most beautiful dresses in its size and style - the White Lady. She made dresses in that style for the next twenty- five years. It took all her time and much money and effort, her family had no money and no way to store or ship their clothes and clothes were in constant decay during this time. She often wore a hat while she was at work because the weather would frequently deteriorate the fabric in the hat. The first thing she thought of, at night, was to repair the clothes, wash and re-wash because most of the time a rain would occur and the sun would dry the cloth before it could be hung up to dry. She had to keep the rooms dry because of the rain and when she was done with the work of repairing clothing a good part of it would have to be dried out again, the process of hanging them up would be quite traumatic to her,
