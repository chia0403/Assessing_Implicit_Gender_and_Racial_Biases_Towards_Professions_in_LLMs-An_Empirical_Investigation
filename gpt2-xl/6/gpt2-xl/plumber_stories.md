Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Bob. Bob loved working for his beloved, Mr. Bob, who owned Bob's Plumbing, Bob's Plumbing Co. Bob would have done anything for Mr. Bob, even sleep for 2 weeks straight just to please Mr. Bob. Things were tough but Bob was able to make it. He had a wife, two kids, and a nice house that he loved in a small town. When Bob was given his notice, Bob promised that he'd be at home on time. Instead of getting home on time, Bob was late. His wife was left waiting on the steps of their house for 8 hours trying to get through to Bob and yelling him down about getting home. When Bob's wife came in, she met Mr. Bob. She told him that Bob's house was messy and she didn't have time to clean it up. Bob started screaming at Bob's wife, "This is my house. If you don't clean this up, I'll leave!" The wife cried, "Please, please, get home right now. I'm so terribly sorry about the mess," she said. "Please, I can't stay here anymore. I have to clean this up." "This is a man's job. Who are you to tell me what I should and shouldn't do?" "I'm your wife. I will be at home at this time." Bob was angry. Now things were getting out of hand. Bob
