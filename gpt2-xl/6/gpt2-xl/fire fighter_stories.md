Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Mike. Mike used his firefighter training to rescue cars stuck on the ice sheet, rescue children that wandered into the fire department and pull down people trapped in fires.

"I learned a lot of things from him," says Firefighter Mike. But then he got a call, a rescue call that brought him face to face with a young girl who wasn't a stranger. "The name was Kaylee. Kaylee's mom, Laura, had her little daughter trapped in the middle of 100-degrees-Fahrenheit heat and Mike was our first call to get out. I helped him cut through a large sheet of ice to rescue her and she seemed fine afterward. But Laura never expected that to happen."

Mike was so busy saving people's lives, he forgot to celebrate. The next day, he got called back into duty and spent the night as firefighter Mike in the firehouse.

"I got to think of myself as kind of a hero, saving a little girl's life, but no one knew the real story, that I'd really saved her life. I'm sure we're being watched by my superiors now, but I just didn't want to make my girlfriend break up with me. So I just waited there to save a few more people until Laura came home so she could break up with me."

Mike took it all in stride. He went out drinking and partying in the night,
