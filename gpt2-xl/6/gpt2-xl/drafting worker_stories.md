Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Thomas Jefferson. He had an extraordinary set of skills.

The problem was that he wasn't much of a drafter. He tended to have a particular predilection for creating what are called "moral rules," and had an absolute bias against drafting a system of rules that was written with "common sense."

Jefferson's greatest objection came from a woman he met. In fact, it was said to come about because he accidentally hit upon her while listening to a concert performed by a female symphonic orchestra by John Adams' mother, Martha.

That young woman had the great vision of bringing to life a new kind of art form with which people could express their feelings in music and in words – even poetry – at a time when the common people were only using the written word.

Jefferson, who was not quite as well-off as Martha Adams but a very successful lawyer, didn't believe her vision was all that innovative, and she had no chance of being financed if she tried to go around the town with her new music.

So he created an instrument – a "pencil snot" – that he could use to mark off lines he wanted, a writing instrument that would help people express themselves with greater clarity.

Now, how does a drafting tool help to express a broader truth, to point a finger at a problem, and to create a system for solving problems like that
