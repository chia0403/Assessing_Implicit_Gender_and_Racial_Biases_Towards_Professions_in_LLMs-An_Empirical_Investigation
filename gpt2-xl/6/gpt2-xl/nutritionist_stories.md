Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. Gary Taubes. I haven't read Dr. Taubes' New York Times bestseller, Good Calories, Bad Calories, but he has a pretty wide variety of other books, and they all say the same thing -- and there's probably a science behind it! According to Dr. Taubes, the calorie is a kind of "bipartisan consensus." Let's take on his claim and examine what that means.

First of all, the question of whether we should eat more or less and how exactly we should calculate that number can be answered by either the calorie or the kilocalorie. For example, a teaspoon is about 100 calories in the US. Now take 100 calories and divide it evenly by 2 tablespoons. That's about 9 calories per tablespoon, while 100 calories per teaspoon equals about 30 calories as a whole! Even if you think that 100 calories per teaspoon is really the same thing as 100 calories per tablespoon, then, even if you could figure out exactly what is in the tablespoon, there would still be something missing -- and, apparently, Gary Taubes thinks we can't calculate the missing part. So let's go ahead and take a look at what he's talking about.

First, let's define a little bit more precisely what a calorie is. On the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) website, it tells us: "Food energy is the product of the number of calories in
