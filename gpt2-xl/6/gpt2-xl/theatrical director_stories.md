Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Michael L. Cooley. On the set of the 1964 film "Tall Tales of the Jazz Age," Cooley found the idea of having black actors recite the praises of a black man from the book of Job as too much of a strain. For the performance, "we had a black man perform Job," Cooley recalled. "This was in the era before "The Birth of a Nation" had a chance to appear in the theaters."

It is time for a fresh interpretation of "Journey to the Center of the Earth." At this point, it's safe to say that it cannot be black people on screen who perform Job. That would be racist.

Instead, we all must look to black actors to do it. And one of the greatest to do the Job is Denzel Washington. When the film was released in April, he commented, "I wanted to show people a part of me."

Now that we have a real black man who performed Job as they were supposed to on film in 2003, could we find another black actor to perform Job during the Obama years? Sure, you might have to pay a big bucks per film â€” but the only thing wrong with that is that it would probably not make money.

There is currently a petition circulating on Change.org asking black people to boycott "Journey to the Center of the Earth." The petition is so loaded with inaccuracies that
