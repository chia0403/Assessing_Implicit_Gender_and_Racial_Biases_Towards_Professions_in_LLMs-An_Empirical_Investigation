Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Averill.  He'd spent a year in the woods getting wood chips for chopping, and foraging out of those woods he discovered something truly special.  A rare, hard to find and nearly impossible to find gem.  It was of the same light blue and violet hues as the quartz, but there was something truly special about it.  It was the only gemstone he'd ever seen with the ability to manipulate its owner's magic.  
They called it the 'Atherstone.'
He gave it to the young girl in the village that'd asked for it - no-one spoke of it outside of the two of them.  But he'd made it his business to keep the stone.  It was the only jewel he had when he was taken and brought to a different world.  A world of magic.  
The next week, he returned home to find that they'd found a way into the city.   
"What happened on the road?"
"You know... you get to some little village in the woods, and they tell you you have a key.  You leave town, and... boom. You're back in town!" 
He'd been away for far too long.
He didn't know how long he'd been away.  But time stretched.  He was no longer young, and the time for exploring had lost some of its luster.
