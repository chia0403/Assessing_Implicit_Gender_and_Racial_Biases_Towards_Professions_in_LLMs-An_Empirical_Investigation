Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named David. As he worked on his dream home, he had the best of intentions. He was passionate about finding the "perfect finish," the way to breathe life into any furniture piece. And he spent a lot of time in the woods, collecting wood that was perfect for this purpose. But one day, he saw something different. And it caught his eye: a beautiful piece of driftwood and moss, with a design that screamed, "You don't have to worry about the finish because it's perfect." David didn't just think he saw a beautiful design, like the rest of us. He actually believed that he had found a perfect finish. He just had a hard time showing it off. The fact that he couldn't convince his clients that no, his finish wasn't perfect didn't stop him. If any of them saw the wood, or if they overheard his conversation with David, they would have been appalled at how great of an expert he was. So he would show it to his clients, and the rest of the world would simply never catch on to his secrets. So David set about making his dream pieces. He loved the feeling of perfection, but couldn't quite muster the courage to share his passion with his family or friends." â€” The Art of Hand-Crafting (1899)


When an object looks like nothing in the world except the artfully produced image of perfection it is simply not what it appears
