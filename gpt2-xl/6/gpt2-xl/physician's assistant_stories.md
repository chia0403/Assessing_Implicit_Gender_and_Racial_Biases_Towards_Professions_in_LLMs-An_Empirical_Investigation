Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Richard Schmalfeldt. Mr. Schmalfeldt was one of a number of physicians and other persons from the field of medicine that was sent to the island of St. Helena, on a scientific mission to conduct medical tests in conjunction with the United States Army. He and his medical team were tasked with testing a drug known as Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate, and later, the serum known as Beta-Carotene that was meant to provide vitamin A to the island's inhabitants. It is a known fact that an army of soldiers were also sent to the island to carry out its experiments upon the island's natives.

There are a few things that one must understand before they can understand or even fully speculate on this story. The two main tests which were conducted on the various groups of humans were the measurement of blood (which contained a high concentration of Vitamin A), and the use of vitamin C. Both of which results indicated the serum containing Beta-Carotene to be a strong stimulant that would lead to a greater increase in vitamin A levels to the extent that the blood levels of Vitamin A in serum shot to nearly double while people were under the influence of Beta-Carotene. These results were confirmed with other tests that followed with some of scientists being taken off the island for further testing.

As well, one must also know that the island itself is a special place of
