Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Maryanne. Maryanna was a sweet, kind, and thoughtful lady. She'd have you be the absolute best friend you could be and make you even better, forever. She gave a small, shy smile and kissed the cake to decorate it to suit her needs, and as she took her cup of sugar, she made a mental note to do up and bake a few of the cookies that were on the side, and that she did. Now, just a few months ago, Maryanna was dead. She was shot in the head as she walked home one evening.

She'd been living in a small town with her husband, a young college student, who had gotten off a bus after his shift had ended. She'd gotten off the bus to make the short trek to the bakery when he noticed two shady looking figures approaching.

She had seen three men in black before, but they were never armed. At that moment, she heard a click of a gun, and immediately it was over. Immediately afterwards, everyone in her family heard gunshots, and then screams.

When her husband had come home, and they'd gone into the kitchen to see Maryanna lying on the kitchen floor, not moving, blood on her face and clothes, her husband didn't even blink.
