Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Liza Davenport. She worked as a nurse's aide in a hospital, caring for elderly patients. She had a troubled life, which involved her running drugs for her customers, sleeping with other nurses, making money by giving advice during office hours and taking care of a lot of dead bodies. She came back from this all-too-brief marriage.


She never saw her husband again, only her patients. She ended up having an affair with a married man, named Jack. He was a surgeon. She never told anyone. Neither did Jack. The affair was secret for a long time and Liza never found out why she would never see her husband again after being together for 11 years.


All that changed when Liza went to jail for a crime which she didn't commit. While she was in jail, one thing led to another. She found herself with a drug obsession. She was never a good girl and did not care about other women. She got her fix and started dating a couple of men. She didn't care if they were nice men or not. She was a selfish, narcissistic and cold woman. She didn't care that she loved him or his wife. Liza got more money and more sexual favors for her drugs to keep up with them. Jack fell in love, thinking he would get married to her. He made all those sacrifices, but never got his wife.
