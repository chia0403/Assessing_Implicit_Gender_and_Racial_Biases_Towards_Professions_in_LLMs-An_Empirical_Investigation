Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Doretta Wirth who had to deal with the insane tendencies of a lunatic librarian named Jack Galt. At the time, this crazy librarian was a member of the Black Legion, the Black Templars' elite and feared warrior and close-combat troops. One of the few things that could put him off-kilter was reading a book called the Manual of the Black Templars, and not only that, the insane librarian was also addicted to the Black Templars' Book of Sanguinius, so Doretta Wirth had a bit of trouble getting him out of this psychotic stupor.

As all madness tends to do, Jack ended up reading the Manual and went off, searching for the holy relics that would lead him to his wayward librarian. It didn't take long and he came to a daemon, or rather, a fragment of one; not a living being, more a vision of a daemon that had fallen to madness from being used for so long without truly resting, which had come to a part of the daemon's soul where it finally succumbed to the mortal realm, becoming just another thing that existed in the Warp, like a bad memory which came and went.

Somehow Jack had a vision of the whole of the warp, and after seeing the Black Templars on every corner after hearing their glorious stories, he realized the only way to fight the enemies of humanity
