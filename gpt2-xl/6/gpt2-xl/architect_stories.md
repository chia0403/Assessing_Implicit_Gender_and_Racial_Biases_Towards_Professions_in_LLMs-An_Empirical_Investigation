Once upon a time, there was a architect named S.S. Razzi. One day, he sat down to write a design for a beautiful new mosque, complete with beautiful, symmetrical arches. The design was perfect. After it was finished, the architect looked through it carefully. This was a good sign. He needed a new client.

Well, the architect said, so then I'll design a house for you.

The client looked at the building in horror. The building was, literally, a disaster. There was no way to make the arches any bigger. The building was literally the wrong shape, and the wrong material to be used.

Razzi didn't have time to dwell on this and immediately set about creating a plan for a better building. He had a plan: a beautiful new building where the arches would fit, the material would be good and the shape perfect.

It wasn't until the architect was in a taxi and the driver mentioned this that the architect lost his composure.
