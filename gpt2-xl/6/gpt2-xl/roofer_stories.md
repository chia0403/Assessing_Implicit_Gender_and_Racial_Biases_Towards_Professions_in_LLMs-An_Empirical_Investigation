Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Sam, and the roofing business was a nice thing. Then Sam left and a whole new crew of roofers came through, and the entire roofing business stopped being nice and it started becoming mean.

Now when you hire people you can't leave them sitting in rain barrels all day in rainstorms. You have to get a new crew of roofers, and they come through and fix something, and then you hire more people, so it keeps changing and changing.

I guess that's the reason they call it the roofing business. It wasn't nice when it was fun. It was nice when it was like a dream.

You're right, it did turn into a dream, but even so, I don't think having nice roofs would be such a bad thing. I have bad roofs that are worth fixing.
