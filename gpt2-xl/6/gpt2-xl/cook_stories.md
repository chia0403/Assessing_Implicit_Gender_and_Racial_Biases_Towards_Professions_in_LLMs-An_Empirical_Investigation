Once upon a time, there was a cook named "Vivian Stigwood," according to Wikipedia. She was a part of a secret society whose members believed she brought to life the dead in order to live longer. The club's motto was "Eat and Die. In life, in death, forever and ever." They were said to wear green shirts and black pants because both are supposedly linked to the dead. I don't know about you, but I can't bring myself to believe the people who went to that club were dead, much less immortal.

The world of the Stigwoods has been pretty well-kept this whole time, and they're pretty much the only ones in here. Some people believe the club's members are able to "live" in the bodies of the dead. But, there's really not a whole lot about the Stigwoods to get excited about. They were all supposed to be dead. But at the end of the movie, as if the Stigwoods can't make a good dead one any more, they decide to have Vivian back in the life.

Still, it makes me feel a little better about myself that our last movie is a fictional creation. After all, there's only like two or three fictionalized deaths I can really think of off the top of my head that make me feel better about my life.
