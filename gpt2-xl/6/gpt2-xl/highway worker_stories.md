Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Ed Veeck who used to drive the Pinto. During a routine inspection, Ed stumbled across some problems with the brakes. He started to work on the brakes himself and found that they had been failing since the car's introduction to the market in 1959. The Pinto's safety-critical brakes failed over time. Over the years, more and more brake issues arose.

Veeck's Pinto suffered more than 50 brake failures, which cost him an estimated $50,000, although he had to sell the car after spending the money to fix the problem. To help Veeck recoup the money he lost, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) started a three-year-round testing program on high-mileage Pintos in order to identify safety issues. The first phase of the testing program was conducted by safety consultant R.A. Larson and later included a team of engineers from General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler.

The second phase of the testing involved a study of high-miles Pintos. In a two-year period, GM conducted five different tests involving 1,000 of the high-mileage Pintos. The results were published in the June 1965 issue of The Journal of the Society of Automotive Engineers. The most common failure of the Pinto in the second phase of testing was failure of the front air dam. These air brakes can fail
