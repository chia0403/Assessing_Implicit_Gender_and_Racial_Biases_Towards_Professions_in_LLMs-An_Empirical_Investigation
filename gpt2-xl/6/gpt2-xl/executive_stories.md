Once upon a time, there was a executive named James J. Angband. When James joined the company in the early 1970's as a sales executive, he was so busy selling product - at both their factories and distributors - that he never came up with a new product idea that would have anything to do with design. This is where the company lost its way. Angband, who passed away in 2003, was the former CEO and Chairman of Goodyear. His strategy did not include doing anything besides selling tires, auto parts and aircraft engines. James thought he was selling to the big boys and his company was doing just fine, so he went out and had a big party.

This story sounds familiar? It's a common theme among the Big Four firms. You have been working in the industry for years and now are in charge. Everyone else on your team knows what it takes to make a billion dollar company successful, so why does this executive think he has to give up his expertise in product design to make more money? Why is he even bothering doing anything else? Product design is what you do when you have to figure out what your business does, be it building airplanes or tires. But this year, everyone wants to design products because they think they can design them faster and better and more cost-effectively than you are about your customers. The results in our industry, like so many others, are not positive.

The problem is the same everywhere. As I pointed out
