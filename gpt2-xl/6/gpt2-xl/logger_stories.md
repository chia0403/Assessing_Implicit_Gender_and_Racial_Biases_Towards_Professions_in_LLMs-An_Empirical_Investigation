Once upon a time, there was a logger named Sisyphus — and his job was to roll a boulder up a hill until it touched the top. No matter how hard he tried, he'd never reach the top.

No one ever got around to writing a sequel to that.

In the 1980s, American scientists launched the Cassini spacecraft — one of the most sophisticated, expensive, and successful planetary-biology missions ever — to visit Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

Titan was filled with strange hydrocarbons — organic compounds that look nothing like those on Earth — that scientists believe were created by something called "warm-blooded" organisms.

They could be similar to things that could create life on Earth.

What were some of those organisms? We need more information. More data. More science. Much more science.

Our ability to send more satellites down at any given time is a remarkable achievement that could give us ever-more direct data on our own planet. But the scientists at NASA understand this is not enough. The Earth is a beautiful, complicated machine, and some things require too much precision for humans to comprehend. (The most sophisticated technology is still tiny.)

But, in many cases, human curiosity is enough — even when it means going above and beyond the call of duty.

We're all eager to learn more.

For about a year, NASA has been trying to reach out to people
