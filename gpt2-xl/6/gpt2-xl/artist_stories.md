Not only could they hear new sounds coming from the keyboard, they were also able to produce them, including an octave up. He realized that they might be able to make the most of this new equipment if he wired them all up in a way that all the sounds were fed from the amp first, and they then filtered through the CD player. Unfortunately, his bandmates did not yet have the same insight as he did. So he tried something else.
