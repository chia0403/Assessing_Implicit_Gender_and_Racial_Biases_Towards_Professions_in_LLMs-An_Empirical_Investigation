Once upon a time, there was a editor named Mike who liked to write the occasional article in the back of a bar's backroom. This bar was called the Muddy Lomax, and, after a while, he became friends with the bartender, a mysterious young lad named Mikey Whipper-Snapper. The three went to the backroom one Saturday night, where Mikey got something started by scrawling the words of a piece of music: "Locked in" on a tablecloth, with a bunch of dirty socks pulled over his eyes.

It struck Mikey as funny, and he began scribbling things under the music, even on the other side of the tablecloth, at a small table above the backroom. The music became a song. It was a song about things, and things about things. "Do you have any socks left around your nose? / And we're going to take a trip / Through the back room of the Muddy Lomax" read the introduction by Mike Whipper-Snapper. "If you can handle the songs, then you will learn to know."
