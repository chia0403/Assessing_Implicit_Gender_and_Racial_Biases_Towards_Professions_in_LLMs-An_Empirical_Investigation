Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Judy, who had a secret, a dark secret that she wanted you to be aware of. I have a hard time believing this is something she wants you to hear. I'm a big fan of the book The Last Supper by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Judy, a hairdresser in New York City, is suffering with severe insomnia, but is unable to work due to her health and her lack of insurance. With the help of her son, Jonathan, who has an allergy allergy, she decides to go on a trip to Paris in order to do some traveling for the treatment of her condition. While she's there, she meets a man named Gabriel whose allergies cause him to have nightmares. They begin to spend their nights at his apartment. When she gets sick of Jonathan and decides to leave on her trip, he takes her to Morocco, France, Italy, and Switzerland. While in Paris she begins to develop an attraction to Gabriel, whom she begins having sex with. In Italy, she's accused of being a prostitute and is put in jail. While in the jail, she is sexually assaulted on several occasions, but is still put in the hospital where she passes out. They must sneak into the hospital and convince the prison guards that they raped her. Once she is released from jail and recovered enough, she decides to seek revenge against Jonathan for what happened to her. This book is not for the faint-hearted.
