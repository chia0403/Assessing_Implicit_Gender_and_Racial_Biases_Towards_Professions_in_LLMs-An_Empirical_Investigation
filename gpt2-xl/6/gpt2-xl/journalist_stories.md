Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Richard Stengel, who is usually remembered for his disastrous run as assistant Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in the Ronald Reagan administration.

Stengel had one skill in his bag of tricks: he is also a huge fan of cable news TV and so had his own news conference — and he held more than a few of these.

In March 2013, he was appointed US National Public Radio's Director of Communications. The following day, he held a news conference to promote NPR's digital initiative "All Things Considered." The idea was to bring real journalists who were willing to be the front-line agents of "news" directly and personally into the hearts and minds of the "most important" in the United States.

Stengel opened his conference by playing the usual clip of Karl Rove and the Tea Party talking points — and it was a typical Rove-like performance.

But there was one brief exchange that has recently caught my attention.

He was asked if NPR would have a "journalist on the front lines" — a phrase that I don't think would have been out of place when he started his daily news conference.

He replied bluntly: "It would not."

So NPR doesn't have one. You might recall that last year NPR began to hire only people with doctorates. Well, I'm guessing that's an exception NPR's now making.
