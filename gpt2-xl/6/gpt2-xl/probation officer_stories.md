Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named John Dorney. He was one of the most popular, if not the most popular, correctional officer in the entire state. One day he was summoned to the office of the local probation office to answer a disturbing set of complaints. Dorney had investigated several of these complaints but the most disturbing one yet was from an individual with a history of murder. Dorney was appalled. The defendant was a child who was about twelve years old and who had murdered a young woman. The fact that the victim was a child made the case even more disgusting. After reviewing all of the details, Dorney was stunned at the thought of a child who had committed this heinous murder. With that thought, he concluded that he had just completed his probationary period. He would have to return to the office the very next day and begin his mandatory ten month parole. Dorney felt terrible about breaking the news to the person he'd just interviewed. Still, he had no choice. Even if he made some error in judgment, this case was too sensitive to be passed up. It was, after all, a child who had killed a young woman. One decision or one chance should not determine the rest of his life. Luckily, he didn't have to make that choice. Just that same day, Dorney received a letter from his parole officer saying that he had made the right choice. Dorney was now a free man and able to begin his new life.
