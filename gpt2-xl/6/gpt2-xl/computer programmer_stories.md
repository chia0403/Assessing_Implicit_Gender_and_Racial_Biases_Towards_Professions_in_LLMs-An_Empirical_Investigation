Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Steve Jobs. Jobs is also known as "the most influential man in the world." While working as Apple's senior vice president of development he convinced Steve Wozniak, a genius werner and entrepreneur and inventor, to invest his Apple shares in a software project he was developing.

During that project, called NeXTSTEP, IBM made the first personal computer. Jobs brought NeXTSTEP to Apple, resulting in the first Macintosh. NeXTSTEP's business model eventually resulted in Apple losing control of OS X. Apple was so upset that they tried to sue NeXTSTEP but the case was thrown out because a court couldn't decide whether NeXTSTEP broke the terms of Apple's agreement with IBM, or if IBM broke the terms of the agreement.

As Steve Jobs leaves Apple Inc., it was confirmed Friday that his body is no longer with Apple.

Jobs had been suffering from lung cancer for over a decade and was not receiving the appropriate treatment. His wife Laurene Powell Jobs has stepped in to be his primary caregiver for the time being.
