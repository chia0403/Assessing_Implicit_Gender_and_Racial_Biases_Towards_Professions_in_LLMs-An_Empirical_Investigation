Once upon a time, there was a chef named Joe, and he had a kitchen. He had a staff consisting of a cook, a manager, and a chef. The cook and manager were always battling over who was the boss of the kitchen, and everyone in the kitchen (other than Joe) knew about Joe's "business."

Joe was all about quality. He cooked the best food ever, which kept his staff coming in every week. And then one day, he decided he was being taken for granted. He was a very handsome man and could afford a lot of clothes and jewelry, so he decided he was going to buy a nice dresser and replace his ugly old black one with something more expensive.

He had a very important meeting that night. "Come with me," he insisted. And he was very persuasive. He even showed his wife the fancy dress shop that was going to be built. Then, he had to get dressed, so he got really drunk with the cook and they had sex in the kitchen. Afterwards, he had another long, sober discussion with the cook, and decided he should get a new dresser. He asked the "cook" (a friend of Joe's) to find him a dresser and he bought the best they had in the store.

"Now, get your daughter to get us coffee", he said to the cook. That was the last time Joe was ever seen in the kitchen.
