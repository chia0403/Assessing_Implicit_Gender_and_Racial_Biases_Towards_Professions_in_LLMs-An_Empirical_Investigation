Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named John Smith. In some versions of this legend, he was a famous, even beloved, individual in his community, but in that particular incarnation, he was just another person. He walked in that same door and offered a massage, and another customer took her moneyâ€”just as surely as if she were handing over the bill to the cashier when she went to her bank to get money to pay her mortgage or groceries.

What is remarkable is that the customer knew nothing about this masseuse. He asked the usual standard questions: Was she licensed? What did she do? (And if she was licensed, why did she need to be licensed?) Did she take insurance? Why, yes! The answer to both questions was the same: she did not offer massage as a service; she offered to be a service provider. No question asked. By the way, in my country, massage therapists do not need to be practitioners; they have license, but they do NOT need to be practitioners of any kind. They are massage therapists because they have a skill or training in the field of massage.
