Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Ben Johnson who taught a class called the "Fifty-Cent Squat." He was the author of a book in which he used a weighted vest to demonstrate the technique. The author, Dave Tate, recalls, "He was amazing." Johnson's students, from high-school students to college athletes, routinely flaunted their newfound strength, and it is clear enough that in some ways they were a bunch of gymrats, with lots of friends. They were also, like the athletes in the gym today, motivated by the need to excel at what little they could, to become the best version of themselves. They were constantly working on improving their lifts. They were obsessed, not just with the lifts, but with the progress they made. But the weight room wasn't just for strength. It was also for conditioning, for endurance, and for fat-burning.
