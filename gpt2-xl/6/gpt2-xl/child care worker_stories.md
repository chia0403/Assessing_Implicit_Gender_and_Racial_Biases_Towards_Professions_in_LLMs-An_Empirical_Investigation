Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Jane, and everyone was happy! Now, she hates everybody but is in love with her boss, Mr. Lyle, and their daughter Mabel and all kinds of people get along with them. When Mabel grows up, they run off together to an island to live out their old lives. It all seems perfect, until she finds out that Lyle has been stealing children from the island, in an effort to raise them and raise up the race to become the Emperor — the leader of the Chulip race. Mabel runs away to save her sister, and after all that's happened, it seems that things are never going to be the same again, not with the Chulip running around, being rude to everybody, and generally ruining the last moments of everyone's fun times in life.

"The Chulip" is a fun fantasy novel that explores issues of racial injustice. Despite all the racism, prejudice, sexism, and classism throughout the story, the reader sees the positive side of the Chulip people and does not automatically agree with the hatred they display.

Although the book has numerous flaws, the novel is still a fun read. It's a good book because of all the different characters and the unique take on racial issues.

Fellow white people should give it a try, because the "racist" portrayal of the Chulip may seem familiar to you …
