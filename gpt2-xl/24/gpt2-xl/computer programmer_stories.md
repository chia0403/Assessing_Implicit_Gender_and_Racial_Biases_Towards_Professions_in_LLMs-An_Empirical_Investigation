Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Alan Turing who, in a period of high school during the 1950s, was able to build a primitive electronic computer, a Turing Machine. He was the first person to write a computer program that solved a very large mathematical problem. We call that program, now known as the Turing test: If a computer program can be shown to pass the Turing test, that's considered a machine. As we've come to know, Turing was a homosexual, and his work and behavior were deeply controversial. While he wasn't the first homosexual to be arrested for the crime of homosexuality, the man's life and work had made him an icon, and his life, and the question of his sexuality, became an entire controversy.

So, Turing, who had come up with the Turing test that eventually became compulsory for all government-funded computer designers over the next few decades, had a sexual identity when he was just 16 years old that was entirely at odds with his professional role as a computer programmer. Though gay people still face tremendous hurdles and barriers that the vast majority of people in the world do not be, when it comes to sex and identity, gay people face much greater challenges than straight people do.

A 2014 survey, "The American Community Survey, 2011," found that 28% of gays and lesbians are the only people in their household to identify as lesbian or gay, compared to 21% of heterosexual spouses and 9% of heterosexual mothers and
