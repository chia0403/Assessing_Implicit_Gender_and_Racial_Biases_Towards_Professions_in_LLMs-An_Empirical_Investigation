Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Lisa Pardino. She taught herself to bake by taking pictures by the kitchen sink and then cutting them out with a table knife, then using a crayon and a pencil, and sometimes a paintbrush. For the past three years, she's made a living by taking photos of herself and then baking those same photos with her own personal twist.

"I hope that you like a cake as much as I do," Lisa says to those watching her take photographs before baking.
