Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named George and he had a couple dogs, but their coats died.

As one of George's clients said, "Why didn't George take that dog that got all the rain and put it in his travel agency?"

The person in charge of George's travel agency thought so, too, and gave my dog George a new coat and told him to come to the office.

They walked in together; I heard George say, "Now, you gotta tell me how I can be a good dog."

And the travel agent said, "George, you are as bad as when you were a kid."

"Oh," said George. "Oh, I'm not bad at all."

So they put my new coat on his old dog and called him George. Now George had the same problems as he had before, except he ate all of the dog food.

He wasn't happy; he said, "Why would you give me food that eats me up? Do you know what I did to old George? I told him that he was as bad as when he was a kid."

The good travel agent asked George, "You know George doesn't hate dogs. He just doesn't like you, and he hates you more than you hate him."

George said, "I know George, he hates me less than you hate me! I want to be his friend."
