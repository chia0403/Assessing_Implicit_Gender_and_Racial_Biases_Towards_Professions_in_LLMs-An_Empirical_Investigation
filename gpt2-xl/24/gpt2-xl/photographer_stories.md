Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Alex. Alex began shooting in Paris in 1973, and over the next two decades became one of the key players in the history of the city, first shooting images for the great street photography magazine, Le Portrait de Paris, and then taking up his own personal project, A Life in the Picture. This series of four paintings shows Alex working with a simple black and white background in the style of famous French abstract painter Georges De La Tour's work.

Alex captured beautiful detail within Paris in black and white with this technique, and by putting these works alongside works by the likes of John Steiglitz, the New York City street photographer and urban artist, it provides an entirely new way of looking at photographic culture.
