Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Detective Jim Gordon. Now he's a big city cop with a badge and guns, and a real crush on Selina Kyle, a girl who lives in a tower next to his own. The two work together to fight crime in the streets and bring justice to the crooks. They'll do it together – or maybe even apart – as the new Batman and the new Robin series kicks off in December from DC.

The first installment is about to kick off with a three-page preview. But then, we got a much better look at the book in a sneak peek at the Batman #1 variant covers. You can see them above and a few sample pages above. You can also view the solicitation text, some of which you can also check out below.
