Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Benjamin Strongman.

Benjamin Strongman became friends with Benjamin Franklin (who was also Benjamin Strongman's business partner) and through their friendship, Strongman became Franklin's financial adviser to his plans to construct the first electric railway in America with a network extending from Delaware to Maine. Strongman was the first stock broker in America to sell shares of stock certificates.

Benjamin Franklin (who was also Benjamin Strongman's business partner) and Strongman became friends and Franklin helped him manage his investments. Later in his life, Franklin and Strongman would be partners in the printing business.

When Franklin came to the United States from England in 1770, he immediately started making plans as he lived in Massachusetts at the time. As a printer and then later as publisher of American newspapers, Strongman had all sorts of financial problems.

But Franklin and Strongman became close friends. Franklin knew a lot about Strongman's finances. He was also a frequent visitor to Strongman's printing house at the same location at 40 Wall Street.

They spent much of their time with each other - for at least four years. The two enjoyed a business partnership. Strongman and Franklin had the same passions and they discussed business.

What might have started out as friendship ended up turning into a business partnership â€“ a friendship between men that would last decades. Strongman had plenty of money, and Franklin had lots of experience
