Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Alice, who worked in a salon which featured a very old, very small, very unkempt hairstyle. Alice had to go there to get new hair for the time being, being the salon only got new hair from a "hair transplant". This procedure was performed by a doctor, who used her dead child's hair to transplant it into her own, which happened to be exactly the kind of hair Alice wanted. But alas, the transplant failed…so the old hairdresser was let go, leaving Alice without a job for a couple of months. Of course, Alice's hair had become too old to be a good substitute for another transplant, so she took the job of the hairdresser at the hairdresser at the hotel where she lived. And at the hotel, she was still known by her old job even though she wasn't a hairdresser anymore. Then she realized that no matter what she did, even if she tried to do the job with the hair she had, it would not fit together, so she would have to do more drastic measures. She decided to transplant her scalp. The first attempts were unsuccessful, but she tried again…and again! Each attempt got even more expensive for the hotel…which was the problem! When she finally got it done at the hotel, she thought "I really could work this place!" but she also saw it was just another job
