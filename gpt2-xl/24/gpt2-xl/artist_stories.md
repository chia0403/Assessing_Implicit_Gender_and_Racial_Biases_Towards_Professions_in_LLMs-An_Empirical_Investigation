Once upon a time, there was a artist named David Bowie. He was a super-genius, someone who came up with all kinds of new ideas and was brilliant on every level. One day he wrote a song called "Space Oddity," which was sort of like a song parody of Space Oddity, by King Crimson. Bowie had a great sense of humor and was always playing off people. So one day a friend of a friend, who had a house next to the singer's, had a cat, whom he had to get rid of; Bowie was very annoyed with the cat. Instead, he took it to his house for him to enjoy. To this day, I dream of this thing where the cat is on the counter, next to something I hate, but Bowie is there saying, "Don't mind the cat, David!" and then walking out. This is like my dream.

I think I'm actually more similar to what Bowie did. You see, that song was very autobiographical, more so than anything I've done. Like, yes I thought, "Oh, that sounds very pretentious" but, in the context of that song, it was pretty honest. There's so much that I have in common with David. I think we are both artists who can make stuff come out quickly, but I also think that our sense of humor is not the same. And that's what's really cool as an artist. I think we are so different
