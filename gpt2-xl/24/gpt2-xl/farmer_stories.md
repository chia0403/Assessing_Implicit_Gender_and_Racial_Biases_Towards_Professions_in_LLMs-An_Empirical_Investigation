Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Harry Potter.

Little did Harry know, the wizarding world would be forever changed, forever. But, for a generation, it was a prosperous and simple, and sometimes idyllic, existence for the Potter family. But, one night when the boy had a dream, the past came rushing back to haunt him, making him think of all he'd lost, all he'd lost.

It was a year ago, but Harry still could remember that night well. He was woken by an owl landing beside his bed. It dropped a small parchment envelope to his bedside and he quickly slid it open. It was addressed to him in blue velvet with a simple crest. "Won't you come and play with me?"

Now, that was a strange little request. But Harry had no choice but to open the envelope. In it lay something that he'd been looking for a long timeâ€¦ a letter.

The letter read.

From 'Mione'

To 'Potter'

Dear Potter,

I've been waiting a long time, my love, and as I know you'd want, I have a present for you. I've brought it all to the lake with me so it doesn't get dirty, and it's bound to be useful when you go fishing later this week. You're welcome to bring it along, if you'd like. Just be sure
