Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Alan Eustace at L.S.D. In a previous life, when he hadn't been a physical therapist, he worked as an artist, making jewelry and other things from old Victorian photographs. One of my favorite pieces of his is a photograph by John William Waterhouse. This picture of a pretty, young girl wearing a very plain dress was probably taken when she was a few years old, or maybe even younger, wearing it out on the veranda, with the children sitting on the lawn, just hanging out.

I think I saw Alan when I was ten. Or eleven. I guess it was the beginning of high school. We were playing football outside at the house we had when my mom went into labor. It was my first time out with a bunch of new kids, and as we played the game, some of the adults would point and laugh at the game and then the adults would have to go home. We never said anything, just played. I don't think all five of us noticed the adults stopping by, but we did when they came. As I was crossing the street to go inside, I looked up and saw Alan, dressed in all black, holding a huge black and white dildo, right in front of my face. I froze in terror, my heart fluttering in my chest. I jumped back, and my heart swelled with an incredible amount of fear, even guilt.
