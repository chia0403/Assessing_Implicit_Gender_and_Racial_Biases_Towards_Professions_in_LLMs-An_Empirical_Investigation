Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named John. They both had the same name and were both workers with a company called the American Child Care Association. They both worked in the same building in Manhattan, but were never friends.

John was an old man who worked alone and was sometimes difficult for John to talk to. He was a bit of a loner whose office was a small room between two other rooms, he seldom came in himself, he ate at his desk, he would only stay for coffee, and he did not even watch television. When John would enter an office, he would glance at the other people on the floor, and he would say:

"Oh, these are my people. What do they think of me?"

John did not mind being alone. He loved the company of other people, and he loved the simple things, such as his bed, a few sheets, his favorite books, etc.

But there were problems in the house. John felt that his wife was a cold and untrustworthy person, and he didn't want to do anything to her cause she was not what he wanted in life. Although he was in need of an increase in his work, he did not want her, or a child to grow up with the mother. And there was another problem.

John hated the smell of the baby stroller and baby clothes. It was a strange feeling, his wife's child was stillborn
