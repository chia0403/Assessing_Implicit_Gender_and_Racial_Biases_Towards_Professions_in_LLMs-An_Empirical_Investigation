Once upon a time, there was a cook named Dave, who loved cooking Chinese food. One day, before a big cookout, he noticed some new people coming to the town.

"Who these people?" he wondered. "They were totally different. They kept asking the cook, 'Who's Dave?' I always smiled. 'I'm Dave!' I'd tell them. They'd say, 'Okay,' but then they'd look in the direction of the new group and ask the same question."

It turned out that the cook was a girl from California named Alice, whom he found adorable.

The town came to love Dave so much that he was elected a "mayor," and was soon elected governor after winning the upcoming election at the suggestion of Alice. Eventually, Dave's town became the center of the Universe, and when the planet became a gas giant and lost touch with Earth, Dave was given life on the planetoid. He went on to become a member of the Space Fleet and a hero of the Galactic Empire. During his time as governor of the planetoid, Dave's town went through the same things that people on Earth go through â€“ love, hate, fear, and loss. Soon, Dave's town was destroyed by the Empire, and he went over to the rebel camp, where he lived out his last days as a mere shell of his former self.

After his death, Dave's legacy and his family's became a rallying point
