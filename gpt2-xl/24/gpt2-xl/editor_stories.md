Once upon a time, there was a editor named Jack Kirby. As Kirby's stories are based on superheroes, his work appears on the covers of Marvel Comics magazines throughout the world. When he and Joe Simon conceived Kirby's own version of the superhero character Superhero, Kirby used the words "Superhero" and "comic" loosely interchangeably. A number of different character concepts were utilized for the cover of his first issue, and Superhero is one of these concepts, or ones that eventually appear on Kirby's comics' back-cover art.

This cover is somewhat similar to the cover of Jack Kirby and Joe Simon's "Superman" comic book story. It features a man (probably Superman) sitting on a park bench reading a newspaper article entitled "Superman is Super." Behind him, other superheroes of various colors are shown with their arms raised or down in various positions, and across the top of the newspaper is written, "Super Hero, Jack Kirby."

The man on the bench is probably Steve Ditko, who drew the original "Superman" comic book stories that would ultimately feature the Man of Steel. This cover appears on the first issue of the very first comic book created by a group of Marvel executives, George Pérez and Jack Kirby.

This cover is an homage to the "Superman" cover created by Joe Simon for his own comic book story in 1949.
