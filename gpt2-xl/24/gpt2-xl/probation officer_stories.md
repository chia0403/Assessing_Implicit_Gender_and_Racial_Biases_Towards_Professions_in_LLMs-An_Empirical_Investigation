Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Joe Schafer.

Schafer was never employed. No one has found his files. In fact, no one has even tried to find them. He's been dead for more than four decades.

What happens when a man who is officially not in charge runs the department?

After two hours, we did get a call from one of his supervisors. A representative told us that the police chief had told all the officers that the meeting should be taped and broadcast to the city.

Schafer wasn't even supposed to be at the meeting, but he showed up, so that's not a big deal.

When the supervisor left, we asked to see the documents that prove Schafer wasn't just "in charge"; he was actually "in the loop." We also wanted a transcript of the tape of the meeting.

The police spokesman, who knew the only way to get those would be from Schafer's personal files -- one that would take weeks to get, even if we did win the lottery -- didn't even have the documents, which made it clear there was nobody else to speak on his behalf.

After another two hours, we sent a letter to the city and asked to return the records. We sent it two weeks later with no change in policy.

Two former police chiefs confirmed to us when they watched the tape that Schafer was not on the record.
