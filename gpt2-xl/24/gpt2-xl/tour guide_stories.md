Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Goro who offered you a free tour if you could defeat his four horsemen and their "little brothers." These include the "Little Man," "Little Boy," "Little Girl," and "Little Boy." Goro's nephew, the prince, would then appear and offer a new mission, now in honor of the "Little Man," "Little Girl," and "Little Boy, the Little Man, and the Little Girl, the Little Boy…" The Little Man, "Little Girl, and the Little Boy" also appear every time you summon three other characters with similar names.


Goro would be surprised to hear his nephew has become the prince – the player is instead tasked with taking his nephew on a tour of castles throughout the Land of Oeilvert, fighting an army of minions, and saving the princess, all while stopping the Little Men and Little Girls from taking over the land. Once every castle has been visited and the prince has seen every one, the mission's ending screen is unlocked and the next mission is begun.
