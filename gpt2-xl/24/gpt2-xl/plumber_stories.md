Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Henry Trousdale who lived in the small village of Northwick in the town of Westport. It was the middle decades of the twentieth century, an age in which most people worked long, grueling hours, never sure when they would be needed, and in which some men — including Henry Trousdale — saw the possibility of the occasional beer night as a welcome break from work.

But something happened at that beer night in which Henry Trousdale changed forever, one night he spent drinking, and the next morning he was dead.

He was the guy in South African cricket team's history who never had his number retired.

"This guy, no one even thought of telling the story," John D. Buntin, the Westport town historian told reporters. "[He] was someone most people wouldn't even know about … not that there's anyone in England who won't."

And that's not all:

He was the first member of the Westport cricket club to be awarded an undergraduate degree in mathematics. Henry Trousdale, The Plumber, was also a teacher, whose children went on to complete B.A. degrees in mathematics and physics. "The Plumber" was the honorary name given to him by the Oxford Mathematical Society.

"My dad told his story to a friend, who asked them why he was called the Plumber,"
