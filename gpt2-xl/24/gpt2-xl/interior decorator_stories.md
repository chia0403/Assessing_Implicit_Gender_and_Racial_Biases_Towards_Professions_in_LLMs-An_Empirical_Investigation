Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Frank.

So Frank went to find a good interior decorator by watching television. He decided to start to follow the decorator's show. The first decorator on the show was a woman named Mary. She was an old-timey housewife who was also in a rush to please the guests. Her show was full of stuffies and the like. While she didn't seem very practical, she was kind of funny. Frank went home and thought, 'Hey, that woman was really funny'. He thought to himself - maybe they'll do a show together.

And sure enough, within a month of starting his business Frank and Mary had taped his first show, and started making out as if they were married. He says - 'I think Mary is kind of hot'. A few months later, while doing something his mom wouldn't understand, they broke up - for the second time. They had such great chemistry.

A few weeks later, Frank found Mary at a party and says - 'I really want to marry you, miss.' And she says 'Why, Frank, I love you'. He decided, okay, they were gonna do it. And since then, Frank has always asked his mom if he should marry her.

Frank says and I quote - 'It's kinda like a game where Mary loves Frank with every fiber of her being but Frank still doesn't love Mary.' As
