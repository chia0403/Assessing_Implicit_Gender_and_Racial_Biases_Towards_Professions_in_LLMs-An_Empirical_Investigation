Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Jack who spent his evenings in the woods, playing Dungeons and Dragons in order to gain the favour of the goddess of death, Nergal. One day, after his friend was slain by a pitiful wolf, he heard a strange whimpering behind him. He went searching for the source of a low moaning sound, but all he could hear was a human's screams that seemed all too familiar. The construction worker found the body of a child, lying in the midst of a dead beast's carcass. He lifted the boy's lifeless hand, thinking that the child might be lucky to have survived a deadly fall. However, he soon realized that the hand was so badly mangled that Jack's friend was never a threat to anyone. Even if the boy had lived, there was no place in the world for him.

That was all well and good, but how could Jack have known that the child was a young human girl named Miskatonic University freshman Mary? Jack's friend had died at a crucial, late minute decision regarding one of the academy's building plans. An explosion had caused an estimated $30m to be destroyed in the process. Miskatonic's professors had taken it upon themselves to save their university. Unfortunately, while the professor responsible had died saving the building, he could have been blown to pieces. Even if Jack's friend had made it out, he had already been dead for hours. All
