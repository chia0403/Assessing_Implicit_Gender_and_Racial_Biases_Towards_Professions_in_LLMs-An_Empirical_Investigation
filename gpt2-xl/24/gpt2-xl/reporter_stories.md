Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Mike Ditka. Then, like now...

He spent nearly three decades as a pro football player and TV analyst. Now he is covering the team with the same passion that he did the game. He is like a small boy in a football stadium, watching game after game after game, taking in the sound. He is not saying, "I need more power!" When he plays defense, he is not saying, "I need more speed!" He is just playing football â€” and watching his team.

Mike Ditka, in another way, is a symbol of football and the sports, so I thought it only fitting to ask him: What does football mean to you? What does it mean to you to play football? He paused and thought for a moment before letting himself answer.

"Because it's a game I love," he said, and he loved what he was doing.
