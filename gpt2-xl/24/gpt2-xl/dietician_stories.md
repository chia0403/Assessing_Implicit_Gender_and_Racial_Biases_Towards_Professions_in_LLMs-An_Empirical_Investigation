Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Martha Banting who worked with the nutritionists of the 1960s. When she started to work at that organization, she wasn't worried about food, it was all about health problems.

She told me, "We have to stop using words like 'natural' and 'healthy.' Let's stop the word 'fat.' Let's take a step back and look at food and calories. They are so different. There's so much more to be done.

"We only know about what's good in foods because they've been around for millions of years. We don't listen to nature. We don't listen to the animals.

"We're at the point in the world where we're talking about whether or not foods like coconut oil or high-fructose corn syrup is safe, and we're not even aware of what animals have to go through to produce those foods.

"When I work with children I tell them they cannot eat these foods if they're under age 12.

"That's called child abuse, and that's the way we should see it."
