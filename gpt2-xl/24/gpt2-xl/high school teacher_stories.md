Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Joe "Yogurt King" McMichael, also known as The Pizza King. Joe became the subject of a school essay in which his parents are quoted discussing his favorite pastime in an effort to convince the other students he was normal:

The Pizza King is a normal person. He drinks beer by the liter on the weekends and watches bad movies with his favorite friend. What else did they ask or whisper? What they couldn't tell? That Joe McMichael never even tries to pick up girls. This doesn't mean Joe is bad. Not by any stretch. They just don't want to talk about it. That's all.

Yogurt King would become a minor celebrity and internet sensation. People would flock to his internet forums to discuss his strange habits. In one memorable case, a young woman asked Joe at a party if she could dance with him, to which he responded, "Sure, that'd be awesome! How much?"

Joe was eventually charged with misdemeanor stalking by the San Mateo County sheriff's department. This was before the internet was ever even a known entity, and it was widely believed that McMichael was a troll on YouTube or a meme made by a forum member. Joe's parents were quoted in one local newspaper saying, "We think that kids are just trying to make fun of him because of his odd behavior, and we think that's kind of disgusting and wrong."
