Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Margaret Wollersheim. This kind of woman is rare — women who are smart, self-sufficient and ambitious for all that they are. Margaret was a loner, and sometimes, when she was in her element, one may be able to see through that loner element altogether. She was intelligent, well-informed, creative, and often a little eccentric (though she managed those last two very well). Margaret never cared for the trappings of her profession, and that was a good trait, although she did put on a good front. Margaret had her faults but it was clear that Margaret Wollersheim was a person who was destined to become a powerful individual, and that's just what she accomplished.

When her career as a physician's assistant came to a close, Margaret found that she was suddenly alone — and this had a profound effect on her life. Margaret started spending far more time in the library than on her feet. She did whatever she could to remain in touch with the world, and that world was a very interesting one.

Margaret Wollersheim was a very busy woman, and on top of her duties she had to make sure that all her money was being spent on food and essentials, and she did just that. She took the initiative and decided that money was a scarce resource and she wanted to try and make it more plentiful by selling her photographs. These shots were all taken
