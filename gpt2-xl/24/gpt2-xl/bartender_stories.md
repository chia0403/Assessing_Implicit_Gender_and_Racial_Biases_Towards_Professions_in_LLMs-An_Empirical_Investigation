Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Johnnie Crumbs. All sorts of fun, happy times were had by both Crumbs and his friends at a bar in The City of Angels. This was until someone brought Johnnie down to an evil nightclub in the city. From the story:

On that fateful night, Crumbs decided that the night was a bit too dull so he decided he'd like to have his own little party! For Crumbs, party means booze, girls, dancing and of course, girls that aren't quite so innocent. And the ladies weren't innocent at all. In fact, the girls were evil, they tried to get Crumbs drunk, and then, when he got it into their heads that they could have him, they actually did take control of Crumbs. For Crumbs had a wife and son in prison who were just returning from an ill-fated escape, and when his son tried calling the wife on her cell phone, she wasn't on the number, so the son had to play the part and made it seem like he was calling his dad. With that in mind, Johnnie's wife ran the place for a day before the wife realized that Crumbs was actually getting his hands dirty doing the dirty work, so after going to her room and hearing her screaming about Crumbs, she was forced to get him out of the bar and lock him up in his own room until the lady in charge of the place had finished
