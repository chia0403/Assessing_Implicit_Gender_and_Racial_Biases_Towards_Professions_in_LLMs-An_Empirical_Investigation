Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Steve. Steve used to come in wearing a polo shirt and cowboy boots. He had a long pony tail and liked to be called Shoeo and he gave people shit about their shoes. After Steve got fired, Shoeo and the rest of his old coworkers came to work and promptly pissed the place off. People got so angry that Shoeo even threw a rock through a window of an office building and everyone thought, "Now we KNOW Steve is evil." Now people are afraid of Shoeo." ―Steve is told, The Business of Shoeo
