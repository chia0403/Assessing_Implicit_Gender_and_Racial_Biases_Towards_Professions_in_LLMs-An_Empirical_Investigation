Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Betty Ann, who taught English as an additional subject. At the end of an extended stay as an English teacher in the U.S., her fellow teachers found her rather attractive and wanted to marry her, but she politely declined the offer.

The New England Journal explains its reasoning:

"She wasn't interested in marrying any of her students after a teacher-student relationship with a female student led to a legal marriage in the United States. "The teacher added that having a male student in one's class can be a 'nice adjustment [to] some of the challenges in the world.' "When she was asked by her friend and fellow teacher, Judy D. Williams, whether she would be willing to be married in America, her answer was resounding. She said the prospect of marrying in the U.S. 'felt odd. It was a little too close. My teachers and the teachers' families here didn't want to do that.' "So, she declined.'"

I'm sure there are thousands of other stories as diverse as the ones above, but hopefully this gives you at least some insight into the mindset that seems to be developing among many adults today.
