Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named First Responders, but its mission now seems to be more focused upon the idea that they're there to treat you after an incident has taken place, not before. The First Responders were the ones who rushed to the scene of the incident, and then got the patient to a hospital. We are seeing what is being called a "new medical strategy," and that strategy seems to be aimed at getting you and your family there as soon as possible in the safest way possible.

The purpose behind the "new medical strategy" is not only that it increases the chances of survival, but it also decreases the amount of medical personnel on scene so that more medical personnel have a greater chance of being there when you need them. There is no question that those who use medical advances like CPR or defibrillation are much more likely to survive, so it's understandable that they're becoming a big hit in emergency rooms.

But the problem is, this move has the side effect of making it more and more difficult to be treated. It was never more than a matter of time until it became apparent to the masses that a patient is just a number. Your needs are never even recognized as being in need of medical attention.
