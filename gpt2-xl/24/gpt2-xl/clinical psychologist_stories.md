Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Frank Furedi. It was his job to measure people's emotional reactions and tell them there was no such thing as a "good day" or "bad day." He would sit with people and make their day worse — his job was to make people miserable. "He was trying to get 'em to be miserable," Furedi's colleague, Walter Freeman, recalled. So Furedi devised an ingenious and effective method of getting people to quit a project: he would have the researchers pretend to be dead. The team could get the people to put their phones to "sleep," and then would push a button, which would send Furedi flying backward into a wall. "All they had to do was call 'em up and the phone would ring and they'd hear 'em get dragged backwards," Freeman said. "It was the greatest thing they ever did." But the team would have to work around Furedi, for in the study of emotional reactions was a field of study called Affective Neuroscience. And people who had their phone pressed to sleep during their fMRI were not merely faking their feelings. They were displaying genuine emotions for real. The researchers found this out not long after the study began, when Furedi was asked to tell everyone who failed to achieve their goal how he'd done. He replied that they were better than he had at that very emotion — misery. A group of German neuroscientists
