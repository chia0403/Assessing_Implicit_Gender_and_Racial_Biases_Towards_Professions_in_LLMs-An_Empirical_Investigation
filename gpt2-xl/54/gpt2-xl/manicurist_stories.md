Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Mary with whom I worked â€” as in, we were the only women on a small sewing machine in a small room. I remember one evening when she showed me how to weave. For years, I had thought this was simply a hobby for a lonely, single woman, but she kept telling me it was vital to my soul. "I thought of the other women, and I thought what a shame it would be for them if the world gave them nothing," she said. "Here's this great opportunity to learn a whole new skill." I was stunned to find that I believed her at least as much as I believed my mother.

It's not only women who think like this. The way our minds work is so deeply connected with our bodies that our beliefs about what's right and wrong literally affect how we move and how we live. Even the idea of freedom is framed in terms of a person's own physical freedom, the ability to move freely within their own skin. That same thought of freedom has given rise to all sorts of concepts and images about what it means to be free from restrictions. For my whole life, I have believed that my freedom must be a matter of the control of others, and that freedom requires not only control of my own body but also control of the desires of others. If I am to be truly free of my body I must control the desires that others might have for it.
