Once upon a time, there was a coach named Bill Parcells that always loved to say that any team will be better with three cornerbacks than it would be without those two guys. Well after all these years, it's time to put that to rest. This is the absolute truth.

With that being said, what exactly is the best 4-3 (cover 3 or Cover-1?) defense to run or not, and what is the worst 4-3 (cover 0)? I personally feel like I can answer both of those questions accurately. What I'm going to do here is make a list of four defenses that each covers a certain element of the game well. Then, I'm going to discuss why that is, how different defenses may be able to defend those elements, and what it could possibly mean for defenses moving forward. So, here goes:

Cover 4 (Cover-2-Rob)

Cover 4 has become quite a popular 4-3 defense in recent years as some fans have begun referring to it as a 4-3 that uses a hybrid of Cover 2 and Cover-1. The most notable example to this hybridization would be the Carolina Panthers who currently run Cover 4 and are currently in the Super Bowl after being one of the best teams by playing this type of defense.

The benefit of this defense is to have extra time (and therefore defensive backs) to react to potential pass routes, which can give the defense time to adjust to
