Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Maureen who worked in the Duchy of Lancaster. A great number of members of the Duchy were involved in the great, great, great, great, great, great, Great Houses.

At the time of the Great War, Maureen was tasked with working in Lancaster Castle with the Royal family as they held their annual jousting tournament. During this jousting tournament, Maureen was nearly disembowelled after a particularly vicious jousting session in which she broke several bones in her leg. However, she was still able to perform her duty, so she stayed on as a Duchy employee to help run their ducal estate.

There was a time when he was a member of the great, great, great, great Duke of Lancaster and this is my favorite bit about him because, he's great for dashing out in a blaze of glory at the end of the story or something!

The Duke of Lancaster lived, worked, and died in Lancaster Castle, and he was very proud of his work in the castle.

Also, that's the last time the Duke of Lancaster wore a hat!
