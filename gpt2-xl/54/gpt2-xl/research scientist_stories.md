Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Michael Shermer.

Shermer had spent much of his research career in a tiny, remote corner of the world: The university he worked at had only one faculty member, a retired obstetrician. Sherryers used research funding — or rather, a lack thereof — to develop his own theory.

The theory was this: As children were exposed to pornography growing up, they started to become like adults instead of like children. If they started growing up more like an adult — more sexually active — they would become less inclined to watch pornography and start having sex.

Shermer had no way of proving this theory, other than to have people try to resist its appeal every time they encountered pornography. But for the last few years, he had become convinced that the people who became most addicted to his theories were women. "Pornography," he would say, "adds to the psychological damage of women."

He'd argue that the way most porn was created did little to stimulate sexual desire, but rather, encouraged sexual frustration. Porn movies were cut to make viewers feel pleasure, but also to keep them aroused. "That's why we say female nudity," Shermer would explain. "Because it's hard for a guy to get aroused watching it at home."

The other cause was the pornified version of femininity: Men were now expected to be sexy while women were expected to be submissive
