Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named S.M. Armani. You may recognize him from the first Armani suit ever to hit the streets. With more than 70 years of experience and more than 250 signature collections to his name – with an accompanying line of clothes, housewares, accessories, jewelry, luggage, shoes and footwear – he is considered one of the most famous and recognized designers… if not the most famous. A New Yorker who's lived in America for more than 40 years, who owns a home in Manhattan's West Village, who serves as a member of the NYC Commission for the Preservation of Historic and Art Deco Buildings, and who designs and creates his own fashion and accessory lines, Armani has been a major influence on New York fashion since the 1950s. He first gained prominence as a children's clothing designer before branching out into womenswear and men's workwear lines, and finally into shoes and footwear. Armani is a product of his time: he draws on his Americana upbringing, where he was born and raised in New England, and his interest in classicism, as well as his personal and professional connections. He holds a degree in English and History, is an alumna of the New York Military Academy (née West Point), and resides with his wife at 60 Wall Street.
