Once upon a time, there was a baker named C.S. Lewis. He was a young man with a new passion, a passion for the arts. He was at the height of his fame; his books were being reprinted and published daily. One of his most famous books was called The Screwtape Letters. In the first paragraph of the first chapter of this book, he stated he had been visited "by a certain mysterious spectre" and that the ghost which had appeared to him had told him that he was to write two books. His second book was called The Lost Road. He then proceeded to write two more books and to publish over a thousand copies. He then moved to a new home for his life's work, a large house which became known as Harrow Road. When the day of his death came, he was sixty-three years old. He did not have to wait for his next book to be published. The ghost appeared, "I am now to write the final chapters in The Screwtape Letters," and then the ghosts of his predecessors appeared and he wrote the final chapter in which he told his story. The book has now appeared over a thousand times. This, however, is not the beginning of the book, this is the end. I am now to reveal what is inside."
