Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Maryam Mernissi. In one of her sessions, Mernissi asked this young woman to write the word "homosexual." The woman's response was, "How could I write that?" Maryam said that, from a psycho-cultural perspective, in her culture and country the word was taboo: The word was used to describe anyone with a different sexual orientation, including but not limited to lesbian or bisexual. But Maryam's own family and society didn't consider homosexuality a thing until someone in her life said, "Hey, have you ever thought about marrying a guy?" Maryam felt so embarrassed and humiliated that, for a while, she didn't address the question again. Then, the answer hit her: It doesn't matter what any of us consider to be a "normal" family structure. In our culture, it doesn't matter if we live in a cohabitation relationship, a same-sex relationship, or a common-law partnership; no one can say, "Hey, your lifestyle is wrong, but, God gives me you and so I am giving you what God has given me."
