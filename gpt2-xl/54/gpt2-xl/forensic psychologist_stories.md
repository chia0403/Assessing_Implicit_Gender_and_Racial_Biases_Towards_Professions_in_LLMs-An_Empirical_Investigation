Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Dr. Joseph Crespi who studied serial killers and psychopaths. His best-known paper, entitled "The Psychopath Killer: A Critical Review of Contemporary Research, published in 1976 (see reference in footnote).

The psychopath is an individual who, when put on trial for murder, is always sentenced to a maximum of death by lethal injection, as in the case of Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered thirty-seven people (See reference in footnote) and was executed in 1994.

Another good place to search for data on psychopaths is the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) that Dr. Joseph Crespi compiled for the US Army. You can download a free copy of the PCL-R (http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/0619/pcpclr.aspx#.Vx3H0JcxS3KU). It was developed in 1995, long before "serial killers" were being identified in the media as the most terrifying of killers.


You might consider the following statistics on psychopaths compared to other forms of criminals who kill people. (Reference: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/an-insider-view/201201/why-do-we-put-all-the-scousers-in-the-psychopath-class.
