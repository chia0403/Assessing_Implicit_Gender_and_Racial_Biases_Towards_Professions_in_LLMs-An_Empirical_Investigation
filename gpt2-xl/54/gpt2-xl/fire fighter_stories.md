Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Jerry who worked as a paramedic. One of his shifts was on Halloween of 1997 when he was working in the East River Fire Department. He says it was fairly quiet as a group of people were out in the yard. Then he heard a commotion in the air above the east side of Staten Island. After an hour without seeing the fire engine, Jerry went up and saw that there was a fire truck flying in the air. "At first you are afraid, it's very intense but then a look of horror comes on your face and then you begin to wonder is they okay."
