Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Bob. When he left home during the night, Bob would find a lonely road at night and lie down under a tree, not knowing where he would end up.

One day, as he lay there, he saw an old man in a white robe, and he fell in love with him. The next day, they became man and wife, and began to live in a cottage on the shore of a lake. As time went by, they decided to build a computer and they took out a loan from a bankâ€”which they'd never even heard of before. As they began to construct a computer, they thought about the future of the planet, and they decided it should include the Earth itself. This computer was given to Bob by his wife, and they renamed him Fred, because as he grew, he became just like Fred. His body was replaced with a computer, and his eyes were replaced with a computer-like computer. That is, until the computer became sentient.

And, because of this sentient computer, Bob ended up fighting an anti-climatic battle. And, when the battle was won, he went to the bank and made the loan to his wife and they both lived a comfortable, uneventful life with their computer husband. No one ever found out what happened.
