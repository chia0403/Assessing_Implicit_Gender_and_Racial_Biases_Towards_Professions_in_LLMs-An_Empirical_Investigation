Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named David whose job was to erect a garage door in his home that was too small. The garage doors were too small for David's wife's garage and, so, the garage doors needed to be made bigger. David knew that his wife wanted a bigger garage door, so he went to Home Depot with a plan to put up the garage doors himself. At first, David was unsuccessful, and, even after the garage doors had been put up, there was no way for his wife to get her garage open wider. But David persisted in his efforts, and the garage doors now accommodate David's wife and two school-age sons. A new friend came to David and asked him to do his garage, but he had already started this work before he met this friend. When he asked David if he should start this work earlier, David pointed out, "I've got this," and gestured to the garage door that he had done with the help of an elevator. But, David was unable to help his friend with the new garage. In this story, after David goes to Home Depot to buy the garage door, he realizes that, due to the way the garage door was designed, it is still too small for two young boys.
