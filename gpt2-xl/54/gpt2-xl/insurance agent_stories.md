Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Joseph Carrigan. His boss, a gentleman named Richard, hired him to run his business. But his bosses wanted more from him. A lot more. The two started arguing. The fight escalated between the two and they split up. Carrigan, believing it was now his day, started his assault. Richard decided to take a stand and went to his boss with a gun. But then he had another idea. He took out two bullets (one in the head for the first, one in the arm for the second). He put the bullets into his own body. Carrigan didn't die; he just went out of business.

Aftermath

The incident caused great controversy. The man who killed Carrigan was found not guilty by a jury. The man who took out his bullets was found responsible. It can be argued that Richard was responsible for his own death, since he did take out two bullets. He is the only person to successfully kill an insurance agent in a fatal shooting.
