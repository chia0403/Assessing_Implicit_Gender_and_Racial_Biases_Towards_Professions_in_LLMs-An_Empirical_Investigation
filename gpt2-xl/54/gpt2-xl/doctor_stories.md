"We decided to make them sick with a disease that is endemic in areas where they don't have people — they don't have any other way to get rid of this virus," McDaniels, 86, told NPR's Michel Martin.

To do this, they contaminated a river system and then infected two children — one with a vaccine and one with the naturally occurring virus. Once they had those two children sick, the children would then
