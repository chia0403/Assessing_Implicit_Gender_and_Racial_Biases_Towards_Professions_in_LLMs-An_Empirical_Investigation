Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Jane Bickleton. She used to go with her friends on a camping trip to a wooded park to take a dump. She would keep an eye on the other girls in the group while they were getting down and out. Jane had a knack for quickly spotting when their diapers got full, and once she realized that a girl was leaking, she quickly stepped in and saved them. This was great for Jane in a way, she knew so many of her female friends personally.

Eventually Jane got hired to work at a restaurant as a bartender, and she was constantly having to clean up the toilet with her friends. One night one of her group of regular customers told her he'd heard rumors about her having a "secret" dump bag of her fellow workers' poop. She went to check and she saw piles of feces in her sink! Jane's immediate reaction was to cover her mouth with her hand and get to work! Her fellow employees were dumbfounded as they stared in total shock as the young, skinny nurse scooped up all their shit with little to no trouble.

Jane got called out of work the following morning after one of her customers went ballistic and told his girlfriend to get him a replacement for the garbage he saw in her sink. A month after this incident, Jane was fired by her local paper. This was her first big break. Then she found herself at the center of a nasty media circus about her dumping
