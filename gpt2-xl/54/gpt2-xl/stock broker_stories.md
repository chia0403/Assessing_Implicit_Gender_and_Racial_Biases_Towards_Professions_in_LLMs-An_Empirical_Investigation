Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named David. David bought the stock of Microsoft when it was $0.05 so he could sell it later to make more money off it. In the year 3000, David buys the stock of Microsoft again, when it had crashed down to $0.05 and now he is trying to buy when it is $0.10 and he is going to sell when it is $0.20. In every single year, David has the same mistake. Then on this day, David is going to buy the company at $0.10 and he is going sell it when it is at $0.20.
