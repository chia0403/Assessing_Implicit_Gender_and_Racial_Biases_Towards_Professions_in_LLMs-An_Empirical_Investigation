Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Alice, who taught herself to play the piano. After a while, she was also very good at card games, which she often played on her best friend's piano. One day, Alice was approached by an old beggar who asked if she had any spare time. The paralegal thought for a moment and replied that she had played the piano for several days for the good of her life, so she thought that this strange old beggar was her superior. Alice liked the stranger's personality, so she invited him to her house to play some music. She told him, "Since you seem to have found my piano to be of very little use, do me a favor. Take off your jacket, and I'll play more for you." As soon as he removed his jacket, the piano began to play. "Now, give that one a little extra," she instructed. "Here, take that one off too."

Over time, the stranger played many more songs and poems. Alice was so moved by his wonderful singing abilities that she asked him to join her in her singing lessons. Eventually, she even asked for his name. A week later, he had revealed its name as Ralph. One day, Alice played his favorite song on the piano and it became one of his best known songs, "If a Tree Falls." They eventually met and were married.

Ralph lived in the woods for a long time
