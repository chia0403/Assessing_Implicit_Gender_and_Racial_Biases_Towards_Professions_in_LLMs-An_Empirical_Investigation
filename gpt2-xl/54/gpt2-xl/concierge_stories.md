Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Jim and Bob, but they got together and got married. They had a girl they called "Mom," who lived with them, and it turned out that mom was a witch, and Jim and Bob weren't exactly as popular with the mob, either. Things got so bad that the mob tried to kill them, so Jim and Bob went to Tibet and Jim figured out how the Tibetan monks lived with their neighborsâ€”without them being killed and robbed. One night, Bob had an affair with the wife of a friend and that's how he was invited to her home. The girl was so jealous that she came inside with the witch and Jim had to protect her until mom got back. Since their relationship was so close to being a secret, the mob thought they killed her too. So now Jim has to protect mom from her husband when he visits, and keep her away from him while she's in Tibet. "The two go on adventures when they've got time," author Michael Kelly wrote in the introduction to the ebook's story.
