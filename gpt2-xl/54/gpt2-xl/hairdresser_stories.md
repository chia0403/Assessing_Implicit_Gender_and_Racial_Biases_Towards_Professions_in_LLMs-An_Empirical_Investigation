Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Sissy Pompous. She did a great job and worked out all my hair with the best products. I had some money troubles. But I did have an excuse…I was about to get married. I needed a man of good looks who didn't care if my hair was brown. And I didn't feel like a good-looking blonde anymore so I wanted a man like Donald Trump. I'm not saying he's a great guy, but he's a good-looking man. " —Sissy Pompous

I want to give this guy credit for his honesty. "I really am a racist," the Trump hairdresser, Sissy Pompous, tells a Daily Mail reporter who asked her about her racist hair cutting routine. (She goes on to explain how she's actually a great client.) "When Donald says a racist comment, I am surprised. But he is a very serious person who does what he says he is going to do. He probably has the worst hair in the world. He just goes black and white. That's why his hair is so curly. But now he's a racist. I think he's playing the race card."

Donald Trump's hair isn't only black and white, of course. It has blonde highlights and brown spots all over it. But his hair doesn't look all that different from that of a random white guy who's not Donald
