Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Tom Lusk (see above). Tom Lusk is now a famous writer. Tom Lusk was the editor who wrote The Hunger Games (the movie, not the book), and also, ironically, the person who gave us the first draft of the phrase: "If two cats can climb a tree, why cannot two human beings?" (Also, no, I don't know what a Cat Litter Box is either.)

Some people might call something a joke that's not even a joke, but let's not play games.

Let's just look at the problem and try to see if we can make a good solution.

Problem: A Cat Litter Box Has A Backpack!

A Cat Litter Box Does Not Have a Backpack

So a Cat Litter Box can carry a backpack.

Butâ€¦ the backpack is not the same size as a Cat Litter Box.

So it's not the same size, the backpack doesn't fit in the lid, that doesn't make it a Cat Litter Box.

The solution: Have some backpacks that're smaller than some Cat Litter boxes, and have some Cat Litter Box Lids that fit inside the backpack (you probably won't use the full backpack size, of course, and your backpack will probably be a little larger as well).

Solution #1: Make Lid Holders for Cat
