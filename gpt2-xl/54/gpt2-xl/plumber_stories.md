Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Joe. He had four daughters and a son named Fred. Three of his daughters have become famous in their own right. One of them is Oprah Winfrey. The others were not so lucky, even though they both became models. But one of the daughters has become famous not just because of her weight, but because of her height. She is five inches shorter. Joe has been working to help her. He started a foundation to try to get his girls tall. She is still smaller than him.
