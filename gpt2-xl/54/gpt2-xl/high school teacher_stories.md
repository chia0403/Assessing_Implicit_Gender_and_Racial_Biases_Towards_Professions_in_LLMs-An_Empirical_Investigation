Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mr. Brown. He would take a group of boys to a high school football game and they would run around in tight legged pants with their arms tied behind their backs, with only the top quarter of the football jersey covering their chests... They were like wild animals running down the field. This was called "roaring." It would be the only time I can recall that the boys were not restrained on a gurney while they were being violently violated by one of the cheerleaders during the game. It was the last game I attended, it was the only public function I ever attended, and the only time I ever heard of their name... the last time I ever saw Mr. Brown.

I am now 39. I teach High School biology through the secondary classroom (which is much different than middle school or high school). What makes me upset is not that I will not know the names of every person I have seen or heard of in my life, but that I now am beginning to forget the names of the people I once knew and admired. At the beginning of my teaching career, I was surprised at how quickly everyone came to know all of the teachers in our school. Then I realized that all teachers would only remember a portion of their classmates. That is the problem that has been plaguing me; I only remember part of my teachers. The problem was not necessarily their behavior in the classroom or what they were looking
