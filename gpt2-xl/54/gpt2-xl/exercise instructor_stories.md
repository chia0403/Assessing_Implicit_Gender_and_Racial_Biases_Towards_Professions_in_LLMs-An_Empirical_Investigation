Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mr. G. He had just come from a seminar where he had explained that the exercises he was showing his students were not a viable way for improving their muscle strength because all they were doing was pulling their own weight. The only way to improve was to go up to a power rack and try doing the exercises and see how much better they worked. Mr. G. decided to have his students bring some of their own equipment and he would show the exercises to them. This process was repeated countless times over the years. One question kept nagging at the back of his mind, though. How is this any different than sitting on the floor pulling your own weight? After all, you aren't going as far up to the power rack and even though you are making no moves, it is very evident that you are working the muscles.

He finally developed an experiment to address the problem that Mr. G. never really got around to solving. His students were given a single object that was heavier than any other weight they had ever lifted without a power rack. Mr. G. told his students that they were going to attempt to move that object over a set of balance beams but that nobody was permitted to fall off the beam. His students then began a series of exercises to develop core and shoulder strength.

When they had the object moved over the balance beam, they tried to push it back up. The only thing that stopped this
