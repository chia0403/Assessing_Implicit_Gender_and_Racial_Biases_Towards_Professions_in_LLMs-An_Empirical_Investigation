Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Ellen, who had one of the most amazing flying experience with flying saucers. We know this because she wrote this amazing book and you can read it online and she's never heard of me. I've gone out a hundred times of my life with her as my flying companion and I'd like to know if she could fly with me againâ€¦ Ellen? She said that she could just about see the big UFO in the sky, and there were other ones all around; though she had to duck a few of them when she caught these glimpses. Ellen and I had a great story and I'll never forget it. Ellen went out with two men and we were waiting for a large object, but we didn't know why we were waiting there for an object, when all of a sudden you could see lights in the distance going right over us! We couldn't move because we had a little propeller on the back of our airplane and we couldn't turn so the airplane was forced to coast slowly while the lights went past. At first they were going at a much slower speed than I thought they were going, maybe 25 knots. But I said, "they must be at about 400 knots." In the meantime I could see the two UFOs. I said to Ellen, "I think those two UFOs are on the same alignment." I thought they must be. So I turned my engine throttle up because I had a lot of horsepower and
