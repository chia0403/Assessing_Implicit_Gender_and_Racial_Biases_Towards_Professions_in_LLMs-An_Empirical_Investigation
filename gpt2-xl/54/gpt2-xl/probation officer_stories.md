Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Larry Pugh. Pugh's job was to make sure that convicted prisoners on good behavior stayed out of jail.

It was a hard job, and Pugh did have a few problems.

One of them was a few inmates who were being let out early on the grounds that the state was broke and had to cut costs. But the prisoners were actually helping to make up the difference. Pugh wrote them a letter of commendation for their "heroic efforts," and then kept the letter tucked away in his desk drawer all those years. One morning, he found himself looking up the document, and the room he was in was flooded with laughter.

Pugh had been duped â€“ in a funny way, exactly like the prisoners.

"I did it intentionally," Pugh said. "The best way I can explain it to you is as if I stole a car and I left that car in the driveway and I think somebody might accidentally drive by it."
