Once upon a time, there was a logger named Harry who worked in a mine and lived in a cabin close to the cave.

That cabin was burned down, destroying Harry, but leaving behind a trail of magic that made him one of the oldest wizards alive. He was also a bit of a troublemaker. Just to be sure, Harry decided to ask Dumbledore to be his guardian, to keep him out of trouble that could threaten the world and Dumbledore's plans.

He then received a letter from Professor Dumbledore that took the life of everyone in the castle except for Lily Evans and James Potter, who both left Harry when he was in high school and didn't know he was a wizard until two years later.

Harry did have some luck with Lily though, and after they found Lily's dead body in her room, Harry learned from Dumbledore's notes that she had a child, James, by a man who was not James that she had a fling with. It was a one off, and only happened two months apart before he had to ask her to marry him in order to protect her son James's future. Harry also managed to find out that James inherited Lily's wand in order to be able to protect himself from Voldemort during The Battle of Hogwarts.
