Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. Tom Parker, who could turn a person into an elephant. But his methods didn't work on some of the creatures...or rather...the creatures didn't want to become an elephant. Now, Dr. Parker has been arrested for using his knowledge for nefarious purposes.


As the new president of the Universal Zoo Association, he must find a way to find The Elephant Man and reverse the effects of his experiments before it's too late. You can count on Dr. Parker trying to do the right thing no matter what the consequences.


It's a good thing Dr. Parker is a surgeon. His experiments often go astray, killing innocent people along the way.
