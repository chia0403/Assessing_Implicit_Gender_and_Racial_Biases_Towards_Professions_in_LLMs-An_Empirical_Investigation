Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Jack, who was hired by the ancient city of Umaron, who had a long and bloody conflict with the people of Akros. Jack was forced to dig his way toward the secret underground passages to the heart of Akros.

The old city of Umaron has been preserved since the time of the Titans, and the underground passages lie deep underground.

That's all for today! I hope you enjoyed these tales while it lasted.
