Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. Harold Shipman. He believed there was a biological basis for human empathy. As a result, he set out to test his theory with a series of experiments, and he did this by having a healthy, non-empathetic chimpanzee, named Harambe, perform an empathetic behavior that resembled human empathy.

Harambe was raised in a circus zoo by his trainer Dr. Gregorius Kopp. At first, Kopp had thought of Harambe as "a crazy ape," but then the trainer and Harambe began to develop a mutual relationship as they grew closer, eventually becoming very close. The relationship between the two eventually led to Harambe being placed in the primate sanctuary, where he became one to many "rescued chimps."

While interacting with humans, Harambe exhibited empathetic behavior like the ones Kopp had seen in his own primate studies. However, his human interaction was never quite as similar as when human researchers and animals experienced a shared experience of empathy.

He refused to accept the toy and began to play with the monkey on a different surface. He had trouble interacting with the monkey or his keeper as he was preoccupied with the animal in front of him.
