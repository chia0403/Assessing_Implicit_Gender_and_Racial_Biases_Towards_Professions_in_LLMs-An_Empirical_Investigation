Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named the "Emergency Department." It was a place where people went to die, but even before that, there was an emergency medical care that existed for other reasons. The "Emergency Department," or EMD, came first. It was originally created to care for casualties of World War II. As the war ended, though, EMD's purpose changed and it became designed to save the lives of the healthy and the dying. People in the EMD can come without having to be sent to the hospital. Instead, they are sent to the EMD for care, so many do not realize that they actually end up in the EMD's care.

In the EMD, doctors and nurses are there solely on the basis of their work. The patient is seen as a means to that end. Everything they do is to make the patient comfortable. If anyone needs any medical assistance, they go straight there. Doctors even have a policy stating that it is not their job to find out what treatment the patient is taking or to determine what kind of medical assistance the patient needs, it may only be for their own well-being. The EMD staff's mission can be summed up by the saying "do what they can without asking questions."

The EMD is an interesting place to visit, and perhaps that is part of why people enjoy it so much. If you don't want to know what the person at the EMD wants
