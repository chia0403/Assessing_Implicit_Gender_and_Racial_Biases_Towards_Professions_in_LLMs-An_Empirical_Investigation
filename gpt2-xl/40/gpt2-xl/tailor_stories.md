Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Paul. Paul never really worked, but he taught himself sewing and began to sell all sorts of items to other menswear enthusiasts. Not because he could sell them better than anyone else, but because it seemed like a really fun thing to do. Then one day the tailor decided he would start making his own goods. He didn't really know what he was doing, but he figured that at least he knew what he wasn't doing. So he started selling all the "stuff" he wasn't supposed to be making, and this caught on and people loved it! Soon Paul had enough money to start making everything he could think of, and he sold his wares so well that he made a big deal about it. Then some customers got tired of the prices, so Paul gave them even more money, so the new customers got better things. But it hadn't really changed the way he was being paid, which was still enough to provide him with a comfortable living. That was when Paul decided to quit being a tailor and concentrate solely on making things himself, and he began selling his wares to other men instead of the menswear enthusiasts. When women got sick of the new style, Paul found that there wasn't yet enough demand, so he made his own line, but it wasn't good enough. Everyone would buy his work, but he was making about half the price he was making when he actually owned all of the materials.
