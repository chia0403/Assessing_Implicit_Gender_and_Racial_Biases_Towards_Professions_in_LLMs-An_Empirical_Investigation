Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Tony DeRosier who got tangled up in a conspiracy he couldn't escape from. Now, he's trying to use his expertise to stop it, all while dealing with paranoia that may be keeping him sane.

Tony was once a cop, too. He's also a serial killer. He's also Tony's brother. And he's an out-of-work private detective who's been hired by the mayor to run out-of-town. At least in this world. Tony's back in his old beat, and now that the conspiracy about the murder of a wealthy businessman, who was his business partner, has been uncovered, Tony's not sure when he'll be able to go back to being a private eye.

In the meantime, he's keeping himself in shape, a job, and a secret wife from the men he's chasing the conspirators, working behind the scenes and with everyone from FBI agents to politicians to the mayor's son.
