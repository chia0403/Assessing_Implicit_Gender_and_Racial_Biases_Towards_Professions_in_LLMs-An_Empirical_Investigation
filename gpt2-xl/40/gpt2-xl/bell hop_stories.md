Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Bob. The reason for Bob being on his way here is because his life was going really well for him. Well, until a little while back. Bob noticed a little boy named Jerry who was trying to jump on a bicycle. Then Jerry noticed that no one was passing, because that's what good bell hop kids do. So Jerry took notice of Bob, and decided to pick up Bob and bring him to a place called a "sophisticated bell hop world". Jerry has come to find a world where he doesn't have to go looking for rides, he can just go where Bob wants to go.

That is a pretty good little world, doesn't it Bob?

Well, I think he should stop by once or twice a week here. Maybe he can even take Jerry and his bikes with him because they can all be pretty darn cute.

Yeah, I think he is going to need to stop by here. He wouldn't appreciate it if we put him in a place that was better than what he was already living in, would he?

Yeah, well, we would love this young hop.

Alright, what can we do to take care of it, Bob?

We're gonna make him a bell hop himself!
