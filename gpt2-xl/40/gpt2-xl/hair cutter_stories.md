Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Frank 'Big Daddy' Wilson. He had a very short temper and one day he had someone cut his locks. Big Daddy couldn't believe what was going to happen when it came time to take the scissors to him. He just couldn't believe that his man would be so mean. That's when Frank turned his anger and rage into action. On this day he went after a guy he knew wouldn't hurt him, but who had done what Big Daddy wanted! I call this "The Big Daddy Mane."
