Once upon a time, there was a logger named Paul Denton on the Eastern Seaboard. As he was sitting in his log cabin, looking out at a small bay dotted by tall trees, a strange incident occurred. A great, black ship was passing. Paul Denton could tell he was not looking at the harbor. The ship did not seem to be moving through the water. It just stood to one side, floating motionless. One second it was gone; the next second it was there. Finally, it had come ashore. Paul Denton looked out the window and saw the ship, moving. It was about the size of a fishing boat. At one end it had a tall mast, which reached nearly to the water's surface. The side of the ship facing him was the forward end. At the other end it had four smaller masts facing up, each with a narrow spar. It was quite obviously sailing and moving through the water. Paul Denton watched from the boat with an almost childlike wonder, as the ship slowly approached his cabin from the side. He looked across the bay to the ship and saw that it was still there the next second, even as the boat he now sat on suddenly sank. That night he dreamed of being in a boat. This was some time ago, in the early 1980s. For all I know, it could have happened before and is being repeated now as we speak. As I told a former classmate of mine about Denton
