Once upon a time, there was a painter named Bob Ross. At least I heard that, I don't know exactly what his name is. He probably had a pretty good life, too. He had a home, and he was a good husband (his wife said so). He was very happy, he had a dog.

He became an overnight viral sensation and his life turned upside down. Because you see, he painted in a different style. It looked kinda messy and messy, and he didn't have a dog. He had a friend, though, who brought him a dog when they got around to painting together.

So they had a dog.

So they sat down, and started painting together. Just like you and I do. In fact, they did it the same way.

But they started having fun painting together â€” and the more they worked together, the better they got. And they started painting more things together.

And as their style changed, they started painting better things. Soon you've got the whole apartment covered, you make friends, you go for walks (with Bob Ross' dog). They started hanging out by a pool and they started drinking and dancing at barbecues in the country.

Meanwhile, the house fell on them, and they had to move.

Bob Ross didn't stop. He wasn't content with just painting with this one partner so that he could be together with a dog.
