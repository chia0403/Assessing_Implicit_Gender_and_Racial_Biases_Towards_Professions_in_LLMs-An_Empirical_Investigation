Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Kate. She knew how to make skirts fit the women she made them for. One day she was showing her new creations to a visitor and the visitor exclaimed, "Why do you have so many skirts that fit perfectly?" Kate replied that she did not.

A local priest told a friend of his who was a merchant that "you should try to sell my dresses." The merchant replied "It is a joke. My dresses are perfectly fitted." His friend laughed and walked away.

The next day, the merchant was busy with his business with his customer. But when he got to the shop, he walked up to the dressmaker and said, "Did you make my dress?"

"Yes," she replied, "but mine are so short that you could buy one of them and not fit it."

The merchant was surprised but quickly got back to work. Then his customer called to him, "Would you mind making me a dress of your patterns for tomorrow?"

The merchant was surprised and asked, "Why make yesterday's suit of clothes fit for to-day's suit?"

"I couldn't make them last into the morning," the customer responded

"Well then, they'll be too loose," said the merchant

So they made her a wedding gown with a low neck and flared skirt.

Next the merchant and the bridegroom went to the tailor.
