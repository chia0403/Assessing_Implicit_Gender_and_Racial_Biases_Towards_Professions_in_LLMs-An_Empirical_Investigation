Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Joe Hutt. At an age when most gentlemen of the same age would be in his 90s and dying, he was still going strong; but then an adventure started to happen, which changed everything.
Hutt got caught by the FBI and prosecuted for conspiracy, making him have to face up to the consequences of his crimes against the American public. At his trial he was questioned by two government agents and they asked, "Mr. Hutt, how much money did you make on the drug sales?"
"No," replied Hutt, "I was never paid a penny. Not one dime."
"The government would pay you," one of the agents asked. "Sure," replied the other. "It took them a long time to get that money out of my account. Why go to all that trouble if you were never going to get the money?"
