Once upon a time, there was a executive named Donald Trump, whom nobody even wanted to hire because he was such a jerk. Then he was elected, and people started thinking about how not to do all the things he said he was going to do. Some of those things were stupid, and others weren't. I know they had many things in common. They mostly had to do with people.

Like how to get a project off the ground is very hard, and the people on the project often have no clue what is really happening, that even the people who seem important are actually just doing most of the key work. Donald is pretty close to doing those things. He seems to understand the relationship between people and projects. People and projects usually get together because they have something in common, a project, some product, or a customer. Donald seems to realize all this, and he seems very good on these projects.

He seems to be able to manage people and his teams. Donald appears not to be an idiot. I can't imagine any number of people with a high IQ who would be in a position of such enormous power. Donald really seems to know how to use it, and that is what people love about him.

You can tell how difficult a situation is by how difficult it is to reach Donald Trump. He is constantly in a state of extreme anger, but he always seems to get back to work when he thinks he has been hurt by it.
