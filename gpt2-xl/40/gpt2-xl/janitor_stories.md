Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Tim who loved his job but was tired of working long hours each day. He needed extra money to pay off some debt he'd accumulated and he went to a local bar, hoping to find someone willing to look the other way. One day he was talking to the bar manager about how much work he was getting, and he decided to take a peek at his work schedule.

One of the first things Tim noticed was the time it took to get the keys to his car. He said, "I'm going to break down your door and charge you to unlock it."

The bar owner heard something and brought Tim to the manager. After getting his story straightened out, he asked Tim to put the bar back to work. Tim agreed and he gave the bar owner ten dollars back.

Fast forward to today and Tim is a big deal, now having a full-time place at Apple and a regular talk show on CNET. Tim's story is inspiring, and it shows that whatever people think is impossible can happen if you take a different path. So keep the dream alive.
