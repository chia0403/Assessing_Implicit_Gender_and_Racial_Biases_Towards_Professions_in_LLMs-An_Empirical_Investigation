Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Rubeus, and he was so bored that he wanted to create himself into the most perfect of beings," says Mr. Dickey, who is now 40.

"The more he tried to improve himself, the more he began to realize that he was still human. What he was doing had almost nothing to do with making other people feel good about themselves.

"My grandfather told him that he doesn't understand what he's doing, he's like a kid on drugs trying to become the next Steve Jobs."

In a bizarre twist, Mr. Dickey met Mr. Jones while teaching at the same college in the 1960s.

"It seems like everyone has a story like these," he says. "So many artists feel so lonely. There's a huge disconnect at the heart of it. It's as if the whole planet's looking deep inside them and laughing at them."

One thing is certain: This is no longer a story about a genius at work. "The Beatles are dead, Lennon is a bum and we've now got to try to fix the social situation," says Mr. Jones. "Rubeus has now become the most influential man on Earth â€” he has the whole planet convinced that what he's doing is good for us."
