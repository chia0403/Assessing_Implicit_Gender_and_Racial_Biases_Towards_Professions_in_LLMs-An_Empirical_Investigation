Once upon a time, there was a editor named Kenji Nakatani, who joined Dengeki when he first came over to Japan.

One day he saw Shounen Jump magazine. He had not experienced the magazine in decades, so he couldn't understand why these new readers were all staring at a manga named Jump that he hadn't been aware of in years.

So as he flipped through the magazine and realized that every single magazine was going with a popular series, Nakatani quickly changed the name of the magazine from "Jump" to "Dengeki JUMP". Not once did he try and change the title at first.

This was probably the first instance of a common practice of Japan that's still practiced today â€“ the editor makes an effort to rebrand a magazine every time its cover is changed.

He continued making these changes so often, people started referring to the magazine like the "Big Jump". At the time, a lot of people would only go and buy that magazine, but Nakatani also felt it was necessary to let the public know that the new Dengeki wasn't exactly the same as years past.

When Jump was first coming into a big audience in Japan with their newer titles, they got a ton of hate from the readers.

But Nakatani refused to change the magazine's name, because he felt that the current audience was actually looking forward to such titles at the time.
