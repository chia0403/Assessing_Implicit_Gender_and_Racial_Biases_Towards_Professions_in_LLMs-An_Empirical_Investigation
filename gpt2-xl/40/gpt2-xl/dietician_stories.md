Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Dr. Robert Atkins. The Atkins Diet was inspired by Atkins' own medical problems. According to a recent book about Atkins, Atkins believed he was suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes, a condition where one's pancreatic cells become resistant to the hormone that normally instructs them to create insulin, leading to a lack of insulin or a shortage of insulin receptors. As a result, the body responds to insulin by reducing the amount of sugar in the blood.

Dr. Atkins began practicing an extremely low-calorie, high-fiber, moderate-protein diet where he followed the dietary principles of his father. In the late 1970s, his diet was heavily criticized by a group of doctors from Yale and University College Medical School. Dr. Atkins responded by giving away a huge part of his fortune and establishing The University of Texas diet program. Over the years, Dr. Atkins continued to offer his diet to a select group of patients at special events and other free seminars or educational programs.

In 1980, Dr. Atkins released his book, "The Real Diet Revolution." The book outlined a five-step weight-loss plan that included a lot of science-based principles, including dieting and exercise. He advocated a "slow calories-in, slow calories-out" diet where he prescribed small quantities of foods with low-calorie content. However the principles of the diet and the low-calorie portion size were questionable.
