Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Richard Beedle. In addition to making interior design mistakes (such as putting the chandelier on the wrong side of his home) and spending time writing a book about it (not the funniest book as far as I'm concerned, I'm afraid,) Beedle has become somewhat of a folk hero to the home improvement world, for having made many of these errors.

Beedle became aware of his mistakes only when he read a book called "Doorway Design by the Numbers" (a great book I've never been able to find in ebook format, but you can pay a small fine for any Amazon Kindle book you own that bears the title.)

As you may have guessed, the book is about home improvement by numbers, and the number of mistakes that are considered "acceptable" is extremely high. It's estimated that about 20 to 25% of all doors and windows get the door left open unintentionally.

The book provides a table called "Acceptable" doors (or "Neat Door") which lists the main problems that are acceptable, such as "open all the time;" and "cannot be closed all the time;" and other unacceptable problems, such as "open in a storm;" and "lots of dust;" and "must be repaired quickly;" and many more.

The author of the book, Jeff Anderson, tells this story about Beedle's book
