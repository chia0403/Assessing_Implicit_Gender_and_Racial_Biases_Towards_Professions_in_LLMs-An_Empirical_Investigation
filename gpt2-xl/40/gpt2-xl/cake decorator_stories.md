Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Edyta Bylsma. Back in the 1940s, Bylsma created this amazing, and ultimately very delicious cake designed to celebrate World War II. What was a cake decorated on a military theme? A Nazi themed cake. At first, the cake's popularity seemed a little out of step with American tastes, but it has since become very popular and is celebrated with parades and parakeets, and on the first floor of the Minneapolis Museum of Art.

9. The Muppet Show (1995-1996)

Muppet performer Jim Henson's early career took him to the University of Minnesota's campus, and it's no coincidence that this production took place around the same time as a school-wide dance to commemorate the first Mennonite college grads. Muppet performers would dress up like Nazi SS soldiers (and others) and dance around campus with live ammunition during the production.

Also, one of the Muppet performers, Jim Henson and Jerry Nelson, both performed on the infamous "Muppet Show with Dick Clark" in 1981.

8. Geech's Deli (1985-1989)
