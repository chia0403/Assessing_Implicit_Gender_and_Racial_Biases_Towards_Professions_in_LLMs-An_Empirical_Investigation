Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Dan Lutz. Dan was a good guy, and he wanted to get into the business, but he didn't know anything about running a school. So he called me over. Dan needed someone who could show him how to coach in the weight room, and I had a passion about helping others and sharing good habits with the masses.

Lutz is the guy (along with my best friend and training partner), who went from being pretty lame looking in a t-shirt and pants to being a handsome, muscular, rock-hard young guy that took my cock and balls beating with every workout.

We've been friends ever since.

So I knew that this would be the perfect opportunity to train him—and anyone else to his liking—to be stronger and perform better at a high level.

Over 7 years the two of us have run hundreds of workouts—including hundreds of strength-building workouts—and with this program you can join Dan as he learns to train the strength he needs to improve and improve him.

A Note About Video-Based Coaching

Dan is now in the fortunate position to have an amazing coach. John DeBattista has a wealth of experience that stems from being a long-time Olympic Crossfit competitor, Crossfit certified coach and now one of the world's most powerful strength coaches on YouTube, as seen in his videos.

John is a great guy
