Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Ben Bradlee. In the winter of 1954, while on a trip to Florida, he became aware of an incredible story. A writer named Jack Anderson had been hired by the CIA to investigate the Kennedy/Castro "Missile Crisis." Among Anderson's finds was a secret memo written by the CIA to a Defense Department official called Henry Cabot Lodge. The memo claimed the U-2 spy plane was used to spy on Soviet missile sites around the world. To keep the secret from the public, the memo said, a top-secret U-2 mission was to be flown over the Soviet Union, where the plane would "disappear." This would be the first U.S. plane to spy on the Soviet Union. This was not a new revelation: the CIA had been doing it since the middle of World War II. But what made this particular mission stand out was that the plane itself hadn't disappeared. Instead, the CIA had used the craft to spy on the Soviet Union, in a cover story that was still secret.


The memo went on to reveal that "The U-2 is really a special project – no one's ever seen it in the open. It would be ideal for intelligence purposes in the event of a confrontation with the Soviet Union. It can be used for almost anything. This means it could be used on a target that would be easily detected – a Soviet weapon site, a new plant being constructed
