Once upon a time, there was a chef named John Besh, and John was just like any other busy chef, serving up dishes from his kitchen in a restaurant called John's Place.

And John loved his food as much as he loved serving it. He also loved playing the piano, and singing. And dancing. And he was just a fun, full, creative guy. I'm not sure what was wrong with him, but he just turned into this tragic figure.

In fact, a lot of my favorite restaurant writers have had terrible jobs.

I've always used words like "hanging out with friends" and "staying in the moment." I've always been more of an introvert at work.

I'm guessing that when John was in the kitchen, he saw the humor of everyone. There's a sense of levity in the workplace where you see how the work affects all of the people around it.

It's like a playground where everyone's out there having fun.

And that means that your coworkers know when you're having fun, and that's why they're willing to come to you for more help later on. Because if they hadn't, one of them would have turned into John Besh.

And the same thing happens to everyone in the restaurant. John Besh is right there, doing his best to keep up with all of the other chaos.

John's Place was John Besh.
