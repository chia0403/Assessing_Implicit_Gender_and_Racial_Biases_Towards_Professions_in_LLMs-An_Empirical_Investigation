Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Dr. Charles Reid, now retired, who was invited to a conference in Washington, D.C., to present on the topic. He was there with his young assistant Dr. James E. Conteh and a researcher named Bruce M. McCance, whose job was to recruit "people that could testify in court to show that defendant Lillian DeCosey had a psychological disorder, which was a mental disorder of the mind."

When the psychologist went to present his findings after one of the conferences, there was a lot of shouting and some disagreement between the two of them, with Judge M.C. Stokes taking particular exception to the psychologist's recommendation, which consisted of psychotherapy. Stokes had been a lawyer himself but had never treated a criminal, so he wasn't familiar with the standard of care. He believed that someone who wanted therapy should be able to access it and, when so inclined, accept it.

As the psychologist said his case, no one from the prosecution team interrupted his arguments, not even the judge. Instead, they seemed interested only in pushing him and the conference organizer back toward their cars. Afterward, an investigator from the prosecution team contacted him to say that he believed that Dr. Reid's suggestions of psychotherapy were too aggressive. In fact, he recommended Dr. Conteh. That would help his client a lot, he said, and would be a more effective argument
