Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Lisa.

In the early 90's she was teaching herself how to build Windows applications from scratch. In 1996, she published a textbook on developing basic applications for Windows. One page was a table summarizing her methods, on the left:

We all thought she was a genius.

Lisa's lessons seemed like the perfect foundation upon which to build a business. After all, why spend all this time learning how to program a computer without understanding how to do something as basic as getting a massage? Plus, she was selling "Sprint" sessions â€“ two hour sessions to get you off your butt so you can start creating the next big thing.

Then, Lisa decided to put out an advertising blurb for a new book she was writing. Unfortunately, the blurb she gave away on the Internet for free had a typo in the cover art. Her first book, the Windows for Business Cookbook, contained an illustration of an attractive woman with a thick neck, which made us all think: "Lisa, there's a fat lady on the cover, isn't there?"

But Lisa was a genius!

She was too smart to use that "fat lady" mistake. Instead, she went ahead and sold the wrong book: the one with the incorrect illustration. Then, she fixed the mistake with a new design, and then fixed the second mistake for the reprint of the book and the new cover.
