Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Jane. Now she is a ghost from that era who haunts a remote mansion in the suburbs of the French Riviera. With her were three ghostly kids, a housekeeper named Rose, and a ghostly cat named Sully. It is Jane's job to make sure there is no accident - not even a break-in and not even a prank call from a neighbor. The kids want nothing more than to be just like her father and her uncle Frank, but they just can't seem to catch a break. In the meantime, Rose has her own troubles: she is pregnant once again. Sully has a secret that he only trusts with a few friends - a secret that has the power to destroy both children and the people closest to them. And the cat is determined to save everyone, even if he first must kill Jane. Written by Aline Ritz <alle.ritz@durham.ac.uk>
