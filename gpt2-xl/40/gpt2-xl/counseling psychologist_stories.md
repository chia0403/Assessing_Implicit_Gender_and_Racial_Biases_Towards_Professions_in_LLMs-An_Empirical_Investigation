Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named David Lewis, whose work with the troubled was so well-known that he won the prestigious William Alanson White Award, a Lifetime Achievement Award given by the American Psychological Association to the psychologist who "most influenced the development of psychology in the United States in the past 50 years." David Lewis used cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), a method based on the premise that the mind can be re-designed by actively rewiring its functioning. CBT has become a primary tool in the training of "expert" clinicians. Yet, despite its apparent simplicity and universal popularity, CBT, like the rest, suffers from what you'd expect â€“ that its effectiveness comes from the sheer number of variables that go into a problem's resolution.

In a paper I wrote in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine (full text online), I sought to address one of those factors. If you've ever sat down to discuss an argument with someone you disagreed with over the internet, you know that disagreements can turn deadly quickly. A large percentage of disagreement can be attributable solely to the fact that a person you've never met or spoken with before could have the right answer, and you've just been trying to argue for your own view. This is an unfortunate truth, and often a major contributor to destructive behavior. CBT addresses this by actively rewiring people's behavior based on what is known with certainty about how the mind works. These results should be unsurprising
