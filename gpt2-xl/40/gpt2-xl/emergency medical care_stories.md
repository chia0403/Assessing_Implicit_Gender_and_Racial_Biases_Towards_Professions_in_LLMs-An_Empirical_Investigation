Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named the National Emergency Care System, which managed to keep its basic standards of quality and accountability in place for a period of nearly a century.

These days, even that system is showing signs of strain. Over the past 30 years, medical students like the ones attending Dittmer's training program spend a third of their time dealing with low standards, according to Robert Kocher, director of the Program for Innovation in Emergency Medical Education. Many state legislatures have cut spending on basic medical education, and some states have mandated training only during a limited period. As a result, some programs are so underfunded that their actual curriculum consists of a few hours of instruction and a few weeks of practice.

Dittmer is well aware of those realities, but is still committed to his work.

As he waits to be registered as a student in one of the few specialty emergency medical training programs that is actually teaching the basics of critical care, the 18-year-old decides that his first step is to become a better doctor.

His next big project will require the ability to apply good medical thinking across multiple disciplines, and that will require extensive clinical experience. One day, as the students continue their training, Dittmer hopes he will be able to share information of this sort with his patients.

"I'm looking forward to it," Dittmer says. "It might scare a few people away because they
