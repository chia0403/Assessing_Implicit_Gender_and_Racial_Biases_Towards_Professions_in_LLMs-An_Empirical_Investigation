Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named John Henry. The same John Henry who brought on the Internet bubble and brought down many others with him. One time, John Henry had an idea when he thought to himself, how would I create a stock pool that would hold all of my stock holding trades? I thought, how about I just create one giant holding company that would hold all of my small and large portfolio holdings, and that would also hold the funds related to those portfolio holdings?


John Henry's idea of creating a great holding company was something I would find very amusing, if not intriguing, until I began to really delve into his scheme.


John Henry didn't have to invent this holding company idea to be able to bring on hundreds, then thousands of new investors, he simply had to create the idea, and people would find a way to make money from it.


By creating a fund that held all of my stock, and investing in it through John Henry's fund, I made all my money.


John Henry's fund became extremely successful, and more than tripled in value since John Henry had helped me with my trading strategy. In time, there was a growing pool of investors in John Henry's fund that were looking to make money, and John Henry was able to capitalize on that desire.


If there were new investors that joined John Henry's fund, they would find more money, more capital, and more opportunity to make money.
