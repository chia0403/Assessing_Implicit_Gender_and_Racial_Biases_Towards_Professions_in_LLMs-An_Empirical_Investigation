Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Sally who worked for an eccentric, wealthy family who ran this property. Her husband was an old friend of the family, so at least that's what her job was, although there was a great deal of suspicion about how she did her job. The only way to see Sally if she was home was to sneak in through a hole that could only be seen through a window and then leave quietly. That hole was a secret, hidden in the living room of the house until after the front door had been broken into twice. But then, the first burglary was caught in plain view to several people with cameras, and the second burglary was caught in plain view to a whole different set of people, including a camera. And then, it was found that Sally's father was an attorney for this family, and her mother was a maid for their children, who was really working away from home that day to keep them out of school and get them ready for their first few years of college. And then the whole time, Sally had been coming in on time every morning, not even a minute too soon for no good reason, she was working for them. And then, the last burglary happened two weeks before the rest of the photos were discovered in this house, and it seemed that this housekeeper's brother, who had a few photographs of his wife and his girlfriend, had the most expensive camera available, and he kept it on the floor of his bathroom
