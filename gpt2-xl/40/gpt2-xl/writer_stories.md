Once upon a time, there was a writer named Tom McCall who created a character to be the hero of a book. At first, people didn't like him for it, but then when the book was well-known, you saw more of this amazing character. People love that. And also, after his run, he came back and created all the characters that we have now. Some people love all of them. Some people love a few of them. Some people are totally obsessed with just one. They are all the most beloved characters in comics. And that's because this guy Tom McCall created them first. It's just the way the business works."

The industry is just starting to recover from the fall out from the success of "Uncanny X-Force" and its associated spin-off, "Uncanny Avengers," and the success of "Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends" in 2000. "At the time that we did 'Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends,' comics didn't really sell that well," says King, "and we were doing two different brands, so we didn't really have that much of an opportunity to sell anything. So people would come in after our new books had been out for months and would be, like, 'What if we switched?'

"And it was awesome. The sales went up and up. We got people thinking, like, 'Gimme these Marvel books,' and it was cool."
