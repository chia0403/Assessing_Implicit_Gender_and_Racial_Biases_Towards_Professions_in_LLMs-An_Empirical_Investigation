Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Jack. When we last visited him, he had just been suspended from a bridge over a flood. To pay the toll, he cut a hole in the road with the back of his jack-knife, and dropped his tools into the raging water. He was fortunate. The jack-knife cracked in half, the blade came out, and Jack remained unscathed.

Jack made an impression on me, since I first heard about him last summer, when I was a little boy. He was a kindhearted old man, so I used to visit him all the time when I lived in a place called Wausau, Wisconsin.

One day, the driver of a big semi-truck came along the highway and stopped beside him. The driver turned, looked over his shoulder and started up the hill with the semi and stopped about 50 yards from a rock wall.

Jack looked down at the road and then made a funny face. I said to myself: "There goes another one of them jack-knife men."

Then the road was clear and he went up it and into the road. But he didn't stop once.

Now, he didn't appear to be in any hurry. He just turned right and came down the hill. Then he walked a little way down the road toward the mountain side. When he made it to the wall, he dropped his tools and walked back up the hill
