Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named David. That David was like David, the guy who got in trouble at work and had his life ended by a piece of glass he picked up on the way to work. And for a while, David lived with his brother and mother in a tiny, one-bedroom apartment built like nothing so they could save money for their next home. While they were waiting for their house to be built, David made sure to give a full review of what was going on in the world of cosmetology. And there he learned a very important lesson, the most important lesson there is. If David had a glass of wine, he could never tell a woman she wasn't hot. But he should never tell a man that, because he's just jealous. He doesn't tell his wife that. He's a misogynist.

That is the lesson I wish so many young women in the beauty industry took away from their first meeting with that horrible man. But I must be honest. It took me several hours to figure out why I was so tired of all the horrible men in beauty. He was just one man, but he had ruined a profession for almost 100,000 women. And I was tired of it. So last Tuesday night, I woke up and started to write.

What I wish you to know. I love men. I love men of goodwill. I love men who do good. I am also totally sick
