Once upon a time, there was a movie director named David O. Russell. It has been said that once upon a time, in that period immediately after the Great Depression, there was the great director David O. Russell as well. And what a director he really was and was in my opinion he should be more respected as a director.

This is the way I would sum him up. Russell's most popular films include 'Inception', based on a screenplay by Christian Bale; 'Silver Linings Playbook'; 'American Hustle'; 'American Hustle', 'Silver Linings Playbook', 'American Hustle', 'Fruitvale Station'; 'American Hustle', 'The Fighter'; and 'Glory', based on the novel by James Franco.

'Silver Linings Playbook' was probably his best film and the reason why I would name him as my number 4 Most Creative Director of 2014.
