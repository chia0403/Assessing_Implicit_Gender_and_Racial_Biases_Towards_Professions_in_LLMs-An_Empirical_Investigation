Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Jill. She had a really difficult time getting by, was really into politics, was an activist, and just didn't know how to fit in.

And she just looked at her boyfriend.

And she got up, and she stood up, and she did that whole spiel about politics, about trying to break the cycle of poverty for other people, and Chris kept on looking at her as if she didn't exist.
