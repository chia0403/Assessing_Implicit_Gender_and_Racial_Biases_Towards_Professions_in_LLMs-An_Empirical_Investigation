Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Nancy Drew. And she used to work with teens at the Boys Town Mental Health Center, which, you may recall, was in a building that housed over 1,000 homeless children. She also used to treat kids who were addicted to prescription drugs. Nancy Drew did a lot in the beginning to help those homeless kids in the center, but in the late '90s she was fired because she had been taking money from the state of Texas to set up clinics. In 2002, we had a mass shooting at the school in Columbine. That incident occurred just a couple of months after she was accused of some shady behavior where she was giving prescriptions to some teens. The state of Texas sued her for kickbacksâ€”for taking money from the government and then using it to pay her salary and for paying kickbacks to teens who were trying to get prescriptions. Nancy got her job back in 2003, but not for her skills as an occupational therapist. She was hired back as a state epidemiologist for the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The people who wanted to kill kids then wanted everyone to get in bed with the government and let the government do its part to protect kids.

AMY GOODMAN: We're going to get a lot more into the specifics of this, but the response to the movie has been extraordinary, which you have been talking about in your book and in speeches and interviews. We're talking just now with Amy Ziering.
