Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Ron.

This was a long time ago, long before the Internet.

Ron was in his office.

After waiting twenty minutes, Mr. Ronald finally came to the door. Ron opened it, and there stood, in the hallway, a man. This man was a probation officer, a good one, a good man who had the benefit of experience, a few months earlier, in the courtroom where he had just sentenced an innocent man. There was no mistaking that man's identity. He wore the uniform Ron had seen in the media, a dark suit, dark tie (he was the only one in the room who wore that suit), and a gold watch on his left wrist. He had a black briefcase on his left hand. And this man's expression, so relaxed as if ready to return home after a long day at work, was now one of resignation. His eyes were dull, his expression a little tired and sad.

"Hello, sir," says the probation officer to the man who had just come from the courtroom.

"Mr. Ronald K. Clark, I'm sorry. But I don't believe you're authorized to speak to me."

Ron stood up. "Are you sure?"

"Well, no. I'm certain I'm authorized to speak to you, but I'm not absolutely certain why." The man held out his hand.
