Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Tim Duncan, known to all as Tim. There once was a Tim Duncan, who was known as a player who could play with the worst of them.

And then there was Tim Duncan: the man who, as he neared the end of his 21st NBA season, was as old and, even more, as weary as a 39-year-old man can be.

"It's like it's always raining, always freezing, it's bad weather, especially at this time of year," he said through his agent shortly before Game 4 of the Western Conference finals.

Tim Duncan is only one person, but he is a giant in this part of the NBA universe. One of those transcendent superstars that make the game better. One of these men who makes the fans' lives better.

But Tim Duncan is also a man who is beginning to fade, who has been so revered this many years that, to see him in person, he seems both too old and too tired to last a game -- particularly if you are a fan, or even a neutral observer, who sees things that way already.

As you might guess, the situation has become increasingly dire. The Spurs have slipped to fourth place, two wins from elimination.

So far this postseason, the last time they met in the Western Conference finals, they squandered a 3-0 lead and lost Game 6 in overtime
