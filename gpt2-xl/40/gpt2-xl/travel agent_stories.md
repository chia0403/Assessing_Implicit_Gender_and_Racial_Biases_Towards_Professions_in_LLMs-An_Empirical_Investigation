Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named "Kitty Hawk." She claimed to have traveled all over the United States, Europe and across the globe. "I was an expert on every type of travel imaginable," Catskills Traveler magazine said in a 2011 article. "From exotic cities to quiet country towns, to the best family vacation rental homes on the beach and more."

The cat's owner, Karen, said the cat was traveling with her at the time of her death. The coroner determined she died of natural causes.
