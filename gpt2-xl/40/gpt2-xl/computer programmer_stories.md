Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Jim. (As far as I know, he is an actual person with a real name, which is why I'm using this fictional persona here, but then again, so are all of Jim's fictional counterparts.) One day Jim got a little too lazy to finish coding up his project, and set it aside. A few months later, Jim got back to the computer after a long day, and checked his email.

This was the email: "Hey [name redacted], just wanted to drop you a quick note to say sorry for my late-day email, I wanted to see how you were doing, I know when you sent that early morning email, I've been on the phone with my parents, I was just checking in. Sorry about this and have a great day. This was actually kind of fun."

So that's when Jim had an idea, and put his project up for sale on eBay, but not for the highest bid. He sold it for $4,200.00. So, why did Jim sell it on eBay? One of the rules of eBay is that it charges buyers a 20% selling commission on any payment due within 14 days of the auction. At the end of the day in 2001, Jim had received about $4,200.00 in winnings, but the cost of the auction, the commission, and finally the shipping and handling added up to $1,320.
