Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Tom McCall. He met his longtime girlfriend at his bar, the Blue Frog, in Boston. They married, went to the prom, and then moved to California. They lived in a big house in Santa Barbara, where there was never anyone in the place but them three. One time, they ran out of wine and ran home. Another time they were in the backyard when some wild thing tried to kill him. Tom McCall was born in 1944 and he died of a heart attack at 64 in 2009. He and his wife died within a year of each other and there was no money for a funeral.


Sandy: Did you come up with your name Sandy when you were 18 or did you create it later?


Tom: I created it.


Sandy: You must have had lots of different guys name it after you.


Tom: Yeah, I did; I gave them their nicknames. This one was "Kiki" and this guy, Kip, who did the drums at the beginning. He was the first one that I wanted to call me Sandy. But Kiki had two children and her daughter said "Kiki's just a funny name. That's not a funny name. If any of those kids read this and call me Kiki, I don't give a damn." I did, and now the kids know that I am Kiki and they call me Sandy.
