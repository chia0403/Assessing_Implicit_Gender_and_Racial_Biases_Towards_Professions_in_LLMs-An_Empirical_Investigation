Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Charles Dookan. He is, with few exceptions, the only toothless human that I know.

Well not only in the world of the comic books, but in reality.

I'm glad I've included a picture of his name in this blog, don't get me wrong.

The fact that I've known that Dookan had a tooth (and his wisdom tooth) for so long, only fueled my curiosity about the subject in the back of my head. I started making phone calls to friends, my local dentist, and anyone else I could find. Eventually I found just about everybody I could think of, and then some, and I got even more lucky with some of the amazing people that were gracious enough to allow me to film and interview them. As you can see from these little clips, I didn't need to ask for permission or pay too big of a fee, it would be amazing if I had tried.
