Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Sam McBride that lived in a beautiful home on a hill. There was a lot of people moving in the block, and the house was getting a bit crowded between the new neighbor and Sam's old co-workers. Sam needed a small place of his own, so he asked the neighbors if he could build them a small shed. The neighbors of course accepted that offer. Sam built the shed on a lot of unused corner land, and named it Hoe House with several plans for it. He gave it to the families, and later they built cabins next door and named them Sam's Lassie's House and Joe's Cabin. As time went on, some of the cabins got larger, and they began to get more elaborate. The larger and better, the more of a mess they got. Sam built these cabins with a big flat plank of hardwood to support them, a plank of cedar wood for the roof, and a large piece of stained glass for the window frames with curtains made of the old cedar boards that Sam had found.

While Sam worked to make each of these cabins great, there was a little problem with his neighbor Joe's cabin. This cabin's roof was too high for him to get inside it, so one day Sam went in to see what he could do about it. He cut off the entire roof, put a plank of hardwood on top to support it,
