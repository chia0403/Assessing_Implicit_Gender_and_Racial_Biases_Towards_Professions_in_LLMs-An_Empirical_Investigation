Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Steven Laurence who published an authoritative and highly influential volume titled "The Nature of the Human Mind." Laurence taught that, for the majority of the human species, our thoughts are a blank slate upon which the unconscious mind can run wild.

He argued that at a time when social attitudes still tended to favor conformity, this philosophy of thought gave young people license and an opportunity to pursue the kinds of thoughts and emotional impulses they wanted. His work was based on insights gained in the 1960's research of Sigmund Freud, who found people who were often more expressive and sensitive and prone to creative behavior at a young age.

Over a decades time, this led to a vast new area of psychology, called neuro-linguistics which began to explore and explain how the unconscious mind actually operates. These new ways of looking at human behavior were often very different than those of the 19th century. And the most remarkable development was the discovery of the unconscious mind, which is not limited to the unconscious mind of our ancestors but also runs rampant in our modern environments â€“ the modern unconscious.

The modern unconscious is a place where we unconsciously choose what we want to eat, what our hobbies are, what we read and watch and listen to; the modern unconscious also affects our everyday thoughts and emotions such as anger, frustration and depression. And the very tools we use to control our behaviors are still shaped by our unconscious minds.
