Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Sam who was called upon to repair the car that was being used by the protagonist of the game. His name was used in a radio advertisement for the game, as well as in the manual that came with Sega's first home console, the Genesis.[4][5][6]

This game and the radio ad seem to be an allusion to the game's opening sequence, "The Hero." However, the advertising for the title states that the title is "inspired by the life and music of Sam Moore, Jr.," which is a reference to singer Sam Moore. It seems that the radio ad that mentioned "Sam the mechanic" was meant to be a reference to Sam Moore.

In the Sonic X-Treme series, the car that the mechanic is repairing is a purple van.

Game and Video Game Differences

When Sam calls for Sonic, Sam's voice is different and, for a split second at the beginning, is in a strange and distorted, but distinctive style, making it look like he's singing. Sonic then calls for Sonic as well.

In the opening sequence of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Sam (in the first iteration only) appears holding a pink umbrella. However, Sam appears to be holding a regular umbrella in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles.
