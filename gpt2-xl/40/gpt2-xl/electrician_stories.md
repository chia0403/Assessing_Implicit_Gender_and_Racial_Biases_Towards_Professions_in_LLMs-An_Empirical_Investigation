Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Harry. And he wanted to marry this girl. No, Hermione Granger – he said she was his girlfriend, and he loved her. "I know how to use the bathroom without any trouble – but you have to be careful, Hermione," Harry warned her once, as she ran out of the bathroom after another fit of fainting spells. "And I've done it again today… this isn't fair… you need to start taking care of yourself, OK? Get the hang of it."

"He didn't even know that she was a girl," Hermione said, sniffling.

"I said he needed to start," Harry said. "You've seen girls do those things to their boyfriends. Besides, Hermione, you're not a girl. You're a wizard."

"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Potter," a voice called out from beside them, and Hermione turned around to see another couple walking through the window, carrying a large bundle of blankets and a table cloth.

"I'm glad you were able to reach us, Mr. and Mrs. Granger," Harry said, smiling warmly at the couple. "It's always hard to be without my love in this crazy world, but I believe things are getting better – hopefully, they will be, sooner or later. Thank you again for your help, Mr. and Mrs. Granger. You two are the best!" He
