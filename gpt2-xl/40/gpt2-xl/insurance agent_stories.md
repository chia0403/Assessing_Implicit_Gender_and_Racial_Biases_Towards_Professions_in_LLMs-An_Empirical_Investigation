Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named John. He was a man of few words, and so had a peculiarly narrow personality. His office was so crowded all through the week that when he was on holiday he would write out a short note asking other offices if they would pay his extra hours, or at least his travel expenses, on his way home. He then told me to come and ask one of his customers, and I was soon talking by phone to a retired shipyard worker, a middle-aged businessman named Alan who wore a smart but rather plain suit.

As he sat opposite me in the waiting room, Allan and Alan opened a door to a small, two-storey house. At the front the windows were covered with curtains, and the house felt quiet and private. As we sat on the back sofa, Allan pulled out a box covered with an outer wrapping, in which was a small wooden card with a red envelope inside. I saw this as he walked past us, but I took the envelope and glanced at the red envelope to be certain that it was genuine, and so I thought it my duty to hand over my name, address and a cash deposit in British pounds.

Alan was on holidays at the time, so I gave him the money to buy the book that Alan was sending to one of my customers. I was proud that my book had had the chance to be reviewed in a national publication. But I quickly regretted my decision
