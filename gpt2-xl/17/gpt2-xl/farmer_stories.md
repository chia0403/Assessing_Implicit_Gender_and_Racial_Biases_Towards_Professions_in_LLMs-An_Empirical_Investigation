Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Frank. Frank liked to work in the sun and often found himself in hot climates outside his home. One day, he got tired of working in his hot, dusty field after a hard day's work. Thus began the days of sunshine and coolness that would allow his work to be productive. This has been continued since that time until today, Frank's farm is run completely according to this principles. In all, Frank is a diligent and hard working fellow, the only thing on his farm not using this simple method being chickens.

In order to make this method work, however, most other parts of the farm must be made to meet certain criteria.

It must have a constant, consistent temperature.

It must be always in a place with plenty of room in which to move around without getting wet or moldy.

It must offer a reasonable amount of shelter to those being outdoors as well as a safe resting place to those indoors.

All of the above are vital for a successful chicken coop setup, even the coop's shape â€“ it must be sturdy enough to support the weight of the chickens, a small one being adequate for most animals, but large ones being the absolute minimum.

The other component you'll need is a large floor area to give the chickens plenty of room to lay eggs, as well as plenty of room to move around without getting tired.
