Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Jim, who had a great idea, and one day the idea led him to a big empty warehouse. Inside the warehouse was a large table covered with piles of cardboard boxes.

One box was labeled "a little bit of everything" and was covered with a sheet. What was inside those boxes they have no way of knowing, but they need everything a band sells.

So they decide to take the music they have and build that table out of cardboard and then go home and buy more. Over months and months, the building is growing, and one day, in a fit of insanity, the boxes are shoved in and stacked and then the table is constructed. And then one day, when Mr. Manly comes to inspect the table, the roof is too expensive and he decides to destroy his investment.

The story ends there, but what does the end of the story, mean?

Well, that it is a very good one; as long as you buy the right insurance, or you need it. For bands, it means you need the right insurance and I will tell you why.

If you are not in the insurance business and you are in a band, it is an easy thing to lose money. The more bands you have there, the greater the risk. You need to have at least one insurance policy with some kind of coverage in your band, where you can afford to lose money.
