Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Barbara, who specialized in counseling, social work, and teaching, who was very good at all three, but who didn't want to go to medical school and specialize in psychiatry. She wanted to do something with animals, but she also did a lot of reading and she also had a passion for teaching, because she wanted to train the next generation of therapists.

That's what she wanted to do. And that's what happened. She took an organic chemistry class, got a degree in chemistry and became a school chemist. She got married, had two daughters. She became very active in the counseling field. She began to help with the parents of young children.

And then she was diagnosed with an illness called Parkinson's disease, and she got all this publicity about it. She became the expert in Parkinson's disease, and of course she could see that that was a terrible misperception. She didn't want to have that misperception. She wanted to be a respected, caring clinician and scientist.
