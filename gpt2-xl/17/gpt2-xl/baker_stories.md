Once upon a time, there was a baker named Joseph B. who made the cookies we know today. However, B's cookies were not cookies in the traditional sense.

These are not chocolate chip cookies, which can be bought either in a cone or in a square shape. Instead, they were shaped cookies. Each cookie was a two-tablespoon cookie or sometimes a one-tablespoon cookie.

To make them, you took a cup of flour, some brown sugar, some spices, one part milk from a can of creamer, and you shook it up with eggs and a pinch of salt. Stir. Then add in your cookies and fold them to form a ball. Take the ball out of the bowl and pop it in your hand and flatten the ball out against your palm.

Then wrap the ball in plastic wrap and then put the plastic on it.

Then cut out cookie shapes and wrap them, once again, in plastic wrap.

Now you have some pretty darn good cookies.
