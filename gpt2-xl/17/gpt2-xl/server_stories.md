Once upon a time, there was a server named "Minecraft" with over one million user accounts that allowed anyone to mine. Nowadays, it's one server with only one active user who mines Minecraft with a single mining lease.

That's not a coincidence. Just like Minecraft, Mojang's website is a single page, with only the Minecraft logo visible at some screen resolutions. This is why it's so easy for developers to use the website, by using server-side script and custom content. So the website has all of Mojang's code that it shares with the server, but it is all kept online-only.

The same way that Mojang's Minecraft server shared code with the rest of the world, so will the Mojang website. While Mojang is no longer maintaining and maintaining this website, I wanted to show just how little a developer has to change to share their code with the world.

Disclaimer: Most of the below code examples are using older versions of PHP and MySQL, as well as their respective extensions (php5 and sqlite3). Because these technologies are all still used heavily in the modern PHP web development environment, I feel that making those examples available will allow those newer developers to better understand how it's done. In short: use at your own risk!
