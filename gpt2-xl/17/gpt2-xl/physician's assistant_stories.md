Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Dr. Robert O'Brien. Dr. O'Brien was married with two kids--one of whom, John, would later become the president of IBM. Dr. O'Brien's life was, for all intents and purposes, perfect. In 1966, the O'Briens moved to an estate house in Newport, California. There, they enjoyed everything in life--kids, a nice house, and an active spouse.

Sadly, one day a neighbor called Dr. O'Brien asking if he could give the neighbor a check for his yard fees.

"Can you give me a check for $75,000?" said the neighbor.

"No, you're too far down the driveway," replied O'Brien.

"No," replied the neighbor, "give me a $7,500 check."

"You're way too far down the driveway," answered Dr. O'Brien.
