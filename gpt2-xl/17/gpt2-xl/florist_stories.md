Once upon a time, there was a florist named Edith.  She was a nice little gal.  She was pretty.  She wore a beautiful white dress.  You've probably seen it, perhaps if you lived in New York City.  Edith was a florist to boot. There were so many of her. Edith had a shop in her own right, right up the block from the store in the movie where the bad guys rob the bank and kidnap the boss.  Edith kept bees.  She was in charge of her own little bees.  She was a bee.  Edith's shop had bees.  Edith owned and operated a bees house.  She kept bees.  And you loved her, of course.  You loved Edith's bees.  I loved her, too.  You loved her all over the world, not just New York City.  You loved her everywhere.  You couldn't stop crying for her.  You didn't give up.  You kept going back to see her.  Edith was always in the shop.  You went to Edith's shop.  You bought flowers.  You loved Edith's flowers.   You felt like Edith. You wanted to protect the flowers.  You wanted to put some honey and some sugar and some spice all over that sweet little heart of yours, Edith's flowers.  You didn't give up.
