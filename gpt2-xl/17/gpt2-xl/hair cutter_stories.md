Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Kiel. She was the one who made those hair cuts everyone likes to see. She had a nice-looking face, dark hair and brown eyes. When she came to work in this new place, she'd be called "Naymah".

"But when I go home, I always make a little joke about it." Kiel said pointing in front of her at the door.

"What joke?" Kiel's sister asked with wide eyes.

Kiel giggled. "Naymah, Naymah... the nickname I gave to myself was... well, you know… in a way it's about self respect... but in its own way… it's about being a little bit more open."

"Why don't you keep that a secret from the rest if the whole clan?"

"And do you... You mean not to tease me?" Naymah asked with a sad look in her eye.

"Of course not! It only makes life easier!"

The girls sat down and shared a laugh.

"Now then, I'll now tell you about my clan's initiation ceremony."

Rhea was excited to watch. She knew the ceremony was something that everyone should have at least once in their lives. But, when she knew about it her excitedness got even greater.

She felt almost like a secret weapon.
