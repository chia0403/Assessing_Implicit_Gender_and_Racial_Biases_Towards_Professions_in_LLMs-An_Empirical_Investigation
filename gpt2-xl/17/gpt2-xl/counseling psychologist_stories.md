Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Gary L. Naughton who made a habit of calling every mother he met, on an intermittent (but regularly) basis, at a local mall. As you might imagine, he found himself fielding a lot more phone calls as time went into the new millennium, and he decided to help women figure out how to deal with the stress and uncertainty that came with divorce. Many were reluctant to talk, and he couldn't really tell what the problem was. "I asked, very bluntly, what were you going to do, for money?" he recalls. "And they said, 'Well, when we got divorced, my husband is making all these money demands.'" He tried to counsel them, but he found that most of them were just a bit too frightened. Still, Naughton had a few new ideas—what if psychologists could use the tools of psychiatry to help people cope in these tough times?

The idea for Naughton's research was originally born during a conference in Europe in the mid-1960s that focused on the psychiatric study of bereavement. The idea is that when you lose a loved one, especially a child, you tend to experience many of the psychological problems that come with the loss, and as you go through the grieving process you build up a tolerance and acceptance for the loss—though, as you get older, you begin to feel a sort of loneliness and alienation.
