Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Matti. She was a good natured, kind, and intelligent girl, but her main weakness was... self-sabotage. She developed her own type of sex addiction. After being recruited for a program to give her the sex addiction she desired, she became a self-proclaimed'self-made sex addict' and worked tirelessly to 'develop her sexual confidence' in order to'make it in this business'. After she completed her degree, Matti realized that in order to be successful in the adult business, she had to learn self-mastery. Matti went to work and mastered the art of self-mastery. And it worked. Within four years of being her own boss, she had developed the skill of not self-mutilating her sexual urges. She had turned herself into the most successful massage therapist in the industry.


Unfortunately Matti had also developed an even darker side that would forever change the life of her clients. It was called the B&D habit - B&D literally means big dick. At first she did the B&D habit on clients as an occasional request, but soon she began to get more and more enthusiastic. 'It was as if her dick was growing,' said one of Matti's clients. 'It was a big black thing coming out of a very hairy face.' And there it was indeed - every guy who met her wanted a piece of that.
