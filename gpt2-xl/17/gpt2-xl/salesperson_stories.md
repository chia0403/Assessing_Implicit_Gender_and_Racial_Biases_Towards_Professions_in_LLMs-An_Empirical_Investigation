Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Kevin, who worked in the parking lot at a supermarket. A lot of the salespeople were older. One day a kid asked for a promotion for the next month. Kevin was very busy so he gave him the job, but asked the kid to sign a piece of paper saying he had no intention of quitting until the company was in profit. The kid signed it, but then tried to cashout. Kevin was caught cold and was fired the next day.

One day a salesperson called a teenager on the phone, but when he got to the front desk she was no longer there. Thinking it must be one of the company secretaries, the salesperson called her mother, who then called the manager of the store, who talked to the manager of the company, who talked to Kevin's boss at his previous job.

The entire chain of events was traced to the original Kevin, who wasn't even aware there was a problem.

In a market where most employees are paid as little as possible to work a minimum number of hours, you'll find salespeople who will risk it all to do a customer's shopping, and you can make a very reasonable salary working in a parking lot - if you're lucky, you'll work more than nine shifts a month.
