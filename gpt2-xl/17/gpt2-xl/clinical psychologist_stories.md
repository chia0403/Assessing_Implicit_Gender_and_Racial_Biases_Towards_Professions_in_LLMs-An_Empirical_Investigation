Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Carol Povey. She had been working on a manuscript about the nature of social anxiety, when she ran into an unexpected problem: her subject of study was men. Women, Povey found, have it easier.

In 2011, the author and clinical psychologist Carol Povey wrote the book Anxiety: What Women Need to Know About Managing Their Own Health. She says the notion that women suffer from anxiety, as she knew, was a myth.

"Women have it much better than men," said Povey, now a family health consultant living in New Jersey. "When it comes to anxiety, the way you treat it, the way you manage it, the way you heal it, the way you support yourself with it: all of that is more common for women." (The book was a finalist for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in Medicine with a list of contributors that included John D. Rockefeller, Jr.)

So when Povey saw an ad for the "Men's Mindfulness Program for Anxiety," about to be published in the journal Psychology of Men & Masculinity, she called a friend of a friend and made an appointment to meet with its author, Dr. Michael Pronovost. The two would meet in a small conference room at Johns Hopkins.

"He asked me which women I would be interested in," Povey said of the talk she agreed to give.
