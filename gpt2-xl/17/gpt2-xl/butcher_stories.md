Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Klay Thompson. He was a big man, and he couldn't move very well. His knees were always bothering him. So, his coach, Nate McMillan, made it a game. If Thompson could lift his knees, he could pass to the open man, and if he couldn't, he could shoot 3.

Klay Thompson was really strong, but he couldn't do the three.

So, he did it anyway. With his shoulder.

And the guy who got him the pass still has a bruise from where Klay hit it. To this day, I'm not sure what happened. One time, I think my dad accidentally hit the gas when we were driving, and Klay ran on an 8-inch driveway. I don't know how.

Anyways, that's all I got. Thanks for reading.
