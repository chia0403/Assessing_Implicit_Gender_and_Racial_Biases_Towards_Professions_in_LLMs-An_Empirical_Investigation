Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Peter Parnes, who used to work with the late, great B.B. King.

He was in an apartment on East 6th Street when he was called into the office - where they kept the vintage "Black Cat" recordings - and told to make the place sound nicer.

"They brought in the old furniture and the old pillows to the apartment: The old furniture and the old pillows, and they called me over, and they said, 'This is what you need to do. This is where we want it in there.'"

Parnes was asked to make a room a little more mellow. He used only one piece from the original, and it was on top. He placed a small piece of the black cat wallpaper in a frame.

"I had this really nice little place there, and I had these great records on all of the walls. They had old records and I think the records were in the old chairs," he said. "And then I used a piece of one of them. It was really cool. I was like, 'Oh, I can put a good piece of black cat in here now!'"

Parnes decided to hang some pictures that he thought were funny of himself and a friend. In one of those pictures, he's dressed up as B.B. King, and on the wall is a framed picture of him
