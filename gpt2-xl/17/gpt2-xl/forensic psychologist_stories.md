Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named J. Kenneth Lippe. He used to be one of those weird, cranky guys who was always on the side of the crazy. When he first came into the profession, he noticed quite a few people saying that they'd just read a paper, heard a conversation, or read an article that supported a certain point of view, and were then ready to start shooting. So, he started researching how different groups of people process information and how exactly they decided what was true. It was not a scientific study, and Lippe thought (and told some people he thought) that this probably wasn't scientific. But, by spending much of his life testing his methods and observing how people reacted to them, Lippe realized that some things, when you test them and give them some time, can turn back into their original state. He discovered that he could test his methods to see if they could reliably replicate certain findings; if they didn't work, they weren't useful. Which happened to be true.

Then, in the early 1990s, a colleague of Lippe's named David Spiegelhalter started experimenting with different methods of testing, and the results were striking: When something was tested and found not to work, Spiegelhalter would then test something else. He found that these other tests and methods were much better at getting results that seemed very similar to the original findings.

If this sounds like the
