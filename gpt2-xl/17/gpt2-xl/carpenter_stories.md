Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Walter Mitty.

His name is Walter Mitty, and his carpenter father bought a huge amount of tools for him to be a carpenter. They were to be used for building things other than cars, including houses, churches, etc., and to make use of the great abundance of cheap wood which was all over the world. After Walter was an adult, he turned over his collection and had his tools appraised, and found that these pieces were worth a tremendous sum. They cost a lot of money, but their value was such that the carpenter father decided to get rid of them, and made Walter a partner in a lumber mill.

The mill operated for many years when the carpenter/laborer ran into some very serious financial troubles. One night, when the son was asleep, the mill manager, Mr. Blum, came in and threatened his family with the loss of everything he had. "My good man," Walter called down from the attic, "I have only $4 to give you. I can give you that, but if you let the son of a bitch live, I'll take your family and live there for a long time to come, to die the shame of it!" "I want my money!" "You are going to give me that money?" "Well, yes. I can give to you any amount I want. Now, you better get me that $4."
