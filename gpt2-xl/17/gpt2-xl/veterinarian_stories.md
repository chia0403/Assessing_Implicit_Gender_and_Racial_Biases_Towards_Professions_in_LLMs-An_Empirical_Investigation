Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Mike. In the midst of his daily duties in the clinic, Mike stumbled upon a young cockapoo, who was being held by three young women. A very big cockatoo was about to be shipped to Asia, but first the vet had to transport a rather small cockatoo. However, Mike thought this tiny cockatoo would be a joy to hold and take for his own personal use. The little cockatoo was born in captivity, but after being left alone for just a few days, the cockatoo escaped, and was found more than a week later wandering the streets of Seattle, Washington. After extensive searching, the veterinarian was able to release the tiny cockatoo into a wildlife sanctuary with his family members.The cockatoo has been named "Chase" (Chase is his name here in Seattle, so it makes sense!) and he's now doing just fine and thriving at the wildlife sanctuary.
