Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Mary Enig. She created the famous "Enig's Rules" for weight loss. Enig was a crusader for the idea that diet is an essential component for weight control, and she believed that many fat people were starving themselves to avoid feeling that they had lost control:

You must do exactly as Mary Enig recommends:

You must read every book you can get your hands on. At least five books at a minimum. Every one of them. And you do not have to read them all. One book per month. Once a week. The amount varies with the amount of books you have, of course, but the average is twenty books per year. And the number one source of information for most dieters is the "Enig's Rules" by Mary Enig (Eagle Book Company, 1956). There may be others, some less well known, but the "Enig's Rules" are by far the most commonly recommended in books and other media, and are still taught in schools as an essential guide. Do not trust the Internet. The "Enig's Rules" have become so familiar; we believe we have an immunity to them that we are more likely to hear them incorrectly than to hear them correctly. If you are unfamiliar, simply do as Mary Enig says, but at least read an encyclopaedia! You've heard about the "I've Lost 25lbs Without Dieting"
