We aren't asking what they did with that piece of copper. We aren't asking why they came to find out. We're just asking what happened to the gold. That's what we have to understand."

Nowadays, it's the modern version of that experiment: It's what scientists do. Maybe they could come back and ask Paul D'Arpino again.

"Of course," I said, not looking up from the table, "I don't know. I am an historian. I don't have that information about their research projects, or their time in academia."

"I am an historian, too," said my host. "I would have asked you the same questions. But how can I know if I asked the wrong person?"

"I don't think that they asked anything out of the ordinary," I said.
