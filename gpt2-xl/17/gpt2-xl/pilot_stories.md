Once upon a time, there was a pilot named David Fincher, who worked on television projects. He had an idea that came from "Carpool Karaoke" where comedians would get in a cab and sing along to some song lyrics and his idea for a pilot was "Carpool Karaoke," but the pilot didn't get the money to pay for the pilot yet. Fincher decided to pay people in exchange for helping him save the money he didn't have to make "Carpool Karaoke" the hit it was. He started a dating app called Tinder called "Carpool Karaoke." He made a number of videos with his wife and his son telling the stories behind his show, eventually getting the backing to produce it.

So now all of us can take Fincher out for a night on his favorite date, or you can have him over for dinner. I just hope he has a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and his favorite beer.
