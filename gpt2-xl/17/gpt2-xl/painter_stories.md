Once upon a time, there was a painter named Jurgen Beckert. He drew all his pictures with the aid of a long, sharp-toothed paintbrush. One day, he lost the brush. He threw it in the river with the last drops of paint that he could scrounge up- to create some weird but beautiful picture he had in mind- but the brush had never been found. Beckert became lost for a while: he wandered through the wilderness for days- at times drinking up a stream to keep warm. He lost his way in the forest and wandered through the dark trees and thick undergrowth, occasionally hearing the voices of people. He thought he was in the world of elves (for he saw himself living in elves' houses) and in the world of dwarfs (for he thought he spoke in dwarfs' language). Finally, he came to the river. He threw half of the paint he had collected out into the river and looked back in at his picture. "I have drawn the brush in the river," he thought; "I will never be able to find it." But when he looked back in, he saw not any brush but only a strange little boat with a little cabin on it in the water. No one would ever find the brush, but he could see the boat.

So Beckert came out. He made up some new stories about himself, and began living his life. He worked at his painting from dawn
