Once upon a time, there was a barber named Bill who would do all these little, very tiny things. All he did was shave the top of people's heads and cut off stray hairs on the sides of their heads and all that kind of thing, but every Saturday, he'd come home and he'd do the same thing: He'd shave the head of some poor little black or something. Just a very small piece of hair off their heads just on their eyebrows so they wouldn't look like a pig. That's something you can only do with someone who's really suffering, one-on-one. A lot of people will say, "Well, I don't shave my own head. I find that it's uncomfortable." Well, that's a lie. If you can find somebody that you're in tune with and it's the right thing to do, no-one's going to say anything to you about it when it's a human being or a child. But if it's a black person or a poor little black girl or whatever, it doesn't matter who it is they're dealing with, that's going to get done.

AVC: That's really important, when you get to that point: that the barber, the mechanic, or whatever, that it's for a person that they get to care for. They get to get rid of their suffering.
