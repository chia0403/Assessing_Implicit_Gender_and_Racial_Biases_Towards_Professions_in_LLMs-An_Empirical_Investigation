Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Gary Webb, and he reported that he was investigating connections between the CIA and the crack epidemic in LA. The LA Times reported: "Several former U.S. intelligence officials told The Times they are aware of the report, though it is not believed to have entered the formal investigation into the drug problem so far." The Times noted it was the first time such a connection had been made with the CIA.

This is the type of story that should never have fallen off the radar. We had the first confirmed evidence in the history of the world that the CIA controlled the crack epidemic in LA â€” a story that still has not been adequately investigated. Even before this, the CIA's role in the crack epidemic in LA had been well documented.

After all, the U.S. government has been telling us for decades that the war on drugs has been a resounding success.

The mainstream media doesn't report stories that don't conform to their narrative on drugs, so it must have been something in this story that bothered people.
