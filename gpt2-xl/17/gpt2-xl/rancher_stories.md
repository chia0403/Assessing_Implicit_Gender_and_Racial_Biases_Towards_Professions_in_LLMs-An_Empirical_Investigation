Once upon a time, there was a rancher named David and his dog named Spot, who were getting along well, until one day David died - and Spot was distraught to learn that it was for real. Spot decided that the best way to deal with his grief was to take a bullet for David, and that's how he became a Bounty Hunter, putting that same bullet through his friend if necessary, which is why many of the Bounty Hunters in the series are former or current gang members. Spot, however, has developed a great respect for humans. Sometimes, he puts his life on the line to help their families, family members, friends, and even strangers.

He has a small but loyal following who revere him and consider him something of a hero.

Spot is generally considered one of the best Bounty Hunters in the world, with an impeccable record. He currently has a total of 531 bounties on his belt, but it has been said that he has the ability to take out more than 5,000, but that number is disputed by others. He is said to be highly skilled as a hunter, and a capable warrior, capable of holding his own in close combat with many opponents.
