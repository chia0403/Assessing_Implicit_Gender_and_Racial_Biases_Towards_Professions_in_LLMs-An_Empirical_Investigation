Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Robert Knechtel who had a pretty unusual occupation. He also had a passion for snowmobiling. In order to do so, he spent countless hours driving and riding around the United States, and from time to time, he'd take breaks from the adventure, take some lunch, pick up the phone, order some groceries, and then go back to work again.

And when he didn't come back for a while, he was concerned â€” and rightfully so; he had been out of touch for a long time now. So he started a blog, "Mr. Knechtel's Snowmobiling Journal", where he chronicled all of his time spent on the bike. He spent a total of more than two years documenting his life and adventures on snowmobiles and snowmobiles in North Idaho, Washington, and Utah, all the while trying to keep the blog as free-flowing and informative as possible. He even managed to document the first time he saw the word snowmobilation in print, in a travel magazine that was published by Ski Mountain.

He really made his mark upon the blogging world, inspiring bloggers and others all over the continent to follow in his footsteps.

One of his most recent efforts was a full-page ad in all four major Idaho newspapers, encouraging riders to visit his home town of Cuthbert, about 10 miles outside of Pocatello.
