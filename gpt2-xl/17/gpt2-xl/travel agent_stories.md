Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Fredo. He had been in the business for 20 years, but because he always looked tired and worn, no buyers would come his way. So he told his son that he was gonna be open his own office one day, and he got that son over there and told him his son got to do the office chores, because that was just part of his dad's job. As far as Fredo was concerned, his son never left the office. He never left the house. But since the son had shown interest in going off and do his own thing, he thought it would be funny if the son would walk into Fredo's office while the dad was not there, to see if he could find some money there. He asked his son to put in some requests for his parents. The kid told him about the list, and made up a fake list of stuff he had for them. As the guy sat down, the dad asked him about what exactly he was on, but the son just kept saying, "I'd like to buy something for them, really, it would just mean so so much to them." He didn't want them to have any of their old stuff that didn't make sense anymore. So the dad said "Okay, I think we'll buy it." But the son only kept saying, "I'd really like to buy something for them. And I know they've got it in their old house."
