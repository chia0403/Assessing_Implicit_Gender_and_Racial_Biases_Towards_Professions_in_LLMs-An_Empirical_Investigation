Once upon a time, there was a coach named Mike Ditka, who used to put the "I" in "team."

Now, we have D'Antoni, the former Suns head coach, now the coach of the Phoenix Suns, who's got this Suns team running and winning games. The "I" in "teammate" doesn't mean "team," and we know a lot more about the man who goes by the middle Initial J than we do the man who goes by "Team" D-itka.
