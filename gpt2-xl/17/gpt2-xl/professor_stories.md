Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. John H. O'Neil. His primary occupation was to observe the "psychic" phenomena of the New Age. He observed the New Age, and he observed people who claimed to be psychic. The majority of these people, when they began talking about getting "psychic readings" or receiving messages from the deceased from those people who had passed away many years prior, were unable to support their claims by explaining those statements by a coherent argument, in a way that made sense to someone who was at least vaguely informed about psychology. What they were able to demonstrate is that this ability had to do with some aspect of personality. The New Age was about making your own reality. It was about changing your inner world with some form of spiritual intervention, like a dream or an ESP. This became known as "channeled energy" for a period of time, until it was found out that most people who claimed to have had these experiences were not having those experiences due to some sort of mental illness or personality disorder, but because of some kind of manipulation of the channeled energy by people who were able to tap into the mental energies of whoever this psychic was, and they did so in order to manipulate that psychic. It became known that these psychic "sessions" were actually an illusion. These psychic individuals weren't even channeling their own thoughts, but were acting as though their thoughts were actually being channeled into the person that they were speaking
