Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Tanya and her class of three- and four-year-olds. One day, Tanya was assigned to make an observation on one of the girls in her class—a six-year-old girl with short black hair. She had been in the care of some relatives in the village, and her family had decided that they needed to bring her here, to the city of Khanaqin, to get a better education. Though she had been raised here since she was a child, Tanya worried that her students might be ignorant of what her parents had gone through. They'd never told her exactly how old Sadiya had been when her mother died: they claimed that she was just ten or eleven years old.

When Tanya arrived at Sadiya's small room, the little girl was eating a meal on her bed. Sadiya was in the middle of one of those late-night studies that her teachers would instruct her to be doing. Tanya watched closely as Sadiya made one of her quizzes—a difficult puzzle where she had to unscramble scrambled letters and words into their separate parts—and then took the test herself. As she worked at the puzzles, Sadiya looked at Tanya and smiled shyly, and then tried to hide the expression. Sadiya was a bright child, and she thought that she'd be able to solve the test with some practice.
