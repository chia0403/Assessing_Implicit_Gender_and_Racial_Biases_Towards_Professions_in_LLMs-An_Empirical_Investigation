Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Michael. When Michael got into a car accident, he lost his memory. Over the years, Michael has visited the pharmacy four times. On each occasion, Mike has shown up, seemingly acting like his memory was restored. However, Mike has always gone away again before the pharmacy could finish the process of returning Michael's memory to him.

In "Gremlins on Wheels," Michael is at the pharmacy waiting for a patient to come in while it's closed. The other patients at the clinic (who work with him) are working on getting a case of the flu under control. When a new patient goes in, Michael asks him if he wants medications with him. He replies "No, thank you." Michael leaves. The patient then says to his coworker, "Wait a minute...it's this new guy. He doesn't look old enough to have his pharmacist ID card yet." The coworker laughs at the old patient's remark, and Mike comes in. As Mike explains about medication, an alarm rings. A cop car then rolls into the scene. In his rush to get the man out of his way, the patient hits the cop with his cane. The cop has the car towed. Meanwhile, Mike's phone rings. When Michael picks it up his assistant is on the phone with the pharmacy. The pharmacist asks Michael where he can find a cab to the hospital so that they can complete the memory reset process
