Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Richard Smith who didn't like his job, and he went on a mission to make himself miserable. He was an enthusiastic computer expert who enjoyed doing what made him happy and doing it at great speed, and he built his software to let other people do the same as he would. To him, that meant making it easy to create his own network, with special characters and a network address field. He called it "The Smithian Network." He had lots of fun figuring out how to do that, too.

In time the idea of "The Smithian Network" found its way into the language of Unix, and it eventually spawned other network related languages and tools. And this was how it did.

A few of his colleagues would give their passwords to the others as they worked together, and so the Smithian Network was born. The programmers started building tools to implement the idea, and within a few years they had a thriving network of tools: the TCP/IP networking system, later called TCP/IP, was created. In addition, other tools that later made their way into the Unix system, like the BSD file system and the LSM, which provided an "access control" service, were the product of the Smithian Network.

All of these tools made it easier to build networks and to talk to networks.

In time, though, there were many new networking systems that were based on the
