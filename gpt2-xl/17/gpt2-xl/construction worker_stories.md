Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Brian Shrout. And he was a man who had a big job to do: to build a tower to house a new power plant. As he's about to turn his full attention to a gigantic tower in downtown Austin, a massive wind farm is already there—and shoving it out of the way on a neighboring hillside. A man named Joe Schuetz was about to break ground on his massive new apartment complex. And while Schuetz doesn't go as far as Shrout, he certainly isn't planning on leaving a wind farm standing when the time comes. But, as any real estate broker or developer knows, there's often a price to pay for going against the wind.

The wind farms we're talking about here are large enough to be quite a hindrance to developers, and they could also be quite a challenge to construct. One reason, naturally, is that their output of wind power is actually rather modest. The massive Texas Municipal Power Agency generates so little wind power that it uses almost all of the electricity it distributes to retail customers from within its own grid. And the wind turbines installed to replace them in Austin and other Texas cities are of the same sort as the ones Schuetz is building—small and relatively lightweight, meant to provide an annual flow of roughly a quarter of a million megawatt-hours (roughly the output of four Texas coal plants). Because they must be
