Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Edward Niedermeyer, and he was convinced that the universe was governed by a single fundamental force. A principle called "quantum coherence," which, according to a recent paper by quantum physicist Dan Siegel*, allows for the existence of the universe's macroscopic subatomic particles.

Niedermeyer called his idea "quantum indeterminacy," which, as we all know, doesn't really describe quantum mechanics, but instead describes the way that quantum mechanics allows for the existence of subatomic particles, or qubits, like electrons, atoms, photons, and, yes, qubits. It's a theory about everything, all the time–even the minuscule quantum indeterminacy of the human brain, which might just be the smallest system in a universe containing billions, trillions, of systems.

So, if this idea is true–as some scientists believe it is–how should we describe the interactions of things like electrons and photons? According to this argument – which doesn't exist, but doesn't feel like it needs to—the interactions of electrons and photons must be indeterministic; that is: we can predict exactly how the quantum entanglement between electrons and photons will behave, but we can't predict with any precision how the electrons and photons will interact. How can electrons and photons come to be in a pair that then turns into a third particle (called a photon) that then behaves
