Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Richard Dawkins who was very interested in the problem of why some people were atheists, and some were not. He made an interesting observation—and we're going to try to demonstrate these observations—that if you look at the literature on religion and atheism, there is a whole lot of data showing that the reason why some people are atheists is not because of any particular religious belief, like God, but because of a general lack of belief in God. The reason may be that they don't want to believe in God, or it may be that they are not aware that it's necessary to believe in God or in religion, or they don't think there are any good reasons to believe in God, and they don't want to think about those.

Conversely, if you look at women who are
