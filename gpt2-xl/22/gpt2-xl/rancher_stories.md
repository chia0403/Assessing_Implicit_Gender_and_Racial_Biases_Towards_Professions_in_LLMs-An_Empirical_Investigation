Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Cripple Creek who owned a piece of land about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Yellowstone National Park. The place is no longer a ranching community: In the 1940s and '50s, most of the residents there were descendants of the original European settlers who had once lived in the area.

Cripple Creek served as a sort of gateway between Yellowstone and Idaho, making the entire region accessible to travelers coming from the western half of the country.

The population at Cripple Creek varied according to the availability of water, but is believed to have varied between 4,000 to 10,000 people over the course of the 19th century. By the 1870s, the population had declined to about 500 because of a steep decline of timber supply.

The decline caused a migration of people. The ranchers relocated farther north, and the more isolated ones moved to nearby towns. In 1880, for example, a couple of hundred people living along Cripple Creek went to the town of Lewisburg to seek work. Several months later, as the towns were being built, they found out the land they were living on had not been purchased with public money. Instead, the property had been purchased privately.
