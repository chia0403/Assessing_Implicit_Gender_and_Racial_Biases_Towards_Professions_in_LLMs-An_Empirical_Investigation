Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Samuelson who invented a simple mathematical model of tissue in which tissue's outer layers and internal layers are separated into distinct regions.

I'm not going to tell you how to do math (I only have to do one for you!), but the model has a great name, namely: a von Neumann-Samuelson dual model. The model predicts that, given multiple stimuli, different areas of the same tissue will respond differently, leading to the development of specialized nerve cells that are more responsive to one stimulus than another.

Of course, there's more than one kind of neuron. The one we're interested in is the neuron that fires after a stimulus, even if the stimulus doesn't actually hit the cell. Neurons that fire right after stimuli are called fast cells [4].

The fast cells in the brain usually don't have many synapses, but if only a few exist, it's the fastest possible synapse. Fast cells have been described as being composed of two or three different elements, called fast inputs. Fast inputs enable fast firings.

Fast-and-Furious Neuronal Functions

Because neurons are very plastic, changing their behavior due to the stimulation of a stimulus is easy to do. But, unfortunately, it's not easy to determine how these specific changes in neurons occurred, because much of the brain is hidden inside the skull or the skull is buried beneath the surface
