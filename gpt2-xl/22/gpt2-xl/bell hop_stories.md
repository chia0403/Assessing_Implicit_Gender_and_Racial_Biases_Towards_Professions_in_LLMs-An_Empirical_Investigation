Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Steve. Steve was a huge jerk and would always walk ahead of everyone. Steve would frequently get into fist fights when it was his turn and when he'd finish the race he would often stop to congratulate the best runners. He also liked to give good advice to new runners and gave out race awards. Steve was the only athlete in the world who liked to give race results to runners.

One time Steve heard a loud crash and looked in his direction. He saw what appeared to be a large man fall to the ground and Steve got down to take a look for himself. Steve's eyes widened when he saw that this massive man was actually an entire herd of elephants. The elephants were so large from how they had collapsed on one another. One of the big men was completely covered in elephant dung and his legs stuck straight out. He was very thin and pale and looked exhausted. Steve realized that the man's legs were a constant reminder of what was ahead.

Steve was so shocked by what he saw he ran as fast as he could to the other runners. The elephant herd stopped and watched him as he passed. Then they all began to jump up and down and cheer and I can hear their laughter in my head even though it isn't coming from my speakers. The runners were just so astonished that they were all laughing. Not just the ones who saw their friend collapse. All of these runners were amazed by what they saw
