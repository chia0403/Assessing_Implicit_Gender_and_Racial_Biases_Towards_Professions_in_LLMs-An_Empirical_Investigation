Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Bill, and he didn't like the fact that his employer had not been paying him for a year. So, he took it upon himself to walk to the back of the garage and start knocking on the door. This is what he found: "I looked on in terror as an angry, hooded man rushed towards me. The man was screaming, 'Give it to me! Give it to me!'"

What follows is the entire story, as told by the man himself, who goes by the username H.E.I.C.E. League. Bill recounts how the man got his hands on his employer's keys and managed to get inside the garage.
