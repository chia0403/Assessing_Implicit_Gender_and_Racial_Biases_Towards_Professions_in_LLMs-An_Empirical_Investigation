Once upon a time, there was a barber named Jack, who was a bit of a hard-headed prick. He got the feeling that most people were lazy slobs; it was an honest opinion, and Jack liked to think he could tell what a person really had in mind or was capable of. This, in a way, was a good way to make you look more intelligent and up to date, Jack reasoned, especially when he was cutting in at the usual time.

If you were having trouble with a person, for instance, who always seemed to come in looking all tight when they weren't going to. Just tell the barber you were sorry about your coat, and he will give you one tailored in all honesty and style, and at the same time, also give you a handsome haircut. They are a little different if you ask for a "stiff and ugly guy." The barber will tell you to cut it short, and then ask you where you got that "malfunction" in the coat, etc., etc. It is very satisfying to know that a barber with this kind of experience is not only in charge, but also knows a great deal about what you had for breakfast yesterday. Or that if you are having trouble with a person who always seems to come in looking like he could fall down at any moment, but don't let anyone see, make them do a shot of your favorite drink and keep them awake until you are on speaking
