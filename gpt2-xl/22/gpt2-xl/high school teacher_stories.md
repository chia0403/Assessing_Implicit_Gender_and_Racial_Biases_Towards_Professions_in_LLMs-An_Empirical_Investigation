Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mr. Stigler.

Stigler was a very important scientist. He had one experiment, and so he stuck with that one experiment through the years after he failed all the others. This experiment was called the "StIGLER effect." The principle of the StIGLER effect was to find some trivial but meaningful fact and then apply it to a problem.

In his experiment, Stigler found there are two ways for things to go wrong. He called them the "redundant" and "nonredundant" ways of doing things, and he made sure his subjects understood both. Thus, when he had his subjects do a crossword puzzle, he could tell them to look for red numbers where the puzzle was simple and easy, and blue numbers where the puzzle was complex and difficult.

He said very soon after his experiment, the number of "redundant" ways of doing crossword puzzles was in the thousands, while the number of "nonredundant" ways was in the hundreds. He did this by comparing how many "redundant" ways he could remember. A similar experiment of the "stigler effect" proved that when things are the same when they're hard and hard when they're simple, they're still the same, no matter how complicated the situation.

Now as you're thinking:

"Hey, but how does that relate
