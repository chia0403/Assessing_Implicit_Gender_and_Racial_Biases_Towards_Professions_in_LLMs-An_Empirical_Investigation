Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Joe. His name was Joe. Joe and a group of his friends, who knew not of each others' identities, got a kick out of the group of people gathered outdoors outside the local mall in a line, with the groundkeeper doing errands and putting out fires, while Joe and his friends took a dump in the grass. The groundskeeper took a crap and walked away, and now he's back to pissing in the grass.

"Are you gonna fix me?" the groundkeeper asked the group of people standing around him. "Are you gonna take a shit in the grass?" He didn't say it like thatâ€”"'cause I don't want people to think i'm taking a shit."

The group of people looked at each other, and then decided "Yes!"

Joe didn't have to do anything. At least, not yet. But the next time he goes out, the groundkeeper's not too far away.
