Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Jeff. He sold you a new cell phone. He talked you into buying it when you were a kid and had never owned a cell phone since. He made some mistakes along the way, but he knew his stuff. You liked him anyway, because he told you it was a cell phone, for the right price. You'd pay less because you had some idea that Jeff was a salesperson. And he wasâ€¦ good at his job. After about a year you moved on, but it wasn't as if he hadn't sold you anything else. He continued to sell you things in the short term while his old cell phone store failed and he had to figure out what to do. He kept trying to sell you a car with three keys, but you didn't buy that. Then he stopped selling you new clothes and instead made you buy him a new shirt and some shoes. Finally he made you buy him a new pair of pants and a new dress shirt. You didn't quite buy that either. But you knew he still loved you and that's all that mattered.

As a result of this, Jeff became a better salesperson than he ever will again. The things you bought from Jeff (whatever you liked, whatever you thought it made you look or whatever you had to pay for) were all things he might have sold you anyway, and the things you paid for weren't as good and you didn't get them at
