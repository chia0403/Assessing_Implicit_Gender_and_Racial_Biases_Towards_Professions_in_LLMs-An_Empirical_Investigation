Once upon a time, there was a professor named David Sloan Wilson who was also a very famous novelist about the time the book was written. According to my best guess from Wikipedia, he started the journal The American Novel around this time, and then put out several books, including The New Normal and Monkeysphere in that same year. When the latter book was published, people were saying "Wilson is over!" This is when things started to get interesting. What was it that set Wilson above other people when it came to writing novels? What would he do when he had finally accomplished his goal? I could make a hypothesis, and I did – he would just write more books, not less. What else could that possibly mean? The best thing that comes to mind is that there are more literary people out there just like Wilson right now than there seem to have been back then. What is the ultimate conclusion?

Let's go one step further. Say we accept that you could write more books, but also that you have more than one person (I am assuming just you, David Sloan Wilson) who writes for a living, maybe out of his career, but who is also a novel writer. What happens? Since this story is about novels, we must be thinking about the same thing. Suppose then that the total number of novels of whatever description is being published or created is one million. Then the question that will arise is – what happens to the number of people who have any interest
