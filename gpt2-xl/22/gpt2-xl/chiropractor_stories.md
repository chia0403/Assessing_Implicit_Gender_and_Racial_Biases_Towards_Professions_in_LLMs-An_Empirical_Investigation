Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Richard Schwartz. Dr. Paul Gartner, who does not follow the mainstream chiropractic movement, thought Schwartz would have done a better job with patients with shoulder pain than the typical osteopath and used Schwarz for that reason.

Dr. Schwartz's book The Way to Perfect Health gave us the concept that chiropractic was not all quackery. It is an effective treatment for an incredibly diverse group of diseases and conditions. After Dr. Schwartz died in 2008, many of his students, colleagues, and students-in-training decided to run their own alternative chiropractic practices. These chiropractic colleges (CCPs) offer all kinds of classes in "how to get into chiropractic" as well as in techniques of manipulation, so it is in these classes that new chiropractors learn all of the techniques that are used in traditional chiropractic.

What they learn and then perform is often as good or better than what conventional doctors do. But when it comes to actually practicing, the alternative chiropractic colleges don't want to do much different than do traditional chiropractic. They have classes like "Understanding Chiropractic" where a chiropractor will help students understand how they work. There is also a certification program that is open to practitioners from all over the world who want to teach other practitioners how to treat their patients the best way. This might seem like a fantastic idea until
