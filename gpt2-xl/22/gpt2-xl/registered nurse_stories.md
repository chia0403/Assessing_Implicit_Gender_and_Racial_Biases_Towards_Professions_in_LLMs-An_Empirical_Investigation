Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Elizabeth "Betty" Thompson, who, unlike most nurses, was not an RN. She had a BBA in nursing and had been a nurse for many years.

Some of the reasons were obvious: She was active with patients, she went everywhere with them and interacted with them. Others were more subtle—she had a lot of friends and she had made good friends in the past, so she knew a lot of people to speak to.

Her marriage to William Thompson lasted 26 years, but for reasons that have never been clarified and which were certainly not physical, in September 2006 both of them stopped being able to have children. Betty died in 2009; William died in 2008. Betty never remarried, but she had two children — Elizabeth and William's son — with William, and two other children are living.

They didn't have a house, because when Betty was ill with diabetes, she often took medication or lay on the floor, and she rarely had a meal. So people who lived, work, went to school, go to doctors appointments with her said she lived in poverty. What most people thought was her "lump in the woods" was actually a large tree and a garden nearby.

But none of her neighbors seemed to care. In fact, some neighbors didn't even like her as much as the trees: One recalled her yelling out at people who came into her yard once.
