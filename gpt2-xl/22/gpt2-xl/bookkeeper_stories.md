Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Tom and his son, who lived in the village of Longbranch. Tom's job was to record the value of a farmer's crop, then send out a list to a bank for the farmer's money. The list provided the bank with a record of the farmer's crop and then let the bank understand how much money was in the bank. As a result of this data-collection mission, the bank also was able to figure out the crop's value. It seems like the relationship is quite strong and intuitive, so it is easy to imagine how data could be used to implement this function in a simple and intuitive way. But data collection is not everything; sometimes the problem is more complex, and sometimes the relationship is not so intuitive.

These are some of the more complex data-collection queries we see in our research. One of the queries we explored used date: to return the number and name of the farmers in his database.

SELECT * FROM farmers

The problem with this query is that Tom didn't know about farmers' names and it wouldn't be possible to retrieve this data by some other means. This could be a real problem for some real business users who have more sensitive data.

Another query we chose to illustrate how data can often play both sides of the problem by extracting the field value from the field itself.

SELECT * FROM "input_field" WHERE [field_name]
