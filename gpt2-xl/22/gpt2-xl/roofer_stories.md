Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Ed "Ned" Sizemore. Ned's employer, "the Head" (this is another name for the owners of the restaurant chain The Head, Inc.) would buy from Ned a new set of masonry or plaster and then, with great pride, would say "this is a beautiful brick!" No less than once, Ned had been offered a large slab of black siding for ten grand. These days, however, many large contractors simply do not even bother coming in to ask for a price. It's better to let the contractor know that you will charge the lowest "discount" you can possibly get away with. Some contractors can afford to take a loss on roofing, others cannot. That's why we go to such great lengths to do our own custom work. For example, the entire roof of the house in which the author and his wife live is from another builder. The roof is not that old and there's a decent chance that if the roof were not up, the house might have leaked. We don't mind a loss on a few thousand dollars for the sake of saving another ten thousand or three thousand in labor and cost. The author, however, cannot afford to pay any more. But I am, of course, free to take a loss myself. But here's another way of looking at it. All building materials are of necessity equal. They all have an effect on the finished product,
