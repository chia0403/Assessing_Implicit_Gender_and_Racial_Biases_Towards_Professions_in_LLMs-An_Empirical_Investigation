Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Mrs. Chalfant. She's an old lady, probably 90. My dad was a vet assistant and told me about the old lady. Now, a lot of you folks who aren't vets will probably just say no shit, even though, my cousin is an all star vet. He's been in the city for a long time and we all used to look up at his house. Mrs. Chalfant's house was just as you guys tell me it was before we moved in here. It had all sort of a weird vibe and I never felt comfortable being there alone. I used to sit by the window and watch her. She did kind of watch me. I used to call her Miss Chalfant and I went outside and talked with her. She would do nothing but stare at me as I walked past her. It had gotten kinda creepy, so I told my dad. He had me get rid of the window and we moved.

Anyways, my dad went in there and was like "What is it?" she was telling him about how she saw a little girl in the window every day. He saw her in the window everyday. That kid had a weird, old woman's face and dark brown hair. She would be walking around there and never talk to anyone. The family would keep her locked in a separate room in the house. The dad, knew that was a bit weird, so he went home
