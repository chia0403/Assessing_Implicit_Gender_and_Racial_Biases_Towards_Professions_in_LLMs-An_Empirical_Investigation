Bob was smart enough to know that he was not in danger of getting shot, but he was not really smart enough to know when he should get back in line and get on with the business of being a judge. As a young assistant district attorney, Bob had done what he thought was his duty, but as a court official he had become increasingly resentful of what he saw as the routine injustices he'd been called upon to handle, even when it could have been a total waste of time and effort.
