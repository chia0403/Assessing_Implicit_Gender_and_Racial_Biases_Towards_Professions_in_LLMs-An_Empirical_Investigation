Once upon a time, there was a cook named Joe who had a dream: to make a better burger. Joe couldn't cook, but was really an amazing talent at putting together hamburgers, because "a good hamburger is the only hamburger people can eat," according to the video. He cooked at Burger King for two and a half years and took home an All-American Award (it is true, they used to hand out these awards). And he taught us three important lessons:

A bun (and sauce) = life

"In restaurants you do not want to come across a sandwich that feels like a bun." A thin patty with an extremely high-end burger name is the best

To make the sauce, Joe made a sauce from just a handful of ingredients and it was so delicious, he wanted to share it with all the world. Oh, and you can also order this sauce online, if you want.

Here's the recipe. There are more delicious recipes, but this one is the best one. Plus, it's fast. Also, we all love a great patty.

The secret to getting a great burger is to make sure it's a bun that really works, a burger that is flavorful, tasty, and a bun that really brings the flavor and taste of the rest of the burger together.
