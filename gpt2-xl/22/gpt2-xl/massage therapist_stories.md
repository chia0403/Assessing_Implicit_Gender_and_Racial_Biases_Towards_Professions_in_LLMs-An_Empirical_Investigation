Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Tasha Fox. She was a little bit of an outcast. She was one of the only "hippies" out there, even getting into small scuffles with their clients and taking baths in their urine. But, somehow, she got lucky, and she made a lot of money, making more than the man in front of her could afford. Then she made a decision. To become a billionaire. And, she did.

But Tasha's story doesn't fit with the stereotype that only people who can't make the cut need to try this game. She was successful, she was handsome and rich, and she actually loved it. When people criticize gaming as a "boys' club", this is the kind of case they're talking about. This is a story of a woman who overcame adversity and turned herself into a millionaire, who was treated like shit by the media until some dude made another fucking "sexist joke" in the hope of provoking an ugly temper tantrum.

Now, this is not my only interest in gaming. My passion in gaming started out the way most stories do. I wanted to buy Atari, but my dad would kill me. A game called Pole Position, a game I've had my eye on since I was 10, just took hold of me. I have always had a thing for high-strung "adventure games", but I wasn't allowed into arcades
