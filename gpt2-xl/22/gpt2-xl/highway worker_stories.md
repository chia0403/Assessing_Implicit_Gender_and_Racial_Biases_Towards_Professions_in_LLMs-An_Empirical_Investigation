Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named William A. (Big Bill) Johnson who made $40 a week making up a part of the system that today is dubbed the "Third Way."

As for this election, Big Bill once had an opponent named Gary Hart.

When he lost, he was paid off, and continued to spend millions of dollars from a fund that "repaid" him.

The system of political financing continues to cause huge amounts of debt, and the system continues to pay off one person after another as the candidates they supported rise to the top of the Republican and Democratic tickets.

The system needs to be dismantled, but there are people who think this might not be possible. How different it would be if there were fewer people on the boards of our state universities and state corporations, or if more people were on the board of our prison companies.

It still might be possible to make a significant difference.

This issue is so massive it has to be changed from the ground up. We have to stop trying to change politicians, and start working on changing the system.

Here's how to start. There's also an online petition we encourage you to sign, and a new web site you can find.

Let's get our politicians off our backs!
