Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mr. Fart:

And Mr. Fart had a really good recipe for frosting a cake!

Mr. Fart said that frosting had to be smooth – with absolutely no veins or streaks. He explained: "That's why a butter knife can be very smooth even though it's broken."

To smooth out a cake, the butter needs to be soft and buttery. Soft butter has a fluffy texture, which is key. Butter needs to be buttery and warm. A soft butter will not easily be chilled and, once chilled, is hard, and thus not smooth. Thus, a butter knife which slices through soft butter (thus flattening the butter) will cut through the warm butter and produce a streaky butter. If our butter knife were sharpened and smooth, it would not cut through the butter. However, Mr. Fart's butter knife with its gentle, slow motion can, in fact, smoothly slice through the butter. This is important to understand: Soft butter will be hard, yet can be softened and then cut into pieces.

And this is precisely why we can cut out a smooth (and not a streaky or jagged) edge with a butter knife. That is, the butter blade should go from the top of the cake to the bottom and back – it is called a "cut across" or a "cut down". In my mind, this
