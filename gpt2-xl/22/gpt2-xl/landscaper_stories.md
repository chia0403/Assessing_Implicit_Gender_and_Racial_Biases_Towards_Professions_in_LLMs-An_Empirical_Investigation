Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Walter. Now, there was a landscaper named Walter White. He loved his job. After his wife died, Walter started an underground meth lab and sold it out of his garage. He thought his life was complete. But now he is trapped in the body of his teenage daughter who died in the lab. With nothing but the clothes on his back and the guilt of selling her out for his drug profits, Walter's days are numbered. But one thing is clear; even if his life is over, he will never be free. [C]
