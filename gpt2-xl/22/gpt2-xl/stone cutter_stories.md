Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named G.L.O.R.L. (Good Luck, Rock Legend) who had set out on a journey to find out the truth behind the legend of a "King Rock" near a remote village. On his journey, he discovered that a secret civilization and an evil army existed underneath the mountain, and with just a little help from the villagers, he could stop the evil forces. He set out to prove to the villagers that he lived up to his "King Rock" name after all. The villagers soon realized the truth about the rock, however, and so did G.L.O.R.L. when he found out that one of the local children had already learned of its powers, but had decided to use it against humanity. G.L.O.R.L. was forced to leave town so that he could escape and continue on his quest to uncover the truth behind this power...
