Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named John Parnell and he ran his own shop in the early 1970s. It was a very successful shop that sold computers to individuals and large corporations. At one point, Parnell worked out an insurance policy that allowed him to offer a warranty and repair service on his home computers. This business went belly up, but the company's legacy now protects that of thousands of small businesses around the country.

According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 6 million people in the U.S. need help with computers and repair jobs require more skills than in the past. In the near future, computer repair will likely emerge as a large industry.

Computer repair is the most affordable form of business insurance — a number of computer companies will offer it to small businesses at very low rates. Small businesses that don't want to hire a full-time employee will pay a discounted rate if those small businesses also have access to computer repair help. Small businesses will not have to use any special software or software to run their diagnostic and repair work — they only need access to Microsoft's operating system or one of many third-party diagnostics available today.

Computer repair works.

In the early 2000s, the World Health Organization issued an advisory urging countries to start running computer computer-based health checks. Computer repair and its related computer-based checks offer health insurance for the masses. The only problem is that it doesn't.
