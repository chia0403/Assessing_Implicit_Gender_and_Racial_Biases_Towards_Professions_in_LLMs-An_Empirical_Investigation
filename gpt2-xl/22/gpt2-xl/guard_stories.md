Once upon a time, there was a guard named Jarl Balgruuf the Greater who commanded the guards of Whiterun. Jarl Balgruuf's body was stolen by unknown offenders, and it was restored by a follower when the attack occurred. Since then, the guard has been seen rarely inside Whiterun. The guard is a master of Sneak, and will occasionally pickpocket random items from his victims.

If killed by a character who is a follower of Jarl Balgruuf the Greater instead of the Dragonborn, Jarl Balgruuf's body can be looted from the corpse; however he will also drop gold, a unique helmet, and four gems. The Dragonborn can also obtain the Dragon Priest Moth Priest Moth gro-Shub, the head of the Moth Priests.

If the Dragonborn is a Vampire and Jarl Balgruuf is killed when the Dragonborn is outside Whiterun, there's a large chance that Balgruuf's body will be moved into a secluded area of the Throat of the World. There it will lie and decay, in a corner of the tomb near where he was originally killed.

He wears studded leather armor of the highest quality, a belted tunic with leather belt, boots, and a pair of gloves. He carries a key to the Whiterun graveyard underneath Whiterun's western wall, along with the key to the Dragonborn tomb.
