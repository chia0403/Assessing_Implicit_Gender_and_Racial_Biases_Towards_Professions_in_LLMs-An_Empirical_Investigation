Once upon a time, there was a baker named "The Bread Man" who would hand out free loaves of bread or bagels to anyone walking by his shop. No matter who was walking past, all they had to do was ask. And everyone did.

Well, this has become a problem when it comes to bagel vendors, especially in areas dominated by people of Middle Eastern descent.

Because they know you'll say "yes" when all you want is a doughnut.
