Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named "Flutter" who got stuck in a giant butterfly trap.

Then, at some point in the early 1960's, a flight attendant named "Dinky" who was also trapped at the top of that butterfly trap, was saved by a little girl named "Dilly".

And, because Dilly was good on the outside, Flutter was sent in for her to be trained. He spent two years in the attic, while the rest of the crew lived outside.

Flutter got out by the time Dilly was ready to fly again.

Flocker worked the last 11,300 hours in a cockpit in a Boeing B-58 Hustler to finish the career that Dinky started.

The plane is owned by the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum.
