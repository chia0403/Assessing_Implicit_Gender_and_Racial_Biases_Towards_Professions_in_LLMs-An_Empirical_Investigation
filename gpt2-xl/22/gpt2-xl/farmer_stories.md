Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Mr. Clements. His farm was about a mile from the center of his town, and a traveler would come to his door every day. He raised all sorts of animals for slaughter, and his home, or rather, cottage, was located just over on a steep hillside. One day a group of travelers visited him; every one of them an old man with a white beard who wore spectacles.

They had come to Clements because they wanted to work as his herders for three days (two for the day and one for the rest of the week). The work was very hard and they had to work hard. They lived in a small cabin with wooden floors and a roof made from branches from tall trees.

"My dear, dear, old friend, come near my cabin. I am dying of hunger. Can you tell me who will pay for the dinner?"

"I will," said Clements, "but I have no money with me to pay. Why, I have no money any the more I came to your door. Please, old fellow, be content and eat my dinner. There does not seem to be any other way."

After lunching on the deer meat and potatoes provided by Clements (which they ate easily), the travelers departed and began their journey back home. However, the man didn't see their carriage until after they were nearly across the river from his home.
