Once upon a time, there was a police officer named J.D. Tippens.

His job was to make sure the little girls in the neighborhood came home safe.

He'd ride his bicycle down the streets, stopping at the homes of all the kids who didn't live in his precinct. Or at least try to. He'd see a family walk right by him on a porch, and he'd shout, "Are you okay?"

One day, Tippens did a pretty routine check. He stopped a truck driving down a dark street.

Tippens pulled up behind it to say something. He was a big guy on a plain black uniform, so the driver knew he'd already made the driver's entrance.

The old man got out and handed him a piece of paper. He wrote a note on the back, addressed to "Officer J.D. Tippens."

The driver said nothing. He drove slowly into the police station parking lot, stopped, looked down at the letter. And then, with a slight smile, he unlocked the door and got back in, drove on in the direction that he thought a person must have come from.

Tippens sat in the interrogation room as a deputy and police sergeant interrogated him. They knew what he'd been throughâ€”he worked 14-hour shifts, his family had been destroyed. But they also knew he was a good cop, a good man
