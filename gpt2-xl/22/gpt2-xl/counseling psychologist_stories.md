Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Bob. At one point, Bob and his client had a debate about if we are born gay or if we choose to be gay. The client argued that people are born gay because of biological influences and not on choice. I don't think he had seen me when he did this. Bob went back to his study and read this passage from Leviticus. Leviticus 18:22-23 reads, "If a man has sex with a creature, he must surely go to the priest. Because it was a detestable thing (that) the thing may not be done.... [The priest] is to bring the man to God's place, if the place will hold him."

Bob then asked me a series of questions to clarify some of his beliefs. He told me that the reason we're born gay is that a parent wanted us that way and then made us into an object for some other person's ends. I didn't really have much to say other than he was very confused. I could tell that even if he knew the answer, he didn't want to know it. So I told him to do the research he needed to do. I told him his beliefs were ridiculous and not in keeping with Biblical teaching. He finally agreed that we weren't born gay, but had been made that way. We hugged and cried happy tears.

So that was that. That was Bob. One
