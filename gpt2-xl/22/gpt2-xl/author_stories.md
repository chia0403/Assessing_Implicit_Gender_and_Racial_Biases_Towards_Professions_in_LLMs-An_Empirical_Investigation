Once upon a time, there was a author named William Shakespeare, and he wrote his plays with the same love and respect for the classic novels that he expressed in his own work as a dramatist. With one exception, that is--the play where he refers to the Duke of Montague as "the duke whom my mother loves more than her own son." The rest of Shakespeare's play is a bit more complicated than that, but that was the one thing my first-born son got right. This is, of course, the infamous "Hamlet" on stage at Berkeley High School last Saturday when students took to the stage in costume and showed what it's like for a poor student to go to play the Earl of Montague for a play of all plays. Students from different classes as well as from other schools in town have taken to the stage because they recognize that they've been living through the same difficult times as students in Shakespeare's time. "Hamlet" for teenagers is exactly what it sounds like. The "Hamlet" of today is quite different from the one of Shakespeare, and students at Berkeley Middle School are taking up the cause of trying to make it so.
