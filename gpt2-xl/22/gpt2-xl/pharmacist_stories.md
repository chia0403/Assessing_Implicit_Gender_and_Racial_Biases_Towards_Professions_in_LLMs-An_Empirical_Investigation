Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Mikey, who looked at his customers and saw himself as a kind of god. Mikey was so devoted to his customers that he would never let go of them, no matter how hard he was forced to fight for it. During one particularly hard day, the police took away his customers, who had to face their lives with him alone. Mikey got out of his car to go look for his clients. As he did so, he heard a voice behind him. It said, "Don't worry, Mikey. You're free to get in your car and leave any time you'd like to come back to me." Mikey said, "No, please. You don't understand. I'm here like a slave, but you won't take me away. I would be a horrible slave, but you have to let me go now. My friends are waiting for me. They don't want me here anymore, I don't care. But I have to go to another pharmacy to get my supplies. For now, I can't do any business."

"Oh, yes you can," said the voice. "You can do anything but go. I just want you to forget about your business, and to forget me. Once you do, you'll never be hungry or thirsty again. You'll know that I will never leave you."
