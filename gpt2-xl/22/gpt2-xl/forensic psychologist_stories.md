Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Dr. Kenneth Lanning.

Lanning was a brilliant scientist with a passion for the paranormal, who worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He was known for his groundbreaking work on telepathy, and even wrote a book on the subject. It wasn't until about ten years ago, however, that Lanning's research was subjected to a thorough and thorough review, and it was concluded that he is a fraud. But even more concerning than his work, may be his personal life. A brief description of the man is not enough to describe the degree to which Lanning was not just a great scientist, but a master manipulator of humans. He's described as being an expert in the subject of "holography" and "telepathy" and using these abilities to create the illusion of psychic abilities that may be achieved to varying degrees.

But as troubling as his conclusions may be as to his personal integrity, there's little doubt for those who were paying attention to him, Lanning's research also had far reaching effects on society at large; his research has been responsible for creating the conditions and conditions that make it much easier to use this sort of power to manipulate people. His ideas have been utilized for everything from the MKultra/CIA mind control program of the 1960′s – 1980′s, to the modern day military experiments conducted by the U.S. government as well as private companies
