Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named "Sleeping Beauty". She was a terrible beauty who slept all day long and never put on a single garment...until one day after doing a very fancy and expensive haircut, I had to give her the following message: "I am going to cut your hair in ten minutes. If I do not get to the salon by then, you are going to have a lot of problems". She took me by the hand and I asked her to go get dressed again. She turned to the mirror. "Sir, I can't get her hair back!" She got dressed and the next thing we knew, she arrived at the salon...with her hair standing straight up! When she put on her hair, she noticed that the left side had a lot of the texture back, although it had gone wrong on the right side. So she said, "I think I will get the right side tonight, and I think I will get the left side tomorrow, with a great fuss." She walked back to the mirror and said, "I see now! I can see my hair starting to form!" She went back to the salon and got her lovely hair in perfect condition with no problems at all! She said later, "I never felt so good about my hair. It was the best night's sleep I ever had!"...and that is what women say, at least if you get what they say about their hair and the way it
