Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Paul, who helped out a friend in trouble. Paul had not worked hard, but was respected by those around him: his friends respected Paul. One of them asked if Paul was a Christian.

Paul was a Christian. Then he said, "I am afraid of God."

So Paul went to his friend, and said, "Hey, how about this? Is it true you lost your job because you're a Christian?"

His friend said, "Yes."

"I don't like this idea at all," Paul said. "I think it's a good idea to be honest with people, but I don't think it's a good idea to go around saying it's okay to be a Christian. No matter what the other guy says, or what his family and friends and colleagues say, it just upsets me. I like to be honest with people, but it's upsetting me."

On the off-chance this analogy didn't seem particularly terrible — which, judging by the fact that it's an illustration of our own experience — you probably don't have to take the Christian friend's word for it. As I mentioned before, your friends aren't usually in on this: no matter how devout or righteous their faith, whether they're actively telling you how wonderful your belief in Jesus is or are only mentioning it in passing, they are your friends for precisely these reasons. They respect you
