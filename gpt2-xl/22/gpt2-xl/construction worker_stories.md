For a man without a steady income, it was quite successful until the day he got a terrible job which required him to perform tasks for twelve hours a day under horrible conditions. Once he got to work for the company that owned, built and operated the factory building he worked in, he soon came to the realization that he had no clue why he was doing these things. For all he cared, he could get out and enjoy the summer or even the winter or the whole year, and he'd be grateful for it!
