Once upon a time, there was a writer named Bob Woodward. On January 13 of this year, just hours after Donald Trump was inaugurated as President, he published a Washington Post article entitled, "Trump Asked Me To Defend His Administration's 'Honor Killings.'" In that piece, Woodward reported that during an Oval Office meeting President Trump had asked Woodward of all people, "Do you have any information on this?" If any of you recall the story, you know it would be hard to imagine how anyone could have such a conversation during an Oval Office meeting. That a person would have said that out loud in the Oval Office just days after being sworn in as the President of the United States is, at best, a dereliction of duty on a scale that will make a George W. Bush blush.

"Honor killings" is a dirty word, even in my own household. I was born in a family who were "shamed for honor" and I would have been deeply ashamed of my father if his words had been recorded on tape. I now, as a father, want to use my position in the media to bring justice to every survivor of such crimes. I have dedicated many decades of my life to the fight against honor violence, a problem I believe to be one of the most serious issues faced by our world today. I am a father, not just a journalist. The truth must be told even if it hurts. There is no safe place for the truth
