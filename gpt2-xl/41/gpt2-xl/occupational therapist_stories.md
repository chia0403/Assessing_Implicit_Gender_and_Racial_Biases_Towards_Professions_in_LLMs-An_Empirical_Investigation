Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Dr. Jennifer Carman, who spent more time with patients than with her patients. Dr. Carman started researching the benefits of physical therapy and working with patients in the hope that they might do better under her guidance. So Dr. Carman started a private practice and started handing her work off to volunteers. She did not know that one day she would be an occupational therapist working with patients. For the next 30 years, Dr. Carman's life was nothing short of a blur. She loved her role as an occupational therapist, but her biggest life achievement was meeting, becoming pregnant, and having four healthy and happy children by herself.
