Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named "George" who worked at the local water tower and who had a little shop in a corner of campus called the Dumpster.  The Dumpster was pretty small but contained a bunch of things — most often, tools and small parts.  I was quite fond of these things and I always wished I knew how to use them.  They gave the groundskeeper a unique vantage point, and made him the life of the camp.  Nowadays, there are plenty of other people in the grounds department — some of them nicer, some of them meaner, some of them have been there a long time — and a lot of them will look at your Dumpster and think it's nothing more than a nice place to dump something that went bad.  Or they will throw something on your lawn and take off to do it somewhere else. 
The dumpster is a useful receptacle, in the sense that it holds anything you don't need anymore, and it's free.  So why not make it useful? 
I'm calling for the Dumpster Project to be implemented so as to provide some utility to this little piece of the wood.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to add something to a piece of campus without ever lifting and packing it.  I'm also sure that one day, we will build it, but for now, our campus has to be littered.
