Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Frank Reynolds. A successful entrepreneur with a good reputation, Frank had inherited a great mansion. The home featured luxurious amenities, it had three ballrooms, two theaters, an auditorium and a tennis court, and five-star service. Many of his wealthy clients enjoyed their stay in the resort, including several politicians. But one evening Frank left to attend a funeral, and the guests were not very hospitable. The hotel staff, and his own guests, were not as forgiving. Frank died from the incident, and for the moment, the estate was cursed. People came and went, as they pleased, and the entire place was condemned. As the years passed without any development, the curse was broken. Frank's wife's family was buried in the grounds, and the mansion was used for charity events, but it would have to wait.

While Frank had been buried there, another estate was being built nearby. The building, complete with Frank's marble sarcophagus, was to be named Frank Reynolds. However, one day, a careless employee came upon the ruins of Frank's tomb and broke the mausoleum's curse. The building, and the sarcophagus, remained untouched, and became homes for homeless kids. After some more renovations, it was home to the Franklin Middle School. And, the building was opened for business today.

Frank Reynolds Middle School, located in the middle of Downtown Nashville, was
