Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Steve Aoki who was a major factor in taking the indie scene from underground to the level we see it now. Some time after his career (his last album came out in 2007), his old band re-formed and released a couple of EPs, before finally going on to bigger stages like Ultra, Madison Square Garden, Lollapalooza and Tomorrowland a year later. In the year between the release of their second EP (The Perfect Drug) in early 2006 and their third album, They're Still Here, all four members of the band – Steve Aoki, Jason Lajoie, Mike McCready and Mark Hoppus – started writing new music together. Despite having just formed a new band, they decided to call their project The A-Team (in the same way that they call themselves The-Dream or The-Dreamclub on The A-Team). The songs coming out of this era of the band's career tend to be very energetic rock songs, with big guitars strumming, bass playing, and high energy riffs. The songs also tend to have almost an R&B sound with a little bit of hip-hop and R&B thrown in there as well. The songs that came out of the period of their career where A-Team were still together, that is, before they went on to play bigger stages with more attention, were often very catchy and have a lot of hooks.
