Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Scott McCorkle. Scott was passionate about graphic design (or graphic design being passionate about graphic design), and was always trying to improve his craft. One day, he came across a web page that listed every single color on the color wheel. It was a daunting task, but Scott found a solution and put it to use in his daily work.

You may be wondering why he wanted the color wheel because after all, only the experts know that. While color is an extremely basic tool that our brain uses to perceive and represent everything, there are many colors that can help us determine if something is good or is it bad. By knowing which colors the designer put in their design, we can know which colors have good potential or bad potential.

The Color Wheel has been used for decades in all sorts of industries as part of product, packaging, and advertising. This color wheel is extremely common on the home, while school and workplace color sheets are also commonly used. There is a reason why this page was able to become so popular over the years.

Color Therapy

Color therapy is a psychological technique that uses certain colors to help improve mood, confidence, and well-being. It is essentially using colors that our brains associate with good situations to trigger happy feelings.

There are two major types of color therapy: Red/Green, and Blue/Yellow. They are both related, but their differences are important.
