Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Sandra Davenport, who had a job that was very hard for her because it required long hours, often on weekends alone and at night at her home. This job didn't require much of her. But, for many reasons--some good and some bad--she could not do it for long. Eventually, she retired, and moved to Michigan, where she became the Director of Health Services for the Humboldt County School District. The job required her to stay at home. The job is tough, certainly, but it is not impossible to do the job. As a result, it is a job that many people cannot do on their own. The fact that Sandra Davenport could not stay home to care for her seriously ill husband, and instead had to spend many nights and weekends away from her family, was really tragic, but she took it on nonetheless.

I've discussed this story before. Sandra Davenport also had a son, who had some health issues of his own. As a result, he spent some time in a hospital where he underwent treatment. He was placed in daycare, where it was possible for him to come to the hospital. There, he was able to spend hours per day under the care of medical and nursing staff. It was all quite easy to do, I guess.

So, why did Sandra Davenport think it was okay for her son to receive health care
