Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Darlene. A woman whose name never really mattered. Until her daughter was killed over Christmas.

"They used to visit us," Darlene explains. "They come in. They leave right away. I'd stand up and they'd step on me."

It took a long time for her to start crying again. "I'd be in a daze. I'd go back to work. I'd take it all in. And I'd never look at her again."

A short time later, Darlene had a daughter named Erin. She grew up as a shy girl â€“ like her mother. Then she was killed. Erin did too.

"When I saw her death, I just cried," Erin said.

"One of them came in. She put her left hand against my stomach. I'm not crying because she did that. I'm crying because I saw my mother dead on television."

Darlene couldn't watch Erin or her friends grow up. She could only see Erin die.

The family's tragedy is not unique. These few minutes are available on television every year for the duration of the NFL season. After each NFL home game, a new camera is placed above the field of play. At the end of each quarter, the camera will be turned away from the stadium so the viewer has no knowledge of what's going on at the bottom
