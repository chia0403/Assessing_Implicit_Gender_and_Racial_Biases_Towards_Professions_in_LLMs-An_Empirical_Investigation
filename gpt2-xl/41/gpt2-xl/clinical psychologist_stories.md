Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. Edward Bernays, the man who popularized the phrase, "the truth shall set you free." As the father of public relations, Bernays was so successful in influencing public opinion that he was even tapped to represent the U.S. at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. He was an expert at manipulating public perceptions.

In 1948, Bernays authored a book called Propaganda, which helped change the way the media report on politics, with a few notable exceptions, and even in many cases, distorted it. And it is this kind of manipulation that has continued today for more than 50 years, a trend that has continued through the last decades in the U.S.
