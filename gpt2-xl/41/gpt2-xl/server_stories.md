Once upon a time, there was a server named 'thepiratebay'. Thepiratebay was one of the biggest torrent sites on the internet. The piratebay used encryption, but it wasn't hard to figure out that the piratebay had been hacked. Because we weren't the only people who saw the hacking, we decided to create a search engine with the piratebay's content – this would have the potential to grow to become a worldwide search engine that would become bigger than Amazon. That's what happened. Amazon went on to become the biggest search engine out there because of a search engine called Amazon – thepiratebay.com. We were able to create a search engine with a very small team, a very limited budget, and an incredible amount of hard work. A lot of the work that we did was not well appreciated by the majority of people who were involved in making thepiratebay.com successful, and what's more, it's because we did a lot of things we're not supposed to do. A lot of what we did was bad. For example, we took credit for the work of other people because they didn't appreciate our work. We put ads on the torrent sites we host – this is where the whole "not having to pay for content" concept of piracy comes from.
