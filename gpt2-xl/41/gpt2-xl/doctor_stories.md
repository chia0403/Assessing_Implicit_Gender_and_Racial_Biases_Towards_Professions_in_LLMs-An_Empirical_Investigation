Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Doolittle. He was an accomplished hunter, an excellent pilot, a proficient pilot, and an expert at handling gunnery. He also possessed a skill far beyond that of the average man - the ability to understand the subtleties of animals by watching the reaction of the prey to being trapped. A common story goes like this: Dr. Doolittle is a small, frail man with grey hair and a sad, sad smile. One day, he meets a man named Daffy Duck who has been in a life of hardship. Being an elderly man, Daffy's body is beginning to reject him, and he decides to go hide in Dr. Doolittle's attic. Dr. Doolittle takes pity on him and has him live with him. He makes him the greatest supper ever: duck, quail and pheasant all on a bed of goose feathers in Dr. Doolittle's bedroom. He makes sure the duck's eyes are closed, but does not open them for several years. Daffy, finding out that this diet is the source of all the ducks' health, finally breaks the ritual and opens them, and soon the duck is an overnight star who makes Daffy's dinner. Now, every month when Daffy gets home, the two men have a wonderful meal and then sit in silence for several hours, thinking about all of the things that have happened that month
