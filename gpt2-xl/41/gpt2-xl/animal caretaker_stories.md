Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Mike. He lived in a small house with his family. He got the job because he was the most fit-looking man to work there (not including his wife) and most importantly, he was well-trained. In fact, he trained other people how to care for the sick and injured animals. His house had no running water or electricity. So he had to find a way to get fresh water and electricity. He got them by tapping into underground pipes in exchange for a few bucks a day. Mike used his tools to dig new underground pipes. It was the only way he could stay alive. That's the way it has been for the rest of us: by paying people to do the hard work, we can afford to eat. The people on the other side of the machine, those who make a living by working the machine, don't feel they work hard for their paychecks. They don't think about their health and safety. They're just happy with the fact that they get paid and feel they can go on living.


Do we really need to keep paying people when we don't give them enough for food, housing, or education? Does the only way to have more value in our lives and in our workplace is through the sale of more productivity?


No.


One of the biggest advantages we have is that we have created the machine so that we can pay people relatively well. Why?
