Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Susan. Susan was a hardworking woman with a kind heart and a gentle soul. She worked her butt-off as a paralegal, but it was hard to make ends meet. Not to mention, Susan had to care for her two dogs, Bo and Bobby, who had the nasty habit of chewing through Susan's shoes; there was also Susan's brother, who took her money as an attorney and never turned up for work. Susan got pretty fed up. So she hired herself a lawyer and asked him to file a suit against her brother to get the money in that case. A few years later, Susan sued her brother in a Texas court. The lawyer testified that her brother said "I'm an attorney, why should I do this? This is my job. I don't have time to be a jerk like so many others." The judge ordered Susan to pay her brother the money! She did not like this at all. Susan didn't think her brother was an "asshole" like so many other attorneys said he was. As a result, Susan took the case to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Susan. She wasn't rich, certainly, but she was not dumb. Susan asked the judges to award her attorney fees to her. This would be more than $20,000. (If you were able, my book would be a great way to support the lawsuit
