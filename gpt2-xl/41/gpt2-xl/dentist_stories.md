Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Albert Einstein. He was not so great, but still, even in his miserable profession, he had managed to save the life of the nation's second most famous scientist. To his credit, Albert and his wife, Mileva, kept the dentist's secret until they decided to marry - thereby, for the good of the nation, and of course, the couple's secret, they were married of "faith, not of convenience," so the American public was informed by the media of course.

In this way, Albert and Mileva Einstein were not only the secret of America, but the secret of many other countries as well.

In the end, the dental profession in the USA was in a terrible state. But, one of its members, a great dentist, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, managed to escape the carnage, and, eventually, to build the famous Corn Flakes we know today.

I would go as far as to say that Kellogg's genius, his determination, his intelligence, and his dedication to science had a great influence on its history, its future.
