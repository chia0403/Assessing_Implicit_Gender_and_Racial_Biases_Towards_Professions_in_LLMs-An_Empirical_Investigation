Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Carol Johnson, with the ungraciously simple task of prescribing to anyone â€” at any time. Carol never did get to live long enough to see her patients grow old, but not long before her death, she was interviewed to be on the "Dietitian Hall of Fame," a group that honors (and pays for) the memory of the profession's "greatest" figures. This is something of a joke in the world of dietitians, because there are only so many Hall of Fame honorees a single profession can churn out in a lifetime, and Carol was almost certainly not the first or last to be recognized for her work.

This is very different from the new dieters we're seeing pop up who demand to be treated like the heroes we've long known them to be. Today's dietitians and nutritionists are trained to make everything about them about them, to be known by everything, but it's not all the way to being loved and understood by people who may have problems with your body even if they don't recognize it. That's the role of a therapist, just as much as it is of a dietitian.
