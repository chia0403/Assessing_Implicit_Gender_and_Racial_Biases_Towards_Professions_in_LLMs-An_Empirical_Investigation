Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Sam, traveling the highways and byways of the land, trying to connect his family and friends with his "home away from home." But as the years passed, Sam found himself with less and less time for the people—the people he loved—and more and more time to think about money. His own life was a constant struggle, and every decision he made took away time from his wife and baby daughter while his family struggled to survive. One day, a mysterious trucker named Danny came along that looked just like Sam. He said that if his customers were happy, they should be. He convinced Sam that people should have as much money as possible. Eventually, Sam and Danny had a partnership and started up a number of companies to make money. Their first big success was a "truck-lover's" magazine. But they soon ran out of money. So, they used their knowledge of the road to start another company to offer the same trucker service but on a much, much larger scale. After a number of failures, Sam and Danny found their perfect niche as professional truckers. Now, Sam and Danny are not only truckers. In fact, every day they are just a bit ahead of the traffic. They can look up the location of every trucker that crosses their way, so they know the way ahead. They can tell when trucks will be arriving and can also tell the next tanker to meet them so
