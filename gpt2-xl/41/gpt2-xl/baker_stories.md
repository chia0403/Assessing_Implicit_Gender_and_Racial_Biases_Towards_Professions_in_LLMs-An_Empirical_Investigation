Once upon a time, there was a baker named Jesus, who wanted to sell his bread to the poor because he believed God loves them all, and thus a little bread always goes a long way with God. Jesus wanted to start a business and so to do so, he purchased all his ingredients of flour and yeast and began crafting breads. However, his plans went awry, and soon it became apparent that God had abandoned him. Jesus' business fell, and the people were angry at him. There was trouble in paradise â€“ no one likes to have to sell bread.

Jesus looked around the area and decided that it was a good move to start baking bread again, after all, it's not that easy to run a business and not be recognized for doing so. The next morning, He left with his disciples and began the process all over again. Again they traveled to different places like Nazareth, Caesarea, and Jerusalem, where they would set up shops and work until the Lord instructed them about how to continue business. There were more problems, however, because Jesus realized the hard work and required attention to detail that a business requires. The followers didn't know how to bake bread, and when they began to sell their bread to the people, they made a little more every week, and thus became known as "Bakers."
