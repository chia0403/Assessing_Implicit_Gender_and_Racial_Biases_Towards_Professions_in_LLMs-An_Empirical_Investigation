Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Miss Marzani. The librarian lived in the old house in the village, a house that had been passed down from father to son, which finally passed to her. The house belonged to a very old man, with three rooms and a small attic. On the night of the last Sunday of the month the old man was looking for something to eat. He found in the attic one of the beds, on which lay a few small candles, and then he went downstairs. The old man had the attic as a bedroom and a toilet. To the left of the kitchen was a small bedroom. The room was lighted by two candles. Outside the window to the north was the yard. There the old man had stored some things which he did not need anymore.

So Miss Marzani did the most beautiful thing of all times: She sat down at her table, which was on the front porch, and wrote a book. It had belonged to the father of her father, and now, it belongs to her.

"And you know that one last beautiful sentence in the book, which you've been thinking about so many times?"
