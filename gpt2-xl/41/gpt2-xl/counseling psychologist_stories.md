Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. G. M. Gorman, who advised the city on how best to handle sexual abuse allegations. Gorman is remembered as the chief "traumatics" of the city. He had a reputation for providing a detailed account of sexual molestation. According to an account in the Detroit Free Press, Gorman wrote of this one encounter. This is not an isolated and unalloyed case. Indeed, he described in detail multiple instances of how people in the "program" were abused. Gorman had his own reputation in the program – he was the "Dr." – for his ability to see through trauma. He had patients who would not speak to him for months on end, but when Gorman walked in Gorman would talk to them and then he would forget that he had talked to them. He did this all the time. He gave patients nicknames: "Charity," "Hippie," "Dana" and "Shasta."

This doctor was, in fact, a pedophile, according to the report of Gorman's investigation as to the city's role in running the program and its employees. However, it was not only Gorman's own patients who had a problem with him, but other people: a woman said that Gorman showed her pornographic images, while others who saw him were afraid to tell their friends because they themselves worked for the program and had a bad feeling about it
