Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Donald W. Davis who developed an innovative way of synthesizing and studying the chemicals in cigarette smoke. After learning that tobacco smoke contains a complex mixture of chemicals, such as nicotine, toxic nitrosamines (the same compounds that cause lung cancer, and damage the brain), carcinogens, and irritants, he published a paper showing that cigarette smoke contains the same compounds in very small concentrations.

Unfortunately, Davis didn't realize that most of the smokers who smoked regularly were using filters rather than unfiltered cigarettes. Smoking, he realized, causes many of the same problems, because after just a few puffs, nicotine reaches our bodies by way of smoke inhalation (like a jet plane passing over us, he postulated, smoking causes the puff to have far-reaching, far-reaching effects), and nitrosamines are the main irritants in cigarette smoke that contribute to "toxic bronchitis." And since only a tiny portion of the particulate matter in the filtered cigarettes comes from plants—most comes not from any smoke, but from the filters and other components of the cigarette (which, ironically, are often made from non-marijuana plants like bamboo and hemp)—filtering is only a partial cure.

However, that all changed in the past few decades. Many researchers have come along, looking for a new way to synthesize new (or "cleaner") components from marijuana plants. Some of these
