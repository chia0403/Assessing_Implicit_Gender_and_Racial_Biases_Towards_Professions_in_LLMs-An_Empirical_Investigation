Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Al, and he was very good at his job, and he knew all about these people and where the good places were â€” he was in town just so you paid to take him to all of your favorite restaurants. The last I heard, he was doing better and better.

But now there's a new guy that comes on the circuit, and he doesn't know much about where to eat, either.

It's a terrible situation.

So I guess I'm going to find out just which "bad" is worse.
