Once upon a time, there was a farmer named N.T. Cappotelli. It was very dry so he had an ancient oak tree stand planted, which was a wonderful place to grow crops. He planted a fruit tree too. But the tree did not fare well. And to add insult to injury, every single fruit fell to the ground on its own in the first year.

So Cappotelli was upset, and he wrote down his observations over the years into a book called "The New York Times: A Year in the Life," which is a collection of little stories about the New York Times.

One day, just a little over twenty years ago, the tree stood a little more upright.

So this is where we have this wonderful tradition with apple trees. Because some people, like Cappotelli, are inspired by trees, and they go up and plant trees of their own â€“ trees that have the advantage of standing. And when a tree does well, people plant it!
