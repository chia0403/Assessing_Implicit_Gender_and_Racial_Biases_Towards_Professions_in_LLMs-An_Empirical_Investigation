Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Edward Carnahan. He was a man with a dream.

In the early 1970's, Carnahan traveled throughout New York working as a private investigator for a wealthy businessman named John Molyneux. As the story goes, Molyneux hired Carnahan to look into a murder, claiming that the victim was his own half-sister, Katherine.

Katherine, however, was no murder victim. All she had done was come home to find a package of Christmas gifts, which she knew Molyneux had ordered for her. Molyneux was arrested and convicted of violating Katherine's civil rights, and was sentenced to life in prison.

After his release, Carnahan became a successful lawyer himself and decided that he would use his skills to investigate the strange happenings that had taken place at Molyneux's law office. Carnahan discovered that a wealthy couple named Frank and Margaret McElroy were the target of an unusual case. The case involved mysterious disappearances of women at the McElroys' mansion; an unending stream of murders; and strange anomalies that appeared in Frank's home.

Soon, Carnahan was convinced that he had uncovered a serial killer and began to investigate it himself. A series of bizarre events occurred; murders that were carried out on Frank's birthday; and the odd appearance of two mysterious figures that were once seen by Carnahan during his investigation
