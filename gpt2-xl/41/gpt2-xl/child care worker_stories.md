Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Amy. One day, an adult named Steve came to her. He was the man who'd put her out with the trash. They started out together, but that all shifted when Amy started a relationship with Steve's wife, who was then still her boss. Steve then left her and began having an affair with the new receptionist. As the drama played out, Amy took on the role of Steve's ex-wife.

"You mean I'm a fucking wife?" she asked Steve.

"No, you're a whore," he answered.

"Are you trying to get back at me?"

"No," Steve said, "I'm still trying to get back at you."

So you see, the truth is that Amy was never much of a wife. To begin with, she had no interest in being one at all. She was always having a fucking affair. When she found out that Steve was having an affair with her old boss's wife, she turned around and found her own husband. That left her feeling completely naked, like she never had a chance at becoming one. As for Steve, he didn't take a wife very seriously and was constantly looking for any way to have more sex. In fact, he wasn't even very good at it.
