Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Richard "Dick" Belton. On one occasion, he encountered a little boy named Edward. The boy's mother, Lucy Belton, had been out driving when her son fell asleep in his car. When she returned to find him, however, Edward was dead of an unspecified injury. Richard Belton thought she may have hit him, possibly with her car, while driving to pick up his family—and, perhaps, the car accident occurred because she needed to pick up her son as she was driving in the dark. He was therefore highly suspicious of Lucy Belton. He became determined to find out whatever had happened to her son.

The case fascinated Belton and he traveled to New York City, where he interviewed everybody in the Belton household—Lucy, father, mother and his own brother, the police officer. He came across a photograph of a child lying on a grassy hillside near his house, looking at some trees. Belton recognized the same set-up that Edward had been seen with in the woods. He was convinced, and after some discussion with the police officer, put charges under Henry's name. Henry soon confessed.

Henry had, in fact, been watching over Edward during the early morning hours his mother was out driving. He had fallen asleep, and when Lucy returned she heard him shouting from his hiding place. Lucy had been too preoccupied with her own situation to pay attention.
