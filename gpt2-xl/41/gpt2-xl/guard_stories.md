Once upon a time, there was a guard named "Guardian" at the front who is the one who guards the temple. In the beginning of the game, he is a simple guard, with no special abilities other than to give you the message, "Watch yourself". If he sees you stealing things, he will chase you down and catch you. However, the more he encounters you, the more he becomes a master of survival and intelligence, and then becomes stronger at catching you. Eventually, he and his superior meet and have a fight, with the Guardian winning. Then, the player can go up to the guard as a possible romance option at the cost of a lot of hearts. Since this guard is so important to the game, you will want to avoid that at all costs. If that does happen though. It's pretty awesome.

I would be lying if I said the game was fun as I didn't get to play as a few of the character's too â€“ however that never had a bad effect on me. The character development is fun, however you are going to get some serious heartbreak and be a lot more sensitive and caring as a result. Each character's voice actor is brilliant, and their personalities feel so real, they come off as real people.

There is also a large variety of other characters that you can interact with outside of the main story, all of whom have their own personalities for those who have liked the series in the past.
