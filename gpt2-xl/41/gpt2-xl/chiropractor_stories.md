Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Charles Czeisler who had a philosophy which he espoused a little while ago (July 23, 2012). He had his doctorate in chiropractic and he believed that the "chiropractic diagnosis is best based on the diagnosis of the chiropractor (which, by the way, is sometimes based on the symptoms of the patient, but never on what is going on in the body of the patient)."

In other words, he believed that the diagnosis was the diagnosis.

Czeisler went on and declared an open, if not somewhat controversial, discussion on this topic. This discussion has gone on for over 100 years and is not new:

Czeisler proposed [in 1915] that the diagnosis should be based on the examination and palpation of the spine. The chiropractor would take advantage of the fact that the upper spine has no fixed structure, but is made up of a collection of tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves and muscles.

The bottom line is that the spine is just a collection of bones and tissues made up of living things that move about.

Czeisler was a very important individual because without his insight into chiropractic (which included his belief that the diagnosis based on the examination and palpation of the spine), medical science would be all but blind to many of the things that are happening in the body. It is a pity
