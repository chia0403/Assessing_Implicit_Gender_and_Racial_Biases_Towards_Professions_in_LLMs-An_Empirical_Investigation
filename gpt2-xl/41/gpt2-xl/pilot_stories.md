Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Jefferies with the nickname "Tiny." Tiny's first job in the air force began with a crash landing in the jungles of Vietnam. Tiny was airlifted out of the aircraft on a stretcher. Tiny could handle that. Over time, Tiny's job grew into one that required him to get dirty so that the rest of us could clean up. He began doing some heavy lifting on the jungle floor, but he always finished out his shift with an unearned bottle of scotch and a little cigarette. Then he would start off his next week at the same old job, never knowing that a year had passed and another one would fly through.

In Vietnam, Tiny's assignment was to clear the jungle. It was called "Operation Red Glove." It was Tiny's job to get things moving. He would fly around the jungle spraying it with insecticide, which was a mixture of herbicides, insecticides, and insecticides. The most lethal of the three, Agent Orange, was used by the Vietnam War. Tiny would use whatever he was given, including a load of "barnacles" that contained a mixture of Agent Orange and chlorine. The chemicals would get stuck on the barnacles, and there it would be waiting for the next plane to come in to drop more on. Tiny never thought of the collateral damage that might occur when he went door-to-door spraying the jungle with liquid waste.
