Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. Seuss who wrote a tale called Green Eggs and Ham, which the title character grew up in. One day a boy who had never seen the book came to him, asking him for the book - and he gladly gave it to him. He read one page and he came running upstairs and ran straight into Green Eggs and Ham. It was the reason. One of the things he read was this:

"The boy put away the book and went home, just as he was, thinking Green Eggs and Ham was too small and dreary to be worth reading. Then he got up on top of a tree he had planted in his front yard, and he sat there until it was time to go to school. In his room he sat eating peanuts and drinking sugared milk, as he had done all his life. When the bus came and took him to school, the first thing he did was open the book for Green Eggs and Ham again. He was hungry as he had been ever since school began, and he read again and it was just like he had read it all the time that he had been at home, eating peanuts and drinking sugared milk. He went past the teacher's room, where the other boys were sitting. He took his hat off, and sat down in the aisle behind her, looking bored.

"He ran into the teacher's room, where they were still sitting.
