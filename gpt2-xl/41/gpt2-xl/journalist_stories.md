Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Michael Hastings, and in recent days he's emerged again as something of a poster child for both the media's fascination with young, glamorous, right-wing bloggers and its willingness to do anything to get them to write about the topics they choose to cover.

Hastings, who worked for the Los Angeles Times, apparently was investigating the story that President Barack Obama had "obtained" and stored classified information on CIA networks â€“ the same information that some of the President's top officials in the intelligence community have insisted has never occurred. As Hastings recounted in his recent memoir, he learned from sources that the information in question involved drones in secret CIA missions in Yemen. He also learned that the material was supposedly "top secret."

Not long after that, Hastings contacted Glenn Greenwald, a former Guardian and Washington Post reporter, who has also been writing about the secret drone program. In a recent podcast interview, Greenwald said that Hastings told him his sources gave him information on several "secret Predator" missions in Yemen, but that their identities and sources were classified.

Hastings also contacted the ACLU, the Nation magazine, and the Intercept website. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal printed a copy of an email from an ACLU attorney to Hastings in which he says that the paper "is seeking you out because we want to talk to you about our ongoing drone cases." The email includes an attached legal memo from the ACLU's National Security Project
