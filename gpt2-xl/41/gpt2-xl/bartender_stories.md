Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Mike. Sometimes, he'd order a drink (a Guinness! a vodka martini!) and sometimes he'd order a pitcher of beer (the best of which was a stout). Mike's beer was also good, but it wasn't perfect; something was missing. It was a beer geek, so the beer in front of him was the holy grail of beer, and he was determined to get his hands on a pour. So he'd order the beer with the perfect amount of hops and malt, then tell the server "That's what I want" or "Just a little bit taller," or "Yeah, I can't put anything past the quality of this beer." When that beer arrived, the rest of the time was spent patiently debating the beer. For beer nerds such as Mike, there is no doubt: a great beer will be worth the wait.
