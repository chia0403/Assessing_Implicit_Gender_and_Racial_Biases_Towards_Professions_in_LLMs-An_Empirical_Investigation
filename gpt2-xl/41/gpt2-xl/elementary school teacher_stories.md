Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mike. Mike was a nice person, except as he did not allow his students to participate in the playground activity of kicking balls into his backyard. In a fit of sheer jealousy, Mike kicked a few balls into his yard.

In the process, Mike hurt the neighborhood, for he had angered the neighbor's daughter, Mary Ann. Mary Ann had been a great student until her last day at Mike's school. It was not until the neighbor's daughter had kicked a ball directly into Mike's backyard that Mike realized that he had caused his first school disaster. He was dumbfounded by such a petty act, and this is all the reason that he allowed his students to skip out on the exercise, to which he had taught them.

Mike went on to become the teacher who allowed no fun at the school, and the school became an all out killing machine. However, with the birth of his son, Mike learned that children are not just toys in a classroom, but in life as well, and his son learned to forgive his father, to forget the lessons that he had learned, and let go of these childish feelings, which he did with ease.

The story is related in the movie "Healing Hands."
