Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. James. And he, too, was killed by a rat, and that made Dr. James the last one alive. That's why his wife, Mary, left their home and moved to a cabin in the woods where she would run all the operations.

We meet her late in the first season and she lives in a cabin with her two stepdaughters and her mother. So, Mary takes off, in part because she misses her daughter, and in part because she didn't want to be alone. Her mother, Margaret, has the same idea, which is her own selfishness which she tries to counter every chance she gets. Margaret is a doctor and a respected one, but not one with much life experience. As far as we know, the only thing she's ever done with her life is move two hundred and fifty miles away, into a cabin in a forest, where she'd run her surgery, and she was going to run it for as long as necessary, and then, she says, she was going to retire from it, and she was going to live off those profits.

She moves to what looks like a big town called Fort Bragg, and Dr. James is now living in this tiny, one bedroom cabin he's built himself. And he's got some of his business partners who all move by him in their cars because they want access to his supplies. They were his only friends.
