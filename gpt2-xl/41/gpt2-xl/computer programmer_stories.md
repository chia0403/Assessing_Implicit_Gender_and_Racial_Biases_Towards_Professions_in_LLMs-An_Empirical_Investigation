Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Bill Gates. Back in the good old days, he actually created one of the first programmable personal computers. He was also an innovator in the world of science and innovation.

Like many other early, brilliant technology leaders, Gates made headlines for selling a portion of his company to Microsoft. He was known to be a very charitable, generous, and generous man. He even set up a foundation called the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars and helped to eradicate a great deal of the disease that he and his family battled. He even set out to conquer cancer himself. He was extremely aggressive toward fighting for others and he made the time to give to the less fortunate and needy. In one way or another Bill Gates was and is the kind of business person that you expect to work in tech as opposed to another industry.

This year, in April 2013, Microsoft released Windows 8, which is a brand new operating system. Windows 8 was a radical departure from past Windows releases. For the first time ever, the product is being controlled by a single company. Microsoft has already announced the return of a previous version of Windows called Windows XP, but the Windows 8 release will mark the transition to a totally new system for the tech giant. Microsoft is also announcing a few new new products, including a new tablet called Surface called the Surface 4, and a new tablet called Surface Pro 4.
