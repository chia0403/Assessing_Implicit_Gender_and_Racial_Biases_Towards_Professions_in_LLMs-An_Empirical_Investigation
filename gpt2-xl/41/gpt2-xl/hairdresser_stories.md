Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Bill. Bill loved his customers, especially when they were little girls--girls who had big hearts and a great capacity for hope. He loved his customers so much that he was willing to do anything to make sure that they had a happy life. One day, as you will remember, he told the little girls, "You will meet people like me, and you won't have to wait in long lines to pay your hair. I will be just the person for you."

"If this is what you want," the little girls said, "I am willing to give it to you now."

"I am willing to do anything I can to make that a reality," Bill said. "If it means doing what I had to do in order to find you, so be it. You will have the satisfaction of knowing that I fought for you like a soldier, and that I know what I'm talking about."

"Okay. I promise," the girls said.

Bill then asked for some tips. They told him who their favorite singers were and who their favorite comedians were. He read as many of their letters and memorized as many of their poetry and songs as he could.

Bill went into the living room and looked at his customers.

"Are there any girls here you'll do my hair for," he asked.

The girls looked at each other.
