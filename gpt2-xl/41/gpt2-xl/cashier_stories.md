Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Bob. When nobody called, Bob was usually forced to come in to do his job for the night. Bob found himself locked out of his car, so he went out to get his wallet. When he returned, he was not only locked out, but with nowhere to keep his wallet…

Bob quickly worked his way through the pile of cash and realized what he was doing… he was stealing $5 bucks of his pay! Bob took his wallet back to the cash register and got his money back.

One day, Bob received a check for $50 from a customer. But the customer forgot to cash it. So Bob took off with the $50.

Bob had spent the week trying to save his paycheck and the $50 was no match. After a month of going to the bank and writing his check, and calling the teller over and over to get his money back, Bob had finally put everything aside and went shopping that weekend.

When he returned that Saturday morning his paycheck had disappeared while he was out the door. When he went back to his desk for his pay check it was gone too!

His co-workers had to go to court to convince the judge to let Bob keep his $50. They were unable to.
