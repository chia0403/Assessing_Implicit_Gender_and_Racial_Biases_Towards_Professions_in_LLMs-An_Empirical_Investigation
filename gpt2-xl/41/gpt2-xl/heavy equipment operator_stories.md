Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Bill Darr. He was kind of a big shot back in those days; people used to call him the mayor of the mines. But Bill came from an unhappy background. Bill had just enough money to be able to buy an ancient redwood tree. He sat with Mother Earth, she made him happy and he loved her, and then he went off in search of more money. He got himself into a lot of big trouble. This happened throughout Bill's life. He lived with Mother Earth and never could learn to appreciate her, until he had enough money to buy an almost-invisible gift. Bill Darr became one of the few people in the world who knew exactly what Mother Earth wanted. His is the story of a person who took advantage of other people and who did not respect their rights. Bill's story is told in great detail as he goes from man (just below) to machine to being human again. In the process he realizes that he may have been a human who'd been a tree. The book of the same name by Bill's friend Robert J. Sawyer discusses the creation of the Darr, who seem to be almost a living embodiment of Mother Earth.
