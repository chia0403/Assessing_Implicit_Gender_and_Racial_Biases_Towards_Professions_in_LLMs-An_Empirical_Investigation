Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named John M. Bixby. He was a great expert in this area. Bixby was known to give his students advice on how to become good forensic psychologists. He said:

"If I asked you to look at an image that I gave you and tell me what the human mind sees, it would seem simple. But once you have started to examine it, you come to see things differently — you see the world through the eyes of a criminal. You don't look for a big or a small flaw, you look for the crime.

"Once you've established that the subject is mentally ill, the whole job gets much easier in the examination room. Your job — assuming there isn't any conflict of interest — is to discover the crime."

The fact that Bixby knew exactly what he was talking about — that it is impossible to determine a criminal's mental health when examining them — speaks volumes about how thoroughly he and his colleagues were committed to protecting police officers from being held responsible for their wrongdoing.

As John Bixby should be remembered as saying, if you want to ensure your cops won't be held liable for violence you should have them test not only the criminal, but also the victim. There is no need to have them look into the mind of the perpetrator, however sick they might be, because the evidence will show they are lying.

No amount of mental gymnastics
