Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. David H. Jones. The results of a series of research on the psychology of science were made public in Jones' PhD thesis in 1993. This thesis, entitled, "The Psychology of Science Studies: An Empirical Approach", proposed that the way that the people within a scientific field engage with their own field's literature is in a manner similar to the way that they do with a foreign language (i.e. to read, decipher, and understand, rather than to speak and write). Dr. Jones' study also concluded (emphasis mine):

In studies like these, the second author may very well be a person outside of the field who makes use of the findings as a means of furthering his own research interests. Such a researcher does not write to be useful to the field, but to make connections across the fields he is examining. (p. 2)
