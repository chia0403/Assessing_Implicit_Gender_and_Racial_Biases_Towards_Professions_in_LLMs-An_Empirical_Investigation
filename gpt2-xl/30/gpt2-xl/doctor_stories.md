Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. Seuss

who wrote about the evils of the things he thought were bad for us.


The things he hated:

Androgyny : no one was ever male or female

Adver-narratives : these stories are a tale only we are capable of telling

Chocolate : too sweet

The internet : as a communication technology it was terrible

Shout-outs : "shout outs" to non-shout-outs

The end of marriage : marriage meant a new life

But the things he loved:

A good sandwich : a new experience I won't be experiencing any time soon

Cute animals : some of my favorite animals

Shirts featuring the color orange and cartoon animals

The power of positive psychology : I'm now sure of that. [2]
