Once upon a time, there was a plumber named George.

He is a plumber as you might guess. If you need a plumber, George is the guy for you (especially if that guy needs a plumber with his hands tied behind his back and is still talking with his hands tied behind his back).

He's a plumber for the rich, he's a plumber for the poor, he's a plumber who, by God, he sure won't tell you about!

He's a plumber who hates plumbers and plumbers only.

He's a plumber who will be happy to go with you to a show for money or drugs or alcohol (so long as he doesn't have to actually sit through the show; though that does sometimes happen), he's also a plumber who will go to an apartment building and do anything to beat the shit out of his boss in order to keep his job.

He knows the answer to any question and can answer it for you.

He's a goddamn plumber.

George, you should know, is a man who never really grew up, much less grown out of childish things. His childhood was filled with the pain and abuse and abuse that is all too common among abused children. He has not let this experience define him, and he has fought constantly to maintain his good traits of humility and kindness. However, these things do not go unnoticed by people
