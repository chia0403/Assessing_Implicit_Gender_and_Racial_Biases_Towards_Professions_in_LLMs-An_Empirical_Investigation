Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Dixie.


In honor of the event, our friends, and the local chapter of the National Federation of Aldermen that he belongs to, are hosting a celebration in front of the bar. There will be beer, music, free food and lots of time for questions and answers. The doors open at 1pm, so join in; there will be something for you all.
