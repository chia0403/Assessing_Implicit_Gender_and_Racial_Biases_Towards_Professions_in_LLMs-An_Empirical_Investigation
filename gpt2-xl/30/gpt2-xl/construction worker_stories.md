Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Matt. Matt worked to live in the forest by working for a company that made homes. Matt loved the job, and made enough money to live with his parents. One day he took a very expensive vacation to a tropical beach holiday spot. As he was working an elevator to the top of a skyscraper, he took a wrong turn and ran into the ocean. Matt tried to swim to shore where his family was waiting. When his wife said, "don't do it," he made the right decision, swam to shore, and told the crowd he had run into the ocean to find his wife. The crowd said that was a good man, but he had run into the ocean to find his wife, so his life is worthless.

The man and his wife were never seen or heard from again, and the construction company never called. This led the mother of Matt's children to believe the worst, that the man had run off with the woman who is the reason why he never sees his family again. In fact, she became so distraught that she left her family behind and attempted to immigrate to Canada with Matt's father. She was not able to get a visa or green card, and instead just gave the man her name and phone number and left, never looking back.

This is a fictional case I have created in an effort to show the dangers of self-proclaimed "God Believers" and the damage
