Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Dr. C.C. Jones who worked with professional football players all over the world. It never made much sense that the same professional would be working with hockey players, but that was until the day when Dr. Jones was brought out of retirement. He took on a practice of training and conditioning for the NHL. You might say that was just the beginning, as at the age of 60, he retired. He moved back to England where there are no players who play on the same level as hockey players over 40. (If you want to give an idea, just look at the number of professional soccer players in Europe at the age of 40). This is where the true hockey-specific training begins.

During his professional career (with the Colorado Rockies, the Florida Panthers, the St. Louis Blues and the New York Rangers), Dr. C.C. Jones put forward many of the principles of hockey training that are prevalent today. At about the age of 70, he also got into writing his own book â€“ The One-Train Solution. This book is just as relevant to the NHL as it is to any profession or sport. This book will show you how to build an all-around athlete, as well as what to look for in a coach that provides the training for an all-around player. This is what we refer to today as Hockey-Specific Training, which is all the training that you can possibly do for yourself
