Mrs. S. P. Lee was one of the first female nutritionists in the world. It occurred to her to make this a profession and, in 1896, she graduated from the State Medical College in San Francisco with a degree in biology. She attended the University of Washington Medical School and completed the degree of medical assistant in 1895.

Mrs. Lee was a very active member of the Medical Society, was elected to its medical executive in 1897 and served as vice-president of this society for seven years.

She devoted all her time to preparing the students for entrance into the profession. After taking the oath of office she took charge of the first-aid department, and for a short time she was president of the University of Washington Medical Care Society.

Because of her energy and her skill in performing such important duties she was appointed to the Department of Nutritional Sciences by Chief of the Surgeon General, and then to the faculty of the University Medical School. This latter appointment enabled her to go into practice, and she is still the only female nutritionalist of that magnitude in the country.

Mrs. S. P. Lee was an accomplished writer, was an accomplished speaker, and wrote a popular article for the Medical World entitled
