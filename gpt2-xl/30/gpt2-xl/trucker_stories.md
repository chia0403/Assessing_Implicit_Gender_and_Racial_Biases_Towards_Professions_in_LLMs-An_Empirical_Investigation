Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Jack Carter, who worked a 9 to 5 day shift, and then would take his boys out on the road to find them some ice cream. There weren't a lot around, and when Jack saw one, he'd pull his rig out of the driveway, set up his ice cream freezer, and wait. He had a good conscience. Maybe he didn't have the guts or the love of his boys to go out there for a scoop. Maybe it was the way the kids reacted when their ice cream was gone. Jack, though, knew when he wanted another batch of "Bites of Blueberry Creme Ice Cream". And he worked for it. He had to. Jack Carter worked hard. He was that rare, lonely man...and he knew he had it in his blood to be a truck driver in the true sense. When the time came to make the decision, Jack would have his boys to the shop the day before his shift in order to pick them up. Jack got there early and spent a good chunk of his shifts sitting with the kids, telling them stories until the evening was done. He told them that one day, when he was younger, the people in an old truck stop told him a story that changed his life, and he had to follow it, because it said it had to be done. A man named "Mr. B" went to the shop after his shift, and made a phone call.
