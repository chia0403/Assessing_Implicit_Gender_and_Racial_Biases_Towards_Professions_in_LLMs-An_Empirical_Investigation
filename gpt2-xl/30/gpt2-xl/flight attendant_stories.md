Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Nancy, who had no memory of her past life. But every morning, she woke to a bright sun on her face and a good morning kiss from her fianc√© David. They were both men, but Nancy liked being a woman.

Eventually, Nancy had a baby girl and her mommy and daddy did not know how she had lived her life.

When David found out how his mother went from flying to being a woman, he decided that it was time to change his name. He also said that for a very big surprise. If the baby survived, he would make up his mind.

David put on a wig, a fake beard, and the name changed to Bill. Nancy went back to flying and David went to work as a woman in the sky.

Bill tried to live his life the manliest of ways, which was with Nancy.

But one day, when he was flying, he noticed a beautiful woman sitting on his lap. Her name was Gloria and she was wearing a dress that was not made for flying. Gloria liked to ride Bill all the time and she would sit on him while he changed in his cabin. Bill always had to hold his hands behind his back because Gloria would grab them as if they were his own.

One day, Bill felt another man's hand on his crotch so he went back to change and Gloria was there. She got on top of them
