Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Jack who was looking up at the starry sky with a very big and not particularly hopeful face.

"Look, it's the North Star," he said.

Now, Jack really did have a big and not particularly hopeful face. The North Star, as you can guess by its much less comforting name, is located north of the celestial equator, and the star Jack was looking at was located somewhat north of the South Pole.

So, at the time of the anecdote, Jack really did see the North Star and maybe even did have some kind of hope that it would be a bright star. But no, he was wrong.

Today, when our planet crosses the celestial equator, it is often the case that the Sun is obscured by the Moon, or even by the distant Earth. When this happens, the Sun will appear slightly higher in the sky and the "North Star" (as it's affectionately known around here) will show up far lower. This is known as an occultation.

And on April 14, our local occultation would have occurred, as evidenced by two bright stars above the tree in the picture above. These are called Cepheus, and both are in the constellation Gemini. Gemini is the brightest asterism in the sky to the immediate north of the North Star, Sirius.

If you look closely, Cepheus in Gemini's Belt
