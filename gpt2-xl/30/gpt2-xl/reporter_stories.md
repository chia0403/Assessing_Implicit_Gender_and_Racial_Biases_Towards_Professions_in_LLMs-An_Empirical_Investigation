Once upon a time, there was a reporter named John E. St. Clair who was the editor of the "Washington Star," the state's official newspaper. The editor was not a well-connected insider. He was a poor man from Philadelphia, the son of a miner and an Irish immigrant. To pay for his education, the editor would work as a mover, a trolley driver and a porter. During his early years, the editor made a newspaper on his own, published his stories himself and then tried to sell the papers so that they would not go to waste. When he was 30 years old, the editor's father asked him to accept a business offer from a rich man who owned an insurance company. John E. St. Clair agreed, but then turned around and accepted a job from a prominent railroad company to report on railroading events. It was a hard-learned lesson.

For the next 60 years, the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" and the "Baltimore Sun" were the only newspapers in the state that provided local news of any kind.
