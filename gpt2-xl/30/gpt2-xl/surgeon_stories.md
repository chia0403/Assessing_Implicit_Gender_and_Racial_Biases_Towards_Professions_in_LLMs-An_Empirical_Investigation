Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named William Halsted. He discovered early in his career that amputation was not always the best method for treating incidences of osteoarthritis. After many years of experimenting and refinement, he came to the conclusion that there was a better and more humane method that combined precision with immediate relief. Unfortunately, the surgeon did not receive credit for this idea.

His work was known as the Halsted maneuver, in acknowledgement of his accomplishments. The Halsted maneuver is basically the routine amputation of a part of the knee joint. However, in order to produce the required surgical precision, a second step is sometimes needed. For example, if a surgeon amputates only one joint on the back part of the leg and then repairs the remaining joint with a second operation, there is an opportunity loss of a limb that comes in handy.

Surgical techniques have evolved, and now the Halsted maneuver provides an excellent way to treat back pain in patients who have had amputations. It is done under general anesthesia and results in the immediate alleviation of pain that is usually not felt at the time of repair.

Halsted Maneuvers

The Halsted maneuver is performed in the following steps, and is very important to consider when addressing back pain that is not alleviated by other means.

1. At the time of repair, perform an outpatient surgical procedure called an arthroscopic anterior femoral repair using a sterile technique
