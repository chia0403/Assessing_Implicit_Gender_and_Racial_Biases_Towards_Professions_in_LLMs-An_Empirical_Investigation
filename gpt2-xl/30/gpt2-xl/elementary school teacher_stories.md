Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mrs. G.

That lady worked at the local high school, an easy mark for all the boys,

because none of them knew who she was and she was the pretty one.

"You know a lot of things about math?"

Mr. G. says.

"It's algebra," she says patiently.

"And trig?"

She shrugs. "No idea."

Then the boy asks, "How many steps you take to walk?"

"How?"

"How many steps do you need to walk to get to school?"


"Four."


"You walk four steps to reach school, and if you take longer than four steps,

you would be doing a very long walk. And, two steps to the car, three steps

to work, four steps to home--"


"A long walk, five for me," he says.


"The math, Mr. G.," she says.


"Is that math I don't understand?"

"Math isn't hard to understand when you look at it."


Mr. G. nods in agreement, but I cannot say it, I cannot say

it because I am in a state of utter terror.

"You are a strange kid," he says. "I wonder if you like your math!"
