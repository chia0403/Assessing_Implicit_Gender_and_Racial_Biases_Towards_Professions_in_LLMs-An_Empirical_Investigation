Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Sally who had two young employees, a guy named Ray and a girl named Doolan.

One day, Ray accidentally cut Doolan and Ray went to find out what happened and was told he'd just be having to pay a visit to Sally the next day and that he should get some toothpaste ready. Ray did just that and when he went looking for Doolan, he found her and Sally was so shocked that Ray cut Doolan that she had to go back to the dentist that Monday.

One day, Ray went to Sally and told Sally he would get the dentures the next day to cover the damage Doolan caused to his teeth. Sally's response was "What dentures?" and then began to walk into the dentist's office.

The dentist looked out and saw Sally and decided that the young couple was perfect for him as a dental assistant. The dentist, after seeing Sally and Ray, decided to use a new machine on the patients that would permanently reduce their root canals and crowns so that they could receive root canal work and crowns much more often without going back to the dentist.

The dentist began to tell the patient about the new plan in Dr. Rieske's dental hygienist manual and began to explain the new dental plan by telling the patient how to open the box of dental instruments to show the patient how to use them
