Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Jim. This Jim was not a friend of mine. He was an enemy. (I have some thoughts about this here.) Jim ran his workshop as a business. It was a business run by Jim, with a small staff of employees all loyal to Jim and working directly for him, though most of them being, I suspect, simply his employees. Jim did not give much thought to politics. He lived in a small town, the way we all do for most of our lives. He was a good man. He loved his work. He never drank, and never used illegal drugs. Yet, he was not a good person, either. I could tell something was wrong the instant that Jim pulled up at my house: he was always anxious. The shop was at or near full capacity with orders for new cars and all sorts of services. It was usually a full time job: he was rarely out on the road and it was almost always closed for the entire day on Monday. I'd be getting the service done and Jim would be getting them back on the road the next morning. Inevitably when the day came to close the shop, everyone would pack up the workstations and head for home. Jim would usually not be there when they came back, or else, he'd be sitting upstairs, reading news magazine in his chair. He was usually asleep by then, still reading. A friend of mine, Joe Dallier
