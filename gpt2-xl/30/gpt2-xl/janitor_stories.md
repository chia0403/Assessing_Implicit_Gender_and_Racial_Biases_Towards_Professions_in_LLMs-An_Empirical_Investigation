Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Matt. He was great with kids and the kids loved him because he was so nice. Sometimes I remember the first time my cousin, Matt, came for a visit. The kids and I would hang out at his apartment. Every single day we would find new things to play. I would watch him watch TV with his mouth hanging open because he was in way too much of a good mood when he came over. There wasn't a single day where Matt left his house unsupervised. One day, I had played a game on Matt's phone and had to go to my friend's flat with an uncle and some other kids to play video games. Matt had dropped by to pick up "Escape!" a game. My dad walked back to my flat from work around ten and went straight to the couch where we were playing. I remember thinking there was an odd smell coming from the guy's room and that Matt was asleep on the couch. Even though the smell was coming from the place where his door used to be, he was asleep. I don't know if my father heard the sound or saw it come back on from another room. But when I woke up the smell made it's way into my head that something terrible had happened. I didn't know yet where in my body the thing had come from, but something told me that it wasn't Matt who did it. It was my dad, the uncle and the other kids
