Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Michael Fassbender.

Back in November 1999, when he was still a schoolboy at St. Hugh's in California, the then 14-year-old had written Fassbender a letter. "Do you like photography?" he asked. When the child actor responded that he did, the boy, a photographer himself (he had recently moved to Los Angeles from South Africa), encouraged him to go to California and explore photography. Eventually, Fassbender, who is now 33, got to meet the kid, and was charmed by his gift of capturing fleeting moments.

In this conversation, recorded in October 2007, Fassbender recalls a trip to the West Hollywood Museum of Art: "I went on this little excursion, and it wasn't to have lunch with the museum guys. It was to come by his apartment. And we sat around for half an hour. And I said, 'So the story kind of took the shape you expected?' And he says, 'Yeah. It turned out to be a kind of coming-of-age story â€” you have a kind of adolescent struggle to deal with, and it ends up kind of having a big final resolution.'" Here's the transcript:
