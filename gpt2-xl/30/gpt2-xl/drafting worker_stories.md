Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Adam Savage, whom the producers of MythBusters had brought in to do two tests using the MythBusters: The H2O Myth and The Truth Is Out There. Adam had a great time getting to know the MythBusters in a personal way through several episodes, but was not satisfied with his performance.

Adam Savage was invited to join MythBusters: Untold Stories, a new spin on the show from Tested. In this episode, Adam plays himself, as he recounts two memorable and different real-world events.
