Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr Bigglesworth's kindergarten students are now in the fourth grade, and they've been in Mr. Bigglesworth's kindergarten since he was a junior high schooler. Mr. Bigglesworth works for the local library, which is located in the same town where they live. He always had a hard time making it to the library all weekend long since there were always a lot of students at the neighboring elementary school that needed reading help. It took a few years and lots of complaints from his students before he finally got the kids to write in a letter on Fridays explaining why they couldn't be there that night. After that, Mr. Bigglesworth had to let them off the hook when he showed up on time. At first, his students seemed confused by the fact that they didn't have to go to Mr. Bigglesworth's kindergarten every Friday night. But they eventually went for the simple reason that Mr. Bigglesworth always came to his kindergarten to spend the weekend with his students, no matter the circumstances. Of course, one thing that would have to change at Mr. Bigglesworth's kindergarten is that Mr. Bigglesworth couldn't come from their school on Tuesdays as it isn't that far away. That means they'd be spending most of the day with their dad now, instead of with their mom. For the time being
