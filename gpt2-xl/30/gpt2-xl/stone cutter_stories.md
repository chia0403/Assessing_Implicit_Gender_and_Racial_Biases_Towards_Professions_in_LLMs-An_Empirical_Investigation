Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Fletch, and he was skilled at cutting big stones on the fly. One day the chief of the village and his son Fletchy were out hunting and Fletch chopped a hole in the forest with his big stone axe. Once inside, he stuck his head in the hole, sat down and started cutting big trees. When his son Fletchy came in to complain, he told him to go home and finish the job off at his place. He did this, and after he left, he sat by the side of the hole waiting to see if it was finished. It was, and he saw that the axe had created a hole in the earth that was about the size of a fist, when he came out of the hole and told his father to cut that hole again. His father was upset about what had happened, and he told him to be careful. Not to trust his son anymore and to always be careful when he went out into the world because the tools he was using was not exactly the right one for the job. So that's the way it works.

My son, Eric, in spite of his flaws, is a special person. He has a talent that I think is pretty special. I have been trying to help him develop something that will be used with my son and help us pass along a certain way of thinking that I have for him with other kids. I really want to help him
