Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Paul O'Neill.

A British aviation enthusiast, and enthusiast in general, O'Neill began flying in the US around the early fifties, taking on missions as a passenger or pilot over various domestic airports. His fame grew to the point where many companies took off as investors and then employees with O'Neill's help. A number of them were eventually acquired by the big companies including Goodyear, North American Aviation, Pan Am, and Pan Am's predecessor in Canada, British Airways, though some later merged or went on to become their own entities, like the American Airlines Group now holding British Airways's interests in the US.

In 1964, before the flight recorders and the electronic tracking of flights, one could only read the flight numbers on the flight boards. On these boards, the three black '4' boxes would show how far the airliners had travelled. The numbers would indicate how many miles the planes had flown, but what was even more interesting was the altitude of the aircraft as well.

At that time, American had established its own set of standards for flight altitudes, based on the best method of calculating speed for a given altitude. American pilots used the maximum speed of their assigned altitude (as defined by the standards) to calculate their climb path. In essence, it was the route the airliner would take to land, based on its climb performance.

If American pilots chose to set their
