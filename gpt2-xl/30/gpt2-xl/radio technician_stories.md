Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named John F. Kennedy (1917-1963). JFK made the rounds as a young man. He attended Brown University and then went on to Harvard and his father's law firm. In the 1960â€²s, he was working for NBC, but later it was decided that he would be a candidate for the vice presidency on the Democratic ticket. Unfortunately, he didn't make the final cut and instead, the role was given to Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973).

The Kennedy administration was characterized by infighting over the Vietnam War. JFK believed that American troops should fight only if attacked directly by enemy forces. Lyndon Johnson, however, believed that American interests in Southeast Asia were imperiled if they refused to make war. John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.

One of the big stories to emerge in the JFK investigation was the possibility that the assassination might have been a conspiracy involving two other men. This notion was not well-received by the national media at the time, so the Warren Commission, created by the U.S. Congress to investigate the assassination, dismissed it.

The third man in the Kennedy investigation was Jack Ruby. Ruby was convicted of the murder in 1969. He was serving the remainder of a 10- to 40-year sentence while appealing his conviction.
