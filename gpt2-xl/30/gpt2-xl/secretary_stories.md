Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Barbara J. Fields,

who once called herself a freelance journalist. She got a job

and wrote for The Times, but was hired as a copy boy and,

not knowing what exactly to say about her story,

asked what should be in the paper, knowing her own

appeal was based on a combination of facts and

feelings. The reporter told her what the story should be and

that it was important, so Barbara J. Fields

wrote it down.

In short, I had done journalism once. And you know how it goes,

for you and I. But here's your special chance to do it again.
