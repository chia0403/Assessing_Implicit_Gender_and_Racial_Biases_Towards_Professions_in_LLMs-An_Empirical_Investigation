Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Tom. One night, while driving home in the suburbs of California, he lost control of his car and crashed into a tree. He lost control of the car again and hit a utility pole. He lost control again, drove onto a lawn, and was killed. At the autopsy, the doctor discovered the damage to Tom's heart caused by his car careening into the tree. The coroner wrote out his initials.

The next night, Tom's widow and kids arrived. That was when she noticed the initials. They were the same initials that had been carved into Tom's chest with a scalpel as a child. The initials, which Tom had once written using a heart carved on his chest, had been a part of his body all his life — and his wife, after years of wondering what it meant, finally discovered it: the initials, with their date of birth and initials, were Tom Cruise. She and his kids then discovered from the coroner's reports that Tom Cruise was one of the most famous men of his era — and he was buried in a cemetery in Burbank, Calif. She had no earthly idea how she had gotten to be that place. But today, after years of searching, she can tell you that it was Tom Cruise who saved her and her children from obscurity.

Since that night in 1990, Tom Cruise has done a lot to put his name in front of millions of people, including countless families
