Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Tony. He was one of those instructors who taught you exactly what you were supposed to do, in an almost mechanical way.

Tony was smart, but his lack of enthusiasm made his lessons frustrating and painful. He didn't like the way we wanted to think, and never paid attention to his methods of teaching. Instead, he kept doing the same thing in the same way over and over again. When he finally took the time to teach us, he tried to tell us why what we were doing wasn't working â€” but that only made things worse.

All along, Tony had been assuming that the reason we were struggling was because of our lack of effort. But now that he had an honest moment of self-reflection about his lack of enthusiasm, he realized that he'd let his lack become his excuse for not being able to help us. After his admission, it suddenly made sense to him.

After years of teaching, Tony saw the mistakes in his method, his assumptions about how you should be doing things, and realized that he was making the same mistakes over and over again.

He's the kind of people who can go on forever about why he thinks his method is the best, and then when someone in his field tells him that he's wrong, he shrugs and says, "Well, I suppose I'll try again."

While the truth is that none of us are Tony.
