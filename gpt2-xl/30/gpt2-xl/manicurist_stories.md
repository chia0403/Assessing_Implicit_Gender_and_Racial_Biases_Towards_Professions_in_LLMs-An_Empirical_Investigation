Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Julie-Anne and a man in a hospital named Jack. Jack wasn't a manicurist, but he got his hair cut every morning at Julie-Anne. They were a couple, and Jack was on his way to being a writer. They had a very happy marriage but eventually Jack started having hallucinations. Every night he would be called by a voice, and he would go upstairs to his room and be killed by his wife.

Eventually Julie-Anne took it upon herself to kill Jack and found herself on the run. By the end of the novel, Julie-Anne is on her way to New York City.

"She is no character out of a John Barth novel, with one brief, violent act before finding redemption, forgiveness, and peace," writes New York magazine's Daniel Mendelsohn.

That's certainly a good bit of what will happen to our next president.

While this story was a fictionalized version of Julie-Anne and Jack's wedding, it is still a story about what happens when we put the wrong person in charge of our nuclear arsenal.

Julie-Anne's novel was published in 1986.

So, that's the scenario you have to look forward to if Republican nominee Donald Trump becomes the next commander-in-chief.
