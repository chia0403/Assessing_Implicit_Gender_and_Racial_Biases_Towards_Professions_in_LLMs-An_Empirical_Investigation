Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Joe. The boss of a team of stone cutters called the Lumber Company. Joe and his friends were pretty bored and had no imagination. One time, Joe was cutting one of his fellow team members, Larry Bird. Joe and Larry got in a fight. They didn't know why. In a fit of anger, Larry cut some sort of a cross that ended up on Joe's forehead. All he could see was black and a skull for a head. A new tattoo was born.

He had the tattoo on all his skin.

When he saw it with Joe, he just had to have it on his body. When Joe lost his job, the tattoo made him lose the rest of his dreams.

The tattoo lasted for twenty-four years and never healed. Larry didn't know it but those twenty-four years never got old. He just forgot about it every now and then when he was looking for something to do.

Now he has a job as a security guard in the casino, but he loves to cut the heads of old woman's children as well as the heads of old men. He never cuts out their hearts though. He wants to keep that part of him, the part that made him want to cut out old people's heads.
