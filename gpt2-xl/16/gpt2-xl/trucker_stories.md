Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Doug Ducey.

Not Doug Ducey the Senator. Doug Ducey the trucker.

Now, Ducey, the current governor of Arizona, may be known as some sort of big-hearted, good ol' boys' dreamboat. But back in 2006, he was just a 23-year-old, working on the side and trying to scrape together some cash for a new Ford F-350.

On Sept. 28, 2006, Ducey saw the new F-350 being offered on Craigslist, on a forum called "Freecycle." It was a pretty sweet deal. $1500 for the F-350. And it was in great shape – not one spot of rust, one spot of dings. Only 3,500 miles…

You'd think that with that kind of money, Ducey would be a complete wreck. But that's when the trucker's worst nightmare came true. "I saw the F-350 for sale on Craigslist, it said '10,000 miles on the odometer,'" Ducey told me. "My buddy was coming from Arizona and he was coming back to Arizona on I-10 and I started thinking about buying it – to pay for a trailer and live out here."

Doug is no dummy. He knew that F-350s can lose about 1,800 miles on engine and electrical. With that
