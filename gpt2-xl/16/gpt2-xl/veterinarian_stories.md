Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named John P. Smith. His name and his profession have passed into the popular vocabulary, and most modern animal shelters no longer recognize him. Smith was known as being "the most influential man in the history of animal sheltering."

"I met him when I was about 15. I'd just run away from a bully. He was the first guy who helped rescue me. He told me to come find him," recalled Karen Taylor.

Taylor, the president of the Animal Protection Group, had gone missing with her two dogs and was left near a gas station. She was later found by a passer-by when the gas station attendant saw her.

Smith, a former deputy sheriff of Fulton County, Georgia, and veterinarian, was a regular presence in the shelter during the 1950s, helping get animals out of the shelter and reuniting stray animals with their owners.

Smith's son, James N. Smith, recalls it as his father was in attendance at the same vigil for the slain firefighters, when the mayor of Atlanta paid his respects.

Smith loved animals and made many visits to Atlanta, going so far as the State Dog Park, where he saw many mutts roaming the grounds. Smith even put in for a job at the hospital to find people who owned mutts but couldn't afford to let them go.

"John P. Smith has been called the father of animal sheltering," says Taylor
