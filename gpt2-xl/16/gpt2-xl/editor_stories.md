Once upon a time, there was a editor named James Fenton. Fenton is a big dweeb. He's only in charge of this, and he's an excellent editor. I've helped write Fenton's pieces before, and they're good. He's got good talent. Unfortunately, he has awful writing. He's got a way of writing that's very, very old-fashioned and very tedious. It's all about the words and what they're doing and what they're standing for, and you can't escape them. It's not just the words, but the whole structure. It's very hard writing like that.

A lot of the problems that his articles have are due to that. He's got a way of doing all his stuff that's very well organized that's based on repetition so you know exactly what things do. That's all classic Fenton, and I've been told by people that really know him that his writing isn't that good. It is very, very hard to write like that. It's very, very hard to write like that and keep yourself sane. He makes his pieces very long, and he uses them to show that he knows what each section of his piece is supposed to say. It's just a very, very hard kind of writing to do on the Internet, really. But it helps to write on The Mary Sue. It is my favorite thing to actually do on the Internet. It's a really good feeling
