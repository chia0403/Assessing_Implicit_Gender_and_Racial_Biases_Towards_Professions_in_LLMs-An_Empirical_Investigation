Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Mr. Mumble. He was very fond of his wife, Ms. Mumble, whom he adores. He owns some land in his neighborhood, and every evening he takes her to the bank, where she deposits the last of the money that she made as an investment. But today, things are different. She now earns money as an accountant. He finds this very hard to accept. She has to work longer hours, and is no longer as attractive as before. He is a very old man and is suffering with a great fear. What should he do? Should he move out of the house, and leave his wife all alone? How should he protect his house and family? He is completely powerless, and his wife is quite dependent upon him... Written by Thomas Meijer <thomas@astro.nl>
