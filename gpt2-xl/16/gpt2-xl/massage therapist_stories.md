Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Mary. She said she was a goddess, who loved to heal other women and made a profit as a result. Her secret was that she did not offer her services to women who were ready to experience sexual pleasure. Instead, she preferred clients who wished to be healed of their various ailments and, to her surprise, they were quite willing to pay. Once her practice had developed to the point where she thought she could offer similar services to men, she thought that she might be a little mistaken and that she had the power to heal the whole planet. She would like to see her dream through. But, one day, Mary was cleaning in her office when a strange man came in. He was in a bad mood and he began insulting Mary. Mary got so angry that she walked out of the office. The man followed her and finally forced his way into Mary's office. The next thing he knew the door was slamming shut. Mary grabbed the handle and pushed. The door came crashing down, breaking Mary's wrist in the process. She never forgot the pain in her wrist and she would continue to fight off her demons over the years.

At the beginning of her life Mary was a goddess. Unfortunately, one night she was looking for comfort in a massage parlor and the receptionist was a male. In a fit of anger, Mary picked up a wooden door handle and smashed it down on the heads of two of the male employees
