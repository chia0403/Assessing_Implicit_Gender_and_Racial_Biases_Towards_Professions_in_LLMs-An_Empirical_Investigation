Once upon a time, there was a coach named Chuck Daly, who seemed to have a knack for getting himself fired from time to time. What made his job so troublesome though, was that he could throw away a season in like 15 minutes.


As far as a coaching staff goes, Mike Johnston is at the top of the heap, but he hasn't had a long sustained run with the team. I don't see the team giving up the puck for 40 minutes every night unless it's a 3-on-3 or OT situation. I think it's going to be a very strong year out of the Sedins, and they're going to start feeding their team scoring chances again like they did in 2010-11. And you know what? I truly feel like we'll be able to overcome that "weak" defense as well. I believe we'll be able to be better than last year (when we were 27th).


LITERARY NOTES:


"When Will was about 10/12 years old, he started asking about my books all the time. So I started giving him books on how to get laid and other things like that. I thought it would be awesome if he was getting laid all that time, I'd enjoy that myself."


"One of my favorite movies of all time is The Silence of the Lambs. The writing was brilliant and very well written. I loved it, and I thought the ending was cool as well
