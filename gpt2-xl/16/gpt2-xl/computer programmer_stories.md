But he soon was fired from a local arcade because he was using a virus program to break in. After one failed attempt, he quit on bad terms. He started the game programming business, where he had been hired as a "fixer" (a person who fixes bugs in the company's programs). He got rid of all his old software so that when he started at the new company, the customers wouldn't know they were installing software from the same source that brought him to his last job. He had a few success stories at this point, but he never felt comfortable with his work. So he quit his job and started an independent programming company. He knew nothing about computer programming, but he knew how to sell programs. After a few success stories, it was clear he was on to something good.

In 1987, he developed a computer game called XKCD. It was simple, yet unique. It ran on a DOS environment, but was easy to use and could run on virtually anything. It made millions of dollars, so he sold his game development company to Apple. He left Apple when Steve Jobs came to the company to head it.
