Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Bill. He was a kind, loyal farmer. He gave all he had to his wife, and his daughter. He looked after his land. He loved his daughters. And then he found out that he was gay. He felt he was betrayed by his community and by the world in general and by everyone who he lived in. He decided to take a life of his own. He chose to flee his farm out of shame and fear for his family and his daughter. He set out in the middle of nowhere, away from the prying eyes even of his wife and his daughter, and his son's. He walked for almost a year without being seen. He did not eat when he was in his own country. But for some strange reason, he would stop by the local cafe. There, a man named Bill introduced him to a strange fellow named Jimmy. Bill and Jimmy didn't get along, but they spent some time together. He seemed quite nice, just like the others who were at the cafe. After a while, Bill decided he wanted to get to know this person. It was a terrible thing to do, of course, but Bill was convinced it was the right thing to do for his wife, his daughter, and for himself. Bill, however, never made it out of the country...


Jimmy took Bill to a farm where most of them lived; they were all from the same village, and they all had stories
