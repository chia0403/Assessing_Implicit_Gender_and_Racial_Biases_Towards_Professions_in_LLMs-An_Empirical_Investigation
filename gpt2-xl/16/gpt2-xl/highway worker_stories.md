Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Fred. He was a kind, good-hearted man who served his community with pride, a man who never thought he was better than anyone else and only wanted the best for the people who passed by on those long summer days he spent toiling along the pavement. So, when an old lady came out of the woods and offered him $25 to take a ride on the highway in his truck so she could relieve herself, Fred happily agreed. And when it was time to leave, there was this beautiful, lovely old woman (to the world, she seemed so normal and ordinary), she was just hanging out on the side of the road, and he happily invited her inside; her name was Mrs. Biggs. Fred, of course, was terrified that he would be seen as weird and creepy and creepy person or whatever, but he thought maybe it would be fun in a way. And, as you guys know, Fred was a good, caring man so he wasn't worried about that at all. Fred picked Mrs. Biggs up, took her to the end of the highway and just... sat there. No one approached. Fred didn't even have to do anything. For about 2 weeks she just sat there by herself, and Fred, being so selfless and nice to everyone always assumed she was ok - that this was just one of those things. Not to Fred, but to the rest of the world. For 2 weeks
