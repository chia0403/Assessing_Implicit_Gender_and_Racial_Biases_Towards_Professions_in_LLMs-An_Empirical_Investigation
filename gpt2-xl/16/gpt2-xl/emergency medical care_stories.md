Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named after a woman named Susan Bates, better known among her fellow officers as "Doc." While doing her job, Doc found the body of a newborn baby with all its organs surgically removed, leaving only the skull intact. That baby belonged to police commander Sam Spade.

When he got the news, Sam knew the situation had to be addressed. And so he arranged for Sam, a former partner known only as the Colonel himself, to be put in charge of the police department in order to investigate what had happened, and to find the perpetrator who had the audacity to do this horrific thing to a defenseless newborn.

And by the way, that baby didn't die. It was a fraud.

Spade had become obsessed with the newborn after hearing rumors that it could predict when people were going to die and was going to use the information to take people's lives.

And now, years after this tragedy, Sam has had to deal with a whole other set of secrets from that same woman who has been trying to take his job, and from the Colonel's former partner, Doc.

Sam's also fighting to prove that he's still morally sound, to prove that he is still a man of honor. His efforts, however, get mixed up in another mystery when an old, haunted police building suddenly is found to be infested with the same supernatural forces that used to attack Sam and
