Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Edward D. House. He wanted to use a genetic method to bring the perfect man as his successor. He thought it through carefully, and decided it would be a noble project to discover true love for the first time in humanity's history to the world.

And then Edward House died.

Houses's study on love and genetics ended up being a failure that he couldn't overcome. He lost his wife, he burned the research data he'd collected, and he lost his children, his grandchildren, and the love he lost.

Houses has been haunted ever since. He's been dead long enough and gone for a long enough time that he doesn't really want to be.

But he'll still do what he can to help create a way to bring forth true love. If it really needs to be found, well he can just hope that it can be.

The main character is Edward D. House, age 72, a man that has worked in the field for two decades, never having success with creating true love. However, at a certain point, he began receiving orders regarding a project that would alter the entire world forever. A woman named Alice, the perfect woman in every way, has been found in a certain castle, and the researcher must bring her to life to make her the greatest sacrifice he will ever make.
