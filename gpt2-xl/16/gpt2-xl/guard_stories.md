Once upon a time, there was a guard named Denton Patman. Then there were five guards like him. Then, three, then one—and then one more, one more, and suddenly Patman was gone. They had no idea he was gone—no idea that they had lost the only man capable of keeping them in check.

Now a new guard has taken his place. But what is Denton Patman going to do when he sees no one around to help him? Will he go off the deep end, or can he find a way to keep the guards in check so no one else has to go on the deep end?
