Once upon a time, there was a barber named "Honey" who was very successful and earned an estimated $25,000 by having two separate barber shops. One shop was located in town, the other shop was located outside town. As Honey went to town every Saturday, he took his barber shop to the outside of town, where it didn't sell as well. So, eventually Honey decided to open a second barber shop within town. After six weeks, Honey's second shop was a success. So, he decided to open a third shop in town. Again, his popularity grew so much that soon Honey's shop was selling more than the other two combined and he was making $75,000 a year (yes, you read that wrong - seventy thousand is actually the number).

To add insult to injury, soon after Honey's first shop opened he was offered a job at the old gas station on State Highway 7 that is located between the two shops. Honey was understandably skeptical of moving into the gas station's former space, but the man who took Honey's job (and his job offer) is now no longer around. So, Honey's second barber shop now has a business partner who is a real estate developer. But Honey hasn't given up on his dream. His two businesses are still in operation and although there are now three barber shops, only one is still in business, although it's struggling to stay open!
