Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Mr. Pigeon. Mr. Pigeon was a real softie, his name comes from his tendency to always take good care of animals that came his way. While it was never mentioned outright, there would inevitably be a catch or two. One story is that Mr. Pigeon would get a dog from the local animal shelter only to later find out it had already died and he didn't want a new one. Another is that when he got a small, elderly, sick cat for a neighbor's cat, Pigeon never bothered to take it to the veterinarian. When that neighbor had to go to the vet because the cat suddenly lost its sense of smell, Pigeon didn't bother sending the cat to the vets. While Pigeon was kind and always acted in the best interest of animals, his behavior was rarely questioned by anybody. However, there was a problem about two days after Mr. Pigeon, the one and only friend that the cat currently lived with, died.

That same day, the cat appeared to have lost all fear of anyone, leaving the window open for no one to enter or even stand outside the window. It's hard to tell you how long this occurred, for he disappeared into the woods and never came home. Even once Mr. Pigeon's body was found, the dog hadn't been found. However, the neighbors managed to look through the window
