Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Daphne Ashford, a charming young thing. She had an interesting life before she inherited her dad's business (and the family fortune), starting a secretarial school in the countryside, going to some wonderful clubs and parties. But then, one day she discovered that in order to keep her job, she had to have sex with men, and the next she decided she was going to marry one. That was all the family ever knew about her, but it wasn't to last. Things went terribly wrong during her marriage to Mark Withers, of the same family, which ultimately led to her insanity, and the very public suicide of Mark and Daphne Ashford. Well, Daphne is now living in the USA, and just like her dad once did, she wants to take everyone with her. And now that she's gotten some of us back, she brings with her her ex, one of the great characters of science fiction, and the man who was one of the people who knew her before she met Mark Withers. And this time, I can confirm that he was just as charming as her. So, with her dad around to provide some extra help, this new Daphne Ashford decides to tell us how her life actually went, and we get to know a whole new side of her life.
