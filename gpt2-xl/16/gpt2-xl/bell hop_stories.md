Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Cogworth who knew what to do for the kids who couldn't get up. You remember Cogworth now? He was such a wonderful man. He was such a wonderful friend to everyone. I feel like a bad person saying this but...He lost it when he lost his mind one day. And now only days after being in a place where he feels so bad, he lost his life there again. They call this place hell. But don't worry he's not coming back. And if he came back, he'd probably just lose his mind again. Anyway - if any are lost again, and it's only you that they need to get to, then get up. Try and stop the pain. And don't forget...He's just like everyone else...He wants you to be safe wherever you are. (A little too sweet. That's a little weird saying your family's son like all that. But hey it's what I was taught) That's all I got. Just wanted to share that this is how I was raised and that's how my momma raised me.

It's a tough time, everyone. We all need strength, love, and support. You're family, not just to your parents, but to your community. We know we're not alone. Together we can help those who are and help each other find hope. Let's not forget.

HUGS.
