Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Steve who had a great reputation and a very powerful boss.

Steve worked hard, but his hours were unpredictable, as were his pay. One day, Steve had a client who had a tough break. He went in to the boss's office, but he heard the boss screaming.

Steve thought the situation was quite unusual, so he walked into the office to find that the boss had been severely beaten up, with the man's head bashed in, making his head look like a pancake.

He quickly said "I'll fix that" and turned back to his desk. Seconds later came a loud scream and Steve's boss was gone.

The electrician had just walked in with such rage. His boss was gone, and he thought they could deal with this one at a time.

But the boss came back in a few minutes and asked where the electrician was.

Steve didn't know, so he quickly pulled out the key. When he got to the boss's office and saw him there, he asked "Why didn't you tell me where this is, you bastard?"

The boss said he didn't know that his boss had such anger. The boss had also said what the gas leak must've been and left.

You shouldn't assume your boss and coworkers won't be angry at you.

They won't even know they're angry.
