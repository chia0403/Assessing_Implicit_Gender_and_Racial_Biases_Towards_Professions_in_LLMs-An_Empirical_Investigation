Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Walter Vane who specialized in the operation of hip replacements. He made one hip from a human femur in 1881, but had to stop because it didn't fit. Vane was able to repair the other by attaching the hip bone to another human thigh, but he had to do it himself the hard way. This meant taking the leg bone and fitting it to the thigh bone (which is what one would do to a human leg) as shown above. The procedure was done on a table, which was a small wooden one that Vane had to make from a chair leg. A nail went through the upper hip to anchor the joint, which was then stitched up. He later used a vacuum to help close up the incisions, which was messy and involved a fair amount of blood.

"He gave me pain."

Walter Vane was a doctor who made a lot of great things happen, but here's one that he is best known for. He was part of the team that made hip implants. These are implants put in place in order to replace weak knees or joints. In hip replacement surgery, the femur bone is implanted with the rest of the hip socket, then the bones in the knee are replaced in the exact same manner as a human leg. These were often made using human thigh bone, which then had a hole drilled in it for the femur to pass through. It's called an
