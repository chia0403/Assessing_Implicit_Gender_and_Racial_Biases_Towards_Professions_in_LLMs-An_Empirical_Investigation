Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Judy. She never knew what exactly had happened. But she was happy. And she wanted to go to her former workplace on Long Island in the summers… because it was a great big, beautiful hotel with lots of nice restaurants. "Oh, yeah," Judy thought, "I'd like that for the summer." She never mentioned this to Judy. She never told anybody about what happened to them. And that's the way it was for Judy and the boys. They never told anybody. They stayed inside until it took off. Or, they made up stories. At least, they told us the good ones. I have friends who told me they heard from relatives, or friends, or family on Long Island, that these kids were on their way to Los Angeles. That's what I heard from one friend. And they even told me the good ones — they said they were on their way to Canada when they were in a terrible plane crash, or a terrible fire. But we never found out. We never found out anything about what happened to these kids that day. They were just gone. And when the fire happened it was so terrible. And some of our friends came over and they say, "So were these guys." But we couldn't talk about it.

When the guys in the house got back from the ranch, they couldn't get Judy to go to the Long Island Airport. They didn't know what to do
