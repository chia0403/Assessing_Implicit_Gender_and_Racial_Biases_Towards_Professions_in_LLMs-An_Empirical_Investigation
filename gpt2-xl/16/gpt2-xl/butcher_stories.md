Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Shaddo who lived in a house by the river where his customers had come to buy meat in the summer, and where a young girl named Martha worked the family farm. When he died, Martha gave her life as a sacrifice, and was buried in the family graveyard in the winter. The next spring, when she was married, she lived as a married woman in the community for about six months. Then she again became a widow, and lived for a few years. Then she became a widow again, and continued to live in the community, and was buried there in the spring. One day, Martha was walking through the fields looking through the iron gates, when a hunter walked by and shot at her, and the shot shattered the iron gate and she fell down. When she got up, she heard the hunter tell her friend that she ought to give up hunting. So Martha said to her friend, "Why don't you try to catch the boy next time you see him!" So the hunter hunted with the boy and got him.

After a time the hunter called his family together to tell them that the girl was dead, and then his family mourned for her until the next summer when they gave life with her in their hearts so as to bring her back to life with them and celebrate her life as a member of their family. Her name was Martha. And she is now a member of our family who lives in our house
