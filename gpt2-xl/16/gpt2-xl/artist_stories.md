Once upon a time, there was a artist named T.S. Eliot. His work, like his life, was as strange and enigmatic as it was beautiful, if you know what I mean. It was a time when it seemed that the world was full of mysteries and dangers. And there were people like Eliot, who came along at moments like this, to add a little more meaning and order, so to speak, to those things we do not fully comprehend. For example, in the case of his poem "The Waste Land," which is about the fall of Troy and the people who were left behind when the Trojan Horse took one of their gods. I did not really like this poem until I learned that Eliot, by the way, was bisexual. He had a deep and long relationship with the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, and this relationship had a big effect on his writing. So, I was very touched and moved when I saw that at the end of the poem, there was part of the horse's tail that was left behind, as well as a ring, perhaps the last remaining link. So when I began to read the poem, I wondered if we would find this element in my own verse. In my own poem. That is not saying that other people can't read the poem and find things in it that might make them uncomfortable, but if it is really the only way to read this poem and feel the same, then it is probably not what the poem really is
