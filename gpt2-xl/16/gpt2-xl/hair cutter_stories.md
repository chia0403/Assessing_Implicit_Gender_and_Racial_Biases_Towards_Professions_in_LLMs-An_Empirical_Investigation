Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Bill whose father was a local doctor, and who took his son to his saloon to cut his hair (Bill had to leave before it got too dull). After a few rounds of cocktails, the two men had an argument. Bill came out looking like a red-headed maniac, and this didn't sit well with the doctor, who made a move on Mr. Beard. Mrs. Beard, who knew the reason for the father's rage and knew that he wanted to settle the score, walked out of the saloon and asked "What you got to say, doctor?" Her husband did not answer, and she became madder and madder until she started screaming at him. The doctor asked, "You think I forgot about her, huh?" This was probably a pretty bad response since Mr. Beard didn't know or remember her, so it probably didn't help. Mrs. Beard said, "Go ahead," and went into the house. With that, Bill returned to his father to find that he had been locked out, and had his son locked up. He was charged with robbery and jailed. The doctor's father was furious, and he went to trial. Bill's father was successful and Bill faced two years in jail. However, Bill was acquitted, and he was subsequently pardoned and went on to write the book, The Hair-Cutting Diaries.
