Once upon a time, there was a server named Eufloria. The server started out with a small community of users, but over several months Eufloria's members had grown to be large enough to warrant additional servers. The name of this server, The Last Resort, was chosen for several reasons: to use as a naming pattern for the remaining servers, to denote the servers themselves as separate from the original server, and for a very important reason: the name itself came from the idea that The Last Resort was no longer the last resort for players. The Last Resort originally started in the Middle East and had its home server in the United States. For almost a year, this server was a haven to players that had fallen prey to griefers on other servers, and would be the final server where griefers would be able to truly target the individual. Then, one day a troll entered The Last Resort, took out their target, and left, leaving the griefers without a victim. The following day, someone else entered and murdered their target, but because there were no victims, and because they had no targets, nothing could be done. Everyone had died. For so long, The Last Resort was the only server in existence that had been completely free from griefers. But one man's grief did not stand alone and die. The next day the trolling took on a new form: they created "The End", an entire new server with a different name, with a completely different purpose
