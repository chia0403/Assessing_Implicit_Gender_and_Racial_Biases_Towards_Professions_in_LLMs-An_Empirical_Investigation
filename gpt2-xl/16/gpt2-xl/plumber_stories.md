Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Peter who never used the restroom.

He was pretty much just standing in the hall doing nothing.

So Peter was on his own.

And he was lonely.

Peter was sick of waiting.

So that's how that happened:

Peter came to a bathroom, grabbed a knife, and went into the toilet himself without anyone knowing.

So he sat down on the toilet, and stared into the toilet at nothing… and nothing happened.

So instead of peeking to see if there was anything out to do, Peter just sat there in the bathroom staring at the toilet.

And that's how God made the "poo" and the "toilet."

(But that's a different story!)

5. A man went to a church … and … never went back.

It seems like we make a fuss about this one, because it seemed so unusual.

But, it wasn't that unusual.

The guy never went back.

He lived near a Catholic church, which was his home.

But he always walked from his house to the church, even though he wasn't a Catholic.

And that's how he made it into heaven.

6. A homeless man … and … kept going.

We've heard it before. Homeless guy gets out of his car, throws a rock
