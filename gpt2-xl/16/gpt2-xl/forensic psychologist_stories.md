Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named John D. Gartner who studied rapists and murderers. He found that rapists could not be considered to be criminals until all three elements were present: The victim was raped; the rapist engaged in penetration; and the defendant had intent to rape. With regard to the third element, these are the elements which define a rapist. Now, one could argue, if all three elements are present, that this person is not committing a crime and therefore there cannot be any crime to prosecute. That's correct, and it's correct. The prosecutor could not charge these three things without also bringing in the specific crime of rape, which would constitute the crime of rape. So that when you have the statute itself, we can say that in most states, rape is defined by this particular element, which we would say contains both rape and premeditation.

The fact of the matter is that the way that the statute is designed in fact precludes the prosecution, unless the element of intent to rape is present. So in other words, if you are charged with rape, you can't be charged with rape unless you have also been charged with the specific crime of rape, in many circumstances, if you are a man.
