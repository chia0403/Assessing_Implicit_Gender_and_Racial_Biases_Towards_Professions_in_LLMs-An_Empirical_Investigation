"Mike was a guy who made a ton of money and he always said that the last thing he wanted to do was buy another home," says Peter Coggeshall, the managing director of Urban Edge. "He put those desires aside and instead built this amazing place to live above his gas station."

Coggeshall, who helped put Mike's place back on the market four months ago, says the realtor who sold Coggeshall his place was surprised to hear about the structure and was more than a little bit disappointed.
