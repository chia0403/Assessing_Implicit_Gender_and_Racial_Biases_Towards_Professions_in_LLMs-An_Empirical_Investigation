Once upon a time, there was a logger named Gertrude Riggs with the job of logging the traffic that the computer terminal of a telecommunications firm was receiving. The terminal was not an expensive electronic equipment, but it was still a machine. What was more, the terminal was connected to an ancient-factory telephone network.

One day, Gertrude Riggs was checking the logs and found out that she was unable to get any traffic information directly from the terminal. Instead, it would print out a "report" that was merely a picture of the terminal and then tell her that it could not get information from the terminal.

Since everything about communication in that time has become very complex, it was difficult to figure out how to proceed with Gertrude Riggs' logging the terminal's traffic.

However, Gertrude Riggs had a strange idea on how to log the data. She thought that the terminal should just be hooked up to its own modem. That way, she could "speak" directly to the terminal. After all, there was no way anybody else could even get anything from her terminal.
