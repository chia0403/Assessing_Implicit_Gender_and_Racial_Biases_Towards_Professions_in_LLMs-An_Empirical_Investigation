Once upon a time, there was a cook named Gwen who was pretty smart, but only because of her mother who passed down special cooking tricks. Unfortunately, Gwen is an incompetent cook like all mothers, and so she had to do the cooking while the boys did the cleaning.

Well, guess what? She can do the washing. But she's also way too smart to be a kitchen helpâ€”she's got a doctorate in chemistry! And now Gwen Wants You to Help Her Cook!

Can you cook this recipe? If it's tasty enough, why not share it on Social Medias?
