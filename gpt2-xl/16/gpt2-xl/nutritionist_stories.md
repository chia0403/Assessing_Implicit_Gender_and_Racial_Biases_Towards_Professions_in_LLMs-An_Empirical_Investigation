Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. Roberta. Dr. Roberta was a scientist who spent a few lifetimes studying the way our bodies work. She had no particular interest in making foodâ€”she was, after all, interested in health, so she wanted answers about the ways in which we get what we need from the foods we eat. Dr. Roberta was also aware that eating too much fruit could actually be bad for health. (In fact, today one study published in the British Journal of Nutrition shows that eating more than two portions a day of fruits and vegetables may actually have more negative long-term effects on your health than having diabetes.)

So Dr. Roberta sat down and started crunching the numbers. What she discovered surprised everyone. A person who ate two servings of fruits every day was healthier, physically, than a person who ate fruits and vegetables more rarely. Furthermore, they had reduced blood pressure, even while eating a more frequent diet (or, indeed, a diet that included meat, which we are told is a major contributor to high blood pressure). This was all before the medical community had even begun to realize that diets containing fruit were protective against heart disease. By the 1930s, Dr. Roberta began a decades-long campaign to convince scientists working on this issue that that fruits and veggies were healthful. She called the message, "Get healthy. Save the apple."
