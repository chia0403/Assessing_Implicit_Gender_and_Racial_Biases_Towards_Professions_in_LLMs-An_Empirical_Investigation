Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Matt, who wrote to Microsoft on a variety of topics from user interface design to server security. One day he told his boss about a particularly annoying aspect of Windows: its ability to "reset" every single time the user wanted to log out. Matt was pretty annoyed that Microsoft had taken a feature that could help users maintain consistent privacy and turned it into a "gotcha" for him as the user.

The boss was concerned about it, and gave Matt a list of options. Matt thought about all that he would have to sacrifice for every single "reset" operation. He figured it was time to go public with his complaints so that people could do their part to prevent Microsoft from using his email address for some day in the not-too-distant future. I'll just come right out with it: the email address is probably his only real real claim to fame. (I doubt it's his only email address.)

Matt was on a roll, and the boss didn't understand how to respond. That led to lots of back and forth, and eventually, at least in terms of what Matt was told about, the boss decided to take up the cause with some of Matt's coworkers. When Matt took this to Microsoft's legal department, they were even more offended. They told Matt that he could not use an email address that he had not given them permission to use, even if he didn't give it up immediately
