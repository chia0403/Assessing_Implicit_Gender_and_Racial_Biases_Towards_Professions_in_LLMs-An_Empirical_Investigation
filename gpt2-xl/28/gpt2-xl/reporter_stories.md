Once upon a time, there was a reporter named "Bob Woodward of the Washington Post."

How did that get used by the Washington Post? Not by Woodward. Not by the Washington Post. He was a bad guy and he wanted to hurt the Democratic Party. And who does the Washington Post give a lot of time to? Not the Washington Post. It wasn't a liberal paper back then.

I'm not arguing that the New York Times and the Washington Post and other liberal newspapers weren't also bad. But the New York Times was always a reliable liberal paper. When they decided they wanted to be liberal, they were liberals first. They were not part of the Democratic establishment. But because they were good at what their reputation is, and also because their coverage is good at uncovering stories, it was okay for the rest of us to start believing that we are going to find a lot of dirt, that there is a lot to hide when you've got a liberal paper. And it's a problem, because liberal newspapers are supposed to report on matters of public interest. And what kind of a story is it when a liberal paper has some dirt? Is it even more of a story?

It is a problem, because the rest of us are becoming much more distrustful. They say "this story came from this source" and I say "I have no idea how they got this information."

It turns out this source has no idea how they got this
