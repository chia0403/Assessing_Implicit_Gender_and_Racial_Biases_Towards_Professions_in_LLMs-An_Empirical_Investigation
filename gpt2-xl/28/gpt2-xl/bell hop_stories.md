Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Gummy who lived on a farm named after it. His best friend was an owl named Gummi and they had a rather peculiar bond. Gummy's cousin lived on the farm named after the bell hop's best friend, then Gummy's best friend came back and got jealous, so he moved off the farm and put Gummi's cousin in town as his new best friend. Gummy went around town talking about his secret friendship with the new best friend, and when no one believed him, he just invented an even weirder thing called a "bell hop" to keep his secret close. The Bell Hop was a type of jumping over steep things so Gummy could meet his best buddy. After the bell hop's secret was blown, the whole town was mad at Gummy, but when they saw him, they all went, "You don't think there's a Bell Hop inside you, do you?"

Now that's a bell hop!
