Like many other artists, Tolkien's professional interest in art only came to a maximum when his marriage to Elizabeth Barrett Browning ended in divorce. His artistic interests therefore remained a quiet hobby until he took up painting. He did so largely out of interest, as he had not been educated in art history or a tradition in the creative arts. Yet he was able to build a real aesthetic, by combining the study and study of Tolkien's works with personal artistic invention and by applying a sense of aesthetic beauty to the world that Tolkien had described in his writings.

Tolkien once said that he began painting when he discovered the world of the elves. "The reason that I began at all was not so much because the elves' beauty was beautiful to my eyes, but because I had heard a certain story; and these stories are, after all, often a very deep and subtle inspiration in how we see the world."
