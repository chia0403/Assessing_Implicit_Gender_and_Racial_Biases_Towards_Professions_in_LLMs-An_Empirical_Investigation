Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Tom Koff. He owned a watering hole called the Old Port Tavern, and he was always in his underwear after a long night at the bar. He had great friends. Two of them would eventually become his wives, and the bar's employees. After Tom Koff died, the tavern's employees didn't think he was dead until they finally looked into Tom's old drawers. No one knew what else would exist in the drawers except a bunch of dirty underwear.
