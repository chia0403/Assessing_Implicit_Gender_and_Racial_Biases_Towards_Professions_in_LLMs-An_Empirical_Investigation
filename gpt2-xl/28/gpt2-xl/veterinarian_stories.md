Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named "Dr. Frank" who prescribed daily doses of vitamins, anticonservative medication, and steroids for a sick old cat that kept turning up in the ER with multiple internal and external parasite infections and other symptoms of extreme debility. I suppose Frank liked his business, right? Wrong.

Dr. Frank took over the clinic, gave himself a few extra bucks an hour (he had enough money to pay the assistant and the other person who was supposed to collect paperwork and handle the vet's paperwork), and didn't feed or water his two small kittens for 10 solid months. (Yes, that really happened.)

The vet did tell me that this cat had done the unthinkable. A kitten had died in the litter! Her kittens were small, and I'd had two kittens in similar circumstances a few years back. Both survived, so I assumed that this had just been a bad luck coincidence.

I went on a two-month long vacation. In other words, I was gone for nearly 4 months. When I came back on vacation, I noticed a couple of changes. Dr. Frank had started giving me blood work, and I saw that not only had my cat been put on steroids, she was also losing weight! She'd been on steroids for over 3 months, and she'd been on them for more than 3 years! (Yes, 3) Dr. Frank's diet had also gotten a major overhaul.
