Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Dr. John Biedermann. In the 1950's in New York City, he treated a patient (later to be referred to as "Mr. X") by administering electroshock therapy to increase the patient's libido by stimulating the clitoris. Dr. Biedermann's technique of electroshock therapy was controversial at the time, and was quickly abandoned for the new techniques of sexual therapy developed by other doctors and therapists. What is notable about Biedermann's technique is that the stimulation of the clitoris was the sole element of the treatment. It seems quite clear that Biedermann was merely providing the patient with a distraction from the sexual issues at hand. Yet, he did have to worry about his fellow therapists from having the pleasure of pleasuring the patient with electricity. In the 1960's and 1970's, this treatment method was revived. Dr. Biedermann revived electroshock after having seen some promising results in patients. However, Biedermann's method of electroshock therapy was quickly found to be unsafe and dangerous. The initial results of Biedermann's therapy in the last years of the 20th Century and even the first years of the 21st Century have been abysmal. Electroshock was widely abused from the 1940's until the 1970's. As a result of many abuses of electroshock therapy, the American Psychiatric Association no longer recommends it.
