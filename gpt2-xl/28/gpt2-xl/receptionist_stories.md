Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Amy who was known with her colleagues by the nickname of "Amy!" When her colleagues left for the night, Amy would go to her office and work in her pajamas. After a month, a rumor spread across the office that she had cheated on her boyfriend with another man, and for that she was terminated.[1]

Trivia [ edit ]

In the Japanese version, the reason for Amy's dismissal at a party is that she forgot to wear her red apron.
