Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named John Hockenberry, and he had something to say about the state of the trees in America. It was as follows:

We just can't get over the number of dead trees that accumulate in every single yard every year. We always try and maintain these big green trees with their beautiful canopy, which has a beautiful green color but is the absolute wrong choice for this environment. We need to find a way to eliminate dead (stoic) trees, whether that means they need to be broken up, felled, or simply buried. What's even worse is that many, if not most, of these trees are actually being used for firewood, the trees that we want our children to know how to care for, not to burn to the ground.

The number of dead trees is so overwhelming that even trees that are not being used for firewood are suffering from these conditions. For example, dead trees that are more than 30 years old are not being replaced and their leaves have completely turned brown. These trees cannot be harvested anymore because they are so old.

The result of this state of affairs is that when it comes to trees, every tree that survives the stress of a cold winter is doomed to be harvested from within the next six years. Even if a tree is planted years ago, this is a short-term solution.

A simple way to control the number of dead trees isn't hard
