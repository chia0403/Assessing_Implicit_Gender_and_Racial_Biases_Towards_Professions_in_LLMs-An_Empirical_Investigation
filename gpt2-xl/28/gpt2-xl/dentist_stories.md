Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. D. J. Molloy, the best male dentist in the world. One day he took a call from a client who was suffering from anxiety about a recently completed dental procedure. Dr. Molloy advised his patient that even a few teeth extracted can alleviate his fear. The dentist then set into motion a chain of events which resulted in the rest of the world discovering another one of the greatest male dentists out there: Dr. Molloy himself. After a few moments of shock, Dr. Molloy then asked how long that client would need his services. The client responded "As long as it takes. It's called the future and the future is never written in stone." Now, Dr. Molloy knew what Dr. Cawood had had in mind: the dental community had never seen such a brilliant male dental expert as himself, Dr. Molloy would never let me down, and in my own words he was not just some man, he was a woman who understood my dental needs, and I would always come back for more. The rest is history.
