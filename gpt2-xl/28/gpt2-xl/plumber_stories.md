Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Jack. He knew about toilets, but he had no idea what a baby was. But he knew there were children and he wanted to help them!

He invented an attachment called the Jack the Plumber. It worked like a diaper, but when you took off the front button it transformed its user into a baby. Jack, at least in his mind, was a savior to his fellow kids. It began in London, where Jack was working as a plumber. He met a lot of kids and enjoyed their company. They drank tea together and played dice. This was his hobby and his passion as a plumber.

Later in life, Jack saw an ad in the newspaper for some special equipment for little children. It was a "plumber on a skateboard," as Jack put it. It was also the ideal place to make his dreams come true if he hadn't already.

So Jack the Plumber came into being and the first attachment was designed to attach to the back of a skateboard. It was a perfect fit! But Jack didn't stop there! Jack also created other attachments like a ladder and a scooter that could roll on flat terrain.

Even the famous film "Zootopia," starring Ginnifer Goodwin and voiced by Idina Menzel, features a Jack the Plumber. He helps Judy Hopps with her problems.
