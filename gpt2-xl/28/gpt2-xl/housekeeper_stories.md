Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Nelle. Once in her lifetime, Nelle was the most beautiful woman in Westeros, but after she became the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch she disappeared.

The first step was to discover that she was the daughter of House Stark. This was no easy task, as few Westerosi women of the same age as Nelle's would be named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. The next step was to find her. She was found in a great castle by the name of Winterfell, where the last survivor of the Night's Watch, Rickon Stark, was born.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Watch and its responsibilities, none of the lords beyond the Wall knew all that happened in their lands. When the news of the death of Jon Snow, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, reached the shores of the North, Lord Eddard Stark decided it would be wise to keep the truth hidden from the North.

Nelle's mother was one of those Lords beyond the Wall, and after the death of her young daughter, the last living member of Winterfell sent word to Rickon to keep quiet if he had any knowledge of her whereabouts; he did not.

Knowing that Nelle was with Rickon for some time, Eddard, upon hearing of this, ordered Rickon's father, House Stark, to find him and to bring him home as quickly
