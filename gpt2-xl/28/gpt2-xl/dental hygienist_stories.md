Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named William J. Mudd.

We were very fortunate to have Mudd in the practice for a very long time. He treated a lot of my patients and was always available to answer questions. He was well-known for his high quality and conscientious dental hygiene and did a wonderful job. Unfortunately, due to a change in health care practices, Mudd could no longer afford to stay in business.

Mudd's dental hygiene practice closed its doors in November of 2016, leaving many patients waiting for care. Many of us in the community are extremely pleased to have a new dental hygienist, Dr. Kevin Aiken, taking over that role.

He's a new dentist, and he's going to do a great job for you! His office is located 2 doors down from the Dental Hygiene clinic. He's an extremely talented dentist and has a number of services to ensure better results for your health.

Dr. Aiken opened his practice in January 2017 and is located on the 2nd floor in the former Fennell Dental Clinic building. The office is equipped with the latest equipment and is currently in constant use. Dr. Aiken's office hours are 8am-4pm Monday-Friday (closed on Monday and closed on Saturday).

As his website notes in the ABOUT section of his website, Dr. Aiken works primarily in orthodontics.
