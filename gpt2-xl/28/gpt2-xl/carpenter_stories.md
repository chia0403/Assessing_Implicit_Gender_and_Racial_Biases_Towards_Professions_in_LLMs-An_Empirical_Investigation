Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Robert. Robert had a job. He had a wife and two children. He had a house he built himself and he spent every dollar he earned, to make his children as comfortable as possible. "I'm never going to spend a nickel of my own." One day, while he was out getting lumber, the lumberman's son ran up to the house and threw the lumber away. It didn't sit there, it never saw the light of day. For days it lay in the woods. Robert had no clue where his father's house was. Robert did his best to make it home to his wife and children, which he did, but the truth of the matter was, he couldn't make it home. On another day, the son came to Robert and told him the boy had thrown his father's car into the woods and run off into the woods to hide in the hills. Robert told his wife about the carpenter's son throwing the car into the woods. Her reply surprised him, she said, "Where's the carpenter?" So Robert went and looked around, with a flashlight on his head. He found the carpenter's home. Robert told the wife he bought the house and had it built himself. "When did you do this?" asked the wife. Robert wasn't sure how he had seen the house. The wife said, "I saw it right through the window." What happened next, surprised Robert even
