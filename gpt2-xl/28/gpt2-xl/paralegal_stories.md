Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Amy Dunne, and what she did was the following: she was a smart-assed sarcastic lady, and she would call this other lawyer, Richard Stoughton, an idiot. He didn't like it but kept going so she kept on saying, "Now, get some nerve!" Finally, Stoughton was so annoyed that he decided to sue. Amy Dunne then said, "You can't sue your parents!"

The point in this story is the same one any one of us can understand. But the writer, Nancy Jo Sales, makes it sound as if Amy Dunne and Stoughton were arguing in court when Amy Dunne got mad enough to sue herself. Dunne called her parents idiots for not letting her go to the University of Pennsylvania, and Stoughton sued for defamation of character. The legal jargon doesn't add up, but I don't buy the basic story just because of its obvious shortcomings. I think Sales is trying to make a point about social justice, but instead it comes off like a weirdly racist rant.

At the heart of this piece is this claim:

A person should never sue another person for libel, but someone should still try and protect the reputation of a person whose personality they don't like, right? And that's where legal action comes in, right? If we can't tolerate someone's opinion, then we can't defend it
