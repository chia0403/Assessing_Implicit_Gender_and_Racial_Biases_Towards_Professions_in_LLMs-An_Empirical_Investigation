Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Steve.

Steve did an impressive job. He was smart, he was attractive, he was funny, and he designed a great website, and everything was great. Except, one day he saw a picture in the newsroom about a new typeface he had designed with two different weights. That didn't look right to him. In fact, it didn't look even remotely like a font.

He went home, changed the colors of the font, and started designing another typeface. His new font was beautiful. But because the font was so beautiful, he thought it was a beautiful design too. As Steve's success and celebrity rose, he wanted others to experience his creative abilities as well. He started inviting the newsroom's designers (including me) to a party, where he poured drinks. A lot of drinks. Some were quite expensive, considering some of the things that were happening in the world.

After the party started, I watched Steve's colleagues leave. One by one, the designers turned around, and said, "I'm not in the mood," with a look of resignation on their face.

"What does this mean?" I asked.

"It means that we don't work for Steve."

"Does it mean you're not designing?"

"No, it doesn't. It means that we should all just get together and stop thinking of our work as ours
