Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Jim. He was a good guy. But it seems that he's a bad guy—bad like bad guys go. I got a message from Jim: "I haven't been out in some time. I'm afraid I might still be a bad guy." He said, "I heard this story yesterday; it got my juices flowing."

Jim started out as a big cop who helped keep the peace, went on to become a good cop, and then went on to become even better. He was a cop who helped solve the case of "Pizza Man"—a real, live, pizza-loving serial killer who terrorized Chicago for a decade. He is known to this day as The Cannibal.

And I'm gonna tell you one of the most terrifying stories ever told. It happened to Jim. Two years ago, he was working a homicide case. This case was in Chicago, and his partner was assigned to it. But Jim was bored. He would always look forward to a cold case. And here, while he was on patrol, a call came in about a rape. Then came more calls about a murder. It was getting late in the night. Jim didn't know what to do, so he got off his shift and headed to the station.

Then he saw the officer on his way to the station.

"You wanna work on that murder case, Jim?"
