Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Tasha. For those of you keeping score at home – that's seven Tasha as in the number of flights in a year – she's just one of the numerous 'Bachelor in Paradise' cast members featured in Season 4 of ABC's long-running franchise.

With more Bachelor's than ever before, Tasha took part in the season with 10 other former beauties from Paradise, including Kaitlyn Bristowe (pictured left, right), JoJo Fletcher, Brielle Faye and Jef Holm.

Fans have to marvel at the fact that Tasha hasn't changed, despite the fact she was sent to Arizona for her bachelor degree, which has come about without the use of all those extra-marital pleasures and parties.

After the season, Tasha posted the photos and stories of being in Paradise and she wasn't shy to share her thoughts on the experience:

I'll save the sexy details for my book. I did NOT go on one of the most embarrassing dates in the history of the Universe. I didn't go because I was so bored and I didn't like the guys who came.

In my experience, there might be a higher chance of you being physically attacked on a date if you are not from Paradise. The men here are more than a little bit creepy and they have little to no manners. I don't know why it bothers some people so much
