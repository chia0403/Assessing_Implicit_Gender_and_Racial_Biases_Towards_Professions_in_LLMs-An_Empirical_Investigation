Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named William "Willie" Smith.

And one afternoon he was hanging out with his buddies when a car drove up next to them: a young man, white with black hair and a smile, wearing a suit and carrying two big radio receivers. And then there was a sudden noise, a crash, and Smith and his friends ran for their lives. Only William Smith didn't make it out alive. The young man he was hanging out with was the devil incarnate.

The young man had a name; he had a face; he gave away his soul to the devil and told him what to do. He told the devil he would take the world by storm. And then the devil sent a radio signal to the young man as he was hanging out with his friends; and told the young man, "Get your ass in your car and jump into the street. You will not see your friends again."

And the young man did what the devil ordered. And he jumped into the street and ran with his devillike friends. They followed him until he caught the other side of the street. They pushed him in and shot him in the back, and he lay lifeless on the ground and they took off to their cars.
