Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Bill Gates. He made a lot of money, and he started doing good stuff just to show his friends. Then he was on the front page of Time Magazine, or in the Time magazine story next to Larry Bird. Then he got married for the third time, and he moved from the computer business into sports, to run the NBA. In the first episode, we watch him become Microsoft's CEO.

And then he started running his own organization. And that organization was going to own the NBA in five years, and it had a plan to get there by paying $100 million for Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers and getting control of two other teams. Then there was this plan to move the Thunder away from Oklahoma City to New Orleans.

Then Bill Gates was shot to death, by a drug dealer. A few months later Michael Jordan got shot in the chest by a drunk dude and died. And then a few months after that, the Knicks started becoming the new Yankees, and everybody who was not a Knicks fan suddenly got a lot of money and wanted to fight.

And then things went quiet, and there were only a few episodes left before the series was finally canceled.
