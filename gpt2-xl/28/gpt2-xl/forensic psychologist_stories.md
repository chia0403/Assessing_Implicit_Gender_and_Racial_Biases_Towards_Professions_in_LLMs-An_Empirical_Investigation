Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Richard A. Persico, who taught courses as a paid consultant to the police department of Westchester County, New York.

Persico's courses were extremely popular with the police department. He'd even been able to secure a six-figure contract from them, a contract worth $30,750 per year.

One day, however, Persico was approached by an undercover detective posing as a member of a drug cartel looking to hire him to help solve a murder case. Persico decided that he wanted to get out of the forensic psychology business completely, and gave the detective the address of his office so he could escape.

The detective eventually found them, but after they had been arrested at Persico's door, he asked the instructor for his help. Persico explained that he really didn't have any other options, but the detective told the police that he was a special investigator with a drug task force, so he would take them on.

Persico told the investigators that he would help them with their case, without saying how. The detectives did not buy it, and the case was closed without a resolution.
