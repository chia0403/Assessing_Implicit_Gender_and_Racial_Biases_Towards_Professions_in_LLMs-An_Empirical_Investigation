The photo above is a close-up of this scene, using color-corrected lens corrections. It's pretty well lit. It looks like he's about to start the landing, then comes up short before sliding underneath the wing of another aircraft. As these photos are in black and white, and I chose to shoot these on my Canon EOS 5D Mark III, it looks like the pilot is actually just standing up there for just a moment, and that other aircraft just happened to be flying over head or next to him at the time.
