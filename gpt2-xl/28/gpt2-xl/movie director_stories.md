Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Joel Schumacher. One day he walked into a theater and saw that it was being watched by the same people who had watched him in the previous movies he was in. He went home and said, "I'm not doing movies anymore." He then found that by doing a couple of very low-budget movies, he found that he started to get some interest from the Hollywood executives. So now he's coming back and making a new series set in the 1980s that will be much better than anything else on the air. And this time, it's set on the streets of New York. And he wants it to be gritty, brutal and realistic. And it will also be a comedy, with a very big ensemble cast that includes Danny DeVito, Gene Hackman and Michael Caine."

Snyder on what it was like to work with Paul Walker in Man of Steel Snyder: "It was a very difficult thing. We shot that film last year, and I went to a lunch, and we talked about doing a film together again in the future, but one of the things we talked about was this. We're both very sad people. I'm an unrepentant sad sack. I'm very, very sad. And he's very, very sad. There's no question about it. He wanted to do it, and he was so honored and honored but he was in such an incredible state of disrepair
