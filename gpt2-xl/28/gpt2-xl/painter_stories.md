Once upon a time, there was a painter named Jack Smith. Smith took a job canvassing outside of New York City, which he still does. He does not charge to paint his canvases: the only cost is paint. And there are no professional standards, such as paint quality, size and even how large the canvas should be.

Smith paints on the street, in the street, on a wall, along a chain link fence â€“ wherever he sees people stopping and looking, on any piece of physical ground, on which there is some kind of object that people stand around looking at. This is what he does, day after day, for decades. He's never had anyone ask him questions about what he's doing. The people stop and stare. And when he asks, he gets good answers.

Smith would never admit that for a moment. But many artists do, and some of them take a stand.

That's exactly what one artist did recently, after he was stopped and questioned for many hours by police who had never encountered him.

The artist, J.R. Jones Jr., said he would have nothing to do with police. Police often want to have a conversation with the artist; they don't simply want to speak to him, according to Jones.

"My whole life I have been standing in the heart of these people," Jones said. "They'd like to sit down and chat and ask me questions of what I do.
