Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Mike the cat. He lived in a little red-brick, two-story house in the poor part of town. He had a black spot on his left cheek, from where he'd accidentally been tickled by the cat's claws. And at five p.m., he'd go around to people's houses, check all the windows for loose cats, and drag the ones whose owners weren't home into the waiting van. He'd make sure the cats were inside before driving off.

There was one problem with this. He lived two hours from a veterinarian.

There was a cat there, named Mavis, who had an incredible amount of health problems. Mike wasn't willing to abandon her.

Then, one day, Mike woke up sick and fell into one of his dreams, a sleep that could only be sustained by naps of wine laced with Prozac. Mavis wandered into his house, and Mike made her his breakfast. When she drank it, the whole memory suddenly disappeared.

Mike still hadn't come to terms with losing his girl and his cat. All the time he spent around them, he'd still get scared when they passed. He worried over the time it would take for Mavis to die, and over the fate of his own health. He spent a good deal of his time researching the topic of terminal illness.

Mavis gave him a lot of comfort
