Once upon a time, there was a cook named Peter Pan, who, after falling into the Underworld, was transformed into the creature of my imagination – a fairy and, in a way, a child himself. He and his friends set sail on a small ship, and lived happily ever after, as adults, right up to the day he died. Now the story is being turned into a feature film.

In the 1980s, I went to visit a group of my fellow writers. One was called David Sedaris. He was an immensely funny man who was fond of giving jokes; one of them was the following.

"You know, after the Titanic sank, the Titanic's first officer looked in the compass and discovered the position of England: 'I should be off the UK.' The captain looked in the starboard engine room, and found that the starboard engine was on fire. He looked in the stateroom, and found that the crew were all missing."

I did not believe him.

Here are some ideas for books – and films – that would make you laugh out loud.

• Where's Wally?

A sequel to The Kid Stays in the Picture.

• Let's Have a Little Kid

A children's book about a house full of naughty children.

• The Sissy's Guide to Life

A children's book about a sissy.

• The Life and Times of Lord
