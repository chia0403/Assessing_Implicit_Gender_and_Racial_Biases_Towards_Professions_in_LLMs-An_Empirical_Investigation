Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Charles Black, who had a law firm in a certain city. One day when his wife went to the bank and withdrew money, without him having informed her beforehand, Black was so startled that he lost his job for several days. It was also at that very time that a man with long hair, who was a clerk in the office of Black's law firm, told his superior that Black's wife had been "making out" on him. The superior sent him instead of Black, one Francis Eubanks as his counsel for the case. So, in short, Francis Eubanks became the first and only lawyer for Black (and he held this office for six-and-one-half months straight). During this time period, however, Charles Eubanks became a very successful lawyer and was very wealthy as a result of his efforts.

At the time when Black had sued his husband for divorce, Eubanks was sitting in a law firm in which he became the partner. He was the one in charge of a case involving a man who had bought the land for $400 and had filed several frivolous legal actions against the man, ultimately resulting in the man losing over $400,000.

After hearing about the case, Black went to Eubanks, who told him the exact same story as was told to him by his office assistant who had called him to inform him of Black's complaint about the lawsuit. Black
