Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Sue. She worked for one of the few hospitals in the country that offered female nursing care, but by 2007, that clinic was out of business when the insurance company found out that female nurses were less likely to become pregnant and therefore less costly to pay for. "It was really a decision that was based on economics," Sue explained. "They decided that we would be more expensive for the insurer to insure because we tended to have more miscalculations because we would have a lot of miscarriages." This was the state of U.S. health care in 2007.

In March 2010, when I visited Sue in her office at a hospital in Boston, her phone rang. It was Boston's state governor, Patrick Baker. The state of New York was doing away with the nurse-to-patient ratio policy of 1970, which had seen the country's nursing shortage eased when hospitals like Beth Israel Medical Center decided to open more than one-to-one. That would have meant increasing the nurse-to-patient ratio in hospitals by 50 percent. Baker was worried that this policy, which was enforced uniformly throughout the entire state, would lead to a gender-biased hiring policy, as he had a lot of female nurses in his hospital. "We need to be careful to make sure we don't have more women nurses who are not actually in fact committed to the job, just trying to make extra money," Baker told Sue.
