Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Joe the Butcher, who drove a forklift truck full of manure into the front yard of the house of a person whose son worked as a delivery driver for the dairy company. Joe made a mess when he arrived. He dumped a load of manure at the front door of that person's son (you can't see from the photograph above); he broke both the glass and the hinges of the front door; he smashed up a few of the house's furniture; he made a mess of the inside of the house; he broke the floorboards; and all the while his truck kept running. After Joe dumped the manure, he went and bought another forklift truck for extra traffic, and drove it to the same place. He drove it again, and again, and again, until he had filled three more delivery trucks full.

This happened so many times that my neighbor became the butt of jokes about the Butcher. As of the time I wrote this, Joe had apparently stopped driving the forklift trucks and had taken an even higher-paying position driving another truck full-time instead. His neighbor's son became a UPS driver, the Butcher has lost all her milk and has been arrested for a laundry-list of petty crimes (that he does not remember), and Joe the Butcher (also presumably a butcher) apparently has taken every other job available to him. He is currently writing poetry and writing to the editor of an academic journal in response
