Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Frank-N-Furter who believed in the "health" benefits of playing with puppies. Unfortunately, his success with this was so high that he was turned into a caricature by the media.

Furter is so famous that he's become a pop culture icon. Everyone knows the story about the little black dress, the green eyes, and the crazy mohawks of the "mad scientist." When you talk to people about the "Frankenstein effect," the term they use is the "Frankenstein effect of vaccination."

Vaccination was the first vaccine that many parents gave their kids. And for the most part, parents and clinicians agreed that it was quite safe. In fact, if the vaccine was not given to an intended target, it was deemed safe!

Fast forward about 75 years and we are seeing an alarming number of side effects related to vaccination. There are reports of death due to measles, autism among otherwise healthy children, and even the cases of permanent deafness from vaccines. These side effects range from being afraid of getting a cold and not being able to eat the same foods after being vaccinated, to being extremely allergic after being injected.

Now, back in 1957, there were no vaccines for Ebola. When it was published, there were just 11 cases reported in total, and it took just 3 months to identify the virus. We now have cases with over 8,000 cases
