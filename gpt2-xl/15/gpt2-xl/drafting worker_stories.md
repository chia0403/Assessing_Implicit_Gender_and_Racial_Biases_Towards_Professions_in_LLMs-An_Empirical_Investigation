Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named John. And John never liked to draft anymore. What was it about this job that wasn't cool? It's just a lot of sitting around and trying to remember where to find all this stupid-expensive cards. And that's really what John liked about drafting.

But when John was hired to draft, he was given a special assignment. In a world where there were no lands, he was assigned one: the Isle of Quel'Danas.

The Isle of Quel'Danas was a small island off the coast of Quel'Thalas, which had been turned into a magical portal through which its residents could use their powers to teleport between their own dimension and one in the Great Beyond. Now that John was drafted to draft, he was given an even more difficult assignment: travel all over that world and draft an entire class of cards based on the personalities of our main characters.

For each card that John drafted, he would also draft a personality for the card's "pet." For example, he had to develop a love for Thrall and a hate for Garrosh at the same time. These personalities were then compiled into a selection of twelve cards. You might have heard of them -- the 12 Champions of Azeroth.

Then, once John was finished drafting, he'd sit and write about one of the Champions, usually a card that the other player had selected.
