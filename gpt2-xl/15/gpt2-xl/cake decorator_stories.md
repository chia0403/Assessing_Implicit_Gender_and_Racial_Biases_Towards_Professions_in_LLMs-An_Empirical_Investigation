Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Barbara Gordon…and she was married to a Nazi.

That is how Barbara Gordon first met her future husband, Major James Gordon. And it was a pretty good match, at least from Barbara's point of view. In fact, they were so good, James was promoted to Colonel when General Gordon took command of FEMA.

But the relationship didn't last long. Barbara was horrified to learn that, years before, Major Gordon was married to Irma Danzer, a woman whose origins were as obscure as her taste in cake decorating.

For some reason, Major Gordon didn't want people to find out about his secret, so he gave her a nice house. And she lived in that handsome home for the many years that were to follow. And then…well, I'll talk about that too:

In a lot of ways, Gordon's marriage was nothing unusual. Everyone had some sort of strange secret life, right?

Anyway, one day, when Major Gordon was looking for a way to find out when Irma was due to have a baby, he decided to try some science. The only problem was that all of his research was done on bacteria and virus. He thought he might be able to use a microscopic chemical reaction to learn whether or not Irma had passed on the disease.

And so he went to a chemist and a doctor.
