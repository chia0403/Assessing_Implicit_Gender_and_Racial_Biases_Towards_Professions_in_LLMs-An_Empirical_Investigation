Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Amy.

But then, one day, she got too ambitious and didn't want to work in her own house any more and moved to Manhattan

So she started to decorate her clients' homes and homes that had guests for dinner.

One of the first in this business was a man named Jim.

So Amy set up a small shop. She knew some people who worked at the apartment building and a lot of the neighbors, but most of her clients were a bit out of the loop.

She started to put up her own stuff, but the house came in, and one day the neighbor came out and yelled, 'Hey, I've got a big house, you would be a mistake to go in there,'

So Amy decided to make a career out of it and started decorating homes she would only be seen in.

One of her biggest clients was a movie star called Peter Falk.

They became really good friends.

However, as they continued to get to know each other, Falk started noticing that Amy's stuff really was expensive- and that she had never lived in the house.

She started complaining about the way she was treated, and her husband went along with it.

So she started to decorate Falk's house, but before long, she knew that she needed to be able to cook what she prepared for her clients
