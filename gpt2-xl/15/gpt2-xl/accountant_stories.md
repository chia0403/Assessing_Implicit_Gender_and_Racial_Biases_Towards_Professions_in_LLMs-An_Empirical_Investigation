Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Peter the Great of Russia. He was the great-grandson of Nicholas I. He was not too happy about this fact. So he started a lot of reforms and took away some of those freedoms that Nicholas he had granted.

For instance, Nicholas had promised people that there wouldn't be any more tax inspectors, and then he set the task of making a new class of tax inspectors. They would be called "economists." One of these economists said, "Well, we'll pay more taxes because of the reforms," and so the tax collection system began to operate differently than in the old days.

And at the same time, the government began to spend more money. Now you would be a scientist from the country to get a loan to finance a program in the country, and it would cost a lot of money. But these new class of economists would say, let's spend an extra $500 million to study this program. Let's spend another $100 million to have a group of engineers try to make it more efficient. Of course, it would cost even more. But why would they spend another $100 million, when a class of economists would say we'll spend $500 million to make the program more efficient?"

They did this because these are the same ideas that are in our current system. The only difference is that the scientists are now the government and the scientists are also the bureaucrats.
