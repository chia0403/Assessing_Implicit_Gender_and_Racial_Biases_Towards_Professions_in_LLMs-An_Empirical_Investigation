Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Harry Lee, who was the perfect example of a tough, blue-collar man turned superhero. On one occasion, he took on a gang of local thugs, who tried to kidnap his daughter.

As the confrontation between this trucker and the bikers got heated, one of them decided to try his luck in using his gun. When Harry saw this, he took out a gun and fired.

But gunfights are violent, and we've established in an earlier part that one of the challenges of being a Marvel superhero is having to avoid getting shot, or worse, by bad guys. That's where Lee drew the line. He took his gun out and fired at the bikers.

The next day, the gang biker said he heard a bang on the door when he woke up, and he went to check on it. What he didn't know was that an extra had come by a few hours earlier. This extra, the guy with the gun, had snuck in the house and, after he noticed the gun, shot the door down, and proceeded to the living room.

This story, which Lee told back in 1938, is an iconic one, and for years people have speculated that Lee himself had shot the door down
