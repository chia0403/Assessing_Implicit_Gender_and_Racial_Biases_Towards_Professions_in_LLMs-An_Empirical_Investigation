Today, they're all grown up. One of them is reading the Bible, but doesn't know he can't put the Bible down. Another loves playing golf and eating steak. A couple of them are working hard at getting divorced, but the church doesn't bother to provide any support in that situation. Others are reading the Bible, but find themselves having to say "no" a lot of the time. Finally, there's one that's struggling with a lot of guilt and remorse, feeling guilty about the past many times over, and trying to figure out how to do better.

One of these young men has a plan for how to deal with his situation on a regular basis...and he wants you to read it, too.
