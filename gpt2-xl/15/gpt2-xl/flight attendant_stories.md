Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Sally Peabody.

Peabody, who is still living, was a single mom of two who was traveling with two other people on a transcontinental flight. This flight is famous for having been hijacked by militant anarchists in 1973. Two cabin attendants (the women) boarded the plane.

One of the women (who was female) was a male. The flight attendant with the male passenger—her seatmate—came forward and asked Sally. "Are you a terrorist?", the woman asked her. "No", said Sally. She then asked "Do you threaten my life?", to which Sally replied "No."

The second woman, a female, walked up and said to Sally. "I'm with the TSA. You have to put your shoes back on."

And, with that, Sally did in fact put her shoes back on.

There was a lot of outrage from those on Twitter about Sally's response. People felt so badly that she had had to put her shoes back on, that they would rather have her be punished. One man actually told Sally that she should be fired.

"I got three messages on my phone saying that I should be fired," Sally said. "Somebody has to say, 'Don't be such a cow.'"

The woman said she was afraid of Sally in that moment.

"I'm really good at flying now,"
