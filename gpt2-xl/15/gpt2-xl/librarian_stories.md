Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Cesar. An orphan or perhaps the daughter of an orphan, Cesar was given by the Emperor's guard a key by which he could enter the Library's deepest levels. One day, he happened to investigate and took an interest in an old book within. It was dark and smelled of death - but that's how the Library should be.

To Cesar's horror, he realized that a number of odd noises and smells were emanating from within. In the end, his curiosity turned to terror when his hand was suddenly covered in a slimy green goo. As Cesar attempted to clean himself, the goo began to grow on him.

A couple of days later, as Cesar slept that night, he was woken up by a horrible, guttural scream â€” and it was coming from the bookcase.
