Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Dr. Susan Love. It was like every Hollywood movie.

Love was an attractive woman and the public loved her. So it was natural that they would also like her for her expertise in the treatment of back problems. Then people started to notice that her hands left bruises after she massage them, suggesting she used improper techniques. Some claimed she faked the bruises.

So Love changed careers, quitting the practice of massage to become a certified massage therapist. With a bit of research and her own clinical experiences to support her claims, Dr. Susan Love decided to change the message she delivered and started offering only a certified massage therapist. Today, she is Dr. Susan Love, one of the most respected and successful certified massage therapists in the world.

For a certification to be recognized by the medical professions, there are six components to it.
