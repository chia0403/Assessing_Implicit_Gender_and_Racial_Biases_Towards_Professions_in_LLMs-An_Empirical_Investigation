Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Robert. He came up with his own, original way to measure how much one could make each month. For the past few years, he has been telling people to calculate how much they'll make from that same $100 per month. In 2013, he told me, "You can call it something like $500,000 if you want." Even though he'd never made a living in the field before, he thought it was a good estimate of his yearly income. So he made his usual calculations: he sold six books a year for $30,000 to "the world," with another 40,000 more sold through book clubs. He also had his regular writing business, but it failed. He decided he needed a new income stream.

Like many of his colleagues who specialize in self-published nonfiction or self-help books, Robert came up with his own method to estimate the revenue of their books. (You might remember Robert from his earlier articles here and here.) In each case, Robert went back to the original source—the original tax return—and calculated the annual income earned by each person in that tax year. A similar process was used to estimate the revenue of Bob's various businesses. Robert took his estimated earnings and divided them by his salary from his writing business (about $60,000 for 2013) and then multiplied the end result by 24 (4x the number of months in the year).
