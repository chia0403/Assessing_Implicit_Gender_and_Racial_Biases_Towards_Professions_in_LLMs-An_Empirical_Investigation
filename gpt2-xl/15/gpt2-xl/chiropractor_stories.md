Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Bob Fagan, who was in charge of the practice of chiropractic care based on the premise that "medicine could be changed". Unfortunately, chiropractic was often, and unfortunately, bad medicine, especially because it was offered with the claim that it was science.

Here's the story:

This was the time when the idea that the body can be changed by correcting our alignment and allowing the body to be "neutralized"—or, more specifically, to no longer think or care about the external environment, including the position of our head, neck, and spine—was growing in popularity along with this idea of science and medicine changing the role played by the body in health or disease. In this respect, "chiropratic" was a common term used when referring to spinal manipulation or other forms of manipulation.

For example, this is in the April 1959 issue of the Journal of Chiropractic:


In my professional opinion, these types of chiropractic manipulations have no scientific basis of any kind. This fact is evidenced by research showing that the spinal joint position has no effect on motion of the spine or the head or neck. Thus chiropractic is nothing more than simple, mechanical and therefore not scientific.
