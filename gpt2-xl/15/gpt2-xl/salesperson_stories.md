Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Peter who tried to sell people on the idea of doing their taxes on paper, he wasn't successful but it is a good starting point.

This is a pretty typical approach to doing your taxes that will save you money once you've done it a few times.

1. Look over your W2 forms and do a quick "look over again" check

This will give you some clues as to the likely areas where mistakes will be made. Then look through your W2 forms again and make sure you weren't missing any sections that shouldn't have been used in the first place.

You'll find that there's a lot of unnecessary information you don't need that can't be found on the form as it exists.

Not to mention there is usually a lot of useless information included in the forms for a lot of tax years.

You'll want to make sure that you have accurate information in these areas and to avoid any mistakes.

2. Check all your boxes

One of the hardest parts about filling out your W2 forms accurately is to see you don't have enough information to see exactly any of the things you do have on a form.

So what do you do about it?

Well if you're doing your taxes manually as in the case I'm about to explain take a look over all the boxes once and twice until you see what information is missing.
