Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mrs. G. H. Evers who taught English. Mrs. Evers was always looking over her students' heads at the textbook in front of them. That was how she knew that sometimes they didn't read the books as well as they could.

She is now a famous celebrity, and thanks to her writing for "The New Yorker" magazine, she has developed a lot of fans over the years.
