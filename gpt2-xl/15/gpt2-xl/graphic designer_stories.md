Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Marc Tarnhagen who made the map for the opening sequences of the 1986 film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. You probably recognize this as the map in the background of many fanfic covers that feature the TNG crew:

After Star Trek: The Motion Picture came Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in 1987, and then Star Trek III: The Search for Spock in 1989. That was until 2007, when Marc returned to the Star Trek franchise with a map that depicted the history of the Federation since its very beginnings in the late 24th century. The map depicted the events of TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT and ENT: Chaos Theory, with the USS Voyager (NCC-1701-01) moving from the far left of that map and ending up in the middle of the frame.

Unfortunately, fans have often seen the TNG map as the "official" Star Trek map (or "official Star Trek map"), even if Tarnhagen's map was meant to be an interpretation of the original Star Trek series map. You certainly couldn't find it on Trek-centric products like posters, shirts, or books.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the premiere of Star Trek in 1973, the TNG crew commissioned Marc to re-create the original Star Trek map as a tribute
