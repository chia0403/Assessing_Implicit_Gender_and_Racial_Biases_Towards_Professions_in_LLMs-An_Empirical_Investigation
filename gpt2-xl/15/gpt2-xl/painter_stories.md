Once upon a time, there was a painter named Frankenthaler who painted the face of a man in various states of distress—sad, angry, angry, and sad. He painted the man in these states of distress and sold what he painted by the thousand of faces he had painted, and was a successful artist.

The artist Frankenthaler never got a dime out of his paintings. He felt the pain of the people that he painted, and there seemed to be a part of him that knew what had happened.

Then one day, Frankenthaler did a painting.

He painted a man, who was crying. He painted him crying into a painting bag—not taking his eyes off his canvas.

Frankenthaler painted this on a large canvas, and put it away for a couple of weeks.

He never took this painting back. Instead, the man in the painting kept painting. He kept giving him the back of his hand. Frankenthaler, who knew this was what had become of the man he had painted, didn't want this work anymore.

He took the painting away from the man, and hid it somewhere. Then he painted a man for the man in the painting.

He painted in that man's face the words, "I'm sorry."

And he painted in the face of the man who had painted him—"I love you."

His paintings never sold.
