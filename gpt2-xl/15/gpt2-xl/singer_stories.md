Once upon a time, there was a singer named Mandy Moore. In a recent song, Moore described how her boyfriend dumped her after she spent a sleepless night with an unwanted lover:

"The thing I need to tell you," I whisper to you, my throat sore,

I can barely breath, but I will try to tell you, his face hot

With anger now, he pulls his fingers from between my legs

Smashes them against my cunt, he drives and he throws,

His hands go straight down and he makes my clit bleedâ€¦"

Mandy's voice broke as she recalled the moment of sexual desperation, and how he raped her in his apartment. She never tried to move away, not for fear of being caught or of being abandoned. There'd been many times that she'd had sex with him, in many different ways, and the fact that it hadn't ended in love made her furious. So she went back to him. She'd already felt his rage when she finally asked him to leave her.

It was a short-lived affair. Mandy later had another one, and she and her now ex-boyfriend never reconciled. The singer also found herself unable to commit to another abusive relationship, she told the audience at Toronto's York University.

Mandy's point: Abuse in relationships doesn't have to happen in the privacy of your room or under the covers. It can happen
