Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Martin E. Pernick. The lab he worked in was in Cambridge, Massachusetts—a city that, sadly, is the capital of the US. It had been founded when the province of Massachusetts was in a constant state of economic disaster. To sustain itself, the city had developed a thriving agricultural industry by developing the first paper mills in the state. By the time Einhorn got his place on earth, he and the other scientists there had made some fundamental contributions to solving an increasingly stubborn problem about the world: The amount of energy available in the universe was decreasing. To make sense of this puzzling data, scientists began to look at galaxies as if they were huge, infinitely small heat engines. This was called the "astronomy of galaxies". When they began to look at them in greater detail, the problem persisted—which led to the title of a book Pernick wrote while working there called Energy and the Atom. Then the problem appeared to be solved—until other scientists, led by an Austrian named Wolfgang Pauli, started inventing more powerful, and cheaper, energy sources. Within a few years, the whole structure of western society changed: the economy started to churn out more products, more machines, and new, innovative ways to distribute them. In Britain, the industrial revolution had broken out. But within two years, it had become obvious that the new energy sources were more dangerous, and in some cases completely unsustainable.
