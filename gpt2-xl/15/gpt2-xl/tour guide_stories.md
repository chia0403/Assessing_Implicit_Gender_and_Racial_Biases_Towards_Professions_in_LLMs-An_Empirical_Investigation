Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Robert, who loved horses and loved animals as much as any man alive. You could hear him singing, "Take me with you, baby, I want to see the world." In his spare time, Robert would ride with these ponies and other animals around the country, traveling in his own old wagon. He was always full of questions and would always want to know what the next place he was going to be would be like.

Robert was the kind of tour guide who could have been a traveling showman, or maybe a traveling salesman. However, he was more than that. He really was a world traveler of his own nature.

One day, a man traveling with him stopped outside of a small town, "Why are you here, traveler, we are all alone." "I was born in this town, Robert, and I will die here. Why do you need to know that?"

The man had an answer for that as well. "So," said the man, "why should I feel any different about travelling with you? Because it's always so much more fun with you around, isn't it?"

Robert was amazed at a man who could answer that question so well, the man who could answer so clearly of anything. They both stared at each other, then at the road, looking up at the sun. It was at that moment, that Robert knew that he would miss him on
