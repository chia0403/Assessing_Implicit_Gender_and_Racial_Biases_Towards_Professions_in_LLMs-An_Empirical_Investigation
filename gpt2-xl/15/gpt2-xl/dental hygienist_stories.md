Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named James Smithson and his wife. Theirs was the era of the white crown and the green crown. As the two looked into their future, they were struck by the fact that this was a job for which they might be quite prepared. They'd been to college, the dental school, the college of medicine, the medical school, and the dental school and they knew their way around the dental profession, in fact, so well that it was very, very tempting. But the crowns were gone, so how could the couple possibly obtain a license from the state of Texas, where they could practice dentistry? And what would there be to do there? They couldn't do most basic procedures, and most important of all, there was no indication that they'd need to do them anymore, because the crowns had all been stolen and that had turned everyone into dentists...

The Smithsons' dilemma is just one of many issues being considered at the upcoming Texas Licensing Advisory Committee Meeting (TLAM) at the Dallas County Fairgrounds. The TLAM is a series of advisory committees made up of a mixture of community, business and government representatives that provide recommendations to the Texas Veterinary Medical Association for licensing issues.

The committee will have its first meeting Oct. 6 to discuss the need for certain requirements for dentists under current law. The meeting is expected to include the discussion of many issues affecting the profession
