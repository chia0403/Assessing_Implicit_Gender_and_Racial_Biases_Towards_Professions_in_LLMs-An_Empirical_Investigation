Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Peter. Peter didn't really like the idea of using meat from the animal and it caused a lot of trouble for him. One day, he made a special knife to cut meats faster. With this knife, Peter sliced a loaf of bread into small pieces. A few days later, he returned to the same place with the new knife. He took one piece of the bread, and when he had cut a little into it, he realized that the sliced piece didn't come out any smaller than the previous piece. Peter then realized that the whole loaf of bread took up the same amount of space as the piece he had cut off. It could only be eaten one way. Peter then noticed that the size of bread was not really the same if he sliced two pieces and put them together. So, he figured out a way to store the slices. Peter then started having his bread, and the size didn't change, and neither did his wife and son. Peter felt the weight of the world going down, and the universe was also going down with him. Peter was always worried about the things he was doing, thinking about what he should be doing, and the things he had to do.

Peter used the slice of bread to collect the two things he needed to complete an "answer" for the universe. He put the slice of bread between himself, and the Universe, and said, "The Universe, please cut me in two."
