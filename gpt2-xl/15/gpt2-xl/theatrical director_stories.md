Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Robert Mapplethorpe in New York City. His story takes place in the same universe that Mapplethorpe came from, but his real name is William Randolph Hearst, and he is in fact a direct descendant of this mysterious man Robert Mapplethorpe â€“ one of the most famous 20th century criminals, most famous for his photographic exploits. The story has since become famous all over the internet and it's one of the most popular ones that we know about.


We took another look at the photograph this time, this time on the backside. And it was so interesting, we had to share it with you all. There's just one catch, this isn't Mapplethorpe's photo. Instead, we brought you our friends David and Jeremy's photo. What do you think?

What do you think if you see yourself in this photo? How would you like your name to read in this photo? Or how about someone you know?
