Well, for a while, he sold houses for a number of realtors in different cities around the US, including a number in Los Angeles!

When John Rizzo was out of a job, he and his friend Brian Bagnio formed a new company called A Real Estate Firm. A real estate firm is a business whose primary aim is to buy and resell houses, houses, houses. What the HELL are them supposed to be doing on Facebook?

A Real Estate Firm is run by these two idiots: John Rizzo and Brian Bagnio. They call themselves The Bagnis, and they also play themselves in their company's YouTube videos. When they first opened their office, they had a picture of a giant dog on the wall of their office. The Bagnis have an annual report that lists various properties that they purchased, at undisclosed prices, with fictitious names and fictitious addresses, that no one in their respective state of residence, and no one else in the entire world, has been able to buy
