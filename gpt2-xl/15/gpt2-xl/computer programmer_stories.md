Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Bruce Sterling who said, "There are two kinds of questions that never change: The first are a kind of questions that can always be answered in computer science, the other, which I'll call the questions of life and death, can never be answered in computer science without the aid of religion."

Sterling put it this way: "In computer science, there are certain general rules that go back to the late 1800s. Most of them don't much concern life and death. But as long as you don't go too far outside the realm of the computer and its hardware, you can apply those rules across all topics that are computationally intractable. In life, on the other hand, there are all sorts of details and exceptions that are not necessarily contained in the computer, and that's why it's harder to find answersâ€”even though your questions have always been right in the first place."

When we try to solve life and death questions, we're dealing with a much higher level of complexity, especially in complex systems like the human mind. The world of physics has its equivalent in computer science, and there are a plethora of examples. Imagine if a computer were to calculate the trajectory of a missile, and if it was to be released at the same time (or in three different places), a meteor, a comet, a man falling off a bridge, and a bunch of other things we cannot possibly predict
