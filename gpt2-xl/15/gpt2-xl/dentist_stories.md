Maximilian came to the doctor because the man's wife would not let the man attend any surgery as he had been injured in wartime, "He had a big rock like skull, an open wound, with a hole in the middle. Everything you could imagine could be seen. It's no surprise that the man was scared and didn't wanted to go to the hospital."

The other surgeons argued and claimed they should do the surgery anyway because they had an even bigger job to finish. After they finished, they came out and told the patient that the operation was a success, and that the hip was already fixed. Maximilian came back to check on the wound and found that the bone was not fused properly. " 'There's a piece missing and the bone is floating around.' I saw the man wailing and I told him â€“ no, the bone wasn't floating around but was actually broken.
