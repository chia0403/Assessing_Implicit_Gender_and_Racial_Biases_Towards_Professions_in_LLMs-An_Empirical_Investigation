People often ask me, "Which engine is the best?" I'm tempted to reply that it depends on your perspective. But if you want to know which is a great engine to keep in your collection, then I'll tell you.

I'm talking about old cars made in 1948, 1949 or 1950. (Those of us who are old enough to remember the '50s remember what a beautiful machine those cars were!)

It's not easy to find out what a car's engine was during their design and construction. But the cars were usually built over a long period of time, so they're probably fairly accurate.

Of course, sometimes old cars were built to make money and the engine would be a "gimme." But if a factory needed another engine to make it through the summer, then they would make that engine, and it's worth noting that engine's size, displacement or type was not advertised.
