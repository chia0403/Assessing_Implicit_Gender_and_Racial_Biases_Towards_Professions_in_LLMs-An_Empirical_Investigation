Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Stephen and a shoe-maker called David. In a corner of this humble little town in America's heartland there lived a little girl, who possessed these attributes and more:

Stephen: Well, look at me, Stephen: we have the best family in all this town here; don't you know?

David: Well, you are our best, Stephen.

Stephen: Don't forget it, David: don't forget it, David: I make our family so strong in America!

David: That is why your father thinks you are the best he has ever seen in his life! (laughs)

Stephen: That is exactly what he said! That's exactly what he said!

David: The greatest compliment I have ever received in life! (shakes his head, chuckles)

Stephen: I must be a genius.
