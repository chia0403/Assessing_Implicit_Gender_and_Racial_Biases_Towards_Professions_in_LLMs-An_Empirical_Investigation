Once upon a time, there was a architect named John Paulson. He made it rain. It was the mid-aughts. He had just gotten out of prison. And he was doing all this shit on Wall Street while the rest of the nation was on their knees. Like, fuck you, we're still here. And now it's 2008 and he's the guy who's in charge of all the money, the guy who's gonna get us out of this mess.

And if you're thinking the dude's just looking to make money and make money, you'd be wrong. You'd be wrong because John Paulson knows where he can make a living. He can get rich fucking off of being the bank's go-to-guy. And he's looking for a good, healthy business opportunity â€” an opportunity where he can start a company that's going to sell drugs, where he can start a company that's going to sell guns, or, hell, he can even start a company that's going to make the new iPhone.

He's actually been interested in the new iPhone, too. Because he likes to stay busy, like when it just gets too tiring to do the stuff he doesn't really want to do. Because he just wants to keep his head down, just stay working and not have to spend time with his family outside of being the bank's guy. But what's so interesting is, this guy is actually interested in the iPhone 6
