Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Celine. And then she was sold to the Chinese. The first place she went was the Hong Kong Concierge. She was a Chinese, so she was given the traditional Chinese outfit which consisted of pants with a jacket and a vest. It was really the greatest thing. She's been there forever and all she did was take great care of him. Celine loved all the Chinese places, so she always said, "Well, I want to go see the Hong Kong Concierge too." So that's where she worked. But she knew that she'd never have her own place. So she got a job as a concierge in a restaurant in downtown Shanghai. She had to wear the same clothes. She had to go as a concierge. And she was also put in charge of the cleaning and washing machine. At least that was what she was told. She started wearing the same shoes, same skirt. And that's when she met Charlie the other day on the street. Charlie was her coworker. He was also Chinese, but he'd brought his own Western dress. He got that job in a hotel just like Celine. They were both living in the same building and it was really funny. Even after they separated, neither of them would ever change. They would both wear the same shoes, same skirt, same bag. And they would never go out of their way to meet or even talk
