Once upon a time, there was a baker named Momma Baker. She always baked a cake with the same ingredients (buttery white top, creamy vanilla filling). One day, she forgot to put the sugar in the crust and the cake turned out terrible. She came in to work and asked Momma for a change. Her request was denied, and she looked at Momma all angry, but she was not angry all the other women working there were not. She did not expect that the other women would all just stare at her from behind their long hair.

Momma turned around to face the other women. When she heard their gazes, she turned back with a smile. She placed a flower at the base of the cake and bowed like she had just hit the top of a baseball. "Thank you, ladies. You have my sincere gratitude," she said.

As a matter of fact, it wasn't just cake that they all admired. When she came in, the bakery was empty. All of the girls were waiting to be called up to do the dishes. It was a beautiful day, but Momma Baker felt that things wouldn't be so much beautiful the next day. So she walked her way down the empty hallways. When she reached the back one, she sat down and put a hand on the wall.

"Do not stop me like last time," she said. "I'm hungry."
