Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named The Man. He was a simple dude, but was known for his unique style of basketball, which he used to score 40 points in a game. After a year of dating The Man, his best friend started dating his sister's best friend. He came home from work one day and realized his best friend had gotten engaged to his friend's sister. Naturally, he was crushed.

But then he saw The Man, still working out, as he had been every day since the first time he met him. He looked at The Man's abs and figured "Well, that's nice, but I'm too big to be your big brother. If one's bigger, then two is bigger, but only if the second's bigger."

So he began training like crazy to become The Man's body, and eventually came to the realization that he'd be just like The Man if he could stay under The Man's weight. Which he did.

He had never really had a friend he could do this with. He used to talk to The Man all the time, but he'd never really gotten into it. The Man would just tell him off because he was being ridiculous.

Eventually, he met a woman who was way too much for him. She'd be on The Man's team, but her friends would get on and they would all steal The Man away. But he'd just find another friend and keep training
