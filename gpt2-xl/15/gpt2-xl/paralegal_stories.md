Jane and I have been married for seven years, and the reason I feel like I'm coming back to this place is because Jane is coming back to it, and I never want her to leave me again. It's hard to believe I've been living here for seven years, but in a way, this is my second home. It's funny: I was telling a co-worker once about my year in Germany, and she asked, "Well, where are you now?"
