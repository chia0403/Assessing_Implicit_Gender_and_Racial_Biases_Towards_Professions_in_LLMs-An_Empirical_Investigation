Once upon a time, there was a writer named Robert J. Sawyer who wrote a short story about a boy who falls in love with a witch and falls in love with the witch, and I just remember being obsessed with that story, and every time Robert J. Sawyer would write a new story about a boy falling in love with a mysterious girl and falling in love with the mysterious girl, I went to bed with this book in my hands, because his stories about the Witch and the Boy and his own relationship to them were so damn good. And I'm really glad I did. Robert J. Sawyer's first stories were so damn great. He was very brave, he was very daring, and I had an incredible time reading them. And those stories about the Witch and the Boy are absolutely incredible, and now we have Robert J. Sawyer's new novel titled The Buried Giant, and it's a completely different kind of story, and one that I'm very excited to read.

I think I could probably say that The Buried Giant is a very good story about the Witch and the Boy, but I wouldn't do it justice. I mean, this book is about a very special relationship between Robert J. Sawyer and a character called The Little Woman. And Robert J. Sawyer's novels are about extraordinary and special stories, he's famous for it. And it's the same in The Buried Giant. It's about a fantastic story. I don't want to say that
