Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Tootie Taylor. Tootie taught me everything that I know. Her husband, Mr. Taylor, taught me everything that I know. Mr. Taylor taught us everything. But Tootie taught me three things that we can teach everyone else: One, a lot of people can cut their hair like my mother taught her, but it takes work. Two, you can't keep something forever, you should enjoy it before giving it away. And three: Never leave your mother with any of your money.

There is nothing harder to learn than never to leave anyone with your money.

But this doesn't really matter when your mother passed from cancer. Tootie died on June 23, 1995. Sixteen and a wife, she was the love of my life who never allowed me to grow up. I miss her and how she taught me my dreams. But when I looked up, I saw a smile on her face.

"You're here," a few of our relatives said a little louder, the last words her mother whispered to me, "and you're gonna be everything she never could be."

It's funny. She always said life was easy. And then she was gone.

The people who told Tootie they were coming with the money were the first people to really break my father's heart.

He used to laugh and talk about everything Tootie taught
