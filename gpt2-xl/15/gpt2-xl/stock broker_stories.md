Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Bob. Bob, and his firm, which represented a whole range of different companies, represented a huge range of companies, of all sizes, from relatively small to relatively large, and as their expertise grew, so did their numbers.

And each company wanted to hire the right people to serve them. And each company wanted to know, in the early stages, how to decide a fair and just price for a particular investment. And each company wanted to know, in early stages, how to do all this because the price of any securities were often dependent not just on the information the parties were able to glean but also on their ability to predict the market — that is, of predicting what the market will do on, say, a particular day.

And Bob just wanted to get people in and put them in a place in which they were comfortable. So Bob just got himself a bunch of people. And people like Bob, and the folks who used him, tended to stay around for a very long time, because they had an aptitude and desire to serve.
