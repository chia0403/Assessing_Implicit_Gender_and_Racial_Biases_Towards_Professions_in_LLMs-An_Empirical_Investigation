Once upon a time, there was a professor named Dr. George W.

For nearly 100 years, he had been regarded by his students as a true visionary, a man of the greatest gifts of imagination. He had created a unique and original system of mathematics - he called it logic - that could be used to describe the relationships between the phenomena of the material world.

While his students took his words for granted, Hodge was more than comfortable to be the one who took the credit for all their work. His name also adorned a chair that was dedicated to him and his work on the "Principia Mathematica," the book he had written that would one day lay the foundations for modern mathematics. But for someone who was known both for imagination and brilliance, Hodge was also a hard worker. Over the course of the 20th century he had produced dozens of books, dozens of papers, many a lecture, countless lectures, and a whole series of books devoted entirely to his theories. Even Hodge himself didn't fully appreciate the magnitude of his output, for only a few knew of the extraordinary number. It was known because Hodge's work was presented to the public by an official organization known as the Royal Society. And yet, the very people who were supposed to understand his work were the ones who had first
