Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Mikey. One day, Mikey came home from work and his wife told him that he had a new baby. Mikey got a new truck, but he left his heavy equipment behind. At first, Mikey was a little angry, because he figured he could easily move his truck. Then he realized how stupid he was. Every day, a lot of heavy materials move through our neighborhood. A heavy oil rig once crashed through our neighborhood, blocking our neighborhood streets. A lot of heavy materials go through here at our job, so we really don't want to let it block the streets. So Mikey figured "I'll just move it inside the fence," so he put on the back of his truck a cardboard box. And he moved his equipment right into the neighborhood. When the truck reached the fence, it didn't work, so he put it back on the truck and put it right back in the neighborhood. And then people started parking on his truck, and they started using it to block the road. And Mikey said "Oh, I know. I'll just put it right back in the fence."

You've probably had to work with people who were really upset to know you wouldn't let them use your equipment. These people are all angry, angry people. They have all been screwed by someone or something. And at the end of the day, we end up leaving the situation they were in because
