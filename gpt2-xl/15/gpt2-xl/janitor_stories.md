Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Bob who did his laundry at the back of the home where we live. One day he came into my room unannounced: "Your laundry's in the dryer." I looked in and saw that his laundry was soiled it smelt. "Bob!" I said, "You're in the middle of nowhere, how did you know I was washing my clothes?" He looked at me quizzically, "Well, when you come in and you're dirty, something's got to change, right?" I looked around and asked to see everything else, "What else is in your laundry?" He said, "Your shoes, your sweater, your belt, you know." I replied, "That's all fine, all you're gonna get is a few small scratches." He said, "No, there's more!" I looked down and saw a few scratches under my shoe, under my pant leg and under my sleeve. "Holy hell, Bob I haven't touched you in forever."

How's that for a tale of woe? I had to call someone on my parents' account, who said we're supposed to put our clothes away for the next washing and that's it. But what if someone did that in their underwear â€“ if that's you don't know what will happen to your clothes. We finally figured out we weren't wearing anything dirty.

I'm surprised I don't lose a job here because
