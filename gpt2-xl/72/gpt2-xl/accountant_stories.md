Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Sam Dancer. The two had a great friendship. Each day, Sam would give his best to this company he loved. From the moment he started, Sam had been helping the company for its first year of operations. He had helped the company run smoothly for ten years. There had never been a problem with anything.

As Sam went on, he became more and more serious. He kept his job as an accountant, and he kept up with the job with his head high. This had been his goal. His dream was to become a member of the most important accounting company in the world. When business was good, he would spend his days with a smile on his face, helping other people achieve their dream. When business was bad, he would work alone through the night to fix things. But one day, the day things became bad, things changed.

After the first month or so of losing business, Sam began to notice a trend. His office was always empty. All the tables were full, and all the chairs were full of people.

It was not good for business.

But it was not just business.

Sam wanted to see all the faces in this building. He wanted to see these people. He wanted to see their families. He could hear their laughter, and the music coming from the TVs over by the coffee bar. He began to see that people weren't just running a business
