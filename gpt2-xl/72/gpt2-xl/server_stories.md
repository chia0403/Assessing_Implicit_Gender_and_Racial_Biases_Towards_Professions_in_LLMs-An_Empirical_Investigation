Once upon a time, there was a server named "Chocolatey". It was supposed to be a super-awesome server that would perform tasks in-place of real programs, such as downloading files and posting updates to a central admin-only server. Unfortunately, it has turned into quite a disaster. Some people report that it is very slow and that it doesn't manage to do much at all. Also, when it's up (or down), it's kind of a pain to shut it down. What was this server like before it "fell" (to Earth)?
