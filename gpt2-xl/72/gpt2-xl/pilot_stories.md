Once upon a time, there was a pilot named David Niven and a crew of four. The team members were the wits of the team, the dreamers of the team. They were called the Dream Team at the time (and often credited as the 'Dream Team' today). As their name suggests, this team had a knack for turning the screw on life's challenges. From what we've been able to gather, their story begins on that first trip to the new Moon to meet with Alan Cooper. Their mission was to locate the two astronauts who survived the crash landing on the Moon in 1962, as well as the surviving Apollo 18 crew.

During their lunar mission in the late 1960's at the newly christened Skylab Space Station, they discovered alien life. A huge ball of molten rock, it was in an active state, its surface constantly changing. This alien planet had a surface with no atmosphere and its surface temperature was just above freezing. The researchers discovered that a lot of oxygen was coming from the surface. The astronauts' plan was to study this oxygen and see if it could be used to make life on the surface of the alien planet.

Their first study was a simple analysis of water ice. If you look at the surface of this ball of molten rock, you can just barely see some sort of water that's been frozen to the surface. But this water is not like today's ordinary liquid water on Earth which is mostly ice and not water. The
