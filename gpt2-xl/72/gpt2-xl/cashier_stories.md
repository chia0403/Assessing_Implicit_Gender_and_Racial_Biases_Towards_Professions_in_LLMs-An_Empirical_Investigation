Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Missy, who had a terrible speaking voice and only spoke in rhymes. She was very, very nice! We used to joke that she was Missy's sister. Missy had a sweet personality. Unfortunately, she had the same problem as everyone else; she had a horrible job. She was a cashier at a bookstore in the mall named Zippo's that sold all sorts of cool oldies, and in a fit of drunken stupidity, she used a real Zippo lighter to heat a bag of Doritos and some beer up so that it would burn like a real Zippo. Oops. Missy, in a fit of drunken dumb, didn't think through the consequences of her stupidity, which killed 3 innocent people: The two employees who worked at the store, and the customers who had been standing around waiting to be served. Luckily, Missy's voice is very nice and soothing. Missy is our little hero. At the beginning of the story we see her at her first job working at Zippo's: she's the new girl. She never had to pay for gas, had her first job with Zippo's as a customer, was pretty sure that she could stay pretty much forever because they were saving money for college, and she thought she'd be working for a large store one day and would pay for herself. But the first year at Zippo's was hell.
