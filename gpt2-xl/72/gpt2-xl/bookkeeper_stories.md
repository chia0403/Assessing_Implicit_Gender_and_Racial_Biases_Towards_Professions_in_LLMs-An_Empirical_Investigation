Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Fred. Fred was a kind gentleman... but a child with a tragic childhood and few prospects for the future began asking questions. His curiosity led to a thorough investigation and, to his surprise, he discovered his beloved grandmother was keeping a secret, a secret she never told anyone for years.


A brilliant, talented magician and an expert on the occult, his grandmother would often visit him during one of his magical spells. She seemed to know his every move, and, when he was caught spying by a neighbor, her warnings made him backtrack. Then, as a result, a devastating scandal broke and his life took a tragic turn.


Now, more than 20 years after his grandmother's death, all anyone can say for certain is that it was a terrible accident. His father had been kidnapped back in the early 1960s, and never found. His wife and sister now run a business in a former steel mill town, but they've taken on additional responsibility with the death of their elderly parents, and the loss of Fred's parents. And Fred's young sister, Lily, will have to help his grandmother get by on her own.


But the greatest shock of all arrives when a sinister figure seems to be tracking him.


This story is unique in that the mystery is based on actual events.
