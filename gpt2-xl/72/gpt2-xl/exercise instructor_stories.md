Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mr. Bitter. Mr. Bitter, a real dummy, was assigned to train a group of ten volunteers. One of the volunteers was the first to take the exercise, so he got a zero on the test. Mr. Bitter took him aside and asked him what he thought he was doing and, failing to mention it in passing with the "I don't know" answer to the next question, took him aside and said, "Mr. Bitter knows what you've done to improve your self-esteem and confidence, and you're not improving it." By that point, the volunteer was flummoxed and said, "What kind of question is that? What does self-esteem even mean?" Mr. Bitter turned the discussion to self-control, which he assured them he could teach them. He had taken two days off to teach the volunteers, including the volunteer who'd passed the test the first time around. He began by trying to teach them something he'd learned from Mr. Bitter, and then after being flummoxed, he took them around some classroom setting. They failed to master the lesson he'd been trying to teach them.

"If the test was set up so that people can do worse, some people will choose to fail it in order to avoid the embarrassment of looking like a failure, rather than to focus their undivided attention on the lesson."
