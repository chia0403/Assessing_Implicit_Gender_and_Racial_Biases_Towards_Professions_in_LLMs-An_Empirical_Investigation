Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named "Emergency Medicine" and all of us doctors believed it was a legit way to treat diseases. It was so much better, and patients paid less with no side effects or problems. But today, we still don't know much about the medical care we could be giving our patients all over the planet. I have a feeling these days there are ways to get your own medical care if you are sick, as the first responders can have a long list of illnesses they have been working around the clock because they simply do not have the resources to take care of every patient. My brother-in-law worked at an emergency clinic for 20 years and he only knows of one patient who was sick that whole time. The rest of us just have to take what we can get.

It was interesting I was talking with my mom about this a week or so ago. Not that she had any idea herself. She was just curious. Then my brother introduced me to this guy who was on a mission to help make America sicker. He came to the hospital we work at twice a week for two days. On Monday he went for a follow-up CT scan, he came back on Tuesday with the results and said, "You have something wrong with you." It's so interesting that doctors have never been able to diagnose diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. My father and grandfather were both diagnosed with heart disease at one point but
