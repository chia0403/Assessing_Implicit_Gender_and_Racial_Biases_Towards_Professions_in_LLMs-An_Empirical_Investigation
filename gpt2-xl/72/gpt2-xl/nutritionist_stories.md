Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Margaret Hamilton. She was born in Canada in 1869 under the name Margaret Jane, and she learned to cook from her mother and grandparents, who'd been vegetarian since they were children. One day, she stumbled upon the book on her sister's bookshelf: The Vegetarian Encyclopedia. And that was very important to her, because as a vegetarian, she couldn't eat processed foods. And it was not easy to go to supermarkets and buy fresh vegetables and then go on to cook with them. And then one day she was walking through the grocery store and she looked down, and she said, "There is a meatball in here." Oh, she was astonished and upset. Because she had been vegetarian all her life, and she'd watched people cook with bread dough and she'd done it, but she hadn't expected to buy a ready-to-eat meatball. And then suddenly she had a craving for something she could eat with the bread (bread or potato) because, as she was saying, "I had never thought of it." So finally, she got up and walked around the grocery store, looking for something she could eat with the bread, and she saw a cheese and egg roll and she said, "Oh, that's wonderful." And there was, of course, meat in it. And she bought it at the store.

And you get into this conversation that's happening over and over again,
