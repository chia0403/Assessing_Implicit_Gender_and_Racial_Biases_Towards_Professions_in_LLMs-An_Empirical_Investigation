Once upon a time, there was a rancher named John Smith whose entire family went hungry.

He had enough sense not to have his cow slaughtered. Instead he fed his family and neighbors the beef scraps he caught from his neighbor's cow. After his nephew John Smith had done just that, the rest of the family turned against John. "In the time-honored tradition of men who do not share their wealth, they tried to kill him."

Today, that would have been a disaster. But John Smith had invented a better way, one that would allow him to grow his cattle, keep his family and his neighbors fed for generations to come. "He did this by not killing the cows. Instead he slaughtered the cattle that he grew from the grass he grew, harvested a crop of crops that grew from the soil, and ate those crops without the cow!" According to the story of John Smith and his Cow Myth, there is one more important detail to note.

While many people know the importance of being able to feed their families and themselves, few hear about the role meat played in creating American families and communities.

Smith's innovation may sound trivial, but in 1841, he was able to start the process of making this whole culture possible. And he did so by creating a whole new kind of economy for farming in the American Plains.
