Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Michael who taught kids how to climb the Eiffel Tower. One day while driving up to the tower, he met a friendly old lady who had a very old cat named "Le-Iroi" on her shoulder. Le-Iroi was very, very old for a catspaw cat, having been born when the tower was a little less than twenty years old. It was clear to the tour guide something extraordinary was about to happen for Le-Iroi. One day, he had a very bad cold and his head was ached. So one day a little later on, he was carrying Le-Iroi around the Eiffel Tower, singing and dancing to the music of the tower. When Le-Iroi came down from the tower with both feet on the ground, the crowd of tourists stopped singing and cheered. The lady was so excited about seeing Le-Iroi finally home and happy, she hugged and kissed him. At that moment Le-Iroi had a total melt down. He ran right to the lady's side and started crying while saying, "The only reason I'm wearing this tail is because my cat is in danger. I will die if I don't wear it." The lady was so touched and honored to have been with that special guy for that brief moment.
