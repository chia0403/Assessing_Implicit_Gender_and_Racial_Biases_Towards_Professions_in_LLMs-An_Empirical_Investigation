This scenario is just one of innumerable possible permutations because everyone has a unique set of characteristics and quirks. The best way to discover the person you are connected to is to find people with similar characteristics, then go looking for yourself. Here at Crave, we've found several common characteristics and quirks that you can use to get to know your own unique blend of a person.

For example, if the theme of a song is love (or perhaps a longing or dreamful note), a lovey dovey singer like Elvis Presley (s) might be ideal for that particular story.

Once you understand your own music style and what makes you tick, you will be able to better understand another's, and vice versa
