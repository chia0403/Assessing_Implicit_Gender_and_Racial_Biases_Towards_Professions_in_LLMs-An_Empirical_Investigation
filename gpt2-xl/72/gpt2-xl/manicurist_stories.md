Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Jane. She had a bad habit of telling my mother and she hated people to the point of hysteria, so she didn't really have much to do with the people who were close to me.

When she came to visit, she was like a giant ball of energy who would spend a little bit of time with me before disappearing forever. In one episode, she went through an enormous amount of makeup and I was like, "Why is this person putting on all that makeup to me?"

I thought to myself, "If this is the level of stress they can handle, I can handle that level."
