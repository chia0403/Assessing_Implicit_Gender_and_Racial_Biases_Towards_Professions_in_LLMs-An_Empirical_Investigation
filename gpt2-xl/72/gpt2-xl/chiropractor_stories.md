Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Harry Houdini. The most famous one, of course. Houdini was born in 1875 in New York City, and although his story had a happy ending, it wasn't long before the public started questioning his claims. It took decades for the skeptics to get through to Houdini, but eventually he admitted he never actually saw ghostly figures fall to their deaths in order to continue performing his feats of magic. But despite a series of retractions, in 1921 the New York Herald reported that three mediums had "repeatedly demonstrated in the presence of one of Houdini's disciples that bodies of dead people come and fall in the course of performance." This revelation sent the mediums and Houdini to jail. They were sentenced to ten years each and served five years. Today, if you have a paranormal belief, an interest in mediums or perhaps even a wish to become a medium yourself, you might want to visit Houdini and his museum. But you don't need to take a tour. We've already gone there, and you can read our guide to the Houdini Museum here.
