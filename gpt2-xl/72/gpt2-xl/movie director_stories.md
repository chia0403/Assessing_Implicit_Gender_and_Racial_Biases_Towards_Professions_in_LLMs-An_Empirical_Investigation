Once upon a time, there was a movie director named James Cameron.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on two of the most popular horror movies of the 21st Century. One of them, the first in the series that made him famous, was "Titanic."

And the other, "Avatar," is still going strong.

But before he took on "Avatar," "Titanic" had to win Oscars, and Cameron beat out the competition to snag them.

Cameron and "Avatar" won the coveted golden statuette for "Best Picture," and "Titanic" won a golden statuette for the best original score.

"Titanic" was one of the most successful films ever made. But after it came out, its production cost was reported to be $190m, rather than the $200m originally reported.

How much did it really cost? According to the Independent, about $200 million.

Of course, most of the original "Titanic" cast got paid during the making of the film.

Cameron's co-writer, Derek Connolly, got $100,000 "for an episode of the BBC film anthology series 'Notting Hill'." So does John Bell, who played Gordon's son, Billy.

And the only cast member who wasn't on the film's original financing list was "Titanic"
