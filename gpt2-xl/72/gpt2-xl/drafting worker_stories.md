Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named William, who, when he was in his prime, could easily put together a team that could beat teams such as Liquid and Natus Vincere if he was good enough.

If one plays a few games, he might be in a much higher bracket of teams that could contend for a top spot within the top four.
