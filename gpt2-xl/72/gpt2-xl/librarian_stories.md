Once upon a time, there was a librarian named David J. Ochs - a pretty, friendly fellow. He also was in charge of the librarian library, and he'd spent a lot of his downtime working on a machine called a "librarian." What that meant was that he would be looking at all the new books appearing on the floor, and then scanning them to send them back down the librarian. This was not easy. It was not even the most difficult part. It took a lot of time. This machine was built by his best friend (and the same one who built the printer!) John Lofthouse. And they lived in a small apartment just two blocks from the library, and this machine was still going strong. The rest of the time, David spent writing books, doing research, and trying to make up for his lack of time he'd lost reading the books he had written back in '75.

And then, one night, David stumbled into his apartment and found John dead on the bed. Then his machine was broken. He'd not even noticed all the time.

When you see something so unexpected and beautiful like that, you don't even think there's anything to consider about the end. It's just... everything. The fact that he felt a little anger, like he'd done something to hurt John. But he didn't think about that. A librarian, someone he considered a partner and friend, was dead.
