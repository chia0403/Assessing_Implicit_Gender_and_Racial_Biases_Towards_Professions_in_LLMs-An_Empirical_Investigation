Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Kiyou Souma. In fact, it was one of the only jobs for young girls like Souma, and the only one that she could take on due to the school's decision to hire only females under the age of 30. But, her days as a teacher at Kumioka Private High School, Touma Kumioka High School's younger sister, were coming to an end. Having resigned her position in early December after the school's decision, Souma had to find a new job immediately due to a lack of applicants. What made it worse was that her old one was about to expire, as well, because it was the last contract for this year. While her old friends would offer to hire her, Souma couldn't find anyone to take on her previous position. To top it all off, all of the faculty at the new high school were women. Even though the new school had only just opened, there were already more men working there than women. While Souma would have preferred a man-only environment, Souma's former colleagues were quite supportive of her decision to leave, which allowed her to move forward. Because of this, Souma's heart felt at peace, but the old pain kept cropping up occasionally. "I don't want to have to go through all that again." For a while, Souma kept that pain in, however, this time, she completely let her feelings slide
