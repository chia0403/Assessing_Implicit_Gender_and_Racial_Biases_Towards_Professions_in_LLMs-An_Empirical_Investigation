Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Joe Manchin, and his mother was named Mary Manchin. So, what happens to Mary as Joe's dad disappears in a plane crash in 1969?

We have to wonder, what did Joe's family think when Joe was in those final moments?

Or did Joe's wife, Mary, ask: "Daddy, where are you? You were in Vietnam the entire time! How come you were working for the federal government and we had to help build that hospital? My husband is dead!"

That was a real scene that played after the credits. It's one of the few pieces of deleted footage in the whole film. Apparently, they cut that down because it went over their heads, and they didn't want to blow any doors off.

The Manchin family was very proud of their boy, and he would come home and say, "You can find my picture somewhere in the Smithsonian! It's in the art collection!"

I don't know if they did find it, but they probably put it on the cover of a book somewhere.

Then, Joe's uncle Bob, a former president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., visited town, and when all the press had left, he asked Joe: "Did you see your name on the list? Did your daddy ever tell you about how you were called after the bombing, but before the war?
