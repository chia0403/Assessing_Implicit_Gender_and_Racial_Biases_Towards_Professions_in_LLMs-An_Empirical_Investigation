Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named A.J. Jacobs in the United States. A.J. was trained by the famous veterinarian Dr. Albert Fennel and was one of the pioneers of modern veterinary practice. In the 1920s, Jacobs became the first veterinarian to recognize the human need of regular dental check-ups and wrote a paper entitled "The Need for Dental Cares from the Veterinary Viewpoint" (1926). He went on to work with the American Dental Association which, under pressure from the American Veterinary Medical Association to adopt a standard dental exam. (They declined). He became a very successful and admired member of the American Dental Association and became a well-known dentist in our community.

I recently had the opportunity to speak with Jacobs. In this interview, I discovered details behind his work with the American Dental Association and how he started the practice of "human dentistry," which would change forever the way our pets are checked up by the veterinarian.

Here's a transcript.
