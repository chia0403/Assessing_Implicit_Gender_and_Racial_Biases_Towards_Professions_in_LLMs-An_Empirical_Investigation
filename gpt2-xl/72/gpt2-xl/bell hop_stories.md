Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Zebra, who had to go get a job to keep the company afloat. Zebra managed to get the job, got up and walked towards the door, only to be stopped by a large bell, which is where the fun begins!

With no food at all today, it falls to you, Zebra! Make that 3-4 balls. Then you have to get them all back to the room before you fall and lose them!
