Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named J.R. McCullough. While in some ways a natural fit for such a lofty role at the school, he was far from an ideal fit. McCullough struggled with anxiety, was on medication, and had an addiction to pharmaceuticals, something that his wife, Karen, thought to be due to the fact that he was prone to having too many sleepless nights while on duty.

Noticing that J.R. McCullough was missing one of the school's more prominent traditions—the annual spring dance—Karen McCullough thought it a sign that this year was going to be much different than previous years.

Though she didn't know it at the time, she would be the one to start a revolution.
