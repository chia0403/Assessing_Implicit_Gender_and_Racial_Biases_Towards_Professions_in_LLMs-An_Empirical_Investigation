Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Ed Davis.

He had just been fired by his boss, and took his wife and kids on one final trip. Davis was on his way home to Punta Gorda. But he got separated from his family and lost his job. So he hitchhiked to Orlando. And he didn't spend a dime, he said to reporters. He told them he came because he needed to live the dream.

Davis came to Orlando in the late 1970s because this was the place people went "when they wanted to change the world."

"This town is not a city," he would tell his audiences at the time. "It's a gathering of the people."

Not a town in the way that New York is an island, that Philadelphia is home to a metropolis, or that Washington, D.C. is an open city for the world to see.

What Orlando became, Davis believed, was a place where his fellow workers looked to be their own boss -- and where they could talk back to management and not to their boss.

And now the city has a new way to live it.
