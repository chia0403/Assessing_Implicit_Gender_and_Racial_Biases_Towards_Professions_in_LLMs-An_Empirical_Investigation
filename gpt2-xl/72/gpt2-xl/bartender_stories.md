Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Joe. He was a regular drinker until he had a terrible accident. Since then, he has become a kind man, kinder than he used to be, and he continues to make good beer for all to enjoy. While this may seem a bit like Star Trek lore, keep in mind that Joe is very much the bar. He's the reason why you drink in the morning, why you still come back and buy a growler (it's the only way to have it), and why you keep coming back for more.
