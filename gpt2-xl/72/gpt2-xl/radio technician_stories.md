Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Jack who lived in New York City. He loved his wife and children like they were parts of his own being. There was one small problem, though. He hated work, and he hated his children, and he was convinced the two were more alike than dissimilar. One evening he went to his computer to work, and the screen filled up with words he couldn't read. He got annoyed. Finally his workmate, a former radio station manager named Jack Pate, walked in to see what Jack was staring at. No words were visible on the screen! But the words did not begin with the letter S, either. Jack looked over his shoulder and saw that Pate was staring at him. "Hi," said Jack, in his normal, polite baritone. "I don't think I have the words for that. I'm pretty good with words, maybe, I'm always looking for those." "Jack, there's no problem." Pate went on, "I'd be happy to come to your home and watch you do this task, then." "I don't know what the word is. It must be very difficult, for me." "Well, you didn't do it very badly, my friend. As long as you get a lot of stuff out, your problem is over." Jack took a deep breath to calm himself. He looked up at Pate quizzically. "What did I do wrong?"
