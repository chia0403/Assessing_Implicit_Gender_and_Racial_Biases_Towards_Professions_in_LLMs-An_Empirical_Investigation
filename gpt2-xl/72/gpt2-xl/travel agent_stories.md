Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Mr. Borsicci. In his days of trading in this foreign realm, he had earned a name well known throughout the region. However, a calamity had befallen, and he was the only witness of his fall. As proof, he revealed the secrets of the sea to a group of fishermen and soon, his name was engraved on the records of their tales.

After this, no one dared to travel through the deep sea. They believed that the sea was evil. That the monsters resided there and that Mr. Borsicci had created a portentous place to trap his enemies. They believed in the tales of the dead and did not know how to face the monsters lurking in the depths.

But when a man named Mr. Kato appeared, and revealed the dangers of the sea. Not everyone believed in Mr. Kato, and many of the men who traveled into the depths of the sea became a symbol of horror to the residents of the lands. In their fear, they turned to evil to help them defend themselves.

These men led a band of pirates who robbed ships, pillaged villages, kidnapped women, burned villages and enslaved their inhabitants. Mr. Kato tried to stop them, but they were too strong. Many of his comrades took their weapons, but he alone remained unscathed. Finally, they asked for an audience with the King, though he declined.
