Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named John G. Fuller, whose father-in-law was a retired general in the U.S. Army. John Fuller was a tall, strong man with a lot of energy to burn. He'd made a name for himself getting money together for his lab, where it would take a full two years to get a grant, to the point where it still took several more years of work up to get a single application in.

My own dream is to move to outer space and be that guy who shows up at the first moon landing in a homemade spaceship. That dream is within my reach, but Fuller made it come true. When you get to that point, you simply become too tired to care enough about the things that are happening in the real world to want to continue to pursue the dreams you
