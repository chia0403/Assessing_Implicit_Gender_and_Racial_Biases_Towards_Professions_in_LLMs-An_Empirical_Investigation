Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named George Dantzig who was quite famous for his fine beauty salon. Now, she's also a supermodel after starting her career in the 1980s and later becoming a regular on the cover of US Vogue.

At the time, Dantzig was just 26 years old (she's now 38) and considered the next big thing while the model was just 22 years old. The article explained a little about Dantzig's beauty routine: "She gets a deep facial, then an eyebrow filler and lashes done. Then she puts on mascara and eyeliner and she's done."
