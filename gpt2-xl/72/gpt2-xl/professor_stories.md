Once upon a time, there was a professor named Jack who was known for having all kinds of terrible, horrible habits—tendencies he acquired at an early age that I can only assume were genetic. For instance, he was the kind of guy (not an insult, just a fact) who would, on the rare occasion, wear black socks because he never wanted to see anything black on his feet.

The worst thing Jack did to his feet was use a nail file to file them to an unpleasantly sharp point. Once he did this, no matter how many times he tried to get rid of the file—as the shoes would get worse before they got better—his feet just kept going, so he just kept filing them more and more. And, when he got the perfect filing point, his shoes would be so hideous to look at, he'd throw them out and go out and use another pair of heels.

Eventually, Jack's feet stopped getting any worse. He no longer wore black socks (at first, he liked brown, but he ended up wearing black after the socks started hurting him more), he had perfect filing point all the time, and he had finally realized he couldn't get rid of his filing nail file.

It's hard to describe how terrible Jack's shoes were because they weren't really shoes at all, but were just sort of hobble boots that had gotten all nasty and black over several months.
