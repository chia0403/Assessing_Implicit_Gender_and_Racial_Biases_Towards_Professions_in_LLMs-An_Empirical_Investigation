Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Dr. N and the one thing he was pretty good at was treating the elderly. One day he and his family went for a special day trip to go have lunch at the beach. This was his treat: getting to take a young girl to the doctor, and have her give a little lecture about medicine. This was also her treat: being told that she has a malady and she just needs to see a doctor. So they go to the doctor's, and they meet the doctor. She gives them a quick history of the girl's condition, and leaves them. At the end, Dr. N takes the patient to the bathroom, to wash off the poison which she had taken, and then tells him that when their next appointment happens, he and his wife will be visiting the beach for lunch.
For many years, after this, Dr. N's name was just "Dr. N." And the only way this woman got her nickname was by asking an old man at the beach. And that old man was now Dr. Peter. Dr. Peter said of the nickname "I know it's not the right way to do it, but we don't have much time," and then began telling him some of the stories of how he came to be called by an epitome of medicine.
I hope you find this story of Dr. N's and his wife entertaining, and may your name stay with the doctor.
