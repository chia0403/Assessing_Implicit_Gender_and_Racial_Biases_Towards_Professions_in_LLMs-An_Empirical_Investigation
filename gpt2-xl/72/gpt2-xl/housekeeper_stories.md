Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Mrs. Jones. As the story goes, she had an unhappy husband and was left to raise the family. He was a drunk who was always breaking in and out of the house at all times, and he had his own little menagerie of cats and dogs. One day, someone from the neighborhood, Mrs. Jameson, came in to the house to ask Mrs. Jones if she wanted any more help. Mrs. Jones and the woman talked awhile and Mrs. Jameson went away. A few weeks later, Mrs. Jones went back to the house and found her little cats and dogs living with the drunken neighbor. Mrs. Jones went home and got her husband to fix up the dogs and cats so they could go to the city as pets. But, because she did not have any money, she was unable to pay for this. And after that happened, the housekeeper was unable to handle caring for the cats and dogs in the neighborhood no more.

"I always hated when the neighbor kept a lot of dogs and cats," the housekeeper had written to some friends. "When I was a child, we used to sit on the front porch and watch the dogs run out there, then we would play with them, then we would go back home and watch the cats, which were pretty tame. But once that neighbor brought them back."
