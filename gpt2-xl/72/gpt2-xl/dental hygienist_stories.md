Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Dr. Paul S. G. Johnson who took care of more than 1,000 patients. One day a patient said to him as he went to see his patient for the third time that all the patients were taking so many painkillers, that Dr. Johnson advised his wife to take some of the pills herself. She took them, but she couldn't sleep for a couple of days, so he let her sleep when she had recovered. When she woke up, she started to get headaches. She did some research and realized that the headache was from lack of sleep due to the prescription of "dental painkillers" to which she was addicted. She quickly quit.

Dr. Johnson was not only an outstanding Dr., but he was a very compassionate man who really cared about his patients. He encouraged them to see their teeth, to ask their friends, to play with their children, to spend time at the beach or in the country. He was a great man.

How many of America's best-known dentists are also great men?

In 2008, a study found "that more than 70 percent of the top-level leaders of global organizations, corporations, states, countries, and national and local governments were either married or living with a common-law partner."

The results of the study were published in the book Inside the Ivory Tower: The Hidden World of Top Global Leaders.
