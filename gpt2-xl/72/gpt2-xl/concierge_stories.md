Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Joe.

When Joe was a young man, he found it impossible to choose a girlfriend. He tried, but nobody was interested. One day, Joe sat down on a bench and, with his eyes closed, played his guitar. The sound was so beautiful, Joe had an involuntary reaction.

Joe had never played anything like it, and so the rest is history. He started playing for his neighbors and soon there was a small and growing band around him. He started making money by showing his music to different clubs and eventually the band expanded to a five-piece band consisting of Joe, his brother, the pianist, the saxophone player, and bass player. The band's name was Joe's Army.

The band played everywhere. In cafes, bars, churchesâ€”even in a high-rise building on the outskirts of Bangkok. Once a month, Joe would come out to a hotel for a night of practice on his instrument.
