Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Margaret Sanger.

Sanger went to work as a medical assistant at Planned Parenthood in 1912.

Her work there was dedicated to providing women and girls with options for contraception, safe sexual behavior, STD and abortion services.

During her 20 years, Sanger, along with other feminist leaders including Alice Paul and Harriet Tubman, were working to create a more humane, just society.

In the beginning, Sanger had no way of knowing of the horrific methods that would later be utilized to commit the most horrendous acts in history toward the black community.

During the late 1930s, Margaret Sanger founded the Birth Control Review in 1940, which would become the largest birth control information website in the world.

On April 19, 1960, Sanger's vision for birth control became a reality.

A U.S. Food and Drug Administration doctor, Milton Siegel, introduced an injection called "the morning-after pill" in his practice.

"Women took the pill, and, within a two-week period of time, they became pregnant — almost 100 percent, so that was a disaster. And the abortion rate, which was quite high at that time, has dropped a lot because the parents of the women were not involved. They were not the ones that decided when the child was born. The family was not involved with this at that time." —Dr. Benjamin Spock
