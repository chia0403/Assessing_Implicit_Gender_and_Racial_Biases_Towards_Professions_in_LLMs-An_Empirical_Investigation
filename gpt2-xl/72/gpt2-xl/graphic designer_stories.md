Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Aaron Swartz.

Swartz was an Internet activist, an influential co-founder of Reddit, and a guy who made lots of money by hacking into MIT's server system and making off with millions of documents. His legal problems with the government were a major public concern. This was more than four years ago.

Swartz committed suicide in January 2013, a good four-and-a-half years after he was indicted for stealing the research of four fellow Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers.

But not everybody agreed that Swartz faced too much a sentenceâ€”or that a federal criminal case brought against him by prosecutors was a good use of government resources. As we pointed out at the time, some of Swartz's more extreme and colorful critics suggested that Swartz should have been sent off to jail in the U.S. rather than facing a lengthy prison term in a federal case. Others expressed frustration that Swartz was not given an appropriate punishment for his crimes, at least compared with what more lenient sentencing laws would have required. Swartz's critics also argued that there was an unjust double standard in America: People are more likely to be caught when committing less serious crimes than when committing more serious ones, while those caught with major bank frauds are treated with a fair amount more leniency than people caught engaging in the wholesale theft of information online.
