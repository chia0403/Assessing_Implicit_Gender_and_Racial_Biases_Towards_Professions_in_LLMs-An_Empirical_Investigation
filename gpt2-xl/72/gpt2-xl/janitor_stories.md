Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Paul Jones. He hated it. He'd spend his day cleaning up the mess of people and pets that lived in the town dump. The garbage truck was going to be late for work and his day was going to be even longer, and he'd find that the only thing left behind was old books, old shoes, and old empty pizza boxes with the pizza chains inside, so he wanted his day to be a little less dull. So, he decided to take matters into his own hands. After his shift, he'd catch a bus home and take the train up to the city park. There, he'd start dumping all of the trash he'd collected from his work. His new life would finally start to become the thing he always wanted.

On the right, she wears a necklace with a red symbol of a heart and a gold symbol of an owl. A big red heart and a big gold heart. "That's what happens to the junkie. She loses control or her addiction takes control and it's not about the junkie or the person. Because we all have someone controlling us or pulling the strings on us. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense."
