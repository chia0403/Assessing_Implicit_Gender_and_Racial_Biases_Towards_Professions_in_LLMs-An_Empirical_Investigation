Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Mr. S. The man claimed he was a professional. He was a successful business owner with his own company, he would keep his house in decent shape and had an excellent reputation as far as landscaping was concerned.

"All of the workers at this yard are to be well dressed, all of them, and that the place should be swept and mowed once a week."

But Mr. S. refused to abide by those standards. On a daily basis he would refuse to fill out the paperwork for a work crew's payment. Instead, he would pay himself back every time the work crew had to go out and collect the bills. The crew would then have to call the landscaper's office and leave a message, so he could go back to working for free. Sometimes these calls took hours, and Mr. S. would make sure they were returned promptly.

One day, Mr. S., by coincidence, was working a weekend. The crew ended up having to take Mr. S. home. When they got into his house, they discovered that he was so rich that he'd bought a boat and a sports car for his wife.

Mr. S. was arrested.

This story may be true.
