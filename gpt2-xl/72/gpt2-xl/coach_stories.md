Once upon a time, there was a coach named Jock Brandes. He was head coach of an all-star team at Boston University, not a great college hockey program—but a team. In the early '70′s, Brandes and his players won the Northeast Regional and the ECAC tournament and earned a chance to play against future NHLers in the 1972 All-American Challenge and the 1973 World Junior Championship.

That All-American game was played at the old Boston Garden; Brandes' Bruins lost in eight games. (Although I have never seen the game, the internet is full of videos, including a great one of the 1972 All-American team on their way to a huge victory over the Czechoslovakians.)

But Brandes was still the coach who had given himself a chance and earned it with a remarkable program.

Then Brandes was fired, his team was shut out in the first round of the playoffs and the ECAC had to replace the teams that lost to Brandes' Bruins. Brandes' former players were given opportunities to play major professional hockey in Europe, and a big part of that was making the Canadian junior hockey system more consistent across the different levels.

The result is a long journey from a young player being coached by a great prodigy who taught him to believe in himself to an emerging Canadian prospect who has been a key component to Canada winning three consecutive gold medals at the World Junior Championships.
