Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Frank Castle, who took it upon himself to solve a series of mysterious killings in the sleepy small town of Pleasant Hill, New Jersey. Castle, a former U.S. Marine turned private investigator, had long been plagued by the unsolved murder of his former girlfriend, Maddy Stark. But when the city's first homicide occurs while Castle was on the job, Castle's career takes on a new meaning as he takes on the police investigators in charge of the investigation, hoping to bring the killer to justice. He also takes it upon himself to help other troubled men and women.


But the cases are anything but casual. In fact, they're as brutal, and the murders as gory as any we've seen on television, thanks to the fact that Castle himself is both a vigilante and a professional killer.

In season two, we see Castle take on a new and mysterious case. After being fired from the police force over a lack of trust, Castle is forced to take a job at a law firm, where he soon finds himself investigating a string of murders. And after investigating the case for three months, and following a trail that leads back to a childhood friend of his, he discovers that the suspect in the series of murders is none other than her ex-boyfriend, who turns out to be a professional hit man named Daniel White. As Castle finds his patience with White wearing thin, White returns one final time to murder
