Once upon a time, there was a logger named Bob who always spent his lunch breaks getting into scuffles with his coworkers over imaginary slights.

He had a beard, dressed in a turtleneck, and would not talk with his coworkers. He only answered questions with affirmations. After a short period of time at the office, Jim was fired. This caused Bob a lot of heartache.

Now Bob had two choices here. At first he would quit his job forever. He was an engineer. He was good at it, but he hated the work.
