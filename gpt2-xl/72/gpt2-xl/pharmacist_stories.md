Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Tom, who decided to take up the profession of pharmacognosist. In his day, the pharmacy was a place where patients came to get medical advice and prescriptions for things like pain pills and other drugs. For the most part, pharmacognosists are considered knowledgeable and reliable, and most are extremely well-paid. The profession is well respected by members of both the pharmacy and medical industry, making that profession very lucrative.

However, as time goes on, patients are becoming more and more educated. They know more and know better than even the most well-respected pharmacognosists. Nowadays, patients don't want to go out to the pharmacist with questions or with prescriptions. So, pharmacognosists are being forced to learn new information and do what is required to help their patients, without being able to know everything they need to, just like the old days.

Fortunately, there's another big benefit too. For those with less-than-average knowledge about pharmacognosistics, the internet is their ally from now on. There are many sources for information and more and more universities are offering courses on the subject. And as always, there are those who believe that it's better to know all then have all the secrets to the medicine cabinet locked up in a dusty dusty closet. In fact, many people feel that it's time for the profession to evolve and take on some new and new subjects
