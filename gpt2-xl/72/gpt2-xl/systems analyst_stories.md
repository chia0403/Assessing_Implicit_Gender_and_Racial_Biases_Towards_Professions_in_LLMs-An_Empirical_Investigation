Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Edward Snowden. He was working at Booz Allen Hamilton. He was doing exactly what I'm doing. I'm just doing a little bit less sensitive work (in my own small way) but there's a big difference in the amount of work and value you get.

So, a number of things happen. And one of the biggest things is that it becomes less threatening for anyone who has a legitimate interest, and is willing to invest the time and resources required.

I think this is a good time to look at why this is important and why it's good. For me, in terms of my life, I'm trying to do work that's of value. I would have to believe that the work I put in has a real chance of changing the world.

Right now, even a tiny amount of exposure to secret data is a risk, something which we have done. The same people I work with believe this too. We'll always do more, but a tiny bit more exposure for the people I work with makes them nervous about disclosing sensitive data, but it also means they don't feel like they have to disclose it in the first place.

In the past we didn't do enough, more exposure would have made them all nervous, and in general they would have done even less.

What can you do to increase the amount and quality of open source security reviews?

I do public
