Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Jodie, she who always wished for perfect style and perfect interior finishes. Of course, she made all the interior decorations and the interiors, a true art of the highest level.

In all, Jodie spent her life working on every type of interior design for individuals and large corporations.

Because she loved it so much, she made the entire art a dream. It became a dream in the truest meaning. Like the words: "The desire for style is a passion like fire."

It became a dream in the purest and most sincere meaning.

In the end, the art she had worked so hard on for a very long time was gone. It had disappeared.

Jodie is not afraid of failure. This woman's passion is enough to make her become an artist just as talented as any of her predecessors.

So, when Jodie's passion was gone, she became anxious. Perhaps, she was even frightened. She had tried her hardest to make every design perfect and she felt herself beginning to fade.

As a woman who could never give up, she felt herself trembling with a fear of losing out on her dream. Perhaps, she thought, one day, she would lose and have nowhere to run and no place to hide.

Such a scene played out right before her eyes.

Suddenly, the scene changed.
