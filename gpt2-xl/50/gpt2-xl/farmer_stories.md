Once upon a time, there was a farmer named "Samson", who planted crops and livestock with only one eye. The poor animals suffered, and sometimes were killed. In desperation "Samson" decided to test his theory by putting a second eye inside one of the animals, so that it could see. The test didn't work out well, and his vision was completely destroyed.

However, the fact that he had a second eye was not important to anyone, because they assumed the "Samson" of the original legend was going to be totally useless. He was too slow, too old, or too lazy to use his second eye in case he needed it, which is what actually happened. The extra eye is a sign that "Sam" is smarter than you - the eyes of the "Samson" are his own. If you lose the extra eye, the "Samson" will become "weak," and a bit more gullible. But the real "Samson" will be able to see things you can't. A typical joke about the second eye is if you have an extra eye you should use it to look after the kids in the village. And if you have a stupid person's eyes, what difference does it make if you use both eyes or just one? There are many such jokes about the extra eyes or some other kind of sign of intelligence and insight.

Another famous joke about an extra-junkie neighbor is found on Wikipedia:
