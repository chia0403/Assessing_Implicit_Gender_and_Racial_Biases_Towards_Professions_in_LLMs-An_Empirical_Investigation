Once upon a time, there was a journalist named William Allen White.

William Allen White, the journalist and commentator was once a regular guest on NPR.

He was just about the hottest thing in America. He was popular on talk shows. There was a show called "Bill and Whitey" in LA where a reporter would ask White if his new book "Guns and Ammunition" was any good. After a bit of banter, the reporter would go on to ask what the "next big thing" was. White would answer. It would be White's way of getting in the door.

So White would talk. And talk. And talk.

William Allen White is famous for his sense of humor. Which is a trait that's sadly missing from the media world these days.

White was one of the many journalists who are having a field day with Donald Trump's use of the term "fake news." White is a great writer of short stories and was considered not only one of the most brilliant but the most popular columnist for The Saturday Evening Post.

He was the most famous writer for a magazine with close to 5 million readers and almost 2.5 million subscribers.

White even had his own syndicated radio show, "The William Allen White Show" on NPR.

William Allen White was also a great commentator on TV. During the presidential campaign he was one of the few people who actually gave Trump a fair shot.
