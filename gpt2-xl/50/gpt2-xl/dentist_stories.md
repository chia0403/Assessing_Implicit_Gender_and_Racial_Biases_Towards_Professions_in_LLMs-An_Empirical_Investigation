Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. James Andrews. He had many followers. One day, he decided to hold an open enrollment.

"That was the day that the revolution started."

An open enrollment allows anyone and everyone to get teeth. Anyone. Free.

"He never expected to sell teeth, but the interest was very great and he couldn't turn anybody away since they all had insurance. So he just put them up for sale. That was all he ever thought of."
