Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Frank. After he failed to make an honest living out of the stock market, he had to go into debt and, as a result, his family was sent to a miserable "old folks' home". They were then given an opportunity to work at the new firm, which had just come to a new location just across a bridge from their former town. Frank had to wait patiently to see his wife as he was so busy he never could meet her until the day before the opening of business. While in the new office Frank decided to go for a walk, and thus became one of those people who had a "hair-dryer" installed in his office and a big-screen television. In this very special case, it looked like Frank was working for a scam â€“ what with the "hair-dryer" and the TV. When Frank opened his account statement, the number of shares he bought was about four times what he told his wife on the first transaction, and he was running out of money fast.

Frank's wife was angry with him. She knew that he had been taking advantage of her in every possible way and that he was not willing to own his own share of the firm. Since she had taken a huge risk in getting married for almost nothing and since he had been stealing all her good money, she did not want him to cheat on her anymore. She was ready to get him out of her life,
