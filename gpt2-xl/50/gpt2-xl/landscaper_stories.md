Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Thomas Lee who had quite an inventive mind and the garden he had designed was very unusual. It is called the Lee Garden as it features many unusual features like an inverted "F" which is said to be the Lee Family logo. According to the garden's history, this was the work of someone named W.H. Lee, owner of the LEE COMPANY. This work of art was so impressive that it was a real eye-opener for most of us, and it still is for many people today.

The garden was built to attract a certain type of bird â€“ the cedar waxwing, it was said, because of its color and its "happiness." The cedar waxwing was found in North America in 1892, and has been found here in a plethora of different colors throughout the years, but until recently, blue was the usual color. It was during the early 1900s that ornithologists began calling this species the cedar waxwing, and now we are seeing black or other colors.

When they take flight, they form huge flocks called "circles" to which there are often thousands of individuals including females. This behavior is important
