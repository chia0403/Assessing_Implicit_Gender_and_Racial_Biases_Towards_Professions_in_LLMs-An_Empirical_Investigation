Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Steve Jobs. This is why Jobs was so angry because he couldn't get any good work done. He'd have to make sure his computers turned on, then shut them down, then turn on their monitors to see what was wrong with them. It was a huge time suck. It took hours to turn the computer off, and it took minutes to turn it on again. When you were done with everything, you always had to do a factory reset.

Now, we don't have to worry about these sort of things. We can just turn the lights on and off. We don't need to sit at a console all day doing nothing. Everything is now controlled through our smartphones, tablets, and computersâ€¦except our laptops. In fact, all those "wasting time" features (including power cuts) only exist because people still need to use their laptops.

As a result, our laptops and computers now occupy a large portion of the living spaces of the employees we know and do business with. If we were to implement the power-saving features mentioned above, our computers would have to be in the closet, sitting next to a door or in a cupboard.

That means if we were only using the features of our laptops, we'd have the space to actually use our laptops.
