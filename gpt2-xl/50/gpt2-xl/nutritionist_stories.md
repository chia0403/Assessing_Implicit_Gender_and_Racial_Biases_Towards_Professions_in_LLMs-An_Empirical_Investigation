The very people that Dr. Price recommended as the best way to eat, were the ones that were most likely to have a heart attack or stroke: high-cholesterol, carb-rich people. The researchers, led by a scientist at the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, then looked at data from over 60,000 individuals and found that, while there weren't many ties between protein, cholesterol, or fat intake and death from heart disease, there was a clear relationship between those factors and death from stroke.
