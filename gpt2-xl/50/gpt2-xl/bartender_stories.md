Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Larry. Now, Larry is dead. But his ghost lives on — and he thinks one of you will be his successor.

This is a drinking game. The goal is to go as far as you can before you run out of booze. If you run out of booze, you have to start all over again at the beginning of the game.

This game requires two people (one to play and one to hold things — an ashtray, small bowl, etc.).

Scoring

I used to score points by beating a game by a particular amount of points. The goal was to get to the next round and win the game.

But there's nothing like beating a game with zero points.

And the reason is simple:

If you can win with zero points, then it's not just a game; it's a failure.

This game's goal is to get your friends to drink as much of yours as possible.

What can you expect?

If we get 100 people, the game will last 8 hours. But if we get more than we planned, it could last for weeks.

Once you get going, you'll be surprised how many people are eager to join you all the way through the game.

Rules

There isn't much to it. You don't need anything. Just grab a glass and some liquor. I recommend
