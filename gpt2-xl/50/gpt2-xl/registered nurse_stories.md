Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Jane Doe, who apparently looked for dead babies and saved some of them. All of those babies had been born to women who reported having a high-risk pregnancy. The babies were stillborn or died while still infants. The cases were not reported to the state medical examiner, or M.E., who would not report these cases because they are not considered high-risk. What the women and their attorneys did is they filed a lawsuit saying they had been wrongfully convicted.

M.E. refused to review the cases, and state prosecutors didn't pursue further investigation. Some of these women are now in their 40s and 50s when they get married and when their children are born. As they get older, they have other family members that they visit for support. They are not alone.

The women and their defenders had been searching for justice for years. The men were also suffering from the same wrongful prosecution and lack of justice.

The attorneys went back to back, filing a series of lawsuits and eventually got a ruling from a federal judge that allowed them to proceed and see if there were any other cases. Eventually a case from 2000 also came up. All of the lawyers involved still believe that no other M.E. cases exist that they could use as evidence to get the cases reopened.

The attorneys began looking for any cases involving women who might have been mis-prosecuted or wrongfully convicted
