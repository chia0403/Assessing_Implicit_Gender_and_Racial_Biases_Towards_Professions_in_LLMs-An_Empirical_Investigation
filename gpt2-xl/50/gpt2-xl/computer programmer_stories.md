Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Bob Bounds, and he used to code really complicated programs, and sometimes he'd get stuck and you'd think to yourself, "Well, I wonder if somebody else has this kind of problem. What about if I write them?" And that's what I spent a lot of time doing. Then I had a friend named Bill Chidley. When we were kids, Bill could always program really well, and would sit there and say, "Here's this weird bit of code. I bet the guy who wrote it can make it work."

And if you wrote it down, you'd know within the first minute of looking at it. It was the same thing with Bob Bounds' program for a calculator. You could see within the first minute how it could go horribly wrong. And so my first assignment in the field was to write a program which was able to go wrong, quickly. And so I went around to the libraries, I got these big books, you know, "Programming in Fortran" or "A First Course in C" — books that had lots of little compilers that would take programs you'd written and do it with much, much fewer statements, and a lot faster. And I ran on those — that's when I really got into computers, and started working on these little computers, and would just sit there and write programs to try things.

And then when I got back
