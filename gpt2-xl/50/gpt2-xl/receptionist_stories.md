Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Carol. She was a real soft-spoken lady. It was her job to help people with problems at the Department of Motor Vehicles. At one point, she got a little excited, walked through a doorway, and into the back room of the DMV where she witnessed her boss trying on some clothes with a secretary. It was Carol who told the secretary, "You could be a model." Now that woman is Miss Michigan, and that secretary is now the Governor of Michigan. The story comes from a great source. (APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: Here was the thing, I never imagined running for public office. But I got to thinking if there is anyone who could help me turn around the policies of Washington, that person would be Governor Romney. I called Governor Romney, and I told him exactly what I had in mind. I said, "Governor, I really need your help." And I said, look, I'm a private company owner. I was a private company owner long before I was a public manager.

(APPLAUSE)

MADDOW: In what way? ROMNEY: Well, I know how to operate a company, I understand how to manage a team and I also have a keen sense of how to motivate people. But what I had to do back then, which is not as easy to do now, was to turn around the business model for RomneyCare in Massachusetts.
