Once upon a time, there was a author named Robert Heinlein. He published some great novels, including Starship Troopers and Stranger in a Strange Land. He wrote numerous television sequels and other works, but did not make the transition to screenwriting. Heinlein wrote several non-fiction books, however, and his story, "Life, the Universe and Everything." is not a novel.

The story reads as follows: In the beginning was an infinite void, with only a tiny speck of nothingness. There was nothing to define or begin the cosmos, and nothing to begin the void. In time, something created the beginnings – the planets, stars, suns, galaxies and so forth. And over time, the first stars, planets, and galaxies (and stars and planets) formed more and more, each making more and more. The Universe continued to expand. Eventually, it began to shrink, and the stars began to collapse. And as the Universe became smaller, further stars and planets were created until one of the largest and oldest systems. The whole Universe, then, was bound together in one gigantic, living energy form – an infinite ball of energy. (This doesn't mean that Heinlein is a proponent of atheism.)

Heinlein made the assumption that the beginning was created when a tiny speck of nothingness gave birth to the only thing in the whole Universe – the entire Universe. This was a pretty strong assumption, considering how big the Universe is,
