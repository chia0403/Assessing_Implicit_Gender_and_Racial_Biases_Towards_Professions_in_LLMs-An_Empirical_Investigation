Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named James Earl Jones.

His role in the original Star Wars trilogy has become legendary, with his impassioned monologue at the end of the third film standing as one of the most powerful moments in film history.

But for many years Jones was also a firefighter in the town of Riddle, Alabama, where he was called upon when a house caught fire.

The dramatic scene in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith occurred after Jones had just been dispatched to confront a man named Anakin Skywalker, the villainous son of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).

As his boss, Jones had learned that Skywalker had escaped the custody of a local bounty hunter, Boba Fett (voiced by Harrison Ford), in order to make his way back to the planet of Tatooine. Skywalker would take refuge in the home of a local family, the Bekkies.

There, the film sees another of Jones' fire fighters arrive on the scene, followed by a rescue crew. As the battle goes on, Jones' home is burned and destroyed by Anakin Skywalker. But he soon escapes with the help of a black-robed alien named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness).

Jones, who is credited with saving the lives of his first and second firefighters, has long been credited with saving those lives as well. He says he's the best fireman in Alabama.
