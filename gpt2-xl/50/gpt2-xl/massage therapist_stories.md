And she was truly a terrible soul for believing that - in her free time. She soon became a frequent target of angry Englishmen who would constantly shout at her, 'Hey lady! Why don't you just tell that rude masseur to fuck right off? He's treating you like crap right now and you're just wasting your time! I'd be happy to give one of my money making assistants a proper rub down!'


And so, Jane became so annoyed that she made her decision - to abandon her career and become a masseuse. And all she ever wanted was the massage industry to be able to pay her a living wage so she could live like a human being, not the petulant
