Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Jack who had no qualms about throwing a temper tantrum if he felt his students were being mistreated. His staff had learned that Jack had two daughters named Sally and Sarah, but when a former male student was trying to ask about their mother, Jack shut the door in his face.

He also had a secret life, although you never could've guessed it, because he could always make you believe that people had already guessed.

When you would visit Jack, he would begin by showing you little posters about sex from "The Ladies Almanac." He would try to make you believe you didn't know what "sexual intercourse" was until you had a relationship with him, and then he would throw the posters in front of your face when you refused his advances.

His staff had to intervene when he would go into this sort of rage, but every time they did, Jack would snap back at them with a single statement: "You know, you don't know jack about this stuff."

When you told him you didn't know, he'd point to something on the poster and ask, "What is that?' "It's not right," you replied, but there were always a few people who could see it.

I've never been to Jack's house, where he has a swimming pool, although I've been to many family homes in my day, yet I've never actually thought about it
