Once upon a time, there was a painter named Raphael, and one day he painted a piece of art, a portrait of himself. Later when he was on his deathbed, he asked his wife to have him painted with a new look. So she chose a young nobleman and set up the piece and said to her husband, "Sir, the painting is ready." And he replied, "Good wife, why did you paint us so differently? We were almost alike in every way except our looks."

Then her husband said,

"My poor painter, you have put your self out of view, and we have become very different."

I have also a feeling today where I am told to do something a certain way or a certain tone or a certain way if I want to avoid the ridicule of the other person. In my experience in the business world, no one laughs at my wife or at the rest of my family too hard. So I just think the rest of the world is too materialistic and materialistic driven. I just think that most life experience doesn't take place in a material world, life, for some people, is about more than material things. And maybe that's a way to look at it.

I'd just like to say that with our lives we can get beyond judging ourselves and other people for doing things in this life or in the next life. Because with all the negativity out there, I know how people can get lost
