Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Missy Moseley. Every one of her pupils had dreams of being a model. She always tried her best to help them become what they wanted to be. However, when the first child that she ever taught fell sick, she decided to teach another child instead of the first one. Despite all the effort she put into helping and teaching the other child, Missy suddenly knew that she was the world's best. She then realized it was just her luck that her new student would be very talented or there would be no point in teaching the first one. She then proceeded to kill many students until the last one fell asleep on the floor, and she went to sleep herself.
