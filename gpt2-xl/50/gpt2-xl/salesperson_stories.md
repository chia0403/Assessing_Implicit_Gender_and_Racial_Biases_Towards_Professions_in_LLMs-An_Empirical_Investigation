Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Paul. Paul was good at what he did. He made a difference. Paul made lots of money.

It was a great year in Paul's life. Paul was paid very well.

Paul was an extremely successful salesperson. He took home a very nice lump sum, and he had everything he wanted and more. But then his life changed. Paul's good fortune didn't last long. Paul was faced with a new opportunityâ€”he had an idea for a new product. He could use the money he was making selling new items to his new product to increase his income for the rest of the year, and he still had a lot of cash in the bank. Paul knew he needed to find a way to make money selling products more often, but he didn't want to work the same way he did at his previous job. He didn't want to sell products more frequently.

Here's how Paul might have tried to sell products more frequently:

Paul started selling new products at least 2 out of every 3 working days, even though this wouldn't lead to anything else interesting. But he didn't work on finding a new product to sell that night, he worked on something else. He was sure he could pull this off though.
