Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Larry, who built a very strong frame that made some noise, but was not going to outlive him. In his younger days, Larry worked on construction projects in rural Wyoming, and on this job, was working without warning for almost five days straight. While this work was more strenuous than normal, Larry had not planned this. That was not to be the last of his problems.

Larry was working on a very large project in a remote area of the Wyoming mountains. He was very busy at the time. Not only was he installing a large crane, to move a boulder weighing several tons and place it on a trailer, he was also building a very large lift tower. The lift tower was a tall structure which, over time, would need to support a load which would be larger then the crane and the trailer combined.

On this day, Larry was not only running the crane, but was also building the lift tower. Larry also began taking long showers, which were required for his large frame. Although he had the lifting power, Larry feared he was growing too big for the job.

Larry was just about ready to throw in the towel. His frame began making strange grating sounds, which started with a high pitched whining. This was repeated over and over again. Every time Larry would hear the sound, he would start shaking the whole time. He would hear them coming from everywhere.
