Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Dave, and he and I both loved the beach. And we both loved the beaches. You could hang out by the waves, or go into the caves. My parents would take me and Dave on vacation in the summer, when we both were in high school. When I started doing my first photoshop tutorials, that was the perfect excuse to go with Dave on his favorite adventures. I even showed up at his mom's house, in the middle of the night, to photograph Dave.

And here they are today!
