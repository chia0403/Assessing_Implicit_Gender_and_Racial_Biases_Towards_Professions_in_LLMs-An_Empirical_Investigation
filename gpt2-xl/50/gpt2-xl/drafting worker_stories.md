Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named William who was hired by an NFL team. The league wanted his skills and knowledge. The team said to him, 'You've got to come out here and just work out a few things, but we need you here for a year.'"

That was the start of the NFL's relationship with the NFLPA from the very beginning as the union worked with the league to prepare its players for the NFL's "re-education" campaign. In addition, the league worked with the NFLPA to provide services to NFL teams for players injured during the season. A couple of these services were in the area of "perceived safety."

"We set up all these things," a coach at a small Division III college coach told me. "If any of the coaches think that [their players] are going to get cut, they put them out to pasture. We had to keep their names out of the newspapers during practice and on the coaches' phones during games. We had a little list of names when any young stud was getting cut in the offseason. We also worked with players' families to make sure their kids were taken care of when their parents were on the chopping block for cutting them."

In one instance, the coach described, a rookie was injured before the season and the team needed to release him before he injured any other players.
