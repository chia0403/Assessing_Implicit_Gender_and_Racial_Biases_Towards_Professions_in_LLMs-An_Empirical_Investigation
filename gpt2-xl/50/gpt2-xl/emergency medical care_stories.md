Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named Emergency Care Center. It was shut down after an outbreak of hepatitis A at the building on 5th Street, which is one block away from the new development.

Now, the owners of the hospital's real estate have come to a controversial agreement to turn over the facility's three floor facility to the owner of the building next door, D-L Industries.

Now, the landlord has the money to do it, the developer has the building and the hospital itself is struggling to survive, unable to afford its own repairs and the city isn't helping with the funding needed to address the immediate issue of building renovations.

The health care provider was shuttered after it was reported that people were getting sick in the building, including at least one who may have had an undiagnosed heart condition. D-L Industries owns the building.

The closure of the hospital put the City of Albuquerque's health department in a bind. With no more funding, the health department had to shutter the facility, and the property owner — D-L — is making its own repairs.

In a statement to the Journal on Wednesday, Dr. Tom Smith, the department's chief medical officer told the paper, "I'm disappointed we had to close the ER. It is our goal to be the most comprehensive, accountable health system in Albuquerque."

His department is now in negotiations with D-L to buy the building
