Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named John B. White. He lived at 3231 East 23rd Avenue in East Chicago and was born in 1848. He was a "hanging on" to his business and made his livelihood by taking out policies and selling them at a discount.

White had five children. His elder son William, John's brother, was born on January 7, 1876 when John was 62 years old. William grew up in the Chicago area but was a frequent visitor home throughout his young life and worked for a time as a laborer on the North Shore. After working his way through school, in the summer of 1900 William earned a degree in Business from the University of Illinois and became a partner with his brother-in-law, Joseph W. White.

William's new partnership was a success but as the years wore on White's marriage to his wife Eliza took its toll. They split up in 1912 when he was 60 years old. Eliza moved to Minnesota and the pair would never see each other again.

William and Eliza eventually divorced. White went his own way however and continued to operate the insurance agent business under the name "B.J. White."

In 1928 John became the President of American Standard Insurance Service. During that first year, under his leadership American Standard posted the second highest premium increases of any company. John also ran against the incumbent State Insurance Commissioner in the Republican primary. Not content
