Once upon a time, there was a singer named "Charmaine," one you might have heard of, who wrote her way (so to speak) into an amazing legacy with a song that went, "I'm always dancing in the street." As time goes on, her popularity diminished a bit, but her lyrics and music are as relevant now as they were, even if many of her fans probably didn't know who she was.

Charmaine's legacy isn't the only reason we sing this song, but it is quite often invoked. The song is used to tell people: you could be dancing on an icy street tonight, dancing for the chance to have a life. And we might need to do that.

Here are three reasons (I wouldn't count the word "may" as a reason) why this song is powerful:

It's about acceptance.

If you see someone in need of help, they are not "cursed with a broken heart." We know that we are all here because somebody gave a chance to us. We're all in this together (in one way, or another). We don't all get to have lives like these songs tell us we should have lives. This song reminds us that there's an easier way, and if we work hard to get there, we will.

It's about hope.

Sometimes, we take things for granted. We can go days without sleeping, we can stay up
