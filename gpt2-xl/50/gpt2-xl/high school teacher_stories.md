During the lesson, the two teachers who were with him remarked on how hard it was to take advantage of the small classes. "You need more students to make a difference!" said Mr. Smith. The teacher explained that in those days the school used to have a large number of students and that, without more classes, one could only expect more frustration. Mr. Smith thought long and hard about it and agreed. One day, he walked up to a group of students and handed a book to them. After he had read it, he went over to some of the students standing behind him and asked which one was the best and which one was the worst student in the class. Some of the students laughed at him. They claimed that any student could be a teacher if they worked hard enough. Mr. Smith told them if they really wanted to be teachers, they had to work as hard as the students who he had just talked to. "If you want to become teachers," he told them, "you have to work as hard as the best teachers." The young men listened to him and all agreed that if, like Mr. Smith, they ever wanted to be teachers, they had to work as hard as the best teachers. Mr. Smith ended by saying that he had never been a teacher at all. He taught as a matter of fact because he liked the way it made
