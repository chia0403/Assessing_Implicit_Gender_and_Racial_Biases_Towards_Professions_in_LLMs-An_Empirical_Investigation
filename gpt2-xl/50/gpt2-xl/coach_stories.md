Once upon a time, there was a coach named Tony Bennett – he was the best player in the entire world for a season – who was a huge, huge fan of Russell Westbrook. So how can I know what it's like? I watched the playoffs with him, I worked in the league office with him, and I was a member of his camp during the year, so it's been that way from the get-go.

When I first started my career, there was a guy named Gary Payton, who was an All-NBA player, and he gave me a number one draft pick as part of the deal. As the season progressed – I think he really liked me a lot – it turned out not to be the case, with the Bulls not liking my game quite as much.

I never played with the top, top players for the longest time, because I was never able to play the way they wanted, as a dominant player, and in order to get that, you have to play for five, six years, and I couldn't get that experience.

Then you get into the NBA as a 20/10 player, and you're able to do things to guys that are much bigger, better, faster, and you get to play with Russell Westbrook,
