Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named A.T. Wilder, who was obsessed with the idea of creating a plant that can produce flowers. To the phlebotomist, flowers were beautiful and interesting, but unlike other plant types, they were limited in the number and shape of their petals. They were able to produce flowers when he wanted to, but they were not easy to propagate in a controlled way.

Wilder took his fixation to a new level when he invented a genetically modified fruit with three petals. It was a miracle in and of itself, but he also realized that the number of fruit could be increased through the use of mutation. By grafting the mutated fruit onto a flower, Wilder was able to produce new fruit, although these came much more quickly than he'd originally hoped.

Fast-forward to 2006, and when scientists at Monsanto came into contact with Wilder, they decided to try their hand at an alternative to his original invention. They took cells from one type of tree, took one group of them (called a "transgenic tree") to different genes, and tried to introduce those genes to produce plants that could produce all kinds of different things, from vegetables to fruit. That work, which they called "Bt cotton," resulted in producing a variety of plants that could produce a variety of different effects. The one thing these new crops have in common, however, isn't their looks,
