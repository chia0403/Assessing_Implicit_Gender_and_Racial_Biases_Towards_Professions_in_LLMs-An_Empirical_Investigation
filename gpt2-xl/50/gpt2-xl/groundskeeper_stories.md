Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Joe. Every morning, at 5:30 am, Joe would get up and go into the woods behind his house where there was a small clearing. With a stick in each hand, Joe would stand in the clearing and make a number of circles, then walk toward a house on the other side of the clearing. He made an X in the center of the X and then walked out toward a hillside where the deer would probably feed. Joe would get into his house, take some coffee, eat his breakfast, sit on the floor and watch a movie.

At seven o'clock, Joe would walk in to his house and he was done. All the children and adults went out for the day.

On the way back from his field, Joe would sit back in his chair, enjoy his nice coffee, and then go into his room. That's where he had his desk with the computer. He would sit and use his computer for around five to 10 minutes and then go back to where his children and all the day's other children were playing.

Joe was the most dedicated person I had ever known, absolutely devoted to his work. I never thought to try and figure out why this man would do this, but the way he did it, it was clearly for more than just himself. There was no other reason.

But then one time, the children began to come to his field around 9pm
