Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Douglas K. Smith whose work helped crack the cold case of missing teen Victoria Clark.

Then there's the case of a woman named Lisa R. who disappeared in 1997. K.C. Thomas is one of the detectives handling the case.

"I know of a lot of these missing persons that may never surface," Thomas said. "And maybe they're just forgotten forever, and maybe others remember them and want to find them."

If the case of Lisa R. continues to puzzle investigators, it might never be solved.

But don't worry. We're here to help, and provide details to help get you started.

Here's what we know so far about Lisa R.:
