Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mr. Bakes. He worked at Starbucks since he was 21 and has been very successful in the company. One day, Mr. Bakes went to the cake kitchen with his father and they discussed the business. His father explained that they would have to make more money due to the fact that their business would have the most customers, due to his son's success in catering. His father told Mr. Bakes to go to his place and make more cakes. Mr. B's father then told Mr. Bakes to go to the kitchen to help him prepare coffee and cookies (for the breakfast cereal the company purchased). He then left him because he was too busy. He did not say anything about the cake he was going to make that day. He has never complained and has always done his best. He has worked in every location of Starbucks. They can tell that he is successful because the cakes he is making have been sold nationwide. His father is an entrepreneur and loves creating jobs for others. He was the only thing that stood in his way to earning the highest salary for his profession.

His father was told to go to Starbucks to bring more business to the company. He was told to make a cake that he had never even tried with this concept. He never once mentioned that he had never baked anything like this. He knew nothing about it in the kitchen. It would be his first time ever doing so. He
