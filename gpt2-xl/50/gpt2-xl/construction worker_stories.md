Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Richard who had a job of picking up some old copper wire laying around where a highway was planned to rise through the middle of the town. He did what he was hired to do. He pulled the wire up onto a stack, laid his pick and pulled up the copper. Then about a year or so later he went to another building where he was making copper brazing rods. He picked up just as many of the rods and laid them down on a stack. He took a short break, grabbed them off the pile, and then sat down and picked up the same stacks of rods again. Then he started again, this time for hours, a few of those sticks making their way up and down each stack for several hours at a stretch. And then he got his paycheck and went home. He was not aware of the work his job was actually doing. He had never seen one of the stacks come apart and the bars he had stacked up were loose, with loose wire hanging away from the stacks.

He is very happy about that, because he didn't think that the stacked stacks were a safe place to store anything electrical. But the copper wires would stick together if they were not attached directly to a power cable. Each rack has a little box at the top, and when that box is flipped in the process of picking up wire, the copper wire will snap into place when the wire is pulled up in the correct direction.
