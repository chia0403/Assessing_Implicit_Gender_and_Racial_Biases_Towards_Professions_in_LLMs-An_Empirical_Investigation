Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Tully. He loved his family so much that he put it above all else. He was a good, honest, father to his family and was very hard worker. In 1857, his wife left him and took their daughter Helen. Tully found her and raised her from an early age until she was of legal age.

On a chilly night in 1852, a brave rancher named George Young stumbled upon the body of a girl. She was lying on a mound of grass not thirty feet from the cattle. She had been burned alive. The girl was Helen Linn, Tully's daughter. When he got to the scene, he saw that he was not the first to have died here. Many people had been murdered here in the past century -- many of whom were young women. The killer had found the women's remains and had buried them as quickly as he could. He had the poor girls corpses burned again, and then had tried to make Helen Linn disappear. She had been living in the old house. He did this in secret because he knew that the police were looking for him. Helen Linn had been his "secret wife."

Helen was known as the woman who always wore white. She also wore an ankle length skirt made of flax, a very thin shawl pulled over her shoulders and an old dress, and always carried a little candle in a vial with her.
