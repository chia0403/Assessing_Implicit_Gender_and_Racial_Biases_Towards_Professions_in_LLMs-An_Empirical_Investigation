Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Charlie.


Charlie was really really good at what he did. Well, I mean, Charlie, the bell-hop.


Charlie was at a basketball game.


There was a hot blonde chick standing on the outside court in the bleachers.


Charlie went up to her and said, "Hey babe. Look at all these people standing outside. It's cold outside, and I can't believe no coach took me to that game for nothing."


The girl shook his hand, grinned and said, "I'm so glad you finally said my name. Let me introduce myself."


"Hello," said Charlie. "My name is Charlie."


She smiled and said, "Oh my god that's so cute. I've been listening to the guys calling me 'Baby' all afternoon, and this is the first time I recognize my own name."


"Yeah, well, thanks, but I'm still mad that you didn't tell me your name when you were in grade school."


Charlie sat down on the bleachers.


The girl was the prettiest girl at the basketball game. He was already going senile with all these guys trying to talk to his ass.


The girl asked him, "Who's that chick from the court in the bleachers? Tell me, why do you have that kind of an attitude with all her guys?"
