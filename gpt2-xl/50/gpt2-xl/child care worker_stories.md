Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Lisa. All children in our home came to her to do their homework, but the children wanted to go out into the yard. She would yell at the children and tell them that they have to stay in their room. That's when the teacher heard her screaming and called the police. Lisa was convicted and given a 5 year prison sentence. She had no prior criminal record. We were shocked that her punishment was so bad. After only two months of being in jail, Lisa's parole date was coming up and we decided not to fight for her since a prison term might result in her returning home to her young child."

But that doesn't mean that the people who sent her there didn't try. In fact, there's a website out there devoted to child kidnapping by CPS and other government agencies. If you have a particular reason to fight back, here's just one example:

"It should go without saying that a child's safety, and even the safety of others, has absolutely nothing to do with the ability to have children. This particular case may appear unusual, but consider the following data: The average child is only missing for two days. The average missing person has an IQ of 120. So at a minimum, the average missing person is not an idiot."

Here's the list of child kidnappings reported in Canada:
