Once upon a time, there was a writer named Kurt Vonnegut. In the late 1950s, a time capsule was hidden in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri. This was Vonnegut's hometown. He didn't have to go to the time capsule; it was built for him. His whole town. He didn't even need to get to the location in time to receive it. But he came anyway. He wasn't sure he would make it. His wife, he told the story in the book Where the Sidewalk Ends, had warned him to stay away from the place for his safety. She told him it has a lot of snakes. We're not talking about his everyday backyard snake problem; I'm talking about the big, scary snake problem. As his wife later told journalist Bob Grant:

I told him, "Don't go." I said, "This is my house — I've never let anyone see it. And when you get lost, you won't be able to find your way back." And he said, "No, I'm not afraid of snakes — I'm afraid of your house." I said, "You're gonna have a bad time."

She also told him that if his heart stopped, it would kill her. She died just days later.

Vonnegut wrote more than fifty novels about his American life, including Breakfast at Tiffany's, Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, Player Piano
