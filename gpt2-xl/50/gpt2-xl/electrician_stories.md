Once upon a time, there was a electrician named George. It was a warm day, and he was working in the backyard on an underground conduit.

The conduit was only partially finished, so when George turned on the electrician's toolbox, there was an explosion of sparks. One of the wires had caught the light, and George got a taste of lightning.

The experience caused George to change his life. He became consumed with doing everything he could to protect the safety of his fellow workers, even sacrificing his family to do so. George took the name George the Lightning Rod, and from his ashes sprang a whole new breed of people: Electricians.

In their minds, the only real difference between an electrician and an electrician, as the name implies, was the ability to be electrically charged. As more and more people were exposed to electric currents during the construction industry, the word became associated with electricity - and so we're still calling them this.


Electricians work under a variety of names, from the name of the company they work for to a unique nickname or nickname bestowed upon them by the clients of their employer.
