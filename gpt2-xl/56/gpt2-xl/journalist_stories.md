Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Chris McManus, and he had the great good fortune to cover the campaign in all its glory. The campaign was, of course, the 2008 presidential election. Chris reported pretty much every move and pronouncement by the candidates for The Washington Post, and all of those are reproduced below:


1. On February 24, 2008:

Obama said: "Yes, we will end tax cuts for the wealthy. We will also end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan." "On the economy, the Democratic nominee, Senator Clinton, has pledged that, if elected, we will spend $800 billion on new spending and $250 billion on deficit reduction in an effort to prevent a second recession by the end of 2009. By contrast, the Republicans on their websites say that they will spend $1 trillion in 2010, a trillion in 2011 and so on. This is not the kind of plan that's going to lead us back to economic growth of 2 percent a year."


And so it goes. As for the Republican candidate Senator McCain, he is, apparently, "in trouble" in a general election where he leads in the polls by only a few percentage points. The best that Chris can say is that McCain is "not as far ahead as he looks." That's a rather odd thing to say about a man whose best position is currently tied with someone we've never even heard of in a national poll.
