Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Roddy. Now his name no longer appears in their office, but that's not much different from how it used to be.

But what many people might not expect is how long it takes Roddy to return a bill and even how much it costs him in the process. It was all caught on camera at a McDonalds in San Francisco's Mission District. Now, Roddy is hoping that this might be the beginning of something more. (The video can be seen below.)

"Let's see if we can make a change," Roddy says in the video. "Change the system."

The video shows Roddy sitting at a counter, waiting patiently for a pay slip. Then, moments later, a man walks in with a bill and takes the money out of Roddy's pocket without actually paying.

Roddy says they were able to recover about $50 from the man because he had stolen his own money. He later realized he'd left his card inside the restaurant, so he called the police and the manager who was in charge of the register at the time.

The incident caused Roddy to call the mayor's office and make a complaint, and it was eventually investigated by the store's manager.

According to SFGate.com, the manager said that he didn't receive the money in time to go through the system and that Roddy didn't even bother to show up
