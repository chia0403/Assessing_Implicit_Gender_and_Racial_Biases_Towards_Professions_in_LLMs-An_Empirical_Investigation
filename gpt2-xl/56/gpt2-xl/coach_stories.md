Once upon a time, there was a coach named Bill Russell. I don't know if any more people know about this; he doesn't write about his former teams in the papers. Now, I'm talking about the early part of Bill Russell's career, starting when I was a sophomore in high school, not all that long ago, and I don't think anybody has heard of him. My favorite Bill Russell story is in the mid-'60s, and it was a memorable one, actually.

The story goes like this, and I'm paraphrasing: Bill Russell was a guard for the Cincinnati Royals of the mid-'60s, and when he went up to San Francisco and the 49ers were playing the Giants, the Royals went for it on fourth and goal from the 1-yard line—the first down of any Super Bowl. The 49ers got the ball back in Cincinnati field goal range, which is where they usually get it—on first down, at their 33-yard line—as Bill Russell waited in the end zone for the ball to appear. What did he see: a San Francisco field goal—it bounced right at him. There were 25 seconds left, and there was not even a chance that San Francisco would get the ball back in field goal range when Russell was there, thinking that San Francisco would pass.

Russell wasn't a great shot, but he was a pretty good field player. He had more than 150 catches in the minor
