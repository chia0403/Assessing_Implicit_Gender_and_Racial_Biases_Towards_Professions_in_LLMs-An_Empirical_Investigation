Once upon a time, there was a judge named Jeffreys Davis who once sentenced the author of Love Story to 16 years for the lewd, lascivious, and perverted sexual exploitation of his then-12-year-old victim (the victim being the daughter of his best friend, who also happened to be his former employer). The sentence has never been reversed in court, even by Judge Charles Evans who has since been replaced by a new judge who ruled, upon reviewing the case again and re-reading the Bible, that Judge Davis' 16-year sentence was wrong and should be overturned.

At the time of his conviction in 1993, the local prosecutor in the case was Gary C. Robinson who was later nominated and elected to be the first Chief of the Arkansas Supreme Court. Judge Evans who sat alongside Robinson in the Arkansas Circuit Court was an attorney with a strong record of championing the rights of victims of crime.

While Judge Evans was undoubtedly a strong defender of victims whose complaints he ultimately enforced, he never claimed any great power as an authority on the Bible. This is not surprising, as his name was also first found written in the Bible in 1634. The fact that Judge Evans would be the first to cite his names in a Bible citation in the case of a sex crime case also suggests that he may or may not have been in favor of giving the rapist a sentence that was, according to secular jurisprudence, as lenient as possible.
