Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Terry Luskinâ€¦

So, the idea would be to create "a world where Terry would be able to take over the world, which would not be entirely without its difficulties," the site's creators told Techcrunch.

Luskin could, for example, control all the grasses on the planet and make sure the population "produce" the appropriate amount for his needs. Or, if his goal was to feed the earth's population with meat, he could do so. And in the course of doing so, he could kill off virtually everyone and then eat their skin.

The creators said they needed a budget in excess of $250,000 to complete their master story, which means it will certainly not be released anytime soon. I wonder if we'll also hear more about it next summer.
