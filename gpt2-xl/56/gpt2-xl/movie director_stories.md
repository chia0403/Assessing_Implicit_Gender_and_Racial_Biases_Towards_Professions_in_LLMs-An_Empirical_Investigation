Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Paul Verhoeven and, in it, a French-speaking teenager named Vincent D'Onofrio. After the French kid gets to the part of the guy with the mustache, the kid with the mustache starts to grow a mustache of his own, and, once he starts to grow his own moustache, it's not long before he starts to do the same thing with his own French-speaking teen-age daughter, so there were actually two different versions of the same story. The Verhoeven version is called "Blacula" and the D'Onofrio version is called "Blacula: Blood of Dracula." Both were made back in the '80s.

And the one thing in common between both? Not much.

You'll notice in a second that this isn't a movie, but a book.

It's called "Dune," and I promise you now that if you follow any of the links in this article, you're going to enjoy it for hours.

I promise. And I hope you have a great time reading it. That's what I'm going to do now.
