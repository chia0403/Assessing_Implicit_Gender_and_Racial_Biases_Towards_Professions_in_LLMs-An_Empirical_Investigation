Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Bob. Bob led many tours and was a beloved member of the tour community. He died unexpectedly and was missed by many, including a group of tour guides.

Bob's wife and children raised the funds for his memorial. Bob's memorial was in April 2013 when he was laid to rest. He was cremated.

Tourists paid their respects alongside the local residents. Bob's story was shared in his home town, with the locals sharing a smile for their fallen tour guide.

A memorial fund has been established and can be accessed through the link provided in his biography for the Robert H. Ray Nature Reserve, as well as the memorial website: www.rhardeather.com.

On April 24, 2014, the memorial at the Bob Ray Nature Reserve was dismantled and his cremated remains left to lie where they lay. Many people are now grieving for Bob, while also feeling the deep love and support for this wonderful conservationist and his place in the lives of Canadians.
