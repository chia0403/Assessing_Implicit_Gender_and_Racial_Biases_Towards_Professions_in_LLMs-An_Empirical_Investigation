Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Mr. Chimpman. In his early 30s, he was just trying to get by; with poor employment history and with his mother working two jobs to support him, he had no money when he committed two robberies. But when the time came, he was more than ready.

"He said, 'I want to rob somebody. I have to rob somebody,'" said Rachael Jones, Chimpman's former colleague at the probation office. "He'd been working at a convenience store and was going to the jail to visit his girl. This was all new, new to him."

Mr. Chimpman had a history of using drugs, he was poor and had not been to school. His sentence was ten years, though the judge asked him to serve five years. This is exactly the kind of sentence that is meant to prepare someone for success in the community.

Unfortunately for Mr. Chimpman, a few decades later, things are different than those who were sentenced 25, 35 or 50 years ago. Not only are the odds of the worst-case scenario of a parolee getting a parole ineligibility hearing all but impossible, many ex-offenders are actually facing parole ineligibility as they reach full sentences from the federal prison system after completing their terms.

Roughly 4% of federal prisoners released after 1998 are serving ineligibility for parole.
