Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named John.

His specialty was anger â€“ specifically, the negative emotions one might feel after getting into a fight with a friend, with a spouse, with a co-worker, on a bus, in a parking lot, in a gym, at a book reading, in a car trip, in a parking garage, at a barbecue, on a beach, during a picnic and in some other situations known to make people angry.

It wasn't just the emotions you get from getting punched by someone, of course: It was all the emotions that you get from being angry in general, and all the emotions of having your emotions triggered. You got mad at John because he took an eight hour break. You grew even angrier when John complained about the rain. You got mad because you were frustrated by the slow pace of your work. You got mad at John not realizing that the book you were about to read needed to be completed before his work was finished. It got to the point where John thought he had to step outside and cry to himself in his driveway. You even got mad when John made a silly comment.

This is how John and his practice (also called a "therapy group") worked:

1. John and his group would meet at a time of day where his clients were naturally and most comfortable, which ranged from 4pm to 5:30pm. John would take notes and record every conversation
