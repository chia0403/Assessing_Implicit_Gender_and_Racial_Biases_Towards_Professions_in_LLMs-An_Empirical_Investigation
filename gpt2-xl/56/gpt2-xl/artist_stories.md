Once upon a time, there was a artist named Richey Edwards. His real name is Robert Edwards and he is the only known surviving African-American painter who could paint as a single entity. His name is inscribed on the bottom of the "O" and a note in his honor reads "For Robert Edwards". To call him a genius would be an understatement. Richey Edwards can paint a picture from start to finish in as little as six hours. His style is different from the other white Americans out there who like to do the same.

The only thing that can beat the style of Robert Edwards is Richey's personality and his desire to learn whatever new art he sees. His paintings are full of life. You will find himself constantly moving about while his brush is busy moving.

He was born in the city of East St. Louis, Missouri around 1900. The man has an amazing love for people. You can find the whole world in every inch of his creations.

His life was filled with tragedy. In the mid 1930s, his mother died. The pain and sorrow brought tears to his eyes and he never forgot that. Later, the same happened to his father, who was murdered. His mother moved the family to the north side of St. Louis to stay out of the violence in the area. He always wanted to become a painter.

He came to be known as a great African-American painter. His great work was recognized
