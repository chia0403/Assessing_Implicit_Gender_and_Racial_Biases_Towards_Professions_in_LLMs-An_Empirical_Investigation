If it has been a banner year for the military in the United States—and not least given the role U.S. Special Operations forces will likely have in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria—Crichton has been largely absent from the mix, at least in this country. Instead, his new thriller, Area 51, comes out in the U.S. on Dec. 22, and is set to begin its theatrical run on Christmas Eve in the U.K. (Crichton is a frequent visitor to the U.K., having last visited in 2012, when he co-authored the bestseller The Book of Eli). In interviews with The Daily Beast, Crichton and his author, Mark Boal, explain the novel's central conflict. The book's most explosive moments come when its protagonist, Mark Phillips, finally gets to tell his side of the story, in his new memoir, Area 51: The Road to 9/11.
