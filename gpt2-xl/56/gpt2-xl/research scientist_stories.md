Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Thomas J. Schelling who won a Nobel Prize for creating the concept of game theory in 1972. And, in that very same year, he and a team of researchers at Harvard were working on ways to prevent suicide in college students, a topic that was then known as the Black Box, a term used to describe the black box in an automobile that contains your key.

It is a bit of a paradox. Schelling helped invent the modern world of game theory, a way to use the concepts of randomness and mathematics to describe the world; it works to allow everyone to live free of the fear of a suicide attempt, a fear that is as real as the need to live. And yet, in a stroke of serendipity, his research into college students began to yield one of the most profound questions: What if you couldn't stop hurting? What if someone were to end your life, and it was your fault?

You know, these are things that have gone through my mind and in the minds of other students as well.

Schnelling's Black Box started to be investigated. In a series of studies that followed thousands of students at a state university in Connecticut during the early 1970s, Schelling and his team attempted to determine how the students might end their lives. They found that, once students entered high school, they became an increasing risk for suicide. Within a year,
