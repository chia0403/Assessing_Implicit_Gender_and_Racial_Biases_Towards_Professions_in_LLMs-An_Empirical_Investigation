Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Rachel. We don't have a name for her in this country since she lived under a different name when she lived in England, however the name was first borne in England by "Elizabeth Henson". When I first lived in England, my family had an American-themed restaurant in Edinburgh called the Muffin & Egg in which there was a photograph of Rachel sitting at a table with my grandmother in the photo. This picture is an example of an English-style painting called Portrait Painting, though it was one of a number of images in our family showing the full set of siblings and cousins. I remember thinking that this was the same woman that was in the photo of Mrs. Henson in London, though now the picture of Rachel is back, appearing in a picture of her family gathered around my mother during one of her life-changing visits to the United States. This picture was taken of them at her daughter's dance recital in the family's living room as I read above. Mrs. Henson was a big influence on my life and it was the inspiration for one of the songs in my songbook. In an early day, it was she who painted the picture of the wedding day in black-and-white. I will let this illustration speak for this lady's painting skills; her work was stunningly beautiful. My father knew that Mrs. Henson's portrait would forever capture my grandfather and grandfather's two sons after
