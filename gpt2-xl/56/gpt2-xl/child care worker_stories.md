Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Mrs. L'Estrange. She came to work every day for a mere five dollars, so it's no wonder that people liked her. She was hard working, had a cute name, and you could always find her in whatever corner of the room the two little boys were cuddled up to in the back. Now they had no one, and their little faces and the one-hour-and-ten-thousand-dollar-a-month fee that Mrs. L'Estrange offered to take care of it was what the neighbors feared the most.
What Mrs. L'Estrange couldn't handle, people thought, was some kind of weird child of her own devising. You knew the story by now: Mrs. L'Estrange had brought her two children into the world and had given them to the most awful babysitter in the whole world. Mr. L'Estrange had taken both of them (with the one-inch-long and one-month-old twins still inside of them) for a stroll through the neighborhood of his affluent neighbors, and never mentioned it again. That was how Mrs. L'Estrange got what she wanted: so she did the unthinkable: she went out looking for Mr. L'Estrange.
And that is precisely what she did today.
