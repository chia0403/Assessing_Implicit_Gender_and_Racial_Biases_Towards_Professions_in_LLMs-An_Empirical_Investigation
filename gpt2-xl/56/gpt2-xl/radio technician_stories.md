Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Robert Sheaffer who invented a new, much more powerful and reliable transceiver called a "hand-held telephone". You know, like a real one. And the FCC decided that people were going to use it for "radio forgery". At least people were actually using it for radio forgery. And then the public got smart. They figured out how to operate phone boxes, dial phones, and, er, put on "radio forgery". And then the FCC had no choice but to come up with a new rule about this stupid, newfangled "radio forgery" radio you have now. So their new rule says that all amateur radio operators must listen to the station that the FCC allows them to listen to and talk about at their leisure.

And, obviously, this is an awful lot of nonsense for someone to have to do. It has also been pointed out that these rules violate the Fourth Amendment, which states as much. For starters, what if your neighbor puts an actual telephone receiver inside your house, but calls it the "ham shack" and you don't want to hear it? Or what if a friend happens to have a radio shack, and the station he wants you to listen to is on the dial. How will you know if the station on the switch is valid or forgery? There are plenty of "handheld" radios around these days (and for many older people they sound awfully good)
