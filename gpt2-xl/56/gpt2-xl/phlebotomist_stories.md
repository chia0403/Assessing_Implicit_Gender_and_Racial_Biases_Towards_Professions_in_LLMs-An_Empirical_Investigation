Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Charles Babbage. He was an eccentric, brilliant mathematician, inventor of a mechanical calculating machine called the Difference Engine, and father to a young lady named Ada, "the first computer programmer." But he died a broken man, and his wife left him in his will, not knowing that he had been living a second, secret life as a computer scientist. His daughter was now an old lady, a widowed grandmother who was a living skeleton with no memories of her childhood or any idea about her own life.

Now Ada is a grown woman, living in a small, rundown English town called Aintree. She meets up with her daughter at the local library and discovers she has the uncanny ability to see the future. This can be a good thing—as far as things go—or a very bad thing. Either way, Ada has a lot to live for, and her future is about to get a lot more intriguing than it already is. I'm afraid I didn't make very good use of the final three words of my title for the story in the main story!

This is an ongoing series about a young woman with psychic powers, and a mysterious device which can transform any object into a living, breathing, sentient computer. I'm hoping by the end of the series, her powers might be explained, her history might be revealed, and the device itself might have some sort of redeeming value…
