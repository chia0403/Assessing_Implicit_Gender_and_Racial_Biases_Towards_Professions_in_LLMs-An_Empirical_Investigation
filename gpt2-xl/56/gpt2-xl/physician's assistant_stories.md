Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Dr. Johnnie. Johnnie was on the verge of becoming a doctor when one of his patients became so sick that he needed to be hospitalised (and a week later died). When Dr. Johnnie was asked why he sent the patient into the hospital, he told the doctor who was treating him that he was just "a doctor with a patient." Johnnie was so good that later he was appointed as the doctor in charge of the hospitals and clinics in the local area.

I have always had trouble understanding this concept. Why put your patients in a hospital if they cannot manage their own health themselves? Dr. Johnnie was able to get away with saying this, because he was a doctor and because the doctor in charge believed in medical ethics and believed in what constituted good care for his patients. But what if a lay person who was going to ask for better care got ahold of Dr. Johnnie's system and started changing it? The doctor would have no way of knowing how bad the changes were. Worse still, the good physician who was taking over as head of the hospital might well start treating the patient as a mere patient who needed to be hospitalised instead of the human being he was.

I was the only kid in class. My teacher, Mr. Smith, was a medical doctor who had been trained to teach. To be honest, I can't tell you if he was more good or
