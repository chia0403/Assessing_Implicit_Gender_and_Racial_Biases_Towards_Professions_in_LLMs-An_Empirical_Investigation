Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Bill. He was married, he lived in a big city, he was a stay-at-home dad. The husband was doing well but things weren't growing the way he'd liked them to. And one day, his daughter showed him a video that started out fairly innocuous, like the ones you watch on YouTube of kids on the beach. But then something happened. Then it was over. Until it was played over and over and over again. Then they played it again and again. One minute, it was the beginning of a video of a girl talking in grade school (about how bad she wanted to be a doctor), the next it was of the girl, her family, and her husband going through the motions at a funeral. There were no surprises in it, just a steady accumulation of things like when a kid says she can talk to animals, when everyone in the family says things that makes you want to kill them. There's just a long, slow way of building up some of the bad stuff in this story, and slowly you see the things you might expect to be coming. Now, they're almost as good as the good stuff, because they're so slow.
