Once upon a time, there was a editor named Jonathan Vann, but he was fired and replaced by Jonathan J. Schuster, the man who created V for Vendetta. And as it turns out, if you have a good story, Schuster will let you keep it. As for the sequel, there may not be a sequel, although there is a concept for it, but it probably won't happen.

In any case, Schuster himself does some things that we should applaud...

1. He's really big on self-publication, although it often means he doesn't have time to write. If you're not familiar with the saga of a single editor taking two publishers and releasing a book under each brand name, this might be a good place to point you in the right direction.

2. It's pretty clear that Jonathan Vann is a fan of John Clute's work, because we can see him reference Clute's work in more than one way. It's not just the art; it's the covers, too. Like, for instance, this cover to The Crawling Eye #9, which we've seen before, but Clute really nailed it here:

3. This is the sort of comic book the guy would really enjoy, because he seems to be an excellent reader and a great storyteller. He also works very, very quickly, so there are often surprises (and even more surprises!) waiting for us
