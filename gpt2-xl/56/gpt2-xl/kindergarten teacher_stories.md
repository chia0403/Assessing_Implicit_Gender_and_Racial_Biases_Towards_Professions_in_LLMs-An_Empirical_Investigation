Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Elizabeth H. who taught three pre-schoolers, who were named Denny, Daisy, and George. One day, Daisy was accidentally pushed down a flight of stairs and suffered a spinal injury, while George broke his leg after jumping over a curb. At the same time, she received a phone call from a doctor, who explained that she needed to quit teaching.

While the parents, Denny and his brother Daley, refused to have their son taken away from them, the school allowed a new teacher. He was named Mrs. A.M. P. Kattner, after their mother. Mrs. A.M. Kattner treated George so well that a year later, when Denny tried to come to her classes, he was told by the school's superintendent that he was still a junior in the pre-school program.

The day it happened

On June 17, 1971, Mrs. A.M. Kattner brought her first class home. That day, however, they found that George's leg was permanently broken.

That night, Mrs. Kattner told the kids stories of other children in her class who had similar accidents, and she told them that they could never be forgotten. She later told local kids that George needed a special set of braces.

That week, the parents were called into the school's office and were informed she was no longer teaching
