Once upon a time, there was a singer named Lady Gaga. In an era that was rife with unapologetic self-obsession, she played her ugliest, most self-destructive material to a cheering audience of adoring fans. In doing so, she helped change our culture from one characterized by self-loathing to one that embraced and celebrated self-delusion.

She was everything you didn't want to be, without any of the benefits. She looked like a loser. She acted like a loser. She was boring, bland, and un-edgy.

Then one day, while performing a song known as "Paparazzi," she took a drink from her water bottle and passed out on the stage. The audience stopped booing. They cheered for her instead. The rest of her album was a collection of other people in the same position as herself, but she made them feel better about everything.

And that was so good, and so true.

We could also go ahead and rename the year 2016, right here in the UK. It's not "The Year of Lord, the Last, and Most Desperate," because while David Cameron did try to hold the throne, he certainly wasn't the last. It's also not 2015, because the internet still doesn't realize that there's a world outside of them. No â€“ rather, it's the Year of Lady Gaga, The Year of the Queen of All
