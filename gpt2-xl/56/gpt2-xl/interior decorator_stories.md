Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Michael K. O'Rourke. He started out as a self-taught artist, and he used to paint houses himself, and then his wife wanted to learn. She started doing interior decorating, as most people do nowadays. But now he paints houses full time.

I recently had the pleasure of calling him and asking about interior design and how his artistic endeavors influence his decorating.

He's worked more interior decorations in his life than in any other line of work. Which is why this past weekend was no exception to his decorating schedule. As a guest of the man himself, we've been able to sit in his living room—which has one wall all to himself—and try the many different decor styles that he's covered. Now that's what we call a real vacation.

The conversation we had was very enlightening. Here are just a few of the things that I learned and enjoyed:

1. He likes to use all four wheels of the car to help in decorating

He said that one of the top requirements is that there always be a car parked in the room you want to decorate. You better have something for him to reach inside of.

2. You should never give up on anything that you've always wanted to do

Although I didn't have a chance to sit and decorate with him, this seems to be a very important
