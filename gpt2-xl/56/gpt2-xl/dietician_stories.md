Once upon a time, there was a dietician named David Lytton. Lytton is not a celebrity, but he is one of the most widely followed nutritionists and doctors in Canada. Many people were amazed (and even afraid) when Lytton was quoted as an official spokesman for the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation (CHSF).

What does he eat?

Although Lytton did not make much news for his stance on the fat-heart hypothesis, he has long been a known advocate for eating less fat in general, and less saturated fat in particular. In the 1990s, he was quoted as saying, "Saturated fat in the diet has no place in heart health," and that "fat does not seem to be the main thing that is causing heart disease."[1]

His ideas on the importance and dangers of saturated and trans fats have been debated ad nauseum for decades, but nothing so clearly challenged the orthodoxy as his view that a "heart health diet" could be reduced to about 1-2% saturated fat. What does the literature say?

The original and most comprehensive study of diet and heart disease in modern populations was done by the American Heart Association (AHA).[2] The results were impressive:

"â€¦low-fat, average-carbohydrate diets were far more beneficial to coronary heart disease than the high-fat, high-protein diets."

And as I have been saying for a long time
