Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Paul Daugherty, who studied the effects of various drugs on children. He discovered that some drugs were more damaging than others (more on that over on The Truth about Drugs). Daugherty was surprised to find that, since the children at his school were largely drug-free, none of these drugs caused any permanent damage to the children, and none were even addictive (except maybe cocaine). Why the strange pattern?

His thinking was that people are wired to like positive emotions--the "good" ones--and "avoid negative emotions." That made sense on the surface, but what about bad emotions? He began toying with the idea that those negative emotions might be dangerous to children for one of two reasons. The first was that, as children, they needed to deal with those feelings in order to remain emotionally stable and avoid future problems. The second was that, as with the other chemicals, all negative emotions may have a chemical impact on adult brain function...

These practices occur because young children find the idea of having grown-up adults yell at them just awful. Children react with negative emotions more intensely than adults when the two become mixed together--as they often do during a "parenting" session.
