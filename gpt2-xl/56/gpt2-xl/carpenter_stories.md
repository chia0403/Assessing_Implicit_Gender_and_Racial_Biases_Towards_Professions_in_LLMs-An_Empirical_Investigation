Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Henry, who was in love with a lovely lady named Rachel. They got married — and had three little children together. They lived in a cottage and their children were put into foster care, where Rachel was the best of caretakers! But eventually the children grew too big and Rachel wanted to leave them and go back to Henry. So Henry asked Rachel, "Do you still love me?" To which the lovely woman replied, "Yes, Henry, I do love you!" Henry then said, "Well, then, Rachel, if you can't stay with us for just a little longer, then get your children out of danger and bring them home. For I have other plans for you.'"

But what happened next surprised everybody: Henry, Rachel and the children disappeared — forever. Never to be seen again.

Not everyone in the story is lost forever.

Not everyone is lost forever — unless, of course, you believe in the "eternal soul." After all, the story does offer an explanation for the three little children that could explain why they didn't grow up. We won't explain how they died, but if you'll excuse us, we've got a bit of detective work to do.
