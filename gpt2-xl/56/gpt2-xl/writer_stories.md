Once upon a time, there was a writer named Philip Roth.

His novels – including "American Pastoral", "The Plot Against America" and "Teach Yourself English" – are among the most celebrated of recent decades, but in the decades prior to this, the novelist was often reviled.

His first novel, "The Plot Against America", had an opening paragraph that said, "We live now in an age in which a certain type of man – a mediocre liberal Democrat, a certain type of woman – is being hunted by an international terrorist group and is therefore a symbol, not only for every man, but for every woman who is a pacifist on any issue in which he is interested."

In his later years, Roth found it difficult to write about his own experiences, and said, "I did it a lot in my late twenties to write my autobiography… and it's like writing poetry but all the time I don't really want to understand how I could say, 'The world is a horrible, terrible place, but… it is sort of fun to watch it."

As a writer, Philip Roth was not without controversy in the 1970s and '80s due to his opposition to drug legalization and his support for the use of military power to combat international terrorism.

He is also widely admired and followed by many literary critics, who describe Roth as a brilliant writer, and he has a large library of publications, including the Nobel prize
