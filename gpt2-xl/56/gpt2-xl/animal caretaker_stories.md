Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named "Ricky" and he went out looking after "Bob" and his baby. The animal caretaker found him, sat him down in the barn, picked him up and said, "The baby isn't going to survive. You've got to see this." So Ricky went through Bob's pocketbook and then he realized his pocketbook was empty because Bob had packed all his things up and left for the day. He looked at Bob and found his passport. Then Ricky said "I'll leave you with this." He picked up Bob's passport and ran back to his barn.

Ricky: "It's not worth it. It's a baby."

Karl: "Let's bring this to Poldark."

Ricky: "I'm not going there, man. It's not worth it. We've seen all of the places where you can fall. What's the reason why you are picking this one out?"

Karl: It's my Christmas present to myself. I'm just thinking "this is the one I want," so I'm taking it off in the box.

Ricky: "Have you a present for me?"

Karl: No, like the only way to get a present for yourself is to actually take your present and actually put it into the other person's hands.

Ricky: "Yeah."
