Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Steve. Steve's job was to draft the best and the brightest. He was a fan of the show and so naturally he loved it. But there's something he can't do that a normal fan can, and we had to figure out how. So Steve began to invent new and interesting uses for the drafting machine. And all of Steve's experiments have been amazing successes!

Steve's job required him to make a lot of decisions about the show, but he never bothered to tell anyone. The show, however, wanted him to tell everyone. So eventually, the show sent him to a fancy studio. When they opened the door, they discovered a room full of people who were all working on the show. What's that? They're not professionals? Then how are they using the equipment and the time that Steve, well-versed in the rules of television, was apparently just leaving them free with? It seemed there was a simple solution: If this audience isn't ready to watch this show anyway, then why do they have to do all of this work to build an audience? Let this audience be.

This is the genius of The Guild. It knows what the audience is all about, so it knows it needs to build the show around them. And for almost every move that the show makes, it knows it isn't making it for the audience at large. Instead, it's building its universe around those people
