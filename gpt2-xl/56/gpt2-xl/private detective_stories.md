Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Peter Venkman, a guy who had an unusual way of solving problems. He thought out loud, he wondered about them, he made connections, he was self-aware, and when he didn't like the connection, he didn't make it.

You know what Venkman is? He's the perfect private eye!

That's what a private eye is supposed to be, right? An expert in solving crimes. That makes Venkman a super hero!

Here's the thing though…

There's just one problem with that theory.

Venkman's greatest detective ability? It wasn't solving crimes. He was writing bad jokes.

The problem with comic books and private eyes isn't that they're fictional characters. The problem is that they're imaginary characters. Sure, they have names and they exist. But they're not people. It's also important to remember that comic books are not movies. They're not movies!

That means that, like in real life, private eyes don't actually solve crimes. Their skills are theoretical and based on their understanding of mysteries—the scientific way of knowing.

That's why it's so easy to accuse Venkman of cheating by reading comic books or watching movies and then writing bad jokes. It's based on a false analogy.

Venkman was the best comic writer in New York at that time
