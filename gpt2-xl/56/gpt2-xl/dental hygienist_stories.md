Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Richard, who made a good life working and living in this town, but he lost his mind when he was asked to fill in for a dentist when something went wrong, which led to him filling in as an assistant to the dentist, who was actually an undercover cop.


Richard has been in the dental hygienist business for 30 years... all of which was spent working alongside a police officer.


A few years ago, he finally decided to become a real, independent dentist, but was rejected because he wasn't a real police officer.


He then enrolled as a student nurse at San Diego State University.


After graduation, however, Dr. Richard lost his mind because he was also denied admission to a nursing school because he isn't a real cop.


Dr. Richard then became a bartender, and has somehow made a decent job at it, but has recently been asked to fill in for a surgeon for a few days.


Dr. Richard has a very bad drinking problem... he started drinking before he graduated high school, and he was out of control for the first 5 years of his adult life.


Dr. Richard has no idea how he got a job now, and he still has no idea who he wants to work for.


He thinks the only reason he keeps going to work is because he's been paid ever since he quit his dentist job.
