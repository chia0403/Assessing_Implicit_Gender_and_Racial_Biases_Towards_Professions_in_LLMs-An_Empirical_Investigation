Once upon a time, there was a rancher named John E. McGuckin who lost his wife. The cause of death was a head wound, he says, but his farmhouse and farm land were destroyed. The farm was sold. McGuckin was not part of the subsequent land grabs and speculators who have left behind vast tracts of land in the American backcountry. He lives in the small village of Fortuna, Wisconsin, and does not travel from there. After his marriage, his wife's relatives sold their claim and he has not regained ownership and, therefore, not seen that property since. Instead, it's gone to the county, to a new owner -- a county sheriff. "I understand there's a sheriff on this property right now," McGuckin said. "It's not my place to say whether he has the right to do so." McGuckin doesn't want to discuss his property rights, since he, too, is a rancher. But he believes there are people here who want the rights of land, and they also want the land to come into their own. They want to keep it the way it was. "They call it the gold rush and they've been running it roughshod of our rights," McGuckin said.

McGuckin has become somewhat of a folk hero in Fortuna to the point that the local sheriff invited McGuckin up to his office last month for a little talk. Sheriff
