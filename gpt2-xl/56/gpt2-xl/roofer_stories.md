Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Ben, who used to be a roofing contractor. One day, a customer came to him with a case of flat-tea, and a roofing problem. This was his dream job in the roofing industry, and he wanted to start as soon as possible.

Ben had been a roofer for 20 years, and he used to be very good. His roofing crew was so good that they used to do it all the time. They would go to Ben's house and he'd tell them what to do, and the roofing job would only cost about 6 dollars.

So what happened?

Ben started to do more work than he felt he was qualified to, because he wanted it to pay as well as he was going to make it. He started spending more money on "rent" than his crew could do. That's when the roofers stopped going out to his house, because when he wasn't at their side, things would go badly.

After a while, he stopped going to work as a roofer. He got a job as a roofer to pay rent.

Ben had one of those jobs that a lot of Americans have to do â€“ work at another person's house. For Ben's people, the job was worth it. There was a lot of money involved to be made. A part of that was getting the roofing work done at a good time
