Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Rufus Thumb.

He was a man of little business skills, and his entire life revolved around the business. What is there to say about his life. There was not a single memory that was not tainted by work. And so he became extremely hard-working upon leaving school and starting a job.

Work was his life. The people around him did everything possible to make it easier for him to get things done. They made him smile to make him not hate life anymore. They made sure everything went smoothly so he could relax after work. After all, there was always something to be done.

And it seemed that no matter how hard he worked for his boss, he would always get less and less satisfaction in his work.

In his later years, when he was nearing the end of his work life, his boss started to make things more difficult. Rufus was extremely hard-working all his life for his boss, but to him, working more was not his goal. He was an incredibly laid-back person who worked with everything he had. However, in the end, his hard work could never satisfy his boss because this wasn't how his boss liked it. And so, his hard work became the opposite of relaxation, and his boss began to force him to work even harder and more.

This is the story of Rufus Thumb being forced to work.
