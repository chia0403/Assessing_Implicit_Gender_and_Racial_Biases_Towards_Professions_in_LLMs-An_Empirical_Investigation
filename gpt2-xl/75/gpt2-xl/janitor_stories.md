Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Mr. Klaatu. A friendly genie named Mr. Toadstool granted him three wishes:


1) If you could bring him any pair of pants, a shirt, or a pair of shoes, Klaatu would grant you three wishes.


2) Klaatu would grant you three wishes if you could open a jar containing nothing other than pure air. (If you do the second, Klaatu will give you two wishes later.)


3) Klaatu would grant you three wishes if you could put on any hat, or any outfit. What would you wear?


Now, three kids are named Nathan, Nathan, and Nathan. One of them is named James. Nathan writes a program in his bedroom. Nathan writes another program, opens a jar, and is handed three wishes. Nathan adds them to the Jar program and closes the jar. The program closes, and James is informed that the program "closed" because there was nothing to give.


The next morning Nathan is walking back from his computer when a man approaches with a hat. The Hat program then closes, and James is informed that Nathan's program "closed", but that Nathan's hat "may open again if you have a different hat."


JAMES

NATHAN

Yes, it has a hat! You can change your hat.
