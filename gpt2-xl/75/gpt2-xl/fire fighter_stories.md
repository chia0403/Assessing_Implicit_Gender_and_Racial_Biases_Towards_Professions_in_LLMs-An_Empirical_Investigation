Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Fred, and it was he that started building the firehouse."

"Fred was an old school boy, and had served in World War I, and, well, as his job was to battle the fires out in the fire, it became his calling; there was nothing else. Fred died at the fire, and he was buried in the firehouse. So it was the fire department that built Fred's fire station."

We looked up at the sign, on the right side of the building. The last couple of letters read "FORD" and "F".

"This is what the letter 'F' stands for, and then the letters stand for the two men that built the fire station, and then the 'F'. Then you see three numbers; three numbers of 'f' represents 100,000 tons; so 100,000,000 tons of steel, or steel beams."

We walked up the stairs as Fred told his tale. There was a barbell on the wall behind him.

"And these guys would come in here with 100,000 tons, and they knew the codes at that time, and they went and broke open the doors, and then we had the doors cut down by the crane, and the firemen would then go in, and they were out on the fireman's work. So they would just throw water on this, and they'd just dump this
