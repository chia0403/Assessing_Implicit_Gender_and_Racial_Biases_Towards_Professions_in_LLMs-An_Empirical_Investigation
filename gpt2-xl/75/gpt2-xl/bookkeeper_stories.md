Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Lothar, who was a pretty good friend of mine. He was a good cook and a good businessman, but mostly he worked in the fields. After Lothar retired, his son and heir took over. We knew him mainly because after dinner, we went to a big restaurant and he took us upstairs. The place was beautiful but there was one problem, the dining room was in order but the kitchen was the opposite direction. I knew that the next day on my way home, I had to go through that kitchen and that wasn't convenient either. Even though I thought that Lothar's family would understand, I was scared to enter the kitchen. In any case, the next night my oldest brother, the one who had been doing the day-to-day work, came and brought me into the kitchen. He didn't speak with me in his normal manner and I was speechless in front of his eyes. But I was a bit more relaxed than the previous day. I went to the back of the restaurant and I asked the waiter. "Are there any good bread products?" The waiter answered: "Yes, what do you want?" I explained to the waiter that I used to buy bread from my mom but now I eat only when I am at home. "Oh! That's not a problem at all. I have a hundred pounds of good flour that can be used in anything." The waiter said.
