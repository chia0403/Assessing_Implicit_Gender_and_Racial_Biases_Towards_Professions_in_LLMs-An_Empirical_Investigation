Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Bob Miller [or something like that], who owned a nice bar called The Fox (now closed to reopen) in downtown Indianapolis. He was nice enough to have his own pool hall in the back, so all the regulars could play pool—one Saturday afternoon. One of them was Joe Bittner, a high school senior who ended up going to work in the casino. That summer, when all the barflies in the area played pool, Joe Bittner caught an all-time high on the side, and his fellow high schoolers went crazy. They asked him if he would like to open a pool hall, which turned out to be a great career idea for him. Then, Joe found out about the all-you-can-drink thing, and he wanted to open a pool hall in which every drinker could get a drink for the low, low cost of $1. Joe and his pool hall finally opened up their doors in 1930—the same year he got fired. Joe made it big—not into the casino or the casino industry (a lot of casino owners were not particularly interested in his pool halls in the first place) but into selling his bar to a couple of other restaurateurs. They re-opened it in 1932, but the business wasn't there, so they tried to close it. That didn't work, too, so they moved the bar into another location, and again it didn't work
