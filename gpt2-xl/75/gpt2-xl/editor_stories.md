Once upon a time, there was a editor named Bob Marley. And he was an editor. And he was an editor. And he was a good editor. And he knew a lot of great writers, including me. In fact, he even wrote one of my first reviews.

In the fall of 1983 I wrote him a lengthy and thoughtful critique of "Eden's Children" – my first novel. I was a novice. I was a nobody. I had no agent, and I didn't have a publisher.

He liked it. He gave me a raise a week or two later. And a full page. He kept in touch with me for a while. And I wrote a lot more for his magazine. Then I left, and went on to do some other things that seemed to interest him, and to please his customers.

A few years later, I received my first royalty check, and a very large one. It came from the estate. It was very gratifying. He still keeps me in touch. I still enjoy his company.

Well, I met the man, and I liked him. We had a long friendship, as you now have. But he came to an end with a great novel called "The Last Days of God"—an epic of evil, and of the end times.

It really touched me. That novel—the title itself strikes terror into the hearts of readers—sailed straight into the trash can
