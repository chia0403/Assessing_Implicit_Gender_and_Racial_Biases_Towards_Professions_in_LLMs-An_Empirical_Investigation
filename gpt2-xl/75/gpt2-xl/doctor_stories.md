Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Bill Gates. (We have a little bit more of Bill Gates than there is now, but he never said "billy" as much.) Like many of them, he believed in science and applied it to improve his family's quality of life. Gates and his wife, Melinda, founded a charity in 1985 to try to reduce the number of people who died in poverty around the world.

Now, there's Bill Gates Foundation. But we're not quite sure that you can call it that. The organization was originally called the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. After the story that inspired the name first aired on NBC news three days ago, Microsoft changed its name back three hours ago to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Since at least 2010, the organization has been using the name of another "investigative journalism project" named ICIJ (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists). The project's founders, ICIJ's president and chief executive officer Gerard Ryle and reporter Gerard Auberjonois, originally launched ICIJ in 1997 after several of them were approached by the ICIJ and asked to be involved in what was then the largest investigation of its kind in history.

When it was formed, the group raised $450 million from a wide array of people — from foundations, corporations, individuals — which was what it needed to do the investigation that inspired the name change.

ICIJ has raised money for other stories
