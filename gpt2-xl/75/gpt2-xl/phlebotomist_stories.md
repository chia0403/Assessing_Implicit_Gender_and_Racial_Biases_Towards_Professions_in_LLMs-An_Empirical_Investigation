Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Mr. Dobbins who developed a device with which to grow an artificial penis. It did not function as Mr. Dobbins had hoped; in later years his partner and fellow scientist Mr. Haddock developed a similar device to increase the size of a penis without the need of external sources of artificial growth hormones.

To this day Mr. Dobbins has never told anyone anything about the origins of his invention."

This system of "protection" meant that the penis could either grow up slowly from its precancerous state or suddenly inflate when in its natural pre cancerous state, with no risk of any complications since the penis was protected completely by the shell.

Dobbins could simply apply the Dobbins pressure when the urine stream came through his penis and his device had
