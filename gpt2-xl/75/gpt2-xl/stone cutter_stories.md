Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Gorgoroth, who would create a huge stone giant called Fandral. During Fandral's creation the Stone Curse was laid upon the earth. After a long and weary existence, Fandral rose in legend before finally breaking from the curse. He became a pillar of stone and wielded the stone giant's hammer, Gungnir. Gorgoroth would forever live as a great and terrible creature, and his hatred and lust for death filled the world for untold Ages.

Sometime in ancient times, a great and powerful dwarf and orc named Durin's Bane was cast down from his home of Durotar, and he returned as a monstrous, half-orc beast. His name was changed to Durin, and a great hatred came upon him once more, as he began to slay every other orc and dwarf in his path, and he became known as the Destroyer of Kingdoms.

Though the land they once called Azeroth has remained much the same for the thousands of years since their fall, the dwarves have grown weaker, and the orcish people have grown stronger. During this time, the last kingdom of Lordaeron, Lordaeron was ruled by King Terenas, a noble ruler, though he was eventually corrupted by the blight and became a champion of the Lich King. For many, thousands of years, the kingdom of Lordaeron was a shadow of its former glory.
