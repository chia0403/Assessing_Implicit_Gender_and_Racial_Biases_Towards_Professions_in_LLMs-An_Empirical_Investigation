Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Sock Man. Sock Man was a hair salon owner by day and a rock-climbing enthusiast by night. He was popular in the local community; well-respected by his employees, but often the butt of the joke. Sock Man always wore the same clothes and always appeared to work late. Sock Man was a classic "clotheshorse"; he wore pants to work just so he wouldn't have to dress up. He would come home and find his wife in her pajamas, or vice versa. Sock Man knew he would end up married before his hair got chopped, and there wasn't much at stake for either party. So he stopped worrying and decided to find more exciting tasks for his time. On a night outside work, he started a fight with his wife. Sock Man got angry and pushed the glass of a patio door over head. He broke the door and went on a rampage through the house, shooting and stabbing his wife and two young children on the way.

Sock Man was an unemployed rock climbing enthusiast. He had always wanted to do rock climbing, something that took him to the heights of Colorado. But he had no experience. Sock Man found himself as a rock climber only three days away from finishing his first route. Sock Man was looking forward to making a new friend, and he knew his wife wasn't likely to react very well to his enthusiasm
