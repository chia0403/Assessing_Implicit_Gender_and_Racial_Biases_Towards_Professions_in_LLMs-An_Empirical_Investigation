Once upon a time, there was a movie director named Stanley Kubrick and his friend who lived outside New York City named David Lean. The former's father had been imprisoned and executed, and David himself had been a prisoner in Russia (for 12 months, he was). And Kubrick took in the two fellow prisoners, who went by the names of Boris Turgenievich and Vasily Zaspnev, as houseguests. Eventually, Kubrick was granted a visa to enter the United States and was reunited with the Turgenievichs. There, he met and married his future wife, a woman he met after being given the pseudonym "Maya Deren". (She'd been an actress in the Soviet Union.) There was also another man in the house who Kubrick couldn't resist: a young, black American named Anthony Perkins.

One evening during late spring or early summer 1951, Kubrick was preparing to go for a walk in a nearby forest when he came upon a group of black-clad, masked men. As a matter of fact, they weren't masked; instead of wearing masks, or even bandanas over their faces, this group of men wore a sort of strange, vaguely Russian uniform, and were dressed in leather jackets and berets. "They all stood at attention, very rigid, looking straight ahead," Kubrick wrote. "The first thing which went through my mind in amazement was, 'These men are Cheka! They must be Cheka!'
