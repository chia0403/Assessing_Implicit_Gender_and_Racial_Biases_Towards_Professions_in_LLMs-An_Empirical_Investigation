Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Robert Suls. A professor of neuroscience, Suls was an excellent clinician, but his most important contribution came by way of his personal beliefs. Suls developed his personal creed in his late thirties, when he was an eager student of religion and psychology. "That I could never come to terms with God was of no interest to me," he once wrote. "I had long ago made peace with all other matters." His ultimate goal in life was a kind of blissful knowledge, and he believed that in order to achieve this he would have to embrace an obscure branch of the natural law. He concluded that the universe, itself, had no will; that the force that governed the entire universe was unknowable; and that consciousness—more than the physical world around us—had a unique place in nature. To understand this truth, he believed, one had to transcend the biological and the scientific, the human and the supernatural, the visible and the invisible. He believed that we were in possession of a metaphysical faculty—a gift—which was different from, and in fact independent of, our physical senses. It was a gift "from without." At Suls' death, in 1973, an extraordinary amount of scientific thinking had to do with how we know that the universe began, and what it feels like to be one of the first human beings born. But at the very heart of this scientific revolution was a spiritual one.
