Once upon a time, there was a painter named B. F. Skinner who created a model for how people learned and thought and built a theory around that. When the scientist George Beadle came up with the "operant conditioning" model, he had the same type of insight, but it didn't lead him to the same conclusion about how children learn. His goal was to show that if you place a rat in a cage and have it receive electric shocks until either it becomes aggressive or gives a response, by the time the rats reaches maturity—about 18 months, or just over two generations—it will learn how to become aggressive. For Skinner, if something has been working really well has only one of two outcomes: it will stop working or change. It can't both. It does, to one extent or another, both. It's a very simple model, and yet it completely overturned so many preconceived notions about learning. It changed how we thought about thinking, how we thought about the mind, and what the mind was.

There's nothing complicated about learning that doesn't involve reinforcement, doesn't even involve biology. You are rewarded for doing something. That's how we learn to behave.

I started reading about Pavlov's rats, learning to associate food with a jolt of electricity and shock. I was astounded, intrigued by what had been taught to me in my childhood, and still has. I started to wonder about the mechanism that caused this
