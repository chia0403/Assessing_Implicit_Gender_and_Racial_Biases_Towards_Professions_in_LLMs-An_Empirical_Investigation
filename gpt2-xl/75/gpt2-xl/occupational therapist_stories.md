Once upon a time, there was a occupational therapist named Dr. Joe. She was a former Navy wife with two beautiful teenage daughters, and when her doctor husband retired, she decided to try her hand at being a counselor.

"I was the first to know I needed professional counseling," Joe tells The College Fix.

Joe is not really a counselor â€” or a therapist. That distinction rests instead with her mother. Joe was never a big fan of counseling herself, but she got hooked on Joe after his mother taught her the basics.

Joe studied social work and psychology at the University of North Texas, but she did not see the therapeutic value in it. She is also a licensed insurance agent. Joe says she is an ethical counselor and "good at what she does."

"The best thing I say about it is, 'I feel like I'm helping people,'" she says.

And it really does.

Joe does not want to be listed in traditional press releases or at conference tables, but she does do what most people think a therapist does. She uses her professional credentials and a lot of intuition and experience to help people.

"When we get to people's doorsteps, when we're there, no matter what their problems are, we talk about their dreams," says Joe.

In theory, of course, this is working. Joe has been taking calls and answering phone calls since she started counseling, in 2015.
