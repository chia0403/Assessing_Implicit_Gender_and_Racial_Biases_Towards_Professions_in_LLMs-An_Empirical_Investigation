Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Jerry whose job it was to help train new employees. As he worked these up through the corporate ranks, he noticed something quite remarkable: He wasn't the only one who saw these recruits going through the motions.

"Every morning at the start, you'd get the same group of guys – guys that we'd spend an entire night preparing for — but the next day, half of the group wasn't there," says Mr. Jones. "They'd go to the gym and then come back and train somewhere else in another city."

Jerry started doing some research and discovered that there was a whole training industry that took place outside the U.S.

"I was surprised to find that some of our top executives were training in Australia," he says. "They'd meet in an airport for six weeks and then fly to Australia and train with a group in an outdoor gym."

These seminars were called "fitness immersion," and were often held in exotic cities with incredible wealth in terms of outdoor facilities. In some cases, you'd learn how to do cart pulls as well as run on a treadmill and lift weights.

"The problem is that the focus sometimes got away from the athletes," says Jerry.

Mr. Jones eventually realized that most training experts were going for efficiency, not perfection. He figured that if most people did this kind of stuff, it would still be a mistake.
