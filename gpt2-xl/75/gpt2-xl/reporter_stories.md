Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Bill Clinton who was on his way to a public event. The reporter was approached by a young woman who he thought to be quite attractive, but as the day went on, the reporter took notice of who this woman actually was. Bill noticed that she seemed to be younger than their other subjects. He looked her over, and he noticed that she had a strange tattoo somewhere on her forearm.

"Hey, what's up with your baby girl? What's this little thing called a Mockingbird on your forearm? Is it a symbol to you or something?"

At this point Bill Clinton must have been aware of whatever symbol this woman had. It was obviously not something he was going to talk to the reporter about. He wanted to go talk to the other subjects on the panel.

So Bill Clinton was now back at the lectern and talked with the reporters about his "baby girl's" Mockingbird tattoo.

He's not going to answer the questions, but at this point, he does point out that the Mockingbird was actually part of a tattoo on the woman's arm and not an actual symbol. To this day, he has never actually told anybody about this strange tattoo. It is still in the news and is still covered up!

Bill Clinton was never on the cover of Playboyâ€¦ he never posed in front of a girl with a tattoo on her arm, not ever!
