Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named John Derbyshire who said this, in 2008 or 2007, that he used to think people were stupid. Which is so unoriginal, and so unoriginal in the sense that Derbyshire is actually saying that to the people that he is comparing to his stupidity, that it's even more unoriginal than it normally is, because these people actually have the intelligence to be very smart to the point that they have been able to out-smart even themselves, it was even worse until people started to get smart.

Well, then came the year 2001 and in 2001 somebody got wise, or perhaps some people were not so smart as they thought they were, but we get to the point now where they're trying to figure out how to put back the stupid that happened before. This is what you call "backing up the intelligent" where the intelligence lost when the computer programmer said, "Well, I was stupid before because I was trying to write software that somebody else wouldn't use." Now these programmers have realized that these other people with their software don't actually use it, so they're taking back the intelligence that was lost.

Which sounds to me like if somebody took back the intelligence that was lost by writing a software program that nobody wanted, would you accept that as a rational outcome, that it would make sense and this would be a good thing? I can't say the smart people actually need to be educated to
