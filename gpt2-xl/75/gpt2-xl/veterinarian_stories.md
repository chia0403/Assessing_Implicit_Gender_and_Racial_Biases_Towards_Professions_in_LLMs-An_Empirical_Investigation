Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Frank Vitaro. Frank had a lot of issues. Frank believed that he could heal animals.

He wasn't wrong.

However, Frank was extremely inexperienced when it came to dealing with animal diseases. Frank did not have a lot of experience in treating animals, but that didn't stop him from treating animals. It also didn't stop him from putting his patients in excruciating discomfort for the sake of performing surgery.

That has all changed.

A few years ago, he learned about a group that was trying to bring this information to the field.

I am a part of this group, and I'm passionate, passionate about bringing healing to animals.

While I may not be a licensed medical doctor, I do have a background in animal nutrition, but the first thing you should know about me is that I've cared for many animals since they were little babies.

I know just how amazing it feels to open your heart to a little baby animal who just needed a little loving. It's one of the main reasons I started my own clinic. The animals I help give my life's work are so worth it.

However, when you care for animals, there is no better feeling than the one animals who are given a second chance at life have.

Please help us to continue to provide healing for the people who are less fortunate and help us bring healing to animals.
