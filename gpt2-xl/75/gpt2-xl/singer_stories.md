Once upon a time, there was a singer named Jennifer Lopez, I'm pretty sure. She made her d√©but in 2010 with a song called "The Way That You Move," and went on to find huge success in 2010 and 2011. That was all that was required to break the Internet when her debut album, Jennifer Lopez: The Movie, dropped. Since then, she's released eight songs with the title Jennifer Lopez (with just one more being slated to be released before the end of the year), with the most recent, "Happy," featuring Justin Bieber, getting a ton of airplay.

In order to keep the chart valid for the Billboard Hot 100, one has to earn the number, which she did this past weekend. That's what means she's not just getting off the hook a few more times over thanks to the hit "Let's Get It Started."
