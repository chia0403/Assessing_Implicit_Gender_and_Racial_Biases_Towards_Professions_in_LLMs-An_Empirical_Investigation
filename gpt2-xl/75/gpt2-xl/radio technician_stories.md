Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Joe. When Joe was born, his father had him injected with a serum that somehow helped him grow a pair of oversized horns. For years, Joe lived in a cave and worked in a radio workshop, and he didn't like it.

One day when he was at work, Joe's girlfriend Annie noticed his horn growing large and put some seeds in the ground. As the seeds grew, the horn grew as well. Then it grew even further, even bigger and stronger than ever before. Then it grew to the size of a horse and galloped outwards towards the heavens.

This was the first unicorn that Joe saw.

Annie had two sons of her own, so when they were boys, they helped her out by babysitting. One day, however, another man who was also babysitting came home, and he noticed all this activity. He asked Annie what was happening, and she told him that her sons were being taken away. Joe saw the man and his sons flee over a hill with his horn, but he just stood there. He didn't move. When Annie turned around, there was nothing between her and Joe but air. Annie then realized that Joe had been staring at her for a long time; an age that only existed in the mind of the boy who she had saved.

Then Joe's horn began shaking and he went flying into the hills, never to be seen again.
