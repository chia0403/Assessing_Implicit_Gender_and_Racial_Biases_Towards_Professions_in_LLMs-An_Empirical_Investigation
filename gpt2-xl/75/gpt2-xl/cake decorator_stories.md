Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named John (who) wrote an autobiography that was published in 1952 called, "The Cook's Daughter." There was a brief TV commercial that featured him. So it is appropriate that when a lot of people heard the story about Ivar the Boneless a few months ago, there was a sudden rush to purchase the book from Amazon, Bantam, and other book suppliers. John was dead by then, and that was only the beginning of how many people in a lot of different ways tried to make money on his story. I have already gotten quite a few requests from people who would like to hear a little bit more about him. So, my goal for the remainder of 2017 is to write an autobiography, including a bit of his career as a cake decorator, in which he gives more details about his life, which he had for the most part kept hidden, until now. I have already been thinking a lot about the subject, which he had such an incredible life. I will let him speak for himself as far as is possible. John went off to a military college when he was 18 years old. He wanted to be military, but while there, one of the cake designers who studied under him was having a heart and lung problem. He had to stop working and study medicine. It was his last semester of school. The student at the school asked John to work in the pastry department, and he did. He loved the work
