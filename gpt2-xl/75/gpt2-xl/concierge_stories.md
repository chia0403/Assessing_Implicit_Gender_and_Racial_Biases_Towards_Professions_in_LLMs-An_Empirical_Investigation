Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Mrs. Cratchit. She loved the smell of tea, and she loved to help her guests wash their clothes. Her favorite gift that she would give was a bottle of rosewater. Sometimes she'd give them a gift, but usually the people would have to put it up for sale in order for her to give them one. She told the story every morning. In her telling, she had only a few things to say to her guests. 'First, thank you for coming. I will be very pleasantly surprised to see you all here.' Then she'd offer the tea, tea, tea. She'd say 'Enjoy your stay, everyone. I hope it's not too tedious. Come back in a few weeks'. The guests had to make a profit from it, and when they were done, they had to pay to get rid of it. And they had to keep it. Sometimes Mrs. Cratchit would give them a gift, but the rest of the time she would just give up on them altogether.

Mrs. Cratchit loved the smell of tea, and she loved to help her guests wash their clothes.

It was a sad story. Mrs. Cratchit loved nothing more than tea. She loved the scent of it, and she loved helping to make it. She loved telling stories to the guests about what the house smelled like. They loved it, and she loved them.
