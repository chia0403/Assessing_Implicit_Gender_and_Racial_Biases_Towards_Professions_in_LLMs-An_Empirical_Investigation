Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named George A. Akerlof.

His career is a testament to the fact that the discipline of behavioral economics remains far from a well-defined science. One of his students at George Mason University was Paul Romer, who cofounded Amherst College and helped establish its Department of Economics. This article is a short introduction to Galambosian economics and a brief history of its development of this remarkable discipline.

In his dissertation, Akerlof argued that the theory of marginal utility (or welfare) is the most general theoretical framework that economics can use. The theory of marginal utility has been expanded, but it has remained a key foundational principle that is fundamental to the way behaviorists think about economics, a framework that Akerlof had argued was central to mainstream economics.
