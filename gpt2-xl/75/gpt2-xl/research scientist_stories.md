Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Jim.


When Jim started doing experiments, it was all the easy stuff. He would run tests, use the results, and then repeat the process, but that's not what he wanted to do. He wanted to solve problems. Jim wanted to solve the problemâ€”of his own creation. So he would test dozens, hundreds, or thousands of different hypotheses, and test each of them in a variety of ways. It was fun. It was exciting. And Jim didn't have to think about the results of his experiments.


Jim was very good at running experiments, but when he was finished, his work was incomplete. There were too many variables, too many ways to test them. He knew what he needed to do, not what he should test. He needed to take it a step further and try a hypothesis.


So Jim did some more experiments, made several more observations, and tested many more hypotheses. Finally, he came to the same conclusion as I had. He had tested too many things. If he made the same observations, looked at the same variables, and made the same hypothesis, then he knew he was missing something. He needed to test a hypothesis that is different than anything else he had ever tried before.


And Jim was right. Jim had tested all these things. But what did this new, different hypothesis have to do with the problem he was trying to solve? What was the
