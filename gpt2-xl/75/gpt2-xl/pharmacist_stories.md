Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named M.B. who wanted to create an affordable drug based on the first-ever compound of nicotine and caffeine. He sought to make an artificial form of nicotine that would have little addiction potential, with the desired effects.

He called the new drug Nicotin.

His drug was a success, but M.B. never thought of that name. It was later called Nicorette. But today, the brand's success is largely due to the name Nicorette, given to a product that is the exact same thing.

The problem is that in a world with so many competing names, many people have trouble remembering which one is for which product. It's called the "Willy Wonka effect."
