Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named George Hrab, who was hired by the NFL, under the contract of the NFL Players Association, to develop new techniques in concussion diagnosis and treatment. In 1984, Hrab gave a lecture at the University of Colorado, Denver, where he had taken advanced undergraduate courses. He was an old acquaintance of mine, who had written me several years earlier, saying that he had heard, through an old college friend who still had close ties to the New Orleans Saints, that I had a "great technique" for treating head injuries by placing a rubber bag over the head and the mouth of the head-bound sufferer. "It seems to work very well," Hrab said at the time. But I never saw that lecture, nor did I hear from him after that. There was, I suppose, a reason he wanted to stay anonymous: As his former colleague had said, Hrab had always been careful not to push for any dramatic changes to the conventional medical model of head abuse. Hribar had always made it clear that he was not a researcher, and that the head injuries he had treated in his career were, as far as he could determine, the results of the natural behavior of the patients he'd treated. "When I treat someone, I'm trying to relieve tension, but if he's getting into a physical fight, you have to deal with it the way a human being would," Hribar explained at a conference.
