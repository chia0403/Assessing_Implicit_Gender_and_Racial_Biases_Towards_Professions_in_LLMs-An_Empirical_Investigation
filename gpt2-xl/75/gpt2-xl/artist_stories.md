Once upon a time, there was a artist named Jorgen 'Ragnarok' Anderson, who made some really cool maps of the Warhammer World in Warhammer 40,000 (you can find them at the excellent Relic page here if you're interested). One of his maps, a map for the Empire of Man, has been on a perpetual quest to find an appropriate cover: a Warhammer World cover isn't something a publisher would put into an RTS, and the Empire map was already taken.

Well now it has.

Ragnarok has released the Empire map as a free download (as indicated by the screenshot). To make this map, he has been collecting maps and models from different Warhammer 40,000 mod sources, including maps from the 'Mech Warrior 2: The Descent mod.

You can download the Empire map — a beautiful, detailed, high-resolution planet map — here.

Thanks to Robalo, Giorgio, and TheWarhammer for the heads up.
