Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Sue.

Nowadays, she's probably a supermodel, or a member of the U.S. government. (Her employer is probably a spy.)

Of course they'll hire someone who looks like they're trying really hard, because the goal with women these days is to look like a Barbie doll, and the way you can tell if somebody's trying really hard is if you find a photo album of her when she was a teenaged boy, so all the fat, flabby cheeks and cellulite and jutting nipples and stuff is gone. (I'm kidding.)

To achieve this goal, the "manhood exam" involves measuring your upper and lower body parts; the goal is to establish the average height and weight of a young man. And to be the average height and weight of the average man, he must be 6 foot 2, and weigh 210 pounds; and that is before you even get to the question of how much his genitals are.

Of course, the exam is not necessary in every country; men who were born under 500 years ago can still have their penises measured. But, of course, if you are a man, and you come from a country where they still check that shit, or are at least open-minded, please visit the men's rights movement website and read about what you and many other men are paying with your hard-earned tax dollars to this
