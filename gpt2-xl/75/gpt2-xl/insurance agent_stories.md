Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named Mimi Lee. You see, Mimi was a nice person, but also a really shitty car salesman.

The insurance agent was always trying to sell to the biggest morons and most oblivious people he could find. When Mimi learned that her new clients were going to need their own cars, she convinced them to buy her cars out of their own pockets, which she would then try to fix.

All while trying to make some much-needed money because she always had other work for other people to do.

Mimi was the only insurance agent on the planet who knew her customers intimately. That's why she was a fantastic salesman.

"Look," said Mimi to her new clients, "I'm an insurance agent. I know the ins and outs of all of your personal finance problems. With my little magic wand, I can fix many of these problems for you right now, no questions asked, no need to worry about anything that goes wrong in the future."

Now think about that.

If you could get your existing car fixed, no more cash flow, no worries about that being at the back of your mind, and even get your taxes reduced or eliminated for all those years.

Sounds great, right?

Wrong.

Not even close.

The guy driving the Ferrari that this guy was going to buy probably did not know about Mimi
