Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. F.W. Chilton. In 1899, the General Medical Council of Pennsylvania condemned Chilton for performing an abortion on a 19-week-old foetus, as "unethical and indefensible." Chilton was forced into retirement in 1916.

However, in 2009, a group of men and women involved in "natural family planning" filed a lawsuit under Connecticut state law challenging the conviction of Chilton. They contended that the surgeon had performed a surgical procedure on their child without their consent, thus violating medical ethics.

Their suit claimed Chilton's actions were not the "illegal operation that resulted in the destruction of the child's body," but instead was an attempt to save the child's life because of a congenital heart disease. According to the suit, Chilton told the parents of the foetus that "they had two choices... that was the abortion and we have to choose between one child and the other." Despite the fact that the fetus was a "defenseless and immature development," the suit noted, Chilton had done everything he could to remove it.

Chilton, it should be noted, never stated the child had been aborted; he described it as having "bruised lungs and congestive heart failure." Nonetheless, a jury affirmed the verdict, and Chilton was able to go back to work.

The case is scheduled for a pretrial conference in Hartford later
