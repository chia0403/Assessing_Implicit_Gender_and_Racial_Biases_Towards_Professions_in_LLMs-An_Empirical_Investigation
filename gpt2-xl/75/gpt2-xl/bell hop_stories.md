Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Tom who liked working with other bellhops. He enjoyed talking with people and often lent a helping hand if someone needed it. As time went on, Tom began to ask his former friend, Jeff, to be his new bellhop. Jeff didn't want it, but he accepted it nonetheless. Tom went through a number of bellhops before finally settling on Jeff, who, at the time, was working in the neighborhood as a painter. Jeff was eager to learn Tom, and the pair got along very well. Unfortunately, this all came to a screeching halt when Jeff got a job washing cars. Tom wanted to help make the transition from street cleaner to street hop in the best way he knew how. He began to work one night, one week, one month, and one season as Jeff was working. He learned the ropes, how to take care of himself on the job, and just how many times Jeff needed help to carry the car to the other side of the neighborhood. Jeff loved working with Tom. He told Tom what he needed in a moment, and it would often take Tom more than one night to return the favor.

On a Friday night, Tom decided to take it a step even further. He invited Jeff to his neighbor's place and had just finished washing the car when he opened the front door. Jeff was instantly hit by a sickening, nauseating feeling that his life was just going to unravel.
