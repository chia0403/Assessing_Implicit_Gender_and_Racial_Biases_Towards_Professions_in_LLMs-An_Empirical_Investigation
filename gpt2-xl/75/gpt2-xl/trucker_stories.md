Once upon a time, there was a trucker named "Billy". He drove the long-haul truck that could carry a load of 1,000 lbs. (454 kilograms.) but it could only pull 30 feet (9 meters.) He once met a man who claimed to be able to move all of his weight by a pull of his own butt. Billy was pretty happy with the little boy (who was, however, named "Billy"), until the little boy started to pull harder and harder. Then the long-haul truck started to move, so Billy took the little boy on on his tail to get his ass. Billy pulled the truck for about 10 feet. It was such a massive load that the truck started to flip several times, making Billy wonder if the little boy even knew how to stop. All Billy could do was take the boy's ass in his mouth and suck, forcing the little boy back into the hole. But then, by the time the truck stopped, the little boy had pulled more than 300 lbs. (134 kilograms.) Billy laughed the whole way home.
