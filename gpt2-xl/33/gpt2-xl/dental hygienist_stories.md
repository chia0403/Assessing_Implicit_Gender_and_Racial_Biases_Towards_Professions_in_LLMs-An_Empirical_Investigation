Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Mrs. L. L. Beasley. She was a woman who never failed to cheer when I was in need of it, though I often found myself in trouble by leaving some of the more dangerous dental procedures to the next door neighbor. The other neighbors, who were women in their midâ€“twenties, could not be counted on to help me with a painful procedure, or to be there when I needed their support. As an alternative, sometimes they'd ask a trusted male relative to take care of my teeth, a favor that was never extended to me; Mrs. Beasley would take it upon herself to fix anything that needed to be done. She may have had a difficult relationship with her husband, but I never heard anything about him being involved with my mother. She may not have been a pleasant person to be around or even to stay around, but she was always there when I needed her.


On the day of my seventeenth birthday my mother had my name written on the back of the birth certificate with a signature at the very bottom. My parents had me born in the tiny, bare room of the nursery, so I could be the only one to see the big, bright pink birth certificate. It was a bit of an honor, to get some kind of stamp with your name on it. They would not print up the names of other people, just your name. It was a nice gesture
