Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Mike who would wake up in the dead of the night on his morning rounds to visit friends and make deals before going on to the business of running a liquor store. While visiting in the first episode, Mike comes across some old liquor that he decides to purchase and is introduced to the art of a shaker, a bartender that fills glasses with spirits. Not long after his introduction, the bar's new owner Mikey takes over and the art of the shaker is lost. In the second episode we'll see the bar that Mike used to own, but in the third episode it will be back under the ownership of Michael, who gets the job done and decides to hang up his shaker.

Mike is the only bartender who keeps a shaker behind the bar and only drinks beer and sake, though he always comes up with a different drink for the evening's patrons of the bar. Mike has been keeping the bar afloat for decades and it works out very well for him.
