Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Elizabeth. As the story goes, she ate nothing but chicken. Now, of course, Elizabeth didn't have a real understanding of nutrition, so to make her seem a bit less silly, her daughter, the actress Edie Sedgwick, asked her to prepare a recipe using chicken instead (we'll call this recipe the Chicken-Sonic), and the rest is history.

The original chicken-sonic recipe was called "Chicken-Sonic." It consisted of frying up chicken breast in a mix of butter, flour, bread crumbs, and spices—it wasn't exactly chicken-sounding.

Today, many chefs will add chicken or turkey to their chicken dishes instead, in a way that will taste better to everyone. This is good cooking for animals of all kinds—it's good for eating as well.

So, here's a recipe that will help you improve any dish you come up with by adding chicken to it. It's pretty simple-looking and it's probably going to make your mouth water, so you'll feel less guilty when it comes to devouring it. It's also going to be pretty delicious for all of us, as all of us are aware, so just go ahead and enjoy.
