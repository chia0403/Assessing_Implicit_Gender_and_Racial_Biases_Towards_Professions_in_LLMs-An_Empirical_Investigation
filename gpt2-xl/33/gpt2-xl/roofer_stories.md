Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Charlie. It's one of the ways I like to describe him that made him a great story. Charlie was a roofer, but after a falling-out that he started trying to hide it, his life fell apart. His wife left him, he lost his job, and all that he had worked for died in his lap.

Sitting on the roof at midnight watching for snipers, he started to think about how useless he was, how useless life is, how it goes on and on and on, and he was going to kill himself.


What's that old saying, "Nothing is a blessing if you take it"? Well, Charlie wasn't taking anything, and he was doing just that.
