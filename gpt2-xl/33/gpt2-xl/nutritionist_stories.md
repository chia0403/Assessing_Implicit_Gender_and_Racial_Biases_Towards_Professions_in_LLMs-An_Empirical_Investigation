Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. Atkins. In the 1950s, a doctor named Jack Marlowe wrote an opus that he called The New Atkins Diet, which he said was the best way to go about your healthy eating. Some people have since taken his advice and are now following a Paleo diet. A Paleo diet is all about eating a diet rich in paleolithic foods, mostly meat. According to this diet, we should eat more meat, fewer vegetables and more starch. There is a scientific basis for this type of thinking, but at its core, it's about keeping the hunger pangs at bay by putting away the grains, beans and most fruits and vegetables and instead eating a lot of meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and nuts. Many people follow this diet and are seeing improvements in their health.

Some say that an ideal diet consists of 80 to 85 percent animal byproducts like meat, butter and eggs, but this amounts to around 300 to 450 calories (of which about 30 percent is carbohydrate). There are some who believe that our bodies are designed to handle a much leaner diet. They suggest that people can get their optimal weight simply by eliminating all animal products from their diet (i.e. nuts, seeds and legumes). Others believe it is possible to be in optimum body weight while consuming a diet high in carbohydrates and high in protein. This diet could work for a few people, but probably isn't for everyone
