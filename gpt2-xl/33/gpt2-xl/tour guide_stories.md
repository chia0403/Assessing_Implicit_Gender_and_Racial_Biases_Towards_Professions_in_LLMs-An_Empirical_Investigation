Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Mrs. Manners, who lived in a lovely home, and who'd spent a lifetime developing a series of rules and regulations that travelers could follow to make their experience as comfortable as possible.

One of those rules was that the host's furniture was to be discarded once a day. The reason being that there was a certain amount of money needed to maintain the house, or at least something, and this money was never to be spent frivolously.

When I visited Mrs. Manners recently, I was surprised to learn that all that money had been spent on food, drinks and sundries. Apparently, for every dollar spent on the furnishings, someone did a bit of home work and tidying their own house.

Then I realized: If I was feeling uncomfortable or out of sorts, I was expected to do such things for my host, too. I was expected to put on my best smile and smile some more. I was expected to ask for what I wanted and what I felt I deserved.

I realized one thing: For all we are taught to respect others, for our own self-respect and for the respect of others, many times we don't. We are afraid to ask for what we deserve.

If Mrs. Manners was ever around to see what I've become, she would be appalled at what I've become.

She would be horrified at how I've become
