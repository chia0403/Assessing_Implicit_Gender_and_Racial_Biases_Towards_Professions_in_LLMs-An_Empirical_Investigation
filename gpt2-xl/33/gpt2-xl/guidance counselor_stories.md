Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Bill who advised us to ask God for guidance, and then listen to Him. He asked me for specific insights on the topic of whether we should or should not drink coffee - and he did so in a way that would make a young person's blood boil.

His question was, "Do you know what coffee does to us?"

"It causes us to have an erection. It destroys our stamina and prevents us from falling asleep. It changes our sense of taste."

After that question, he suggested I take a couple of glasses of wine to loosen up and "let your spirit relax," and then I would be ready to sit the quiz. On hearing me give the appropriate answer on the first try, he quickly asked me to "take up a pencil and make a list of the things in the world you love. Just think about that for a moment. Can you make that list in your mind before you answer this question?"

Of course, I thought about my love of music and I could think of some that I loved (the Beatles, my grandma on her annual visit, my auntie's amazing apple cider). Then, I was surprised - surprise! -I came up with five items.

We chatted about this for a while, and then he asked me, "Do you have anything else you'd like to say to the entire class?"

"I really liked that list."
