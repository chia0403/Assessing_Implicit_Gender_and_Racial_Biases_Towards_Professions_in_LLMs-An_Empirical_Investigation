Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Joseph P. Smith" said Brother Lee."His shop was located, in 1821, at a spot now occupied by the "New Era" and now used by the "Church News."

Joseph Smith, Jr., was an immigrant to Nauvoo, Ill., when he organized "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" in 1830. Brigham Young, a Mormon who had been on the frontier during many of these years, brought with him, as a new branch of the church, several thousand immigrants from Illinois, Iowa and Canada. The city of Nauvoo was not far distant, and their meetings were open to all who would come and take the sacrament. The following are a few excerpts from the historical record written by Church members who were at the time in Nauvoo, Ill., in the years 1850-1870:

"Sunday, November 14, 1845, in the morning, the Nauvoo Temple was dedicated by the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon…

"Joseph and Sidney then gave the Twelve the keys necessary for the sealing of the house of the Lord into its present form…

"The Nauvoo Temple was not to be finished until after the coming of the Prophet and President of the Church. It was to be a temple of the Lord's house, a place for worshipping God in holy temples, temples that were not to be built for many years
