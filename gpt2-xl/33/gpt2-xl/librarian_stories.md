Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Lisa D. The librarian was kind of...mean to this girl, and now the girl is on the run from her. I don't even know her real name, but for some reason, people have been trying to kill me over this. I mean, this librarian has a book? So, this is definitely...interesting."

"Oh? Interesting for a girl with no history of running for public office?"

"Oh, definitely! Well, there is the book, but we have to figure out the rest ourselves. I mean, most people don't actually have a library. In fact, some people go into hiding when it comes to their legal history. This librarian, however, is a different story altogether. I'm pretty certain we're going to have a hard time proving who this girl is or what her connection is to this library from before. I mean, if someone is so paranoid about the book, they sure like this librarian. I mean, she got my book that way."

She then pulled out the book and glanced over it for a moment before closing it up and put the cap back on it. Lisa turned her attention to the floor and sighed with pleasure. It was good to see that she wasn't the only one who got in trouble.

"So...uh...where would you like me to go next? Maybe to try and find...those other people?
