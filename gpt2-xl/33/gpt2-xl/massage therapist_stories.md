Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Dr. Bob, a real, live human being.

The reality is, there is no "real" Bob — and there never was, not really, but we accept that without question. You do not have to take Dr. Bob's word for it, though.

In the late 1990s, a woman named Julie began taking clients at a California spa. That spa was a licensed health club, and it offered a number of different services to its clients — things like massages, body wraps, and, in Julie's case, face-lifts.

When Julie saw that some of the clients she'd already put in her care she'd never seen before started showing up at her business with strange ailments, she took action. She called the California division of Occupational Safety and Health, and asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to conduct a "mandatory investigation" to get to the bottom of it: "What is it that I'm seeing here?"

Her suspicions confirmed that at least some of the ailments reported had a familiar ring to them. And they were not some random maladies, but symptoms of something very dangerous. The women who came into her clinic had all arrived there via one of dozens of health spa facilities in Southern California that were not registered with the government (and, apparently, had not been inspected by them). These spa centers were selling massage services to "sick women."
