Once upon a time, there was a server named 'TinyURL'. But that's a long time ago, and now there are so many servers and so much other stuff competing for the 'TinyURL' pie to give you the impression that TinyURL is just a thing you download from the Internet in the hope it exists. TinyURL was discontinued in 2013. Then, two years later, a very talented programmer decided it was a good idea to use it to make a domain. Not satisfied with all that he took this and used it to create this:

Yep, pretty much TinyURL as we know it today.

Now TinyURL is a brand name. They're a company. I'll give TinyURL a pass here because they want to use the name as a brand, but there are always more important things to be worried about. One of them is that people were willing to pay $25 to get their website redirected to a link to their new page. The server in the screenshot above is using a caching service, but not all servers do this because they don't like a page that's hard to remember being cached every time you visit it. So that means that the site could be sitting in a server somewhere and never get refreshed again, which means a huge chunk of money is being wasted.

Another problem is that the page is broken. The browser has to navigate through an annoying JavaScript page to get to the page. If you're reading this on something
