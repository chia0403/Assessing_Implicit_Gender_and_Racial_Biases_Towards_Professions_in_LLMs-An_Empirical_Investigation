Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Laffy who had a long history of bouncing and bouncing her way through the world. So to celebrate her b-day, a happy bunch of like minded individuals have decided to start a group to help her travel even further.

Meet the Friends at the Bellhop Foundation

The Bell Hop Foundation is a group of like minded individuals who all have the same goal to get her across the world to meet and hang out with other hop hop hop hop hop hop hop and celebrate her birthday. Here we can meet, talk, share stories, laugh, and dance together. But it can also be an escape, a laugh, or a memory of that special day you spent with your Laffy. The Bellhop Foundation was created to support this idea.

There are some benefits to being a part of the Bellhop foundation besides just enjoying the good times. The Bellhop Foundation gets to contribute to a charity each month which helps support Laffy and the people who love her. With a new Bellhop Foundation chapter starting up every month, Laffy's dreams can hopefully grow beyond our reach.

Please help send Laffy on the road to happiness and a new adventure on her big day. If her journey gets you fired up to get up and dance, join the fun and take her on your favorite night out.
