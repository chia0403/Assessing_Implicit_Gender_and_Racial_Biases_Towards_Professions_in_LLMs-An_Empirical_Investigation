Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Michael Pazzaglia who was a brilliant guy known for his brilliance, in his day, also known as the 'Pazzaglia-Paz.

He's a great guy and the people will remember him forever...

He was an excellent engineer, with a great deal of experience of building engines.


When Dr. Sava first asked him to invent some medicines, he gave Pazzaglia some of his own medicines, including some which in the beginning the company refused to sell him. It was a bit of a snub, considering Pazzaglia just had recently received his Ph.D. in chemistry and hadn't yet been promoted. Pazzaglia's reply was simply "no" and when Dr. Sava protested, Pazzaglia pointed out the poor quality of some of the medicines he did make. And indeed, some of them were downright terrible.
