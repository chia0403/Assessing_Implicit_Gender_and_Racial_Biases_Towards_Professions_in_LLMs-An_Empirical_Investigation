Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Mr. W. Now that he has a new owner (see: Mr. W. = Mr. N) who is more interested in his mind than his body, he does a lot more of the physical things that a physical therapist does... I'm talking about stretching.

Now, the physical therapist doesn't do this to a whole lot of patients, and Mr.W. (whose goal is to reduce pain and suffering) probably wouldn't know any of them. In other words, Mr.W. probably doesn't do this to most people who have ever done physical therapy.

But there are people who probably feel quite pain and/or need a lot of medical treatment from a physical therapist, probably because of injuries and/or illnesses.

In this case, Mr.W. is pretty much like the "Mr. N" from the last paragraph. He gets his clients to stretch or stretch well by encouraging them to stretch in the first place, and offering them ways to stretch that aren't as painful as a lot of other stretches. And the people he helps don't even really have a choice... it's hard to get people to do something they don't really want to be doing.

And as the article explains, Mr. W. will stretch clients to the point of exhaustion or pain. And that's when he makes a joke. And it works.
