Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Tawney. She came to be called Tawney. In fact, when this book came under fire in that battle, it's hard to believe some people didn't call her by that nickname.

I'm sure you remember — Tawney?

Yes. Oh, yes! Of course. The only other person named Tawney is the Wicked Witch of the West: That's right, Miss Gulch got that job. But that was different. Tawney was the only girl who was ever named. But they put this in the film: Tawney was called so because she thought she could read.

I wonder if in the original film, they took out that line or added it. There's a part of me that regrets not writing it into the script — just because I'm hoping they didn't remove it.

I would imagine they did. I don't want Tawney to be a stupid witch. She had a good reason for knowing, because she had actually seen the book. I mean, at the time, they were like: Why don't you say she can't read like the other girls? She said she could read because there was this book in the first place, Tawney — the Witch Goes Back To School And Actually Reads It! That was the part I found funny, because we had a line and the whole movie just took off from there
