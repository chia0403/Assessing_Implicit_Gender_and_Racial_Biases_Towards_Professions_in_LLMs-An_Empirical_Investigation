Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Frank.

He came to New York and began working with a very important man. Frank's new superior was Richard Feynman. Together, they developed the theory of quantum mechanics. Frank's life was changed by this revelation and he began to work with Feynman in his own department, which would prove to be the pinnacle of his career.

The radio was designed by Henry Graves in 1937. The design was to be much smaller, and to be able to fit all the equipment needed on the surface. Instead, it was a rather big piece of kit. The antenna had to be placed at a certain height in order to have a good receiver. So, Graves decided that the antenna had to be the size of a golf club that was able to be folded inside the radio.

A radio can be a radio, but it can also be a giant box containing a lot of small, expensive electronics. You can never be sure of the number of electronic components inside a radio unless you actually open it up. Frank was right: there is a lot of electronics in a piece of ham radio equipment and sometimes it is not worth the hassle.

Frank's favorite radio was built in 1956 by the National Radio Corporation of China. It was called the AM7. The AM7 can be seen in the photo above. The AM7 was an AM radio modified through modifications to become a VHF radio. The top of
