Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Sarah, who had a dream of taking care of her kids. She went to high school, studied and got a job as a home-care aide. In the first few months, it was great. As her husband took on more and more work, she had the ability to spend more time with them. But her life went off the tracks when things happened.

The couple came in contact with someone named Michelle, who also has a child and is also a care-giver. She came with her own story; Michelle's was unique. They struck up a friendship, falling into some common ground. Michelle helped Sarah with her workload. Sarah was able to use her own money to buy more diapers for her three children, along with food and medication. It was an arrangement that Michelle felt comfortable with.

Then things started to change. Michelle started to notice the change in Sarah's life, and she couldn't be in her life anymore. Sarah had become dependent on Michelle just like it seemed Michelle had become dependent on Sarah. She was working part-time jobs to save money. The couple were always in this situation until Michelle was able to buy more time with her son, when Michelle would return home to find her husband in the shower.

Michelle knew she could only help Sarah to the extent that she could do so. And she couldn't do so, Michelle said, until Sarah stopped relying on her.
