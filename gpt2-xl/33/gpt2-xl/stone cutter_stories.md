Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Jack who had a really shitty attitude. He just cut all the stones up for a living and if a girl he wanted to fuck were not exactly what he was looking for in someone he saw, he just threw them in the dump and cut a new one. Well, there were a few things that needed to be fixed about his life before he started putting his life back together. He was a good looking guy, maybe with a bit of a swagger, and he had a lot of money, which made him even more attractive for any hot woman he wanted to bang. It wasn't that he was some sex addict though, or anything. The only problem with his life right now was his attitude. He was a jerk that didn't give two shits about any of his feelings or feelings for other people. There was one woman that Jack was interested in, that he had not had previous contact with, he had been casually chatting up her on his phone and she had offered him something, which Jack thought was pretty attractive but he was way too busy being a jerk and not paying attention to the real world to really give much thought to it. Then the day came where he finally talked to her on the phone, but when he finally finished the message, she said "it wouldn't be such a big deal if you just weren't so rude to me, you know all about my condition anyway, you must know it's pretty shitty."
