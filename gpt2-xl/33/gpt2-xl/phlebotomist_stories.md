Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named George Bush (POTUS, you might say). He was married to the former first lady, Barbara Bush, and had two adult children, George W. and Jeb. In 1994 he was elected, along with his wife and children, to the highest office in the land ("the highest office in the land," of course) and is still there. He lives in Dallas, the world's biggest Bush town. The first family is like no other, including the vice presidency and the cabinet that reports to it. It is a unique amalgam of politics, privilege, bloodline and celebrity; it is a bubble within a bubble, within a bubble where they live as they dream their big fairy tales and spend whatever time they want to watch their new favorite soap opera and eat their favorite food, like a super rich American version of the Queen of England. The presidency and the vice presidency are now both run by siblings with their own individual personalities. Theirs is a world apart and, as it turns out, for different reasons.

The presidential family consists of Jeb, 50, the former governor of Florida and son of the 43rd president; George, 43, the former governor of Texas and son of the 45th president; Barbara Bush, 45, the wife and eldest daughter of the 43rd president; and Neil Bush (POTUS), 46, the brother of the 43rd president and son of the 43rd president.
