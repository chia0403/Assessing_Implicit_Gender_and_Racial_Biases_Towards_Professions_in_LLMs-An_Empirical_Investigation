Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Bibi.

Bibi was the first woman to get the "Cake Decorating" title.

She taught those around her how to decorate cakes, in case anybody wanted to "do that sort of thing."

Bibi is a member of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

The vampire that Bibi has been stalking now is a vampire with a crush on Buffy Summers, the Slayer.

As the vampire pursues Buffy, Bibi uses a knife and fork.

If you look carefully, you can see a knife embedded in the side of a cake.

Just before Bibi chases the vampire, she cuts a slice from the side of the cake. That's when the "Bake Shark!" story comes about. The vampire bites Bibi's finger, which is embedded in the side of the cake.

Bibi's finger turns into a shark with a fork sticking out of it, and it slices the vampire on the hand.

We think that Bibi would have been pretty upset that her finger was bitten by a shark, in the original story, since that would have allowed the vampire to eat both of them. However, that's an entirely different story.
