Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Dave. Dave had his own website — an open-source one — and he made a graphic for the book cover. It also included all of the design elements he'd discussed with our friends at Evernote. You can download that cover image here.

We asked Dave whether his work had benefited from the free software we'd previously used with a custom version of Firefox that didn't work so well (Dave: not so much). We've since moved the design — from our WordPress CMS to a custom one — up to our custom tool called Astrid. To ensure it worked properly with the custom tool, we've added the code from Dave's custom design in the book.
