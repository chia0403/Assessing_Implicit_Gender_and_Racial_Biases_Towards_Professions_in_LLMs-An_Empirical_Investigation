Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named John Smith whose job was to maintain and repair the highway. John Smith loved his job a lot and loved his wife, Susie (not the same Susie Smith as the one who was in Dixie in 1944).

One day, John took a break along the highway and went to his favorite bowling alley, just over the hill from his workplace. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith was the one whose day had been interrupted; he had been struck by a falling rock. Although John Smith was not hurt in the incident, he suffered a bit of "personal affliction…severely injured his right arm."


It wasn't just his arm that was seriously injured that day… He had to deal with physical consequences that even his doctor in the hospital couldn't anticipate. And the consequences were long and complicated.

The following description of John Smith's ordeal by Charles L. Nesbitt, a retired U.S. Marshal, and Thomas D. Hall, an FBI official:


"Within twenty four hours of being struck, John Smith was in the hospital with a severe head injury. When he began to regain consciousness, he could hardly find his right arm. He did not know if it had been severed or if it had fractured in the fall which had occurred hours before. In some sense, he still did not know how he had been injured. While he was in the hospital doctors told him he had been hit
