Once upon a time, there was a pilot named James, in his prime when he would have been in his mid-40's. In those days, only pilots who could fly planes well, and pilots with the skills to land on a water aircraft like this, went down. The only thing the ship could be relied upon for was to stay with the carrier until they had been fully refueled and could safely make the landing they had requested. The aircraft was an amphibious attack aircraft, designed for deep penetration into enemy territory. The aircraft had plenty of fuel and had been built without any anti-aircraft guns on it, so there was no fear of being shot down when it dived. They are usually not allowed to make landings at all, but a man called the 'Flying Commodore' was a very experienced and hardworking man, and he went down doing what he loved. This story has it that on the afternoon after he had been down for the last time, the aircraft started returning. When he saw the ship come up behind him, he went to the controls and tried to slow down, then to go up, but it was too late. His plane had crashed and he had been killed. His body had been recovered later that day, and he was flown in an open casket to his home in Perth, Australia.
