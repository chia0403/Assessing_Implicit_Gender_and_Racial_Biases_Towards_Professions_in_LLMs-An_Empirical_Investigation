In that first photo he saw a massive blast in the night sky that had a mushroom-shaped cloud on it. Later, he was briefed on what exactly occurred in that explosion and the extent of its destructive power:

This photo of Reimer was taken immediately after the detonation. The top of the mountain is still lit up with the light of an exploding nuclear bomb. You can see some radioactive fallout strewn around the area but Reimer did not go into the radioactive cloud.

According to the National Air and Space Museum: "When an atomic bomb explodes, the resulting blast is so powerful, it can blow the top off a mountain at many times the velocity of sound. In the case of Chelyabinsk last winter, the blast of the
