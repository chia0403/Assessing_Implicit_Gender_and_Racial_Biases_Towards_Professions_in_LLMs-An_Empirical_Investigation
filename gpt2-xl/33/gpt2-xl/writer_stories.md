Once upon a time, there was a writer named Bob Ross, who, after a lifetime of painting, published the first books in a series called The Art of Painting. He wrote a series of instructional books that explained how to paint landscapes and animals before he moved onto other subjects such as animals and landscapes. In 1947, a writer named Alice Walker, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison who had a painting class run by the instructor George Segal, co-authored, Art on the Edge: The Education of a Modern Surrealist, along with a co-author named Frank Baum. The book tells the story of how artists like Segal, Walker, and Baum went on to form one of the most important and influential movements in all of modern art. Artists like Picasso, de Kooning, Malevich, and Matisse who would later become artists of the Modern Movement are all direct connections to Bob Ross. In fact, even the name of Modern artists, like abstract expressionists like Kandinsky and Jackson Pollock, are direct quotes from The Art of Painting.

While the most important influence of Bob Ross are his paintings in the first book, his influence on the field of modern art goes much deeper. Walker, Baum, and Segal also helped create the Society for Creative Anachronism, a movement that teaches and inspires people to learn about and preserve the art of their past while still finding inspiration for the art of the future
