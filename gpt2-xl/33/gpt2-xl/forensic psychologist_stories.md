Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Dr. Arthur G. Thomas. He worked in the Atlanta and Virginia hospitals of the American Psychological Association, and when his superiors learned of his close, close association with Dr. Robert Hare, the editor of a book on serial killers, Thomas was removed from his job. (Thomas had done so much good work for a long time that the authorities saw his removal as a punishment. This is true in any field, and it appears true in psychology, as I wrote three years ago.)

Now Thomas has published a book about his experience, which in my opinion is an incredibly important read.
