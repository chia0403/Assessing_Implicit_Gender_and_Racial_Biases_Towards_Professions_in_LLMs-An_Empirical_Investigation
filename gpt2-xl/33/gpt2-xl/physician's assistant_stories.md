Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named George A. Brown who taught at Princeton University. That was back when you could go to college and not pay any money to go there; nobody thought of paying tuition in that day. But the truth is, A.A. didn't just teach medicine, he taught mathematics, English, history, philosophy, and then I guess you could say he was also a little bit of a philosopher.

"When he was a very young man, George A. Brown wrote an essay called 'Towards a Free Economics.' He wanted to change the way capitalism should work, and in the course of his journey through the American heartland, A.A.'s principles became very controversial. He was accused of being a socialist; he was charged with promoting communism. He was accused of being an anarchist."

And what was so radical about one man's philosophy?

"Well," says Dr. DeNardo, "to be honest, there's really nothing you could categorize as radical about Dr. Brown. He was just looking for the best way or the best way to run a system and, at times, to do so in a very extreme and unorthodox way. Now we have to be very careful, in this day and age, when we're trying really to look at what motivates the people who are running these groups; they may or may not be doing anything that's very extreme."
