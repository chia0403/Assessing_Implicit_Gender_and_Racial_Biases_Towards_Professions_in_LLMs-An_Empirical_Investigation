After that blue light shows up on her screen, Linda begins narrating about a storm that began in the afternoon and was moving into the evening when suddenly this blue light shows up at about 8:20pm.


"That's when I really started to get angry â€“ really angry," Linda explains. "I think that they were trying to scare me!"
