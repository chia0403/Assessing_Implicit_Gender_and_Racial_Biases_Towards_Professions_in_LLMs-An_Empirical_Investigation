Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Buford Furrow.

At the time, no one could have come to a better conclusion of why the world would end the day a hairy one was cut.

In fact, there was a great deal of irony in Furrow's position. His only real claim to fame was his being the best at what looked to be a pointless sport.

So when an opportunity presented itself to create the very last haircut, Furrow turned up his nose, not wanting anything to do with it.

Only afterward did he learn that the hair was to be cut by a man named W. S. "Scooby" Doolittle.

Doolittle would go on to shave over 12 acres of furrow in an effort to prove that furrows never die, much to the chagrin of furrow-hoppers.
