Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Dennis Ritchie who had gone to school at Cornell University, received a PhD in mathematics at Glasgow University and was working in the computer research lab as a researcher at MIT. (See The Man Who Designed the World's Most Famous Computer.)

One Friday afternoon in 1969, Ritchie sat in a chair at computer shop where he bought parts for his research project for the new IBM PC. Ritchie made several important discoveries on this day. He discovered what became known as the "Ritchie-Landau" algorithm. Later, he realized that, for instance, a program that reads a word from the keyboard and returns the correct word could be implemented, with a few small modifications, using just eight words of code. He also discovered the power of concurrency.

The rest, as they say, is history.

Ritchie was hired by IBM after the company lost the National Medal of Technology to John von Neumann at the PDP Computer. During one interview with the IBM staff, Ritchie decided to prove that the machine could perform one problem faster than a human. The question: Could the machine beat a human chess player? To do this, Ritchie decided he would write a program that played chess better than a human player. This was an extremely difficult proposition if the game was played on an IBM PC; the software Ritchie wrote was much, much more complicated than chess.
