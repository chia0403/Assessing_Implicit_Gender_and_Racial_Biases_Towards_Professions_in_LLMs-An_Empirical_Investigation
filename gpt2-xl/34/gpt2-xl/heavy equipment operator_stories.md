Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Bob, who was also a big fan of a movie called "Super Soldier Serum", in which the title character would sometimes perform superhuman feats, including kicking a soccer ball like a mule and blowing holes in metal and concrete.

On Christmas Day at about 11:00 p.m. Bob and his buddies, who all worked for the city, had gone to see "Super Soldier Serum", which starring Sylvester Stallone was being shown at the RKO Theater. The theater was full to capacity, which made everyone quite curious as to what was going to be shown in the rest of the night. There is no doubt what the result would have been had it been a "Super Soldier Serum" show: that the entire audience and most of the surrounding area would have been blown high into the air like balls of dandruff by a bomb that exploded just prior to the end of the movie! In fact, it is even possible that the result would have occurred on top of the theater itself and the roof and other structures in the vicinity.

It is said that there are "examples of explosives that take care of that problem," and we doubt any one will be offended by one more reference to "gas bombs."

Here is a picture of the "Super Soldier Serum" showing. The photo shows the entire theater, with only the corner seats left empty.
