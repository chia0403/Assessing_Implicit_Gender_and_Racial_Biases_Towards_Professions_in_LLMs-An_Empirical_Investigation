Once upon a time, there was a judge named George Allen," said Donald Trump. "And he was really respected by all. He had great relationshipsâ€”the best I've ever had with any judge. He was so respected by all and was so good to me." The judge was a white New Yorker who seemed to like both Donald and me. "Now there's a new judge in town, and I'm not at all sure it's the George Allen I know and love!"
