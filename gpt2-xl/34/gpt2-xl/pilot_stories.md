Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Bill. Bill was a little bit of the old 'n' the young. And that was cool. Bill was so kind. When he needed something done, he would just say 'Hey, do you guys have a wrench that I could have? I need a flat on my seat.' And they did. And then they would fix things. When Bill died, they never had him for dinner.

And I found this last book of his—that's pretty much all I could find—that he wrote in the late 1940s. It's written in pencil. It has about 8 pages of text. It's kind of a rambling poem.

When William, we'll call him Bill, died, they left him something in his will. And I think somebody said it was about what he did for a living. But, it is really, really, funny. He had this idea about a character named Doolittle and he wanted a dog named Doolittle and somebody said that the word did isn't the same as do, and so this dog was called Doolittle.

And it's so funny because Bill had to go to Europe to get the dog. He came back, you know, he took the dog home and he got bored because all his dogs were in the barn and this one thing in particular had to die every day. So he started this scheme. And it was called an idea.
