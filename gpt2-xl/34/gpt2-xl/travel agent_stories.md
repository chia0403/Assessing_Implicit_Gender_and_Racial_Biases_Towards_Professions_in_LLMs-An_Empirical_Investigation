Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named William J. Kennedy. He was a hard drinker, though his liquor bar was no more than a dingy back room on a stretch of New Jersey back road. But his customers weren't there to drink. They were there to buy. When they came in, they went into the back and found his desk, where they could sit and wait until they found an offer. When they came out, they went to the desk and waited as long as they liked, and when they had waited long enough, they bought.

William Kennedy made much greater amounts of money than he ever had before, and his clients wanted him to keep buying. He became unhinged, he started to buy a lot of goods so he could sell them for more money (he wasn't always even capable of selling them, he often just kept them for himself).
