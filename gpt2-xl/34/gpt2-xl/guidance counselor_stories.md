Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Kathy. She's now a senior pastor at the church where I volunteer as the music director—and yes, the same one my fiancée attends. That was a few and a half years ago. At that time, we had an in-house dating counselor. She was wonderful, but the real star of the show, to be honest, was my guidance counselor. Yes, that's right: Kathy. I've been married for ten years and my now-husband is in his second year of college, a new college freshman. If someone asked me, "Should I be dating my guidance counselor?" I'd say, "No, you have better things to do than do that with your counselor."

So how important is it that you build a foundation with your counselor? For starters, it's a connection. A good counselor can help you identify the specific issues in your relationship and give you the resources you need to resolve the ones that you don't have to. She can help you navigate your way out of your relationship if you make mistakes. She'll even encourage you to put them behind you. She will give you the words and words you need to say, "Enough!" If you don't understand everything at first, she won't. You are going to learn, and she's going to teach you. Just like I've learned and grown through my time as an ordained minister, so have my mentors and advisers.
