Once upon a time, there was a baker named Richard, and he had this incredible dream, a dream to make homemade bread. That dream was, apparently, the start of his obsession with baking bread and baking bread, and in particular bread that had gone through the so-called 'dry heat' ovens, which produce 'bready' bread, or 'firm','sweet' bread, and 'tender' bread, in which the outside becomes almost rubbery and the inside slightly mushy (the'mushy' texture is most apparent in some crusty bread, e.g. English Butter-Bread). These breads, I believe, were traditionally made in a bread oven and that Richard, perhaps, had begun to try his hand at making them under higher temperatures (perhaps 600 degrees of Farenheit) as well.

If I can imagine Richard making bread in the 500 degree oven and being able to make a loaf of bread at that temperature without it being mushy, something that was not possible when baking bread under normal commercial ovens, I can not imagine what he'd be capable of when he was baking bread under 800 degree Farenheit. The crusty/firm breads were a real revelation! To think that bread that had gone through that oven process had been made perfectly! How cool was that! To be able to make it yourself, on a bread stand, and to know that that was a bread. And I think
