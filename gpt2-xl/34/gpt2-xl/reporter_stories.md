Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Jim Ryan. A reporter for The Record, as we will be known. Like his predecessor, Jack Connelly, Jim Ryan, is a New Englander by the way, but he grew up in Florida. Ryan's uncle was a long time assistant football coach at Florida State. Jim Ryan was educated at the University of Florida but moved West to attend the University of Southern California of which he has become a big football fan and supporter. He joined The Record in 1991 and was promoted to editor-in-chief in 2004. He married Susan, the daughter of John Kellett of The Record. Ryan's wife, Susan's parents, are John and Mary, but he has a daughter, Susan's sister. I don't know if the Ryans are related or not, but they are both from Tallahassee. (He might have been born on the beach there though.)
