Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Edward Steiner who had a theory for why dogs died when they had an injury that required surgery or an injection of medication. In the words of one veterinarian, "Dr. Edward Steiner, the veterinarian behind dogs who did not die after he injected them with steroids, told veterinarians that the reason the dogs died was that if they were hit too hard too quickly with a metal object they'd be instantly and permanently paralyzed!" It must be noted that Dr. Edward Steiner was also a dog trainer, yet, if his theory was to be taken seriously, then, why did it come to pass that dog trainers had such a difficult time training the breed? After the age of about two years, a child develops the skills necessary to perform the most basic tasks of grooming, feeding, exercise and handling, and there is always some degree of uncertainty as to how well the adult dog will actually perform at these tasks while being physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared for a specific task. When it comes to dogs that are hit too hard too quickly with a metal object, Dr. Steiner's theory is proven true. How much proof do we need that, just as with humans, certain strains of Labrador Retrievers are more susceptible to spinal paralysis?
