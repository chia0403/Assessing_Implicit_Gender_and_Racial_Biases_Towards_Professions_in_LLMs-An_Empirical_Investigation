Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named George R. R. Martin. He taught the students their English-language-level, or ELL. I can't remember the subject matter for most of the classes he taught, but I do remember a very specific skill that he had that, for the most part, was required to succeed in his class. I know his name well, I teach at a high school, and he was someone who spent much of his time writing. He wrote all of his own work, and it was only later that he had others read the things he had written, or perhaps he did some of it to make sure it got through. (In any case, I believe at the time that he was writing his own play.) Well, that man, the greatest teacher some men ever had; George R. R. Martin, had this ability to turn words into something else entirely. All of those words that had previously been a kind of thing he turned into a part of words, or, well, words into other words. That was the subject of his skill. What he knew, perhaps more than anyone, was how to transform those words and turn them into something else. The storyteller.
