Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Pamela Davenport in Massachusetts. She had the power to decide who could have access to their newborn infant's heart.

Now, a similar problem has arisen in the United States, and a pediatric team at the Children's Hospital of Boston have identified a novel solution.

When a woman gives birth, the placenta releases oxytocin, which causes the mother's uterus - and therefore its cervix - to contract. And because blood vessels in an expectant woman's womb - called the amnion - are so close to the placenta, they can be damaged in this way. This is what makes it difficult for many women to have a vaginal birth afterwards.

When the placenta is removed after the birth, it is also removed from the uterus. If a woman has a vaginal birth, the tissues containing the placenta will have no way to access the uterine lining, so the infant's umbilical cord will still be attached in the mother. If a woman has an abdominal birth, the placenta will move out, but the umbilical cord should still be attached.

Davenport's research indicates that by exposing a woman to natural light - and, yes, the sun - before and during her next vaginal birth, it might be possible to re-attach the umbilical cord.
