Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Michael Scott. Not a very nice man, but he did a fantastic job to repair the room where he had done the renovation and gave me his opinion about it - that it needs the floor and wall trim redone. And, he gave me the address of a store on Broadway called Old Chicago (of whom I had heard so much ) that has the perfect fabrics that we are looking for. This is how I met Mr. Jim G. Now one can never go wrong being a true local; the store owner Jim (pronounced "jimm") is a gem he's so genuine and personable. He has a warm smile and makes you feel really comfortable in his spacious shop. But, the more time I spend with Jim, the more I realize that he's actually an extremely smart individual with an unbelievable amount of knowledge. He is a big fan of his customers and is always keen to help them on their project. He seems to really like every one of them so he makes sure to meet with them as soon as possible (at least that's how it feels)... And now I have to return the favor - he gave me a few more tips about what I need to know when preparing the interior and how to improve the look and feel of my kitchen, hall closet and small family room. Thanks, Jim for the great job - now let's try and finish all the renovations in time for a full closure!
