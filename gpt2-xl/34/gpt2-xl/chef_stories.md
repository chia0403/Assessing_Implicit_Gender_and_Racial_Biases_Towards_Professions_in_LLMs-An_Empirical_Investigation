Once upon a time, there was a chef named Jim. Jim was brilliant, but it got harder and harder to get his recipes accepted and his cooking style was lost in translation. People didn't want to call it something else. So we named it what it is: Jim's World. Now, I'm not even joking. If he lived to be 150 he'd be 100 years old and this place would still be named after him. He opened the first Jim's World restaurant on the corner of Third and K streets, just a few blocks from the first Jim's World restaurant I have ever lived. He had a massive success because he was able to create an identity for Jim's World for people who otherwise couldn't locate Jim's World.

There are a ton of great things about Jim's World. But for me personally, I love it because it's one of my favorite spaces in the city. It's a space at a historic location, that people are often excited to go visit, and even though it isn't an upscale restaurant that is unique to the area. In fact, it's part of the historic district, with the Old Towne Cottage at its core.

The most unique thing about this space is that I can walk from my front patio to the dining restaurant at the top of Third Street, without ever meeting one another. This is one of the nicest spaces in the city. It's open until 12am on weekdays and 1am on weekends
