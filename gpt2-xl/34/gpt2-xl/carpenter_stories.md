And so they built themselves a mill, and they put a saw, a lathe, and an anvil into the mill, and they gave it a seal, and they named it the Mill of Michael Skakel, and they said it was in the city of Michael Skakel, and they knew not that it was the devil's mill; and every time they turned the wheel of the mill they would hear a roaring, and if it was a thunderclap, they would hear a rattling, and if it was a gush of boiling water; and so on with it till it was finished. They put it into their house and said, 'We have done in turning the mill, but now we can see that there is more work to do.' So
