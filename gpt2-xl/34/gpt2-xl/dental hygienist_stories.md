Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named David Chabot. Every year during his dental school training, Chabot would study the first couple weeks of his classes, using the period to memorize all of the basic terms to have around in case he was ever called upon for a client and he just happened to learn that the term "toothache-nose-mouth-oral-lacrimal-frowns" rhymed with "dentist."
