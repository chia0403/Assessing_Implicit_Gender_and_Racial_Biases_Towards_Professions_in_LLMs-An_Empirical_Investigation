Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Brian.

When the world of programming was new, Brian used the old commandline interface.

He had a good time, but he wanted to take away a little piece of the joy, he wanted more. And he began to write the first ever, and most brilliant, terminal.

Brian decided to make the first-ever text-based graphical tool.

It didn't do much, not exactly, but it did start a trend.

Over the next few decades, terminals would become popular and ubiquitous, and would eventually cause the end of the interactive DOS command prompt.

But, that is another story.
