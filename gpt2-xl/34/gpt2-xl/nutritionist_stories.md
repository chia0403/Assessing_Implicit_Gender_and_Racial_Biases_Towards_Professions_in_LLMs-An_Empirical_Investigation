Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Mrs. Edna O'Brien. As you can imagine, she had a very busy life. One day, some friends and family who had met her while she was giving nutrition lectures came by to pick up her dietitian business. They were surprised to find that all the books she'd put out had disappeared. It was never revealed whether O'Brien had done anything illegal or immoral, but her business went under after that, and she soon disappeared too.

But wait - there's more! Not only does the plot require an omnisexual (her pet name was "I'm a double-amputee") nutritionist with a penchant for cannibalism (she was constantly eating human flesh) to be the cause of the death of a bunch of innocent children, but the whole thing was entirely fictional. At the very end of the series, Edna O'Brien was revealed to have been nothing more than one of many fictional nutritionists, and the whole thing had simply been a fictionalized version of the real life O'Brien nutritionist case.
