Once upon a time, there was a police officer named Officer Jason Brown. In 2006, Brown was assigned with a small police department in rural Montana. One night at work, Brown was approached by a young man named James Egan. Egan wanted to use Brown to clean out his apartment. "I told him straight up," Brown recalled. "I told him, 'This is a police station, not a methadone clinic.' " The officer was concerned about the teen's reputation of selling drugs. To Brown, the encounter seemed simple. It was also not unusual: Police are rarely told the truth.

When the teen came to visit Brown, he offered to sell him methadone treatment. This is how Brown remembers his interaction with Egan: He was "very articulate. He was very well-read. Well-spoken. And I felt confident that he was telling the truth about what he knew." During a discussion of the pros and cons of the treatment, the pair decided to split the purchase. Egan took the drugs and Brown picked up the cash, paying for the drugs out of his own pocket, since the store did not have a cash register.

There was one problem: The teen did not have access to methadone. Though methadone doesn't actually exist as any kind of illegal drug, it's legal to sell when sold as a therapeutic substance, like OxyContin (although selling it on the street is illegal). For more on meth
