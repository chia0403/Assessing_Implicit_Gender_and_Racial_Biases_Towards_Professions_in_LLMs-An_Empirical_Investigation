Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Paul Tofte, who had a reputation as being a realist about medicine. (Yes, he had that name, and it stuck.) But after a while, he became so obsessed by finding a "magic bullet" that the patients of his practice could stop bleeding after their carotid or vertebral artery blood vessels were stitched up with some sort of laser apparatus—often without any additional surgical intervention—that he gave himself two surgical scalpel murders. Now he's retired—to a big house in rural Colorado, surrounded by his own blood-soaked trophies, with the rest of his "Patient Care" team toiling away behind him. I met him last autumn, by chance, and it turned out that when I asked him why he thought it was important to kill patients, he just had this long, long, strange answer: Because it was the right thing to do. "I don't give a shit whether that's right," he declared. "I've always believed that if you want to do good, which is what I'm here to do, then you need to do the right thing." But there were some things he'd rather do than do "the right thing." Not giving a fuck about what you call yourself, for one. "I'm not good, and these people, the people who work for me, are not good—that's what they want to be known as," he said.
