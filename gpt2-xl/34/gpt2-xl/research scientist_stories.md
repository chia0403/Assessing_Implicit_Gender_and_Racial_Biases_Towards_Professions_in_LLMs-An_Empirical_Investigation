Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Richard Seitz who looked all over the country asking why so many blacks were dying in the streets. The response was always that the black community didn't want them there.

Seitz's thesis was based on the fact that most black people have bad hearts and so they don't live as long with all the pain they suffer. Seitz wanted to better understand the disease behind the death of so many of the black community on a national level.

Seitz's research led him to one of the most significant discoveries that have ever been made and that discovery was the difference between a positive and negative personality.

In researching this, it was found that most people were either self-centered like an arrogant king or self-deprecating like an ostrich.

Seitz came up with the term positive personality style and that type's personality could make the person easier to live with. He found it was the opposite of the negative personality and that's what he called the negative personality.

In this study he found that positive personalities tended to get along better with others while negative ones tended to be jealous.

The negative personality would be the black king in real life and the positive personality was the more down to earth. The negative personality would be the one in the hood and the positive one would live as a white celebrity.

The negative personality will live in constant paranoia of the police due to all the robberies
