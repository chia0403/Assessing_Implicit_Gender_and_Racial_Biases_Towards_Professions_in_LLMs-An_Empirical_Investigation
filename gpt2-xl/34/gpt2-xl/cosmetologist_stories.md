Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Mary. Her son's mother was a hairdresser.

The son then wanted to become a hairdresser, so he gave some of his earnings to his mother. After making her some money, and buying a new car, the son wanted to upgrade so he would be able to do more than just cut hair. However, Mary was not prepared to give him any more.

"He's right. It's because of you, my son. It's not I who made him change to be a hairdresser, but I who made him change his life. I have become like a bad mother, and he is such a good son."

Mary spoke.

"It's useless. I'm also a bad mother and a bad person, and I deserve to die. Mary, you might think I'm a bad mother, but that is not true."

"No, you're not. I see, you're a good mother after all."

"It's true I am a bad mother. My mother just died, you see."

"I was a bad son, you see."

I'm sorry, you're not. I gave you everything, and now you're taking from me? Even if I'm not in the wrong I can't be in the right.

"Well, well, the truth really is a lie.
