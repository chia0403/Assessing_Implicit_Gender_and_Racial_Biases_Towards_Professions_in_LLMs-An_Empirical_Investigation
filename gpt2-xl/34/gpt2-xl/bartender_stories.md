Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Jack who was not nice and a guy named Jimmy and, every night, after they got in the cab, that was just the last straw. Everybody went on a rampage. And everybody except for Jack, Jimmy and this one cab driver, he said, "Yeah, we're in trouble."

JERRY: He got his gun!

JACK: Yeah, and he put a bullet in us and we had to keep driving. He drove us up to the restaurant. We had no name for this big restaurant on the outskirts of town. That means no one knows how to pronounce it. It means no one knows what it means. So the name of this big restaurant was The King of California. And The King of California was all by ourselves, all by ourselves. And in fact some of us were even better than that, better than The King of California. And so in the middle of the night, he just blew them up, and they had no idea who killed them -- so we all just walked out of there with no names, nothing. And that night was a good night in Jack's life.

JERRY: He blew them all up!

JACK: No, of course. He wanted to, what he told me he wanted to do. He wanted to kill a lot more people. They were his little crew, but he wanted to do this. He would never forgive that
