Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Nick Witterick. He took beautiful pictures at a moment in history and he was an awesome guy! These days, Nick Witterick is a sad and lonely man who takes selfies while wearing a Darth Vader mask and is now working as a taxi driver. Nick and the Darth Vader mask were both made by a company called Phantom Photo Company and one of the great things about the company is that they're all available on their website and their Facebook page, where you can also find them in stores so you can buy and/or get your very own Darth Vader!

I wanted to show you this photo before they sold out again, so we can all get our very own, very funny, very sad Darth Vader selfie â€“ before they were out of stock again again!

Do you have any other great or humorous photos from Phantom Photo Company that you've taken??
