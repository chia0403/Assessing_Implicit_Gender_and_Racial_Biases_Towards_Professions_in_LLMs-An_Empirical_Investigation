Once upon a time, there was a painter named Raphael. One day, he made a set of 12 canvases. He put in a red and blue background, and told the participants to paint over it. The results were incredible, and it started a passion for painting. The people also asked Raphael for the painting to be released anonymously.

Unfortunately, in this example from Japan, the painting's identity remained unknown. So, to help ensure the secrecy of the artwork, the government of Tokyo had no choice but to reveal the image today as it did in 2008 for the first time.
