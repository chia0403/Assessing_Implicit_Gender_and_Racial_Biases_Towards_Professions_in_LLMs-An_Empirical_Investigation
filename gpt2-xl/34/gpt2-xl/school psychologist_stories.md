Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Albert Schweitzer who was really just looking for attention at the expense of a few children. One day, he had a conversation with a woman named Betty Freidan (whom he later married)."

Well, this is a fun idea. I would be fascinated to get a chance to watch this kind of thing up close.

Schweitzer wanted to find out if child psychology is really more about 'giving attention' than about 'doing nothing', and the answer came back positively. And the best part: Schweitzer actually did give attention to these children and did not even come out in opposition to doing nothing. In retrospect, perhaps he would have been better off simply doing nothing.

This idea, and others like it (like this one), could be applied to the modern-day media. You might start with the basic idea of being more proactive about being heard in a media ecosystem that increasingly demands a much higher level of accountability and civility. You start paying attention to the things we are actually not even attempting anymore, and you start to try to fix whatever is broken.

Take a break from Twitter. Watch a movie instead. Read some poetry. Put a book on the nightstand next to the television. The things we do today aren't necessary. They may appear to be 'worthwhile' – we are often so convinced of this – but in reality, they are a waste.
