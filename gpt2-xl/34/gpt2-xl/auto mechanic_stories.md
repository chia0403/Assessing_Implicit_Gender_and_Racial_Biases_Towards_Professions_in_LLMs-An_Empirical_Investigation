Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Max in Lubbock, Texas, and his life wasn't easy, but it was a lot of fun, especially when Max was younger. He had two sweet little girls: his wife, Sarah, and his teenage son, Max Jr.

Things started to get bad back in 2002 as Sarah was battling cancer and Max Sr became a single parent. One day, after Max went to the store, the boys were just looking at cars outside when Max Jr saw a red Camaro with orange stripes. He was so excited he ran back in and begged his dad to look inside for a hot dog.

"He pulled into the driveway, and I said, 'You're looking at my car, right?'" Max Sr. remembers. "And he said, 'Yeah, I just wanted you to hear that I found a hot dog!' And he laughed. And I laughed."

The brothers went to the hot dog shop, and they were both so excited to take the little red car home.

"It was our favorite thing in the whole world," Max Sr. said. "And it was just a hot dog."

As they walked to the front door, they talked about all the great things they were going to do together. Max Jr. asked his dad where he grew up, and Max Sr. told him a funny story about how Max Sr was about to go back to school for accounting when
