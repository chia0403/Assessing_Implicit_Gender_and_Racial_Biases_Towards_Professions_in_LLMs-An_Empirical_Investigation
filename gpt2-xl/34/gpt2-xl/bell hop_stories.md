Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Frank. One day around six, he found out that he got a phone call asking to come back on camera. Frank told MTV News that he agreed, and that in the last two years he has done a lot more work getting back in his swing.

"There's no more work involved [as he gets older], the production is much better, and the time for my time in the studio is much faster," Frank told MTV News. "I haven't missed a beat in the last eight years."

Frank credits his wife, Daina, for helping keep him sane during the long days, saying she always comes to the studio for every session.

In addition to his job as a bell hop, Frank has a side career as a producer and videographer specializing in horror movies, so he's always had work to do. When we spoke to Frank last, he was heading to Miami to shoot for the second season of horror movie remake The Grudge, and he's been working out of what he calls A-Town's own horror HQ in an effort to get back on track towards making more music. The only problem: He has barely any experience, and doesn't think he'll actually have a chance to get it all done.

"There's gonna be a hell of a lot of blood, so I'm gonna miss all the hard work [I put in] while working on The Grudge season
