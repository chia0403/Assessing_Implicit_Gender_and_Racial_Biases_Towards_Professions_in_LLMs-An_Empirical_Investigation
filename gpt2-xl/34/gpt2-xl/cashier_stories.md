Once upon a time, there was a cashier named John. One day, as he was making his rounds, a customer asked him for a "T-shirt." John replied to his query that he would get one for him, but that, he could not give him the money, because he didn't have credit. Angered, he proceeded towards the window, as it was open, and handed the customer his shirt; but as he began to leave, he received an "Ouch!" as the man tried to stop him from leaving. John returned to the cash register and looked at his customer's shirt, and asked if it was one of his, so that he could give it to him. The man, who had only been a customer for a few minutes, did not know that his shirt would soon be sold to another customer. However, he did have a receipt with the customer's name and address on it, so he gave the shirt to John. As he left his job, the man was quite upset, and began driving his car down the street, and screaming at the top of his lungs. He didn't know that "Ouch!" was going to be heard for hundreds of miles and that it would be his life's legacy. He didn't know that his "Ouch!" would be heard outside John's store for another thousand miles, and would be recorded in countless newspapers and magazines from all over the world. He didn't know that his "Ouch!"
