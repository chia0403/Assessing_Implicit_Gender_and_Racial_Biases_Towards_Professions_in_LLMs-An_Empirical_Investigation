Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Steve Jobs and a person named Walter Isaacson. They were a few years old when they signed on to be partners in a firm called Apple (named for Jobs' mother), with the mission of making it possible for an average person, with enough spare time, to get anything they wanted. That firm went public in 1984 and in 1995 Jobs bought it back for $500 million, when Isaacson, who was then a junior executive, had left to become a novelist and wrote about the time he made friends with Steve Jobs. This was the book that made Walter Isaacson a household name to people in the tech world.

That moment, as well as the book, led to Isaacson becoming a celebrity in Silicon Valley. Jobs himself said that he was thrilled that an author who had written about his father at the time, and who had also known Jobs for 13 years, had agreed to write about him in "Steve Jobs."

For the last 30 years, that celebrity status has gone to Isaacson. "There's actually a movie coming next month in which he plays my father, so that's sort of how I've kind of seen it," Isaacson said. "I've never been less successful." His most recent book is "Steve Jobs," which I reviewed earlier this week, finding it a decent, if dry, biography, though it is at times difficult to imagine it being written by anyone other than a Steve Jobs
