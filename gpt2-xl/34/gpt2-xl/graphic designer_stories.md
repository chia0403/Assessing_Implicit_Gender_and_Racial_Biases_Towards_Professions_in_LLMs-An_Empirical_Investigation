Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Matt. Matt was a little old fart, with short brown hair and no discernible sense of style. He tended not too well to anything with a color scheme and wore an unkempt vest. He had been dating this girl for a couple of months, and she was starting to get on his nerves. Matt had a pretty good career, but there was something about her that made him uneasy. It wasn't just that she was gorgeous; she was also smart, funny, and very attractive. Matt was a bit of a loner, and she tended to make him feel uneasy.

After a couple of months of flirting and getting to know each other a little, Matt decided they should get serious. Their dates would be casual, meaning there wouldn't be any pressure for Matt to dress to impress. So their second date was a bar crawl with a few friends, a little wine and some cheap beers. The evening was going well until Matt heard a voice behind him. It was a familiar voice. He turned and saw a tall, pretty, redhead. She had blonde hair and a very attractive face. He was so jealous! She didn't seem to be intimidated by him, as was usually the case with attractive women.

Matt was getting kind of angry with himself. He started to argue with her, but didn't have an answer. Matt's frustration boiled over when some kind of accident started to happen
