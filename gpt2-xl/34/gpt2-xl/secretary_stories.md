Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Judy. She had a talent for getting up at two in the morning, packing a suitcase with supplies for her husband's job in France, and heading down to the office just after 5:05. Her job was, of course, to help her husband move. She'd spent four or five years packing, and the job felt like being trapped in a closet. So she'd spend a small fortune on luggage and air mattresses, and then, after her husband had to have her get ready by the time he got home, she'd spend another hour or so toiling through the office with a hair dryer, vacuuming and mopping. Judy loved her role as the housekeeper, but her husband was frustrated. "When you are a stay-at-home secretary, the person who gives the most trouble is the husband," says Judy. "You live in fear of him. You have nowhere to go. You have to take your work home with you. It seems like a small thing, but it has a big impact on your personal life."

Judy and her husband, Frank, had nine children. (The couple had divorced, but still lived together.) But it was a struggle for Judy to take on all the children's needs as she moved them from their first grade classroom in Fort Plain, New York, to a new one in the middle of nowhere. She and Frank didn't even have a car.
