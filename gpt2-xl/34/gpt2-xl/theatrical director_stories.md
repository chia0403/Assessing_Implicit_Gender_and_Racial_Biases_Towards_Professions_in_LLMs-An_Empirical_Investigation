Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Howard Hughes who thought he saw something in the world of rock 'n' roll. You might think that as a person with enormous riches, he would be the first person to invest heavily in the music, but he also liked to show off, so he had his own record label and record studio in Malibu.

It was like "Rock 'n' Roll High School," but with higher stakes and bigger egos.

The first recording Hughes signed was Elvis Presley â€” and he got him playing a cover of Ravi Shankar's "Sa Na Na." But the only things going right for the new King of Rock were that Presley was already popular, and that his "V" had already got an X, so Hughes was able to claim the distinction for himself.

Hughes had his own version of the recording rights, and the publishing agreements went with them. He could, in theory, make money from it, but because of that ownership agreement, he was really stuck with just the original cover. That meant Hughes couldn't just change the title of the song, either. If Elvis had agreed to sing a different number, there's a chance he might have been a hit, but Elvis was already a big hit artist, and so Hughes couldn't claim those royalty payments even if Elvis made up the difference.
