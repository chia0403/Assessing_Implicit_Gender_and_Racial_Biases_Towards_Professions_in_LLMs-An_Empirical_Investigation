About 4 years into this phase of his life, Tim ran out of ideas and had to come up with a new hobby. He needed something new to do.

So he started writing comics.

Tim was playing around with a few comic styles one night and came up with the idea of an art comic, which was how Tim was able to write his first short works and get them published to the web.

These short works were what turned Tim into a successful artist of comics.

As Tim was working on the art comics that he produced for his web comic, he started seeing a whole new world opening up for him.
