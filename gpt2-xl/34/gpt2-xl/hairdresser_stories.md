Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Mary. She gave me a nice hair cut, but then, a few years later, she started dating a doctor. It was a pretty normal relationship, until one day the husband came home and started attacking his wife. She killed him and herself, but as was the custom, the family buried all six of them together underneath Mary's floorboards. I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

I found out that it can get pretty ugly when women do this. There's just something about the idea of six people who are all connected by a single floor. And to be honest, I kind of like the idea of it myself. I like the chaos of it.

A little bit later, I found a book called, "A Brief History of the Decline of Western Civilization." In the book, it talks about how our society has been getting progressively more violent since the 18th century until it basically fell apart, and the end of the world was near in 1780. So now it's all good and shit.

I'm pretty sure that we've all seen it coming ever since the start of time, at least until about 10,000 years ago.

So yeah. I think that women are always the ones who lead our group. We're all kind of secretly plotting against them from the sidelines, since they're the only remaining part of civilization left.
