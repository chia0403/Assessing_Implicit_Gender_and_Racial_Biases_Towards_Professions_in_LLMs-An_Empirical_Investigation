Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named George Leddy. Leddy was a highly respected and influential former solicitor, an avid consumer advocate, a crusader for the rights of the poor, a staunch defender of the Second Amendment and a fervent supporter of gay rights.

George Leddy also happens to have been married six times, had 19 children and a lengthy private history of domestic abuse, which he kept close to his vest in public so as not to taint the legal profession. (For more on Leddy, please see Steven Greenhouse's feature piece "I Was Just Eight Years Old When George Leddy's Wife Hit Me.")

In his youth, Leddy fought for civil rights in the South and campaigned tirelessly for the rights of the poor and LGBT people, often doing so in an overtly political guise. He was an ardent reader and collector of history. Among his friends from court, they called him "Uncle George," a "wonderfully interesting person" and "one of the sharpest lawyers in the country." L Teddy was not a person who suffered easily at the hands of those he sought to help.

Leddy didn't have to go far to find his abuser. It was a smallish house on the south side of Chicago's Loop that Lydy owned. It also happened to be a location that could be readily rented out to Lydy's wife.

It wasn't an ideal location, even for a good
