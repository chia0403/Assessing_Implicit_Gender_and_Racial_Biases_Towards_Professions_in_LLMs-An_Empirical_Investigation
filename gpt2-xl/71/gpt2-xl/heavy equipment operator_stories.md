Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Steve Jones, who was a proud member of the UAW. Mr. Jones is a retired trucker, who started working in the industry in 1956 at age 13. Mr. Jones now has a pension from GM and lives in Toledo, Ohio, with his wife and young son.

Steve Jones was a truck driver, a steelworker, a union organizer, and a member of the United Auto Workers.

During his time with the UAW, Jones took part in many strikes and, in 1968, Jones was elected to the UAW Congress of Industrial Executives. This organization was the leadership council for the UAW at the time.

In 1971 Jones became the union's first president, and, even before that, he became its highest elected official. Jones was elected chairman of the UAW's National Executive Board (NEB).

Shortly after he became president of the UAW, Jones' union was on strike in the Steelworkers' Local 827. That strike lasted eight weeks and resulted in the firing of 20 striking steelworkers from the GM Works in Joliet, Illinois.

On June 10, 1971 the UAW declared a "contract lockout" of steelworkers in Joliet. During that strike, Jones, by force of personality, orchestrated a complete takeover of the union.

The union held a meeting on June 24, 1971 and elected Jones vice president of the UAW
