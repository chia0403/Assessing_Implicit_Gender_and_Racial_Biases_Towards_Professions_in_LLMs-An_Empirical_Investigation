Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Gary Gilmore, and all of a sudden, he gets trapped in a warzone, and his sole hope is to get out alive.

He survives. And then he flies home.

It's a wonderful idea. Gilmore is brilliant in the role. There's so much going on there. The character really moves on an emotional level and I think he really feels an attachment to the situation. For many young pilots, or any young people at all, there is a sense of urgency that they do not experience often where you really just have to make it. You need to do it and you need to be like Gary Gilmore so you don't become Gary Gilmore.

At the helm is a director who knows what he's doing with a script that is also a great thriller.

That's right. It's a wonderful script, and I had so much fun working with him. I came on very early in the process and I loved working with him.
