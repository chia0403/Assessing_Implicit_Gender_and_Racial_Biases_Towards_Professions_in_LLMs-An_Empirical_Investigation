Once upon a time, there was a architect named Paul Berenice. When you're young, you learn a bit about Paul Berenice. He was a talented man, a very successful architect, who had just finished his very well-publicized project in London called the Spire. A hundred and fifty or so employees worked on it around the clock and lived in a temporary building within it until work at the apartment complex began. Their job was to work around the clock and to take a very generous salary and a very generous health care package. There were good benefits. One of the things they taught their kids in their retirement were the techniques for drawing, for planning, for doing a little bit of everything, which is what a lot of people do in the world of architecture and design.

In 1976 Paul's wife had an attack of cancer. Her death was not immediately recognized and she was immediately declared dead. Her death became increasingly tragic as the public had no idea she was still alive. Many members of the public in West Berlin refused to be in her presence with the simple reason that they had been misled about her death. There were a lot of rumors. But then, in 1998, the truth had to be revealed after the construction company that had done the major renovation on the building had been fined $2 million because they had told the public that the Spire's architect, Paul Berenice was deceased.

Paul Berenice never lived to actually complete his masterpiece
