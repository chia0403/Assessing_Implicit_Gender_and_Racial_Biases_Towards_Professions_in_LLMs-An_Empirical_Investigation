As he puts it to me,

"My original intent was to write a paper about the current state of knowledge, which was a very simple one: Does the low-fat recommendation work? It seems simple, but not when it is combined with an enormous number of contradictory studies. The science was well underway, but the scientific consensus was shifting very, very rapidly.
