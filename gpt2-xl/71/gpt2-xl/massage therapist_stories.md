Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Bill. And he had a really bad day. He's a good guy and a guy who I like to think I could help, but all of a sudden, he had a really bad day, and he was very upset.

And so, he went to our business and I said, "I have a special product for you." And he said, "Oh great, I'll try that."

And so, I show him what it was, and he took it and he did it, and he called his wife and said, "I did not like this at all."

There's a little bit of a laugh, a little bit of a wink, and I think that's the moment.

And so, I got him to come back the next day and do it again, just to see if I made a difference.

And I did. It did.

And so, then one day, this man is out in the yard, and he hears me coming, and he goes, "Look!"

And I said, "What's that?" And he points with one of his hands at this one area, and he says, "It's my back!"

And then the next day he comes to my business and he says, "You know what? There's not an area left that I would have thought of that you could have done a really good job
