Once upon a time, there was a server named TobiWan. For those not familiar with the name, Tobi was a short, diminutive ninja (you know, the kind who wear long black coats with the red trims on the sleeves, and occasionally don long-range ninja-style throwing stars of some type.)

Tobi was a good guy, good at his job. He'd be very proud, if he was still alive, to say that he had served as a steward of Cloudbreak for over three years, and had never once let a single person go.

No one, including Cloudbreak's former CEO and co-founder (and TobiWan's former business partner) Joshua "Josh" Boggs, knew whether Tobi had died earlier this month. The reason? According to Josh, Tobi's servers didn't function well enough to hold up long enough for the servers under his ownership to be brought back online.

All that said, it wasn't like Tobi hadn't been a long-standing good guy. It just wasn't his job.

You see, Cloudbreak is a company located in a very cool office building (which makes their offices really, really interesting in their own right) that Josh has leased to himself since 2004. As I have said before, being a CEO's son is a very good thing in my books. As long as you have a CEO, you will never have to do anything
