Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and he liked to believe that he was a civil rights martyr. A few years before he was assassinated in Memphis after meeting with members of the Black Coalition, the group that was organizing the mass-violence that was to come the following week, King wrote a letter to his friend, the chiropractor James J. Watson, detailing his problems with the chiropractic profession. Watson immediately passed the information on to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who in turn arranged to see Dr. Sidney Lewis for treatment. In this letter Watson expressed concern about King's health and was dismayed that King had not been able to see an osteopath. King responded, "It is no objection in my opinion for you to give me the benefits of your skill in a medical sense, but not as an aid of the spirit; in other words, not to help me keep still [emphasis added]." At the time of the interview with Sidney Lewis in 1967, Dr. King lived with a chronic, degenerative disease known as syphilis that was affecting his hips because of a syphilis-related urinary tract infection.

If the letter is any indication, it might have been something Dr. Watson would not be able to ignore. Despite the evidence that was presented in this letter to him and the medical facts that showed how King's condition was not improving, in the letter King expressed his hope that Sidney Lewis might cure him
