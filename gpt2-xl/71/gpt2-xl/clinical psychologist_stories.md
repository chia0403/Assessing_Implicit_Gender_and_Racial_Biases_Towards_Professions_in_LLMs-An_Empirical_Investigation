Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named John Halpern who studied people who had died as a result of strokes. Halpern found that many of them had vivid psychic images (which I'll explain in detail in "Tapping Into the Extra-Sensory Realm" â€“ we don't know much about these, but many people believe that this might be the explanation for UFO-sightings and similar phenomena).

These images are often difficult to explain to others; afterall, people who died in their 60s are not supposed to remember many of their life events the minute they wake up. Halpern suggested that maybe these images were not caused by loss of memory, because people can easily recall and retain many vivid images of things they were not able to experience immediately. The pictures and voices were so compelling that people were unable to ignore them and continued to tell stories about them for years afterwards. Halpern even speculated that these things were from God, suggesting that "if the Bible is to be believed, then all those in heaven would have the ability to 'tune in' to other peoples' dreams and senses without their brains being disturbed."
