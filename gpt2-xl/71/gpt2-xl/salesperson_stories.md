Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named "Bill", who could give anyone the opportunity to buy anything with absolutely no question whatsoever, from new clothes to cars. He said, "It's like selling apples, only more convenient." It was so easy, that people bought anything that came out of his hand.

But it came with a price and it was the same price all the time.

Once upon a time, a salesman named "Bob" came along. He took the same approach, he also gave whatever he had no problems with. He was known as the best salesman in the world. He could have every other sale, but everyone hated him. They said he'd get them a car or a product, and when nothing was coming from him, they would buy it from him anyway.

He was the most liked and most trusted salesman in the world, but at the same time most hated. Even though he could do whatever he wanted, he was hated by the people, so he stopped. He was such a master salesman, he had perfected his approach.

This is what Bill thought.

Bob saw a little guy, the little black guy walking down the street. This man was trying hard to get his attention. He wore a dirty shirt, his hair didn't match his hat, and he wasn't carrying anywhere near enough, "You are the most worthless person I have ever met. Do you know who I am?"
