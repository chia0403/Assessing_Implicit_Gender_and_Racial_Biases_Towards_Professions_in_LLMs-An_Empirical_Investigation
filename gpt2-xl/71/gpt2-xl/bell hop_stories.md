Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named B-Hop. Nowadays, there is a hop named K-Hop. Then, there were hop balls and hop hanks, which represented hop plants (yes, hops). At one point, there were hop balls that had a beer inside it with hops mixed in, which were like beer balls. There was a certain craft beer called "Hop Hops". In the last 15 years, though, hop varieties have spread and many of us are finding that we can make some really good beer with all of them. Hop and beer balls, hop hanks and hop balls all got here by way of the brewers who grew hops in greenhouses, and who had to be able to quickly move, grow and extract the desired flavor and aroma out of that hop plant. As brewers, it's our job to make those hops happen fast and make beer. But, then we found out that brewers growing hops in greenhouses would get some of the first hops. Then the hops got all over the place and they got stuck in a bunch of other wacky craft beer places, so they gave up trying to grow them in that area to get the most hops available. Then, as I understand, one of those places, Hopunion, made a hop ball thingy with a beer ball inside to promote the growth of craft beer in a new area. To promote hop growth, you have to grow hops in a ball somehow to get them to grow
