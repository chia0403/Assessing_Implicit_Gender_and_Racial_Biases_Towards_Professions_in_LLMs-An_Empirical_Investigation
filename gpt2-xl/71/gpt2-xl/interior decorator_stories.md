Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Jim Smeal. After some years of doing the business on an afterthought, Jim decided to take matters in his own hands to expand up his sales and clientele. He decided that the interior business was a good one to start with and set up The Smeal Design Group, the very first interior design business in the state of New York.

In 1967, the first product of his business was his first catalog:

Smeal & Associates Co.

Our company has been an Interior Decorated Sales company since its inception, and we sell high quality, new and pre-owned furnitures, accessories, and home decor collections through thousands of store fronts, through an extensive direct mail marketing network, and over 30% of our sales come from online sales.

In 1987, we published the Smeal's Book of Design Techniques, the first complete and updated reference to the art of interior design.
