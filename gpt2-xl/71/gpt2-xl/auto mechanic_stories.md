Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Jimmy.

Every other weekend, Jimmy worked on a new car. It was Jimmy's birthday every week.

And Jimmy knew where all the secrets were. Jimmy's dad loved to say that, even though they were only secrets if you knew about them. No one else knew. Because Jimmy didn't want to share his knowledge. Jimmy didn't like sharing. Or selling. What Jimmy did want to tell people was things that could be considered secrets, and that Jimmy was pretty good at. He had good instincts.

So over the years, Jimmy accumulated a few cars. One of them, this one, was Jimmy's old mother's old car, a 1970 Buick Riviera.

And when Jimmy's father died, Jimmy had no idea what to go do with all his cars. But one of his new-found friends from work, a guy named Jack, gave some of Jimmy's cars away as he left town, taking the ones he had saved.

Because Jimmy kept his car too. His mother was from New England, but he liked to drive wherever he was. And wherever Jack was going, he was.

That's what Jimmy's grandmother used to say: "It's the things you have in common that separate you. It's the things that connect you."

Jimmy's grandma died while Jimmy was away on that car project. She had no way of looking after her
