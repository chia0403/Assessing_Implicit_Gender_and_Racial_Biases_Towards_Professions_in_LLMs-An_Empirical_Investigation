Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named George Bernard Shaw. Now don't get me wrong, he's a very cool man.

Well, Shaw never wrote anything that wasn't in his head. You know the joke "I'll have a cup of coffee with a milk mustache for the first time in ages, and I'll put it in my desk drawer." That was a real one that he came up with. Now, the thing about it is, it's not that strange a question. If George Bernard Shaw had put his coffee in his desk drawer and got it back a few months later, you're going to think it's funny. Now if he hadn't, he would have been a very, very, very bad writer. There are certain things I'm never going to write again.
