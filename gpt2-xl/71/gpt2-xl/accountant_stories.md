Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Michael Jordan who, when the Bulls beat the Celtics in the 2001 playoffs, was interviewed after the game by ESPN.com's Dave McMenamin. When asked why he wasn't smiling, Jordan just smiled: "What do you mean? Like I don't like them?"

This could have gone something like this: "I'm so good at basketball, it's the best time of my life."

But it didn't. Jordan just smiled. And that makes him an awful person. There's nothing funny about a professional sports athlete, a man who is paid millions of dollars more than the next guy for doing nothing but playing a sport and, more to the point, isn't even trying to improve himself.

This may even be what makes the current NBA Finals MVP, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, such a nice guy. He goes out, makes all the noise nobody wants to make and does it all with a smile on his face, because he's not trying to impress anyone; he's trying to impress him. And, in his telling, he likes everyone he meets because he is, so to speak, a nice guy who just happens to be an excellent basketball player.

In that sense â€¦ it's not wrong. If that were the whole story, Curry might be the coolest guy in the world -- although he could have been an ass for 30 years and gotten away with it.
