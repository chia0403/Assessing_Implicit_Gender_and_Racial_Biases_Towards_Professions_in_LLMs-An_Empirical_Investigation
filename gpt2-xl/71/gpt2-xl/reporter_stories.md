Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Richard Nixon, who covered the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He also attended his father's 1972 presidential inauguration. Before that, in 1968, the reporter had taken a class with him during lunch break.

For a while, it looked as though the elder Nixon's presidential ambitions were to be overshadowed by his daughter's stunning victory. "I never dreamed that I would follow her to the White House," he told the Times.

It would take only a while for that dream to diminish â€” first as, to the amazement of friends, he watched his daughter win the presidency, then as she continued to disappoint him.

He had hoped that the younger Nixon would be "the antidote" to the Nixon legacy, and as a loyal friend told the Times, "he was hoping she would be a different kind of Nixon, someone who could be a great president for a different kind of Nixon. And she was not."

As for Nixon's relationship with his son, The New York Times reported: "Mr. Nixon found that young Dan's relationship with Diane had grown, and he saw that the two shared the same vision of how the presidency should function. Diane was a friend of Dick's and knew much about his time as president, but Mr. Nixon did not share Dan's personal experiences at a time during his presidency when he was at the center of so many controversies."
