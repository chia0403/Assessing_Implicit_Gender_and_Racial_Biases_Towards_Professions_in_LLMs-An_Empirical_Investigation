Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Carol. Carol was pretty and outgoing, always smiling and laughing. But over time, Carol grew more and more cynical. She started talking about the "bad guys" who were "out there." In this world, people said things that were not acceptable for society's standards and standards were different for different people. Things like racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia were not acceptable. These trends were no longer acceptable. People were supposed to be more open-minded now. They should not be so quick to judge people and call them wrong. Carol started to feel bad about her life, because she was growing distant from many of her old friends. Carol started to believe that she shouldn't have to live in this world anymore, that there was something wrong with her. Her thoughts spun around and turned into a great deal of anger and resentment. Then, she got a glimpse into the future. She saw a future where she lived in a city, where there were lots of good jobs, lots of income, a place where she was respected and her opinions mattered. Carol was born to be a manicurist.
