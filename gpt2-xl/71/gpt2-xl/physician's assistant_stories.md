Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Harold Huggins. According to his family, the beloved young man lost his life as a result of heart disease. Harold was only 22 when he lost his life to heart disease.


He wasn't even doing anything that was particularly hard to do at the time, he was just having a good time. He took walks around the neighborhood, played in the backyard, and he even played basketball with the kids. It was because I saw him on my little walk home from the store one night with his friends. They were playing around and one of his friends threw a brick at him. I ran over and saw him with the blood spattered on him. I couldn't believe that he was going to die, he seemed just like he always did. I think about Harold all the time. I have a picture of him on my wall. In any event, this man lost his life to death. He was a great guy, always had a smile on his face and was totally devoted to work. It's not easy for a young man to lose his life to something so tragic, I lost my father to heart disease three years ago. He was 51.


I thought a lot about Harold when he died. I was just about to come home from a trip and I was thinking, "Well, I guess he's out for the night". But then I realized he is now with God. He's with his family
