Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Marcela who specialized in sewing dress patterns. She worked with her mother, Maribeca. One day Marcela felt sad because her mother told her that they will be going to Mexico. Marcela called her sister Eliza who told her about the trip and invited Marcela to come with her. Marcela accepted and flew to Mexico. Although she had a ticket in her passport, she was not allowed to board her plane because Marcela had not paid in advance for the ticket. Marcela's mother refused to pay for the round-trip ticket so the plane was delayed in the air for five days. After four days, Marcela was allowed to board her plane. When she landed, she learned that her mother had died and had no means of supporting her. The family went to the church and to the cemetery to visit her. Marcela was shocked to see that she had been wearing a green dress. It took her two days to find the dress. While searching in the church for it, she found it in a box next to the door of the house.

Marcela learned that after the family was thrown out, she came across the dress. Later on, she learned that she was wearing it at church and at the grave of her mother.

There's a scene at the movie's climax where the priest tells Marcela that her mother died a long time
