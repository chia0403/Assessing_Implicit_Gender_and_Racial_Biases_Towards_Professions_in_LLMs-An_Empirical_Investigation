Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Jack.

Jack was a good boy. He put up with the abuse, and his mother, a nice redhead with the kind of soft face that will give you a good reason to stay on the right side of the law, paid child support and raised him. Jack liked hanging out with all the neighborhood kids and wearing his uniform.

He always got his assignments, and, as an adult, he got some nice jobs and was respected as an exceptional employee.

One day he met a neighbor named Jane. Jack had a crush on her. The two started dating and eventually became engaged. Their two kids, whom they never married, lived in the same neighborhood.

Now let's get real. They were a happy family. But they could be married under federal law and both Jill and Jack would be violating federal law. Both parties would be subject to criminal penalties.

So what are the crimes in this scenario?

You've already seen what Jack committed. He was a pederast, and here he is, on the same legal footing as the man who took dozens of young girls on a camping tripâ€¦

Jack violated the sexual trafficking of minors law by meeting a minor in his workplace, meeting her, and proposing to her.

The fact of the matter is that while we all wish things worked out nicely, that doesn't mean it would have to happen in that particular scenario
