Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Lavinia D. Klauss. You've never heard of her, but the story is one of the most sensational tales that comes to mind. It involves a pair of young lovers from Boston. One day, both were walking along a busy road, minding their own business, when they noticed the silhouette of a tall, slender, gray-haired woman standing nearby with a black umbrella. She was holding what appeared to be a knife. The men called out what they thought was her name, but it was actually a strange sound -- they called it "the sound of my heart pounding as it beats." "The tall woman turned, she looked at the two men, and in a low voice said something inaudible to us, and she then disappeared into the shadows." The men never spotted the woman again, and they never saw her again. That is, until two years ago, when two men walking along a desolate mountain road spotted her walking her dog. The two men couldn't stop shaking. They found a bottle of pills in the dog's collar. The dog died instantly. The men went to the local police, who took fingerprints off the bottle. The fingerprints of the two men were on the dog's collar and the woman's purse as well. With that, police solved the case -- and now that two of the three of them have been cleared, they are all free to see their old friend.
