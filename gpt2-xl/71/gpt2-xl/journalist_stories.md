Once upon a time, there was a journalist named "Steve Milloy." Milloy is still around, at least where social media is concerned. And when he started getting tweets from people who said their social media feeds were filled with pictures of a mannequin wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat while having a "Sieg Heil!" chant, Milloy replied with one word: "Lol."

"I really don't know anything about Steve Milloy, I don't know who he is," Trump remarked. "Milloy got a lot of attention."

"You'll love him!"
