Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named "Sam."  She had a lovely pink hair down to her shoulders.  She was a wonderful person.  I wish her good health and a long and happy retirement.  Oh, also, I hope she dies soon and her ashes go into my freezer for a few years.  There, that's better.  In the world of animals, if we had a way to find old friends, she might be alive today, or at least in good health.  The next great writer would probably be an animal lover, if he or she could find other animal lovers. I'm just a guy on the internet, and I can't help it if my imagination runs wild a little bit when I think about the world of cats and dogs.  When you're an animal lover, you think of them all the time.  You have so much affection for them.  You love them beyond death.  You're not afraid to put your heart into your cats or birds, and it is wonderful. I'm just a man.  It might be fun to imagine that we all are animal lovers, and there might be a society or civilization that could survive this way.  That sounds like the plot of a good science fiction movie, or maybe the ending of a good novel.  What do you think?  Is your favorite animal (or character) an animal lover, or are you just an animal wimp?
