Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named Mr. X. For some time, you would see Mr. X at the park, taking care of kids and asking them what they were trying not to do, what they really wanted from their hair-style, or what they missed about their own hair. I always smiled as this strange, bald guy seemed to know everything about me, just from my hair and the way I walked. But lately he's been a little... out of the loop and the last time I saw him was when he asked me to cut my hair.

This experience reminded me how much I missed my old hair.

Mr. X's is a shop that sells pretty much only manly but really good quality hair-styles; men's style as well as women's. If I wanted something really short and cute, as short as it gets, Mr. X was the place for me. I couldn't afford a pair of cute men's shoes and I had only one pair of women's shoes at home, so I went out one day and bought some for him. But unfortunately, Mr. X was a male shop, so not surprisingly the only thing Mr. X gave me was a package of "futuristic" highlighters. He said a lady from the company was coming in the next day, and as it often happens when I visit a hair-dye shop, I was expecting someone nice.
