Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Michael Cimino (he made an excellent director, and so I love him). I am sure there were other theatrical directors of equal talent in Hollywood, but for the sake of argument we'll go with Cimino. Well, guess who played in The Sorrow and the Pity? Michael Cimino! Guess who played in The Wild Years? Michael Cimino! We all know who the great Robert De Niro is, right? Right? No, that's a big, huge lie. Robert De Niro does not, in fact, play in any of the "Good Vibrations" movies. In fact, De Niro's most memorable and best known performance in movies was on the Oscar winning movie Network. As you can see, the story about Michael Cimino playing in The Sorrow and the Pity, which I mentioned earlier, is total lie. This is one of those lies people tell because it's an easy way to get attention. So if you're talking about an old story about Michael Cimino being in a scene with Jimmy Dean, you can call it that. Because who wouldn't know about Cimino playing in "That's Entertainment". But if you're talking about the movie that was made about Jimmy Dean ("That's Entertainment"), it's just an old school, low budget, big studio, crappy remake of a movie about a guy who tries to be a TV show
