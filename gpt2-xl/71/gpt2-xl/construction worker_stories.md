Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named George. He worked at a place called the Great Wall of China. His job was to build long columns to support the great walls of his great country. In order to get there, George had to climb over the great walls and along the scaffolding that lined the way to the top. To add even more difficulties, George had to climb high in order to get to the platform where he was supposed to lay the foundation on which he would be standing. After a long day of work, George was so exhausted that he fell down the stairs, and then fell down the chimney. When he got down, the scaffolding was still there, so he had to re- climb down the staircases. Once more, the scaffolding was still there, so he had to climb to the very top of it and begin again.

When George began again, there were no more columns to support the scaffolding, so he had to climb even higher. Only one time could he be sure the scaffolding would be there as he climbed over the towers of the Great Wall of China. He climbed to the top, and once more the scaffolding was still there, so he had to climb down the staircases.

This was becoming a very tedious, and at last George got tired of climbing. He decided to give up and go home. He decided that after all, it was not the scaffolding that was holding up his job
