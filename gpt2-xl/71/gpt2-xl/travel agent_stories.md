Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named William B. McFarland, Jr. who was looking for the cheapest airline tickets for his customers. In time, he became the travel industry's greatest money maker. On his websites, the site links to his own travel advice, to his customers' travel advice, and to his family travel advice. All of his clients are people who are paying him for advice, and he profits if they choose to continue to rely on his advice and travel advice.

McFarland's business model is what's known in the travel industry as a loyalty program: to get his customers to continue to use his travel advice and his advice to continue to use his business advice and his advice that keeps their business business.

That's where the trouble lies.

When you take a close look at his website, you'll see it's full of ads, and not only ads, but ads for his book, speeches and speaking engagements, and personal endorsements of all the products he and his clients use. McFarland uses that advertising to build his company, to maintain his high level of customer service, and to keep his employees dependent on his advice and his advice that keeps their jobs by keeping them from quitting.

McFarland's customers can get a good sense of how much he's made from them by going to the "Customer Relations" section of his website. You'll see that he collects hundreds of thousands of dollars each month
