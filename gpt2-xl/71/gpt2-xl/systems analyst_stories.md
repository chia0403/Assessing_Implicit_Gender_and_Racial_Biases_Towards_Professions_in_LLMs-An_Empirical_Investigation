Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Greg Bader. In the early 1990s, he would routinely break down some of the company's big systems – some of which were really complicated – in order to determine what the company was doing wrong. A few years back, Greg gave a talk at the Hackers on Planet Earth meeting, and the talk got a lot of buzz.

A few years later, Microsoft purchased his company, and they renamed the company Greg Bader Group. It's one of the few companies from the early 1990s that still exists, and their flagship product is a "computer vision" application that was used in almost every Windows NT operating system release and is still used in newer Windows OSes.

In this blog post, I show how I learned to use Microsoft's computer vision application, and the basic techniques that developers can take advantage of. It's not a pretty picture, and to be honest, Microsoft probably would not have cared about my personal hacking techniques if it had known what I would reveal. However, they made some decisions that probably led to this situation, and Microsoft is still facing lawsuits related to their "hacking" behavior a decade later.

First, a bit of history

Greg has been working with Microsoft for over two decades, and has been working in the computer vision industry since the early '90s, when he started at the Xerox Corporation. That company was an early supplier of laser-focused optics
