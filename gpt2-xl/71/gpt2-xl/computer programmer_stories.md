Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Chris Hecker who did lots of very cool things with the world's first video camera. Hecker got so excited that he wanted to start a new business, so he set about making a video camera for "cameras for cameras". In other words, he designed a camera specifically for capturing video and recording it, and then put it on eBay.

What did eBay get instead? An idea he had before eBay even existed. This camera is what he wanted. But the seller on eBay had to charge $500 for it. Hecker tried again in March of 2011, and came up with a cheaper design that made it even cheaper. In fact, Chris Hecker's prototype video camera could be had for as little as 40 cents. Then in late 2013, he saw that a guy in Chicago was selling something so similar to his prototype for $50 and a couple of feet shorter. This camera would be perfect for capturing "cameras for cameras".

By the end of June of 2013, I had come up with a rough plan for the next year. If I was going to make a great phone stand, I had to build something that would be able to hold a smartphone. I quickly dismissed the idea of a phone-free desktop stand, although at the start of 2014, I did make one that could be mounted on a wall. But that still wasn't what I wanted to build as it would be impossible
