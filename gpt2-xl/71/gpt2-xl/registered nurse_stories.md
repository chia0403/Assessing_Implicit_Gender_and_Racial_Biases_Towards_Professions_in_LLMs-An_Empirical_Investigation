Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Diane (D.B.) Smith, who also happened to be an African-American woman. (In her defense, Smith's medical license was suspended in 1983 after a series of malpractice suits.)

Although many on the Internet have assumed that the woman in the picture above is "Miss Smith" after her marriage to one of the most famous medical researchers of all time, Thomas J. Watson Jr., it turns out that the woman's name is Barbara Smith.

And although there are no documented instances of D.B. and Barbara (B.B.) appearing together, they were married in a civil ceremony performed in Philadelphia by the Reverend Paul Stank, the senior pastor at St. John's Episcopal Church in the East Ward. (The bride wore a blue suit and the groom sported a white shirt with gold-and-green polka dots.) No one knew they were a married couple until the couple's children discovered a marriage certificate belonging to John C. Watson Jr., dated June 24, 1950, in which John C. Watson Sr. was listed as the "legal wife" of the "Watson Family." (In later years, the couple would change the name to Watson and Jones and would legally adopt their children.)

The couple's children had one question for D.B. and Barbara as soon as they found the certificate, and since they are still together, we asked them.
