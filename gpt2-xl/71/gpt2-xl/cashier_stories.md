Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Debbie. She was so kind to this guy named Mark and gave him a bottle of some kind of alcohol. When you told Mark that you had to pay the money, he looked at Debbie and said, "You don't understand. We are just friends." And Debbie said, "Look, they're just friends," and hung up the phone. Mark and Debbie were close and he called Debbie back to say, "You have no idea how hard I've worked on that bottle. I worked non-stop." They made a commitment to each other, and if they were going through something tough, Debbie would ask Mark for advice.

Mark's life changed when Debbie invited him to dinner when she found out he was divorced. It just seemed right that Mark should go out and celebrate this event. He decided to take Debbie out to dinner for one, but things weren't going quite as smoothly as planned. Debbie asked Mark a really sensitive question: "What would you do if you found out a girl was pregnant? Would you stay in bed with her to see if she could handle the baby?" Mark thought about it for a bit, and said. "I wouldn't stay in bed with her, but in theory, I wouldn't leave her just because she was pregnant."

What Debbie saw in Mark was so much more than he was letting her see and yet, she wanted him to stay in the same bed, too.
