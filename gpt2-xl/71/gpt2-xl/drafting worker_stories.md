Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Toni, who was in charge of the development of the new draft. He had a big project: to take all the bad ideas (like making all the game's enemies female) and dump them into a game full of male heroes with long hair and sunglasses and no beards. This game would be called Shadow Warrior, and it was going to be released during the first quarter of 2005. The first draft of new, badass character ideas, the so-called 'Shadow Project', came back with some promising news.

There were, according to the people who were working on the project, about 10,000 words in total in the first draft, and they hoped that at least half of them would make the cut. Half of what? The idea for Samus' main weapon, the infamous Screw Attack? The idea for her suit, which looked like a heavy armor-plated catamaran from the back, but was actually powered by wind and water?

The original concept art for Samus' suit looked like this.


Well, most of it.


That was when Toni gave the task to someone else, but that someone had a strange name: Dave L. Bowers. He was a senior writer on the project, and it was his idea that 'dude' be removed from the game's title and that Samus be transformed into a cyborg-fied version of herself known
