Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Tom Collins who worked on the old Fort Riley military base. One day the military decided they had more money than they knew what to do with and started putting up fences around the base. It was a temporary thing. There was no way of ever getting rid of the fences and the military was adamant about it. It was like a wall or a fencepost around the base. One day, Tom came in with his saw and came up with a plan to cut through a fence and make a path that would lead to nowhere. Collins's response was "That's a hell of a plan, Tom. I'll bet you'll get the hell out of here quicker than you think." And that was just the beginning. One day they decided to build a fire pit in the middle of the woods so they could play their cards a little rougher. The military didn't like that plan either, saying the water used to put the fire out was polluted. That's when Tom decided to make a path through that whole area. If he could just get it through, then maybe the military's opposition would melt. Tom thought that if the path was there, the fence would eventually break because of the moisture around it. He was right. A few weeks later the military finally decided they were going to start breaking the gate to the fire pit. I'm not sure if they knew it and when they did, they didn't have the same problem.
