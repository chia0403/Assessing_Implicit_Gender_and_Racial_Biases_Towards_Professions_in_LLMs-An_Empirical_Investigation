Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named Dr. T.D. Jones. He's a strange old bag, and like many strange old bags he gets on my nerves, so if I was to take a crack at dissecting him, that might be a fun idea. He is a professional, although like most professional guys, his training involves a long stint of working in a factory where he can do nothing but watch. So instead of getting him the actual training in an actual school, we are going to get him some more general, pseudo-professional, 'therapy.' Dr. Jones is a big fan of "mindfulness" and he encourages you to "go slow," go "slow when you feel the need," and all the rest to "create space" between you and your suffering. "We all need space to practice." (How I love these dudes. Don't they get it?) He also talks about "bias in your thinking" and the need for awareness. He never seems entirely relaxed at all and is like the last guy you want to call for help. (Well, unless you really, really, really, really need his help.) He's a good therapist as far as I can tell, and that's about it. In any case, all the general and pseudo-therapeutic nonsense that's been taught in therapy seminars for the last 60 years.

Anyway, back to being a sad asshole again, and I've been sitting
