Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Peter who took a keen interest in the study of exercise methodology and had a knack of improving his students' abilities. After many years in the business, he eventually realized he was just an overpaid salesperson who didn't understand exercise mechanics or how to teach proper exercise technique. And so he began teaching himself... and his students.

We'll start with a great exercise technique known as the "three-pound dumbbell sit-ups", a method that works very well for people who are overweight or have limitations with mobility.

"Three-pound dumbbell sit-ups should be performed with the legs completely in suspension; with the hands slightly wider than shoulder width. This should be done in the direction of gravity." Source: http://www.exercise-science.com/training/couples/sit-ups.htm

With the legs fully in suspension, perform three sets of sit-ups (at a speed no more than 30 repetitions per set to stimulate the muscles and get the blood flowing, and no more than 3-5 minutes total to stimulate the "gluteus medialis"). Do this exercise 3 times a week for 5-7 days per week. Take any additional days or weeks off if required. Remember to drink plenty of fluids to maintain hydration.

This workout will require you to use a very low load (10-15% of your maximum-effort) with
