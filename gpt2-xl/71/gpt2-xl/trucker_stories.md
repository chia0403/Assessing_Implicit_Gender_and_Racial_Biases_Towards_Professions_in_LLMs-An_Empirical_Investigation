Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Larry on the road. His truck had broken down once and then he'd bought another one. And then on that same second trip, on that same day in the same town, that same trucker had another break, another repair. It happened so often he lost count.

"It's just like a routine, it's all that is," Larry reasoned. "One truck, one break, one repair, one broken windshield, one radiator, one tire and that's it."

Eventually, the trucker was tired of the routine so he decided to stop running his broken and repaired truck in the first place. After all, Larry liked his truck so he was prepared to take it in for an overhaul.

Unfortunately, his mechanic informed him that the old truck didn't have the right parts. A "new" truck wouldn't have the same parts. In fact, Larry's "new" truck wasn't quite complete either. He didn't even know that the old truck existed.

He was about to toss the old car into the back of his shop pickup so he could start over and find a new truck to replace it with when there was this brilliant idea that struck him. Since his shop had its own auto body shop onsite, the next time he needed to fix a broken car, Larry could just come to the body shop and start the job. And it would be so much cheaper.
