Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named John S. Nash. He wanted to solve a problem the world found very hard to deal with, called "the black-box problem, or the problem of unplugging an electric power plant's black box." Nash found that, by unplugging the black box (which, recall, was designed to be plugged in), he was able to recover the exact time of the damage to the power plant!

It was a fascinating paper, and I think it had been well known by some at least, before Nash's paper. Now, in the wake of the huge Sony hack that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, many have decided to revive Nash's paper from the archives, to show how even a paper like this can be used to do the wrong thing.

Let me be clear.

While I'm happy that people have done their own research on the black box problem, I'd take what I've always said to heart: I think that this paper, while it's a nice illustration of the problem and what it entails, was not the most important paper on the black box problem of all time, and should not be used as an example for this specific situation. It might help us to see what we don't know, but that is, after all, the point of an example, and is not meant to be the ultimate decision making tool in a black box world.
