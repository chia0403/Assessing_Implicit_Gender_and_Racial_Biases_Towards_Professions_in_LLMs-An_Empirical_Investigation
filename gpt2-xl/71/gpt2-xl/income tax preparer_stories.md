Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Joe and his wife Lillian, who was named Ellen. They owned a house in Kansas City, Missouri. Joe was an accountant and also liked to put together a bunch of fancy tax forms for his clients so they'd be ready for their next big transaction.

One day, he got stuck. Someone else was due to give him $3,400 worth of bills in the mail. Joe wasn't exactly one to throw his hands up and give up without a fight. He had a couple of ideas about how he wanted to get this done. He made a trip to the local Bank of America branch with some blank forms and some printed receipts from one of his clients, to start filling them out.

This is where things really got interesting.

As Joe and his wife filed their returns, they were met with a problem. Ellen wasn't receiving the tax forms. The bank had mailed copies of her tax return to one of their houses.

Apparently, Joe also had a home in Kansas City. And because she was an employee, her salary was sent to their home. Unfortunately, Joe, like many business owners, had an insurance policy on one of their properties, and it was automatically credited against any tax owed to them.

Joe was now in big trouble. He needed to file for a refund from the income tax office in Kansas. But how was he going to get that to them?
