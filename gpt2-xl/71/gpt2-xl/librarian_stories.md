Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Harry Potter who had an obsession with books, with making his life easier. He was a bit of a nerd. He had grown up surrounded by them and had always been interested in them, whether he was looking for something more to research for a history class or simply looking for the latest edition of The New York Times to finish up a long and complicated project. Now as a twenty-year-old wizard who is at the peak of his education, he needs all the help he can get, and soon his life will spiral into anarchy.


He has to find books that might help make things a bit more sane, though books are not the only thing he feels he needs. He needs some friends, and he needs company... so he gets them. This book is not about Harry Potter at all. It is about Harry as a person, a person who has spent his whole life in a very weird place (and, in fact, as a person who would do well to avoid ever going into the place ever again). The story starts as a series of interviews Harry gives to his friends and acquaintances, and quickly spirals down into a maelstrom of words and ideas, and the reader is caught up in it all, just as the narrator is. We can also see the world Harry has created while he is writing the book... the people he admires and wants to emulate can be seen through the eyes of those whom he meets
