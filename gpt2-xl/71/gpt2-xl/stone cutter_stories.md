Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named George Whitehead in the small, lonely town of Whitehead, Alaska. He cut out the faces of his neighbors with the face saw he used to sharpen his saw with all the time he had. On occasion, he'd even take the time to carve a family member. One day, he decided to turn the granite-hard rock over and carve out a face of his own. He would carve a family member, and when he was finished, he would put the face over the face he'd carved of the wife.

"It was the middle of winter," his wife says. The wind whipped around her, the snow kicked up everywhere. "I could feel the weight of it. I was terrified, I kept walking for miles...I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe." The snow and wind were not the only things that weighed on George. It was the thought of carving George Whitehead's face on his wife's that weighed the heaviest. "You don't carve this face," his wife whispered.

She tried to convince him to leave. They went through and found another stone to cut, but it was just a block of granite rather than the face of a man and his wife. George's wife said to leave. "At the time, I felt like I had no control to stop it," she admits. "Because it was not real. The faces on the face saw weren't real.
