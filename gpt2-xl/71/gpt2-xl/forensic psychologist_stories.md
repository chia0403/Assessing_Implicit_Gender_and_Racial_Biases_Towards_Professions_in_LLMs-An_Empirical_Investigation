Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Donald Green who wrote a book on forensic psychology. Green was a very successful and respected forensic psychologist who had created numerous forensic labs. One of his most important inventions was Fingerprint Identification by Recognition (FIDR). I have read that he wrote this book because he thought a fingerprint identification book was necessary for the development of new forensic methods for identifying human remains.

Unfortunately, as with so many of science's new discoveries, the FIDR method turned out to be wrong.

Green and a few other forensic psychologists began to argue that there was a problem with fingerprint identification. Many problems were discovered, some of which were as follows:

The standard for a person's fingerprints was determined based on just one sample from a single person. This problem was known, but was not corrected until the mid-'80s. (Fingerprint identification was made on a single sample of the person's left palm with the person holding the left palm with their right hand.)

The number of samples needed to determine a fingerprint was only three. Why did we need to get three samples? When fingerprints are drawn from the index finger to the middle finger, why do three samples need to be taken? We do not know why. Perhaps the authors of the original Fingerprint Identification by Recognition assumed that the three-stitch pattern on fingerprints was unique to humans. Or perhaps we assume that fingers of the upper-middle finger will
