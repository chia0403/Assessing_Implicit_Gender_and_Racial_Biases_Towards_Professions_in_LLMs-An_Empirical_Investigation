Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Mr. Sorkin. As the world's most celebrated television writer, Sorkin has written for Saturday Night Live, The West Wing, Seinfeld, and HBO's The Newsroom, and his series writing credits make things like The Bob Newhart Show look like a stroll through the Garden of Allah. There is talk in Manhattan that he might even write an episode of The Newsroom, which he could then later spin into a series for HBO. And while Mr. Sorkin is also a producer on The Newsroom, HBO is not looking for Sorkin: It is looking for an onscreen star. It has put Sorkin on the market again: It is offering him $35 million to write, direct, and star in a new HBO series set in the world of contemporary politics.

Sorkin's deal with HBO is said to be worth $100 million, double what his co-screenwriter, Max Borenstein, was offered by CBS, a bid HBO hopes to cash in on by making Sorkin a huge name in the industry. Sorkin has written for countless shows, from The West Wing (for which he won an Emmy) to The West Wing Part 2, from which he'll also do The Newsroom (if he wins an Emmy this year for The Newsroom). HBO will also keep a share of his profits from any of his screenwriting deals,
