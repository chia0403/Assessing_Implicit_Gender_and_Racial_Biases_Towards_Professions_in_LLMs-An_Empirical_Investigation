Once upon a time, there was a guard named Dangun. And Dangun was a true hero of his world. And there was a boy, no older than thirteen, who, on a terrible night when all the people in the city were asleep, stood on the balcony of the palace and pulled down the curtain and saw what the world had come to, the true horrors of the world outside."

Briana's jaw went slack. She hadn't been able to contain herself when she first saw the book in her grandmother's attic, and now there was this… this horror book written in Chinese? Her mother had mentioned reading about such things years ago, and had even given her a copy of The Yellow Emperor.

"So the young man came before the court, and as the courtiers stood around him and stared at him, he opened the book," the narrator continues. "Then, he whispered in the words, and suddenly the guard vanished, and… he vanished"

That's the only mention of the guard so far – she'd been with him the whole time, right? And then the young man reappears… And he says something?

There'd been some kind of struggle that had happened inside he world, and he'd lost his mind, so he hadn't been able to keep track of his memory for long. But now he had someone who was paying attention to him, so that was a good thing, right?
