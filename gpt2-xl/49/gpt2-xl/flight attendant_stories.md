Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Carol who is like the flying version of you. She's a sweetheart and one of those people which you'd meet in a cocktail lounge and immediately feel very good knowing she, like you herself, was in some of your relationships. Like one night after work, we came across her at the airport in Hong Kong. She told me that she was working as an English instructor for the airport. She told me that she had been out in the hallway one night with some taxi drivers, when she passed by some of them smoking up on a bar stools, and that she was very nervous because she had never seen the cigarette butts. And suddenly she saw the butt and, well, you see what happened next. She got a lot of comments from some of the people she passed on the street about how lucky she was that she saw that butt. It's a good story, but not entirely accurate. Her greatest fear and worry was that those smoking butts would go missing from the airport. The fact that there were taxi drivers passing that way on their way to the airport was one of the main reasons Carol got up at two, and headed into the airport. She was more worried about the butts of the regular drivers than the occasional butts of taxi drivers. She decided not to return into the airport after that night, but instead headed to a local store to buy a couple of butts, one for herself and one for her
