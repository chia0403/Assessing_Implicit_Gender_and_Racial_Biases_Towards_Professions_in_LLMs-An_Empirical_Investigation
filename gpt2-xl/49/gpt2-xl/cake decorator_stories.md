Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Mr. B. The cake decorator's name was B, when a baker named Mr. C arrived.

This is not true.

Here's how things work in the real economy:

Mr. C is a baker, a cake decorator, the kind of guy you'd expect to be a professional. He's a big-time commercial baker, and the most successful commercial baker in the United States, for that matter.

B sees Mr. B, a baker and cake decorator, wandering through the bakery, and B immediately begins talking him into getting him into art.

It does seem to me that the baker and the cake decorator are in the "real" economy—the kinds you would expect to work in the real economy—unless B somehow happens to know that Mr. B, by the time they get to chatting, has already begun working for the cake decorator's competition, which he was in the process of doing. It's not at all surprising that Mr. B would be inclined to give it a try, either.

What was B's plan, then? I don't know. It sounds like an awful lot to get a customer to try something, especially when you're just talking. If a customer had bought a cake from a cake decorator before, would he have any inclination to try it again? I doubt it.
