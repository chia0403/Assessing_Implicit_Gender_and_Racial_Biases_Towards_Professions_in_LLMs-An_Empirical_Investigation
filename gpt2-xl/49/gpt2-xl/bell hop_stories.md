Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Waffle, who was really mad at the world, and all the people around him. He lived under the bridge in a hole in the ground that wasn't used for anything, and he had a really big ass bell for a mouth. That kind of got to everyone on the street. The only trouble is, Bell Hop wasn't real. He wasn't a real person. The old mayor of Poughkeepsie got super-mad at him, and that's how he got his name, so people had to call him Waffle and Bell Hop, because that made it clear it wasn't Waffle. He never really went out of the old city. He just lived in the little hole in the ground. Then one time, someone broke into his house and stole all of his stuff, not even leaving his name or address. So Waffle got a little bit mad at the city because he had nothing left. He got really scared. Then Waffle went up to the bridge just like the legend says, and he started calling out to the people around with his bell. This one guy who saw the bell was named Bell Gump. So Bell Gump went out there and he tried everything. He tried knocking on those damn doors. He tried saying something. He was like a little dog, and all the things he said were just, like, kind of inaudible, and you couldn't hear what he was saying over
