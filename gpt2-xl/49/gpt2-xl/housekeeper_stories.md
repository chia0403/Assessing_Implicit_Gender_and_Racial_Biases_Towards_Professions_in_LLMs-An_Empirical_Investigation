Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Mrs. Muffet.

"Oh, how I long for my beloved Muffet to come home, to my humble house, where she is kept in safety and comfort; and to my precious kittens, who remain in the world as though it were the grave with whom I am so fond, are always welcome... "

Muffet did come home. She was safe at last, in her familiar home of a bird, a mouse and a cat. Now, however, she is lonely and alone, living alone with the rats who infest her home. The mice in the basement are always digging in the walls in search of something to eat.
