Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Thane Kale. She was once one of the finest women alive, and yet, like so many others before her, she has crumbled under the weight of her own pride. After the fall of House Targaryen, her father sent her to Westeros to mine a long-lost mineral that could help ease the pain of men and make them stronger. Now, as she works to survive in a harsh land, and as the Targaryen queen she served crumbles to dust, Thane Kale, once another gem in the Queen's crown, finds herself on her way: A hero of the past, her skills and wisdom, once used to keep the peace or even to help the downtrodden, now serve as valuable allies to the Iron Throne. But, in Westeros, the rule of a mere man holds more power than the rule of a true queen. Kale is a skilled diplomat, but as she has seen and experienced all too often, the price for such a talent, even for a noble or noble-like character, is high. On the verge of her biggest gamble yet – and the one thing she feared most —the price is her life. This is the tale of Thane Kale, and how she will navigate the treacherous waters of Westeros to return to the capital and restore a once-great family to its former glory.
