Once upon a time, there was a architect named Michael L. Osterhout, who was a very bad planner. He designed the Los Angeles Times building, now a Los Angeles Times and Orange County Register building. It was horrible. And he was forced back in. It was a case of going forward and backward. You go forward and backward. And the building was always designed to the back of what was being built. It had very little space for people walking around. So the idea that you can do that with retail space, they're not going to be interested.

JW: As we head into 2016, they seem to be more interested in retailing, but do you feel that's the way our city evolves?

ML: And one of the nice things about that is when they see we need parking lot development, they can say "That's what you should be doing, if we're going to survive," because they know that's the way people want to get to and from their transit. I think it's not so much the street design and the sidewalk design. It's not the street design or sidewalk design. It's, "How do we make it easier for people to get where they want to go?" And I think the way we've designed downtown, in addition to the way they've designed the streets and sidewalks and the parking, is to make it less congested. People want lower-cost, better transportation options than what they have now
