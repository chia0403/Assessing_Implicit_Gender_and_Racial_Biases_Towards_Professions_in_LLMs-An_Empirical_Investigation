Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Robert Raskin who used to work as a staff counselor at one of the first psychiatric hospitals in the country in the '50s.

In a recent interview, he shared a funny story about a patient named Fred and his therapist's encounter with this patient.

"When I first met Fred I was kind of skeptical," Raskin says. "Not of the case but of the therapist because he was very nervous."

The patient was a man in his late thirties living in the same room as Fred. Fred, like Raskin, was a psychologist at the time. Fred, a very intelligent man and a psychologist himself, had a rather unusual case.

"Fred had been in a bad relationship and started drinking heavily," he said. "He became violently abusive to his partner, which is why she broke off her relationship with him."

Drinking heavily, it turned out, was one of the symptoms of schizophrenia. To his surprise, the patient's abusive behavior was somehow connected to the drinking.

"It was so bizarre," Dr. Raskin says. "That's what made me curious."

Raskin read the patient's psychiatrist's notes and found out that the psychiatrist had also been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

"To this day, no one has been able to link the drinking to schizophrenia," he said. "I never believed it.
