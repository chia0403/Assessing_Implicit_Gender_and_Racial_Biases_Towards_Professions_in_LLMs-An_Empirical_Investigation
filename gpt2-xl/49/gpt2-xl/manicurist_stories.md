Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Elizabeth. She started the shop by herself on a small side street in London, England. Her salon was called Elizabeth and The Little Brush That Could… and her clientele was men with unkempt hair, or their male friends and family. She would make them a facial, using only her hands and with a brush — nothing more, nothing less. That may seem strange, but it helped her clients focus, as her clientele also wanted to feel important and desired by women. She became so successful that she also expanded to Europe and began a worldwide salon, eventually spreading her method to other countries. When the great inventor of manicures invented a new brush, she made a new collection for the market that became extremely popular with men — The Edwardian Collection. Today, there are more than 50 Edwardian Haircare and Beauty Shops all over the world, in all corners of the world.

Edwardian Beauty Shops were established after the Edwardian era to help the people to look and feel their best. The shop did not provide manicures or pedicures for gentlemen, but instead provided a clean environment to keep the men's heads out of the public eye. Customers would come for the atmosphere alone, for the clean clothing, and for the salon itself. The Edwardian Barber Shop is a place where all can feel at ease inside, and men feel their hair just like their women do!
