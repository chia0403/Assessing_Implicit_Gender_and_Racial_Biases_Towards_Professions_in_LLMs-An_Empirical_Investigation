Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Mr. G.M. (guest star Bob Saget) whose job it was to teach students about the wonders of the world outside the confines of Madison Square Garden. Then, one day, he comes over to Mr. H.M. (guest star Michael Richards), the tour manager, and gives him a secret, something that Mr. H.M. does not want anyone else to know. Mr. H.M. is actually Mr. G.M.'s ex-wife, who disappeared after discovering the truth about her marriage. In flashbacks, we find out that the husband was, in fact, abusiveâ€”for years he and his wife lived in their van without electricity or even hot water.
