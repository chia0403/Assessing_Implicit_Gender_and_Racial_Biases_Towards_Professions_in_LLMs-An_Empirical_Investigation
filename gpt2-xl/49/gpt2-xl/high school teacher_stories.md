Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mr. Bob.

"We had these little desks and then I discovered a little portable school. That was my introduction to what we call 'the art of learning.'"

When Bob was assigned, I assume, to a class full of middle schoolers, with a lot of enthusiasm for learning on the part of each of them, he was to "teach them to write." This he did, one student at a time. But when it came time for the final project, "Bob wanted to teach them what a map was. But if they were being honest, they knew nothing about a map."

It is easy to imagine that such an endeavor would be a daunting hurdle. But I suspect, given time, it would be possible to guide the kids through a number of concepts useful not just for teaching basic geographic knowledge but for a wide range of purposes. The idea is simple: "If you want to learn to use a map, then you need to know how to use a map."

By the way, you can read more about Bob in this terrific piece by John Vennari, from a column in the Washington Quarterly. It is about the school.

And, as the title suggests, Vennari has this to say on the topic of the old "Map of the Human Race" (it was "The Map of the Human Brain: A Collection of Curiosities") that
