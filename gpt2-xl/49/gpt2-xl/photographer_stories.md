Once upon a time, there was a photographer named J. Rottenberg, whose photographs were the dominant image on the cover of the Sunday newspaper. His photographs were mostly black and white: two images of the same person, one dark and one light, and each showing the same person doing something different. The photographer would make the same pose. The dark one would turn around first and the light one would turn around first. It was called "black and white." The pictures of Mr. Rottenberg are today used as a model for many other photographers and, at times, for the press as well. His work can be seen as a model for both the black and white images of the twentieth century and the photographic art of the past century.

Today, of course, there is quite a bit more to being a photographer. Photography has become a more technical process as well as more visual. Most professional photographers are not interested solely in black and white, and have other subjects in their photos. The photographer, the producer of the image he or she has shot, now takes color pictures as well. I would consider my photographs to be somewhere in-between a black and white and color image.

I would like to add one more element to the black and white category. I don't know if it has any relevance to how people remember or represent what was around them at the time. It is as if in the past one looked to the same people, places, and situations when
