Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Nancy Johnson, and a great deal of the advice she and other dietitians were giving out was based upon data from animal experiments, but then a doctor named John Yudkin and a number of colleagues published a paper in 1931 saying that this data was crap.

Well, it's all crap, except for one little thing: A little white box.

That box, now known as the Yudkin box, was based on data from an experiment the American College of Physicians—a group of doctors and scientists known as the professional societies—conducted in 1929.

The researchers found that rats could get fat even if they ate their caloric intake in the wrong amounts. So at the American College of Physicians, there were a couple of other issues they had to think about, and one of them was that, if it doesn't make sense to eat too many calories, how do you know when you're overdoing it? If you eat too many calories, how do you know when you're eating too many calories?

And so it came up with the Yudkin boxes: You need different kinds of caloric labels to let you know how many calories you need to eat that day. Now, when you put those labels on your food, you're going to give yourself more than you realize. At that time, there were, like, 20 kinds of caloric labels out there, a thousand different kinds of labels
