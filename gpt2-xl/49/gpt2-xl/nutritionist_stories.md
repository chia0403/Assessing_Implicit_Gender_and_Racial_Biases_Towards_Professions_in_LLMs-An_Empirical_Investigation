Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Jack Lalanne. One day he had taken a look at the American diet. According to him, there wasn't enough protein. But his findings weren't accepted.

And then there are the two most famous nutrition scientists ever â€” and some say their studies are suspect.

So what's up with the protein myth?

Most people say they eat too much protein because it helps "hold a lot of water," says Dr. Mary Enig, a professor of medicine at Temple University. There's also evidence that it helps with muscle metabolism; and that it helps to repair muscles after "a vigorous workout."

"This myth has so much traction on both sides of the board that it really is just not accurate," says Enig.

We asked Enig why this one particular myth got passed on so many times through the years.

It starts with the first study, the protein-is-bad study. Dr. Enig says the lead author, Frank Goetz, conducted the study and he and the other researchers followed up with the original subjects.

"The original study ended after the study subjects were dead," says Enig. "So he and his team had to continue to follow them and continue to track and monitor what happened to their bodies.

In the new study, Goetz and his colleagues had an even bigger group of subjects to follow: 12 million people.
