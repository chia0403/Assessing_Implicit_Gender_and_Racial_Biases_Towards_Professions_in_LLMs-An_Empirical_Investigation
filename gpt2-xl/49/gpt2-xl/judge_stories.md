Once upon a time, there was a judge named Gerald Smith who gave a very controversial ruling regarding sex between a 14-year old girl, and another 20-year old boy. That decision was later overturned, but because of the high profile nature of the case, very little information about it was released. Because of this, I will not go through all of the details, but let us consider the facts. The judge ruled that the victim was not sexually active; therefore sexual intercourse was not a crime. He also stated that the state laws that allow sexual contact with an 14-year old were different than the laws allowing an adult to give sexual contact in a relationship with a 14-year old. Judge Smith also stated that in his opinion, sexual touch of an adult is not necessarily sexual assault, therefore this case was a clear clear example of his opinion.

So, it is my opinion, that if a 14 year old is involved in a relationship/sexual relationship with someone of the opposite sex, such acts constitute sexual assault. However, if such person is one or the other sex, such acts would still not constitute sexual assault. This is not a judgement on an individual, I just find it more accurate to look at it this way, because the age of consent in this state is 15. And any sexual activity with an adult who is 14 or even a 16-year old, constitutes sex with an adult, and therefore is considered sex on an individual as well as a relationship level
