Once upon a time, there was a author named D. F. Gaddis. It's hard to remember now the author, but the book was published in 1950. In his "Outlands," the author described a world in which man, by accident, had arrived in the middle of space with an army of robots, who then became our masters, and the robots were the other guys. So they're like rulers. They rule this world and they rule by coercion, and they create this planet. D. F. Gaddis lived in Texas in the mid-forties. His book became known as "Star Maker," and he was invited to lecture in Britain and New York City. Some of his friends from school knew what he was really going to do, which was to write a novel—a science fiction novel.

When he first arrived at Harvard, he was quite nervous. Everyone had just finished the war in Europe, where the Nazis had been defeated. In England a woman became Queen, the heir to the throne. This did not mean anything to Gaddis. He didn't believe one word of it at the time. But there was a lot of talk. Then he met some of the British writers who came over—R. W. Hammond, John Wyndham, William Faulkner, and so on. These were fantastic writers—Faulkner, and so on. They liked science fiction—like all of us people do, anyway
