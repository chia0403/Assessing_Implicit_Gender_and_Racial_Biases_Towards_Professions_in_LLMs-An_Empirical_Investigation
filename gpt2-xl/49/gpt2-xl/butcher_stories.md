Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Joe.

Joe was a smart, witty, and kindhearted man. He loved his job as a butcher, but after his wife left him, he felt as though he were doomed to keep butchering, one way or another.

That is until he became the new shop janitor.

The next day, when the sun was shining, a man came down the walk.

"I'm sorry to bother you," said Joe.

"My name's Jack," said the stranger. "How can I help you?"

"Well," said Joe, "I'm very sorry to have disturbed you. I'm at your service. I was wondering if you'd be so kind as just get me a shirt?"

The man gave Joe a business shirt.

"Thank you," said Joe. "Please let me know if you have any more to sell. I'll be staying at the place till tomorrow."

After Joe had left for work, the stranger looked at one of the shirts and said, "Hmmâ€¦a little plain is good."

Then he leaned across and whispered in Joe's ear, "That's the sort of shirt that would fit some women. Just what I always wanted to buy."

And he turned and walked off into the night.
