Once upon a time, there was a journalist named John O'Connor's website. He didn't like journalists, so he didn't like them calling him a "journalist." And then he started saying, "There's no such thing as a journalist" and he was pretty mad. So the next thing John O'Connor did was go to a bar, get a drink and then get up and come back with "A journalist is just a person who collects facts and then writes as if those facts can tell you what to believe." And, for many years, he believed that all journalists were these sort of big bad liars who are just trying to get rich at everything and therefore are worthless at every kind of thing and, furthermore, are actually more dangerous than some of the terrorists. That's a lot of stuff that's been coming out of my mouth.

You said you're currently a student, and there's a lot of stuff on the internet – YouTube, SoundCloud, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, Vimeo…

I'm definitely not a student but I did go to a small, one-and-a-half-day, three-hour, no-frills university school, and the first class they took – they basically said "You will be here to pay for it." Which in my view, you do have to pay for it, whether you're an actual student, not just paying for it, but to come here
