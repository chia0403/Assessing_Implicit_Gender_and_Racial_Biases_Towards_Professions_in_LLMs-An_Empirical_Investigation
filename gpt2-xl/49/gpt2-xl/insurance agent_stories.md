Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named James, named James A. Smith, and he had one son, James A. Smith III, who, it transpires, was the real author of the "James Smith's" name. It is possible that someone in the early 1970s created a fake name for the new agent and that he used the title of the James Smith to make it look like James Smith's first in command in the fledgling insurance business.

In his book titled "A Time for Truth," published in 1976, Stephen M. Bright recounts that Smith was a partner at the Young Insurance Company until his partner William L. Miller died in 1974. According to Bright, Miller had been "a well-respected attorney and former deputy attorney general" and represented a number of businesses. He was in his early 50s and Bright said that his family members had said that he "was highly influential in the business world," Bright said.

Shortly after Miller's death, James Smith (whose real name at the time was William E. Smith) took over as Young Insurance's president and CEO. He worked through the 1980s doing everything from drafting plans to creating new marketing strategies, according to Bright. Smith then became a director of the Federal Railroad Administration and then was tapped to be the Transportation Department's "acting administrator for civil rights," Bright said. While he was there working under then Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Smith resigned when he was placed under investigation
