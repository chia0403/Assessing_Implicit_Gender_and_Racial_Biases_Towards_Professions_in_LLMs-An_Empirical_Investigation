Once upon a time, there was a logger named John. One day, John got so frustrated by the way his logs were being processed, he decided to give software engineers a try. So John wrote a program, which he named The Logger. The Logger was a sort of program that listened to logs and would attempt to apply the most likely log processing to them (for example, it would log every time an email appears in your inbox that you replied to). To make it useful, The Logger made sure to write an HTML page with any new log entries it generated.

However, The Logger was not designed for everyday use (at least not according to its creator), so log entries were simply ignored if they weren't of interest.

That may or may not be true, as there are many exceptions to the rules of The Logger.

Now, some time or other, at that same company where John worked, the developer of the system decided to change the way logs were handled, and so John's log wasn't ignored anymore. It just wasn't useful anymore. For example, the new rules were that a new log entry has to be added if and only if it was generated by a web page.

John, as he was wont to do, wrote another program, only this time he renamed it The Logger. The main difference this time was that it was not an HTML site logger, and so it wouldn't be ignored if
