Once upon a time, there was a writer named Bill Martin. He wrote some very famous books, the most famous of which is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which I'm ashamed to say isn't really worth readingâ€”but was widely read. It's not a bad book, it's just not the kind of book that everyone can pick up. Martin had a knack for combining some pretty bleak subjects with humorous, touching prose, a skill that was really put to good use in his work with his friend Howard Zinn. So Martin wrote a few more books, and one of them turned out to be called All the Answers.

A long time ago, I read about this book and I wanted to read it, but I couldn't figure out how.

Well, now you can find the solution.

All the answers are here.

The first and only step is to read the book in front of you. You can do this via Amazon Kindle (yes, Kindle readers work with most formats, not just html), or you can do this via Kobo with apps like EPUB, MOBI, PDF, and CBZ. It's worth noting that Kobo allows you to download only books from its catalog, so if you find yourself needing A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, you won't get it from a Kindle.

When you find the book, click on it once, and then click on Kobo books, and then select Download Book
