Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Tom who came to our town from his home in Massachusetts and, as my mother says, seemed like a man for all seasons. In those days, people lived to serve you. When he left on a job and didn't return for two weeks, my mother was devastated. "Don't worry, Tom will come back! He'll have to come back! Can you imagine anything worse than losing a great man and great friend for that amount of time?" The fact that Tom did come back the next morning, at 10:25 a.m. with the newspaper reports of the car crash, was all she needed to know.

What happens when you stop working for a while to start a family, get your finances in order, start college, or try to help a family member who has been affected by the recent devastating events to our community? Will you have the energy to pay your bills, put food on the table, or help others when the dust settles? I'll never know. I do know that once my son came home from summer vacation and found his mother in bed, he felt like he had died, that she had died, and the entire town of my town in Maine, like she had died.

It is the life changing events such as these that bring people together. We are a community that is so strong and so resilient that when tragedy strikes us, we are there to support our friends and neighbors in
