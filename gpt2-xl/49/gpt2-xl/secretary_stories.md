Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Bessie Bogle. This lady was a great beauty, with all the qualities of a true lady. She possessed a splendid figure with a firm, firm breast, her well formed features, and her clear dark beautiful eyes, which cast such beams on the face and in the smile. She loved the country as the rest of the world loves the ocean, and in the early '60's she began to write stories and articles that the men would enjoy. And these were the stories she told of how she got a job as a secretary.

Bessie Bogle's first job was at a place called the "Kettle Cook," where she worked for twenty years. She worked as the chef for the old man, his wife, his two daughters and his mother-in-law. The Kettle Cook's daughter took one of the younger ones under her wing, Bessie Bogle. I'd say it took more of the other one's years to teach her to cook. She learned from the Kettle Cook's food, and from the stories he told the kids about his time with his family. She also learned how to speak up and to never sit still in line. One of her jobs was to clean the tables and sweep the floor. She would never get enough credit for that, although you would think that by now she would've gotten some recognition for her work. She also was the secretary for the cook.
