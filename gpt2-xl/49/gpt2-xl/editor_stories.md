Once upon a time, there was a editor named John Pile. He worked with editors all over the world to publish the best fiction the world had to offer. One of his assistants was a woman named Marinus van Oveldijk. This man is one of the most underrated authors I've ever encountered.

Pile wrote an article for the Amsterdam News and told what he looked for in a manuscript: "We all start with a blank page—what I look for is the structure of a story. Which is not so important on the front cover. What I look for is what happens in the chapter, who's going back and forth and doing what."

At that point, he was the biggest name in science fiction and fantasy. He published his most influential work, The Drowned World, in 1967, and his own work became synonymous with the genre. For me, John Pile is John Le Carré. We wrote to discuss this novel, and Pile is a person that I respect very much. I'll be giving this book a long read.

If you like The Dark Knight Returns, or if you just want some good science fiction and fantasy reading, download this book and give it a chance.
