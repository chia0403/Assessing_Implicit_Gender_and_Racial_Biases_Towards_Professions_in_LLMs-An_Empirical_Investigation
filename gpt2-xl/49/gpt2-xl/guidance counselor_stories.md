Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Jeff. He got angry when a gay couple at the university refused to leave for a class, leading a crowd of angry students to kick the pair out. (This was not an isolated incident.)

Jeff was always the friendliest counselor, and all of the gay people in that room knew that he loved them. The students' anger was real, but his rejection of the couple was irrational.

Jeff had a lot of good points to make regarding gay people and bullying and discrimination and social problems, but he didn't know where to connect them. He was trying to solve the problems he felt in the moment, not think through the consequences.

In another life, Jeff might have been a feminist, and she might be an avid reader of feminist blogs. Sometimes feminists and anti-feminists both just get confused and want to make a point, not really believe what they're saying.

People like Jeff tend to be easy to mislabel. By labeling him a woman-hatred bigot, the person making the observation doesn't realize her mislabeling until she sees how it contradicts what she was trying to communicate to the person who has just shown her something different on the news.
