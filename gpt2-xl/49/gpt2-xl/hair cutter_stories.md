Once upon a time, there was a hair cutter named Mike "The Moustache Bandit" Murphy. The Moustache Bandit was like the Robin of hair cutters, doing everything the best he could and making a quick buck off of the hard work of someone else. Mike cut hair for everyone — rich or poor, white or black, man or woman — all day long. He took off in the morning, ate his lunch, and then headed off to work until evening. As a result of his success, Mike had to wear a full suit because the company that made his clothes was not happy with paying someone who had just recently arrived in the city. Mike's hair cut, however, never seemed to cause any big issues.

One day, his hair bandit business was doing so well that his boss began hiring him to cut hair. Soon, the whole hair company staff was in Mike, and he soon became the company's only employee. It wasn't long until he had turned the company into a multi-million dollar business.

Then one day, the company went bankrupt. Mike was so upset that he just gave up the headband business, never to do it again, and he shuttered his hair bandit company. It was the best thing that happened to him all year!

So what is the difference between Mike the Moustache Bandit and Mike the Hair Bandit?

There are a number of differences between the two.
