Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named James Watson working on a molecular formula. It was a theory that the human race may all have come from one race, the Neanderthal, and the reason the human race was not extinct at the time of Jesus Christ. The theory was that the Neanderthal had a genetic abnormality, or mutation that prevented their cells from maturing properly.

In 1952, Dr. Watson developed a theory about why the human race was not extinct at the time of Jesus Christ when the other races must also have survived the Flood. This theory was that the human race was not from the Middle East but more so far to the south in Africa with very dark skin and hair.

This theory stated that all the other races were genetically similar to the human race, but not able to produce the proper hair, skin and eye colors since there was an abnormality in their DNA.

The other races that were found were Neanderthal and East African Dervish.

After James Watson discovered the genetic mutation that created the dark-haired, dark-skinned, and blue-eyed white people was in Africa, he began studying a little more about what happened during that Flood and how they survived. When he found proof of an Exodus, and a people that looked no different to whites, he thought things were pretty good in terms of being able to survive a Flood. Then, another scientist, Francis Crick, claimed the mutation that made blond hair
