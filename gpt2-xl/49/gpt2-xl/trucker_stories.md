Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Harry. One day, at the roadside, he struck up a conversation with a girl.

Harry: I'm a truck driver.

Teen: Oh, wow.

Teen: I just want to talk to you.

Harry: What?

Teen: My name's Taylor. You look like you're from Texas. Do you know me?

Harry: Yes, yes.

Teen: You're not that big of a trucker, are you?

[We hear a truck arriving, and Taylor walks to the window to see it on its way, and then the music stops. Harry is sitting there, the girl is gone.]

Teen: I was so worried when you left me, that…I can't even begin to put my feet…

Harry: You're a big boy.

Teen: Thank you.

Teen (laughs): I want to tell you something, Taylor. That I don't think you have to be alone anymore.

Harry: How do you find a girl like her?

Teen: I can't. I just want to.

Harry: Why?

Teen: Because I love you.

Harry: I thought about that for a while, but you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

Teen: I know. I feel the same way, too.
