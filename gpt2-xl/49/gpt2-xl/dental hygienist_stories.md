The dentist, Dr. Reitmaier, put an end to Lise-Lotte's days of pain and suffering by replacing a number of teeth that were in the process of growing back.  They were so old and rotten that she could barely pull them all back with just her teeth that were in working order.  Dr. Reitmaier put them back in, and as they were all the same age and had been there at least 5 years, Lise-Lotte was told to smile.  She smiled.  Dr. Reitmaier's office was crowded, and she needed to make sure that her patients were happy and comfortable.  She had the smile out, but the patients were still suffering. After several minutes of smiling at the patients, and looking out at the crowd, her patient came in to her.  Lise-Lotte was so occupied that she had forgotten to have his teeth pulled that there wasn't even any time to notice.  He had some loose fillings and an area of roughness under his lower jaw.  He just kept complaining for no reason. Dr. Reitmaier had him give his teeth a strong pull.  It was all she could do not to laugh, as she had never before been so
