Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Mike who developed a system called System 2. Since System 2 relied on the system clock, it was a very important piece of hardware. One week later, a member of the System 2 project sent Mike a note. Apparently, an employee in the IBM factory had made a serious mistake. The employee had not counted the time on the IBM circuit or in the IBM system clock. It had only been 30 minutes, but the whole night had been marked. The employee had been fired, and it was clear that Mike would lose what, he felt, was a very valuable piece of his heart. But Mike could not find any way to stop the clock. The only solution he had left was to build a robot that would keep the clock running indefinitely.

The first thing Mike did was to go to IBM's system clocks to figure out how to run a system without the clock. He found an operating manual that explained how the clock could be bypassed from the main processor. The manual stated that there were three separate switches which could be located on the main processor board. All that was needed was the circuit board. The manual then gave the required information as to how to wire up the circuit with these switches and to tell the processor how to read them off the circuit board. It had taken all day for Mike to learn all the necessary details, but he had done it and now he was able to get his system running without the clock.
