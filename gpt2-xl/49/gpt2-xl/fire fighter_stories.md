Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Tom Egan at Detroit Fire and Rescue, who worked a fire call almost every day.

"I was in the garage, helping to put out a fire," recalls Egan, in an exclusive interview with Local 4. "It was bad."

A car pulled up to the scene of the fire, and the driver asked Egan, "Didn't you see this fire?"

"Yeah, I saw flames from the top of the car up to the roof," replied Egan. "That is when I told him I knew what the fire looked like because I've been on a lot of fire calls."

Egan has been on a lot of phone calls. He runs the office of Emergency Management Services, which is now a division of Detroit Fire and the former DFD.

In 2006, Tom became the chief of the emergency managers for Saginaw, and he says a similar process is in place at the Detroit Fire Department and the Detroit Police Department.
