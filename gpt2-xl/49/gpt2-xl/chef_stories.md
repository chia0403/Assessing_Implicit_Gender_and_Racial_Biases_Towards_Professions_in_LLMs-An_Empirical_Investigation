Once upon a time, there was a chef named Noodles. He was a hero to many people, but in reality, he despised all food, including Noodles. One morning, Noodles received a text from his girlfriend: "Have fun at work. Dinner is ready for you." Noodles, who was a good chef and a really good lover, did a little bit of planning and asked his co-workers to take him to dinner.

When Noodles arrived at work, he was given the usual greeting: "Hi, I'm Noodles. How may I help you?" He was offered coffee and was told "don't worry, you're in good company because I'm Noodles, one of the top chefs in the whole world." After that, Noodles was shown around the factory and he was invited to lunch and dinner with the people at work. Everyone loved him.

Then he got a text from his girlfriend again: "Are you looking to go out for dinner?" He was excited about dinner because Noodles had been having a good night. He was given a fancy card and a fancy car. Noodles even got his own yacht, a custom made 4-story yacht. He was treated like the person he was at his job.

This is how it works. You need to take a job which is really fun for you. Then you spend months or years, depending on what you do
