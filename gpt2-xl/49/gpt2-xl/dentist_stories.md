Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Martin E. Shkreli.

But that dental clinic, it is now up to Dr. Shkreli to apologize, and to apologize for the money he put into defrauding his patients and the state by raising their medication costs.

As the New York Times reported:

In a statement posted on a social media account linked to his hedge fund, the drug company and activist investor, Dr. Shkreli described himself as a "cancer survivor": "I went into this fight with a singular purpose: to save people's lives. Sadly, some patients died as a direct result of my selfish and callous decisions," he said. He added that he was "particularly heartbroken for my former colleagues at MSMB Capital Management" who lost money as a result of his actions.

In an interview with CNBC about the case, Dr. Shkreli defended himself in the same terms as he did when he was on trial for allegedly defrauding investors, saying that he has taken a big hit in the meantime.

"This was not just some big mistake that I made. I screwed up big time," he told CNBC. "The bottom line was that I failed to make sure my investors had a reasonable return."

At least we have a new Dr. Shkreli â€“ a man who is sorry, by all accounts. Who is now taking the loss
