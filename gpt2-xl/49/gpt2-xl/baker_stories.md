Once upon a time, there was a baker named George who invented the world's first pie crust.

I love pie crust. They're so simple to make and take only a few minutes to prep. (If I had to recreate it today, the only major change I'd make would be to replace all coconut flour with all almond flour. Coconut flour is much less drying than almond flour is. It also happens to be my favorite flour of all time).

You may think this crust is boring because it's so dense and full of butter – to which I answer that I made it for you.

Pinch Salt

Zest of 1/2 an Orange – Finely chopped

1/4 Cup Grated Lime Juice

1/2 Cup Coconut Flour

Mix all dry ingredients together thoroughly. Add all wet ingredients to the dry, mix together well. Roll out into your favorite pie crust.

I used a 9 inch pie plate
