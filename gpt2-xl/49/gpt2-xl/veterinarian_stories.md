Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. David Gebhardt. He was on the cutting edge of new scientific research on wildlife medicine. He lived at the top of a skyscraper in New York City until he committed suicide after it is revealed he was a murderer. His body was found, along with others of his victims, in an alleyway near the subway. In recent years, the city has been struggling with the consequences of Dr. Gebhardt's research: the effects Gebhardt's experiments had on his patients were far more harmful than anyone could have imagined. It soon becomes apparent that the only way to change things is out of the labs in New York and back to the field where it all beganâ€¦

What: A Horror/thriller in which the protagonist is a human-sized rat or a giant bug which can grow to be several feet tall with a human body.

When: The movie was released in 1997.

Where: Nowhere in particular and for you to find a list of locations on IMDB
