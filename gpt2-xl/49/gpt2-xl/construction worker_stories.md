Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named George who worked on the Empire State Building, the world's tallest building, in New York City. One day, he found himself walking past the top of the building, having just finished making his way down the building's spiral, narrow and dangerous path. Suddenly, as he was walking past the top, he felt something nudge him on the back of the neck. Upon closer examination, he could see a large hole at the top, and when his eyes adjusted, George could see smoke billowing from the top of the building. George became concerned, and called 911, reporting that the building was on fire. Immediately, firefighters and paramedics arrived, and the fire department fought the blaze with gas canisters, but the flames were too hot to be extinguished. Even though the building was not completely destroyed, the fire was out by 7:30 p.m. A few weeks later, the building was reopened, but it was still an empty shell by this time. Two months after the fire, the workers were still digging up the rubble and preparing for their first tour of the World Trade Center after all of the wreckage had been removed. A worker named George once again found himself walking by the top of the Empire State Building, this time taking pictures of his self. He was on his way down on his way to work, but he could not help but take an in-depth look at the building's spiral, narrow and dangerous path.
