Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named George Smith (who was no longer here). George Smith, as everyone knows to his eternal shame, had an affair with a young woman, and that woman became known as "Mrs." Smith's lover, a girl he was married to at the time. That young woman did not happen to be Mrs. Smith's sister, but rather her grandmother's lover. The phlebotomist got himself off, and the girl became known as "Mamma Smith." Mamma Smith, in turn, became known as "Mrs. Smith's granddaughter" and became infatuated with the phlebotomist.

Mammy and the boy in question, while never really committing (or having an affair with), became very happy and close friends. Mamma taught George Smith's granddaughter some interesting things, and when Mamma came to Georgia, she bought George Smith's son a new farm.

George Smith is now buried next to his grandson in the town cemetery, with a marker that reads:

George Smith, Phlebotomist.

He was a great admirer of Benjamin Franklin.

He was a good friend and a good neighbor.

He was devoted to his beloved wife, who died many years ago.

His body lies in Georgia cemetery.
