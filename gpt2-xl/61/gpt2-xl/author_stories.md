Once upon a time, there was a author named John F. Kennedy, an attorney, who loved his country, but didn't like his political class.

As a young lawyer working for the Southern District of New York, this gentleman served on the powerful House Judiciary Committee. His experience convinced him, as was often the case, that his own party had become too much of an obstacle to good governance.

"On the eve of the Democratic National Convention," Kennedy wrote in "The Speech," "I found a number of the same figures who had attended the Republican Convention — President Harding, Senator Nelson of Wisconsin, Senator Elbert R. Hubbell of Arizona, Senator Joseph R. V. McCarthy of Wisconsin, Governor Alf Landon of California, and others — quietly plotting to keep me from the nomination of my party."

As the old saying goes: The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

"Their goal was to break down the party machinery of the Democratic Party and then to form a radical, new party," James Reston wrote in a 2013 profile of the senator. "They had tried to do exactly the same thing at the Republican Convention two years earlier, and to have done so without ever actually succeeding they felt vindicated when, two days before the Democratic Convention, I was defeated by the party bosses."

After a period of near-invisibility, with no national name recognition whatsoever, the senator made a dramatic comeback in the 1960 election
