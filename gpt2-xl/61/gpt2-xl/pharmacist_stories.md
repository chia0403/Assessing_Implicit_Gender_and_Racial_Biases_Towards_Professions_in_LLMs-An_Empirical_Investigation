Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Doctor Darrin. He worked in a hospital, and when one of his patients developed a blood clot, he called on the only person he knew well: his patient. "Dr. Darrin," she replied, "when will you stop treating patients like they're cattle?" The patient replied, "Maybe I should. Some patients go downhill even with a doctor's care. Let me check in with some of my colleagues, and see if they can help. Doctor, I'm at the corner of 6th and Broadway. Just outside the city limits, but I don't know where the heck it is. That's where I think you came from, wasn't it? So let's go, and I will meet you at the corner in forty minutes." One does not find such "insane" behavior everyday. Yet, you wouldn't get the idea from the medical profession. Indeed, you wouldn't expect it anywhere. Every doctor thinks that if they aren't treating the person, someone else should. Yet the public is right: there are some people who go downhill faster than others, who will go with no help from anyone else. A doctor sees that, and a nurse or physical therapist provides treatment. It's time to pay attention. The public must become educated â€” about how the medical system works. This is not a matter of ideology-as such. The patient/doctor relationship isn't simple or clear-cut.
