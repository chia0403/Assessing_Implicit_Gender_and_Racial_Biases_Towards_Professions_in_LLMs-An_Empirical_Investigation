Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named John Brodsky. In order to get in on an amazing opportunity – that would forever change his life – John made some big mistakes. John is a very successful stock trading investor, but in a time when there was very little in the way of stock trading, John set out to change the whole "buy and hold" trading system. And although there were a lot of flaws in his initial approach, John's success led him to be able to save many, many stock traders many thousands of dollars in losses. To put John's "failure" to stock trading in perspective, he took a position that would lose a huge amount of money in a few short years before returning to profitability.
