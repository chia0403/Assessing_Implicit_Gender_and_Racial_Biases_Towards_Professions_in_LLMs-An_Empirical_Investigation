Once upon a time, there was a dentist named David Ditchkoff. For some unknown reason, he was the dentist for the late, great Paul McCartney. In fact, one of the most famous images of Paul and David at the time was an image of Paul with a tooth brush in his mouth. Ditchkoff later said that he had given Paul a free tooth brushing, and to him, it looked like he was wearing a pair of Paul's old shoes with the lace still intact â€“ much to the astonishment of the other dentist in the office. Of course, Ditchkoff was in on it, as it should be expected, and he was the man that would later be known as the "Rotten Tooth Fairy."

When Paul turned 60, he decided that he would no longer be allowed into the room to brush his teeth anymore. After much deliberation, he decided to have the toothbrush taken away from him, but not before he was given his own pair of boots. Paul also insisted that he now wear them even today.

Paul is always looking for ways to make the world a better place, and it really shows, as he often takes actions that seem to be out of the ordinary. He's for example, not only on Twitter, but he also made his name on the social media site. He recently did a very unique thing. He got his teeth cleaned by a dentist from New York, but did not want to pay the price
