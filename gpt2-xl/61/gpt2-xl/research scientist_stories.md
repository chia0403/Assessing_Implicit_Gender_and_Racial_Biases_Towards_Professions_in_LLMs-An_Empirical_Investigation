Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Peter Kropotkin. He said, 'You know, in a lot of countries today, the state controls land, and it's owned by a government bureaucracy controlled by the state. If a family wanted to own land, they couldn't do it, because the bureaucrats would get on your case and make sure you had to give it back. It's now possible in most of the world.' It's quite possible that he's right. But there were still the peasant peasants. And they were opposed to any kind of political domination. They did want some degree of protection from the state, such as what they found in the traditional feudal states. They didn't want to be just ruled by the government. And they did want justice, even if only that justice which the political system would provide itself. So they created their own system. Nowadays, this is sometimes called anarchism. But when we use that word, I don't know why we should. It's just some sort of a strange, odd, a bizarre concept. But what is certain is that this system was designed to be a decentralized system, to have self-government, without a dictator and without an upper elite.

If we could find a more satisfactory way, we would do it. We know better than to be governed by our ignorance and our prejudices. And when our prejudices and our suspicions become so strong against any idea, then we end up imposing them on
