Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Jim. Jim was really, really into grass. Like, literally. He would just lay waste to all that green everywhere and leave it perfectly trashed. In the spring, his wife died. This caused Jim to become even madder and more destructive.

Every morning, Jim would go and rip through every little bush that was in his way for a couple of hours. He loved the sight of trees and bushes all mangled. He loved to see the dead foliage littering his yard. He would also get extremely drunk and beat his wife because nothing gets in the way of a good cocktail.

After a while, Jim realized something was up. He started to take extra caution when he was around children. As time went by and the kids grew up and the wife died of old age, it was more of a joke between Jim and his wife's three children.

The house was also full of old trees that he had removed from the lawn. When the woman finally moved out when her heart stopped, Jim decided he would retire. The lawn was too beautiful to see the same old old shit all year round. It was getting too hard to care about it all the time. Jim decided he'd try to kill his lawn.

Jim started by ripping through every stump on both sides of the house. He also went around and tore up all of the grass as well. Jim felt the old grass needed dying.
