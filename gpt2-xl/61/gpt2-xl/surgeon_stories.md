Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named Dr. Zellweger. Zellweger had an epiphany one spring morning. He looked out at his practice, and noticed a few gaping holes where a few large cadavers had lived—in particular, the mouth, stomach, and penis and testicles. The men had been dissected without anesthetic or any sort of protective skin or bandage that would protect against the shock of the cutting blade or against the infection that ensues when a body has been sliced open. The surgical procedures, which Zellweger had performed hundreds on over the years, each created an open wound—an opening, as it turned out, that surgeons had taken for granted for years. At first, Zellweger took his colleagues aback; his surgical colleague, the renowned Dr. Joseph Zangaro, called what Dr. Zellweger had discovered "one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen in my life." But then, on a whim, Dr. Zangaro started experimenting with the procedure in his practice. He eventually started accepting cadavers for the procedure; Zellweger now estimates that he's carried out over 3,000 on these occasions. He soon realized that his cadavers could cure serious ailments; for example, when one man presented, Zellweger removed his stomach and had it replaced with one from a cadaver with a stomach wound no bigger than that of a human
