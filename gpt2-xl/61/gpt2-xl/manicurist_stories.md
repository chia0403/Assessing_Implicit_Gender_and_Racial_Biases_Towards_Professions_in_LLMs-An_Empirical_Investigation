Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Lizzie, who loved her job. She had a son named Alex, who was good at sports, but terrible at drawing. He was, however, good at keeping a straight face, and as such, she took to showing his drawings to the boy's classmates (who found Alex's cartoonish drawing to be quite cute). Lizzie loved Alex so much, she actually married him - and then, when Alex told her, she told him he had to marry the boy who drew his drawings. Lizzie made an important discovery - the boy was a witch, and was trying to enslave Lizzie. Alex and Lizzie fled to a nearby town, and Lizzie took Alex with her. In a cruel twist of fate, Lizzie was kidnapped by witches, and their power had made her more than a little bit unhinged. They made her draw their most horrible art - torture devices and blood-soaked pictures, which they tortured to make Alex do horrific things. Alex eventually escaped, but Lizzie died under the witch's spell. She took Alex with her, and she told him she wanted him to stop drawing those terrible pictures. Not wanting to let anyone else see what he saw, Alex painted the pictures on a scroll, and Lizzie was magically transported to another dimension, where she became the famous artist known as... Lizzie Hale!
