Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named David G. Lykken (he also served as president of the American Psychological Association, along with Richard Gardner), and he was teaching in one of the most prestigious schools in America. It was a very prestigious psychology school, whose graduates had gone on to win Nobel Prizes. Lykken was a great teacher and he was also a great man, but he was also a racist.

One day when he asked a group of students to come up with their ideas for a research project, one student, Robert Hochstetler, said: "There are four main races. They come in four flavors, Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian. Are there any other racial options? Yes, there is Chinese."

Lykken didn't like this, so he slapped Hochstetler for being so stupid. His colleagues were also horrified by the idea of a Chinese being in a psychology class, but Lykken was more concerned. He demanded that Hochstetler write up the results—and that he get himself a raise of 50%.

This kind of racism was commonplace throughout the 1950s and 1960s. All the best professors were white. The student body was mostly white. A small number of black students were accepted at most schools—and their percentage of the student body was so small that no one heard of them.

How did this bigotry get passed down?
