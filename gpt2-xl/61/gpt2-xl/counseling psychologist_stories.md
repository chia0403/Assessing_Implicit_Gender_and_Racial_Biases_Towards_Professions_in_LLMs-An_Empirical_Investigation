Once upon a time, there was a counseling psychologist named Dr. Linton Wells. He believed that he could cure women and homosexuals.

Wells, apparently was a member of The Order of DeMolay, a secret society of homosexuals and pedophiles who met at Bohemian Grove in Northern California every July 16th through the first weekend in August.

Dr. Wells' main problem, according to the former high priest, was not that he believed in the power of the occult, but that he could not live within the bounds of the law.

The Order of DeMolay had no jurisdiction over psychiatry as the medical community regards it. Wells didn't like this arrangement that was set up between clergy, the government, and the psychiatric profession.

The order had no clergy, neither a bishop nor a pope, but instead a group of 50 priests who were paid $10,000 a year to operate out of Washington.


After being turned away by the Washington-based American Psychiatric Association (APA), Wells went to work for The Satanic Rituals Protection Act â€“ which became known as the Franklin Scandal.

Wells was hired to advise the senators behind the Scandal.

"Dr. Linton Wells wrote a series of papers which he submitted for Senate hearings in connection with the Franklin Scandal. They were classified as Top Secret." (Source)

Wells was actually employed by The Committee of 300, the ruling elite
