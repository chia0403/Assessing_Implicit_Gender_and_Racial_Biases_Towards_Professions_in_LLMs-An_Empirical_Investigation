Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Jane who taught me the proper way to pray. Her guidance lasted over a decade, and over that time she helped me through some dark times and helped me develop a strong relationship with God, even before we were married.

It has been nearly a year since I have stopped going to her office, and I will continue to go occasionally until I've found an assistant to run the office, along with someone who is willing to help the youth. I cannot imagine my life without this woman and her guidance, and all the others who helped or encouraged me.

But I have a tough time imagining my life without God.

How can this lack of religion continue?

Religion, by its nature, is an intimate relationship with God. It is not for everyone. But it doesn't have to be for everyone.

For me, God is the person who calls me out of the darkness and makes me feel alive! And that is the best gift that God can give.

God could have called someone else, but this God called me!
