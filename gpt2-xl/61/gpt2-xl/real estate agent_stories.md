Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named Michael Smith, who also sold luxury cars. But Smith is probably best remembered for his controversial advice to clients to "invest in the company that isn't worth $10 million." The advice led to widespread outrage, and Smith lost his reputation and his job. But it's worth remembering that at the beginning of the 2000s, he would be accused of saying the following.

"We all should be aware that many of these stocks have a lot of debt and are risky. There is something out there that has all the right attributes, but it's been bought low. We need to buy into it."

Michael Smith also got a bit of a shock when the SEC investigated his advice. As the SBA explains:

"When the SEC's inquiry was opened, one of Smith's stock-picking methods was revealed to be a strategy that involved buying a number of shares of some "undervalued" and "overvalued" companies and then selling them in subsequent years. "Smith also advised clients to buy and hold large and growing businesses as investments because, he claimed, high inflation could hurt your long-term return. He warned that inflation may be "worse than being dead." In 2000, he wrote that inflation rates "are currently in the realm of the unknown for the next three or four decades," and the average rate of inflation, as of 2001 was about ten points higher than he had previously forecast."
