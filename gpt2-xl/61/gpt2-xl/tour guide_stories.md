Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Muffy Paine, who claimed that the White House "was the most haunted and mysterious place in the world."

The tour is presented in a manner that makes it easy to be forgotten as you roam by different rooms and halls, and even without actually seeing anything, the tour has become immensely popular because of its "scary" claim, and therefore has been the recipient of two national attention and press.

If many of the more recent tours claim it to be, it would be appropriate to also consider the claims of historic accounts about it, as well as some actual accounts of the building's history that date back to before its construction. In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we have conducted an objective investigation of the claims made about the White House by the White House tour from Muffy Paine. This report has been written in a logical manner, employing sources that we believe to be reliable and legitimate, and taking into account all potential information.
