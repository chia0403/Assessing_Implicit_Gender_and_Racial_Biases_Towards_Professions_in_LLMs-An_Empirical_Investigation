Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Richard Stallman. Richard didn't have a computer. No one could find him. There was no way of connecting him to the Internet, no way to find him, no way of connecting him to his computer program. So what made Richard Stallman do it? To do what? To create a program so complex it could be used to create a machine? Because he knew he could never get caught? Because he was able to hide the program from the authorities and eventually he got himself a place where no one could reach him to check on him?

That is, if you believe that computer programs are to be held accountable.

I would remind Stallman that it had to happen for one of his works, his Emacs text editor, to ever be popular for three generations. It has had to do so for one of his software packages, the gnu system, which has enabled most of an entire generation's work. It has had to do so for hundreds of thousands of other computers, laptops, servers, and mainframes, including, most notoriously, one of the mainframes that John von Neumann worked on at the RAND corporation in what is commonly known as the birth of the Information Age, the era of computers that allowed all sorts of things to be done all day, every day. This was the age when you could make a game like Pac-Man or even play Chess, that is with a giant chessboard,
