Within six months, it had sold over three million copies. It was the number one bestseller on the New York Times children's nonfiction bestseller list. It's available in paperback. Moss was featured on Jimmy Kimmel Live. It became an Oprah-approved best-seller. In November 2010, she won the Nobel Prize in Literature, with her memoir of her years studying in New York as a writer named "A Moveable Feast for Beginners." It's one of our top two novels of the year. And it sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone. It's been called a memoir of love, marriage, grief and everything in between.
