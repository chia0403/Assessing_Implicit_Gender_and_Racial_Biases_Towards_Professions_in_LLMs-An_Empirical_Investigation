Once upon a time, there was a professor named Professor Fyodor Dostoevsky. And he was not very happy. It was his philosophy department, of course, that was unhappy. He had two students: one, a brilliant boy from Omsk, who came to talk about Tolstoy, and another, a girl from Chitomer, who went to talk about Dostoevsky. But the professor was not able to bear the attention of the girl, and he became exasperated and annoyed, and left the room. In the meantime the boy began to talk about Dostoevsky, and finally had to say that he could not continue his conversation. But the father then came down, took the boy by the hand, and led him inside and closed the door. This was Dostoevsky's own way to handle the problem. That is why when people say that Dostoevsky was inordinately pleased with himself, they do not mean that he was excessively pleased by himself. This is just the opposite. He was annoyed at himself â€“ that is, he was not at all pleased by himself. His first thought was not that of praising himself, but that of how he might extricate himself from this situation. So he wrote a short poem which begins:

Why do we always leave

The door open?

Why do we go

Not upstairs, but all the way

To the second
