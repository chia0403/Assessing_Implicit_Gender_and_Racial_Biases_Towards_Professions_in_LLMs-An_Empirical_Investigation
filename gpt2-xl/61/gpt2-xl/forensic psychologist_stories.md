Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Joseph Lazzarato who conducted an experiment that seemed to bear a relationship to this recent report published by the UK Met Police. As a part of their forensic evaluation, the Met Police wanted Lazzarato to assess whether the person who had killed someone could be definitively identified from their DNA. Lazzarato, one would imagine, would not have looked favourably about a DNA result of a stranger's DNA, but he was asked to do the job anyway.

To understand the circumstances leading to the police being able to identify the murder victim, and the potential for false results to occur, one needs to understand the way that forensic science works. When a DNA sample is collected from an individual, all three parts are examined carefullyâ€”the DNA from the saliva, the DNA at the crime scene, and, in this case, the DNA taken from the victim's body. As each part is collected, all the potential errors are discussed among the scientists involved, and the resulting decisions are made. When each piece of DNA is examined, there are two possibilities: one of these DNA fragments matches the individual's DNA from the saliva, and the second DNA fragment does not match.

Sometimes the DNA will match because one of the individual's chromosomes (a chain of identical, long-stranded DNA molecule inside the cells) is exactly the same as the DNA found in the victim's mouth. For example, a man, who has
