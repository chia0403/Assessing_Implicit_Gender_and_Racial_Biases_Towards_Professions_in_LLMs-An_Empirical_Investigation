Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Mrs. Mary Ann Parnell. When she wasn't in the lab, she made a living as a nurse-in-training. Her favorite thing to do was take people off to see the doctor, and then take a peek at their faces when they got there. She was a young lady who had dreams of becoming a doctor.

The day the Doctor arrived, all of the women rushed into his offices and begged him to look in on Mrs. Parnell, but he said he wasn't going to put her through that again. Mrs. Parnell had been a great lady all her life, and she was going to make this right.

I told Mrs. Parnell the Doctor had said he'd see her the next day. Mrs. Parnell went out into the hall to check on her husband.

Mrs. Parnell walked down the halls and met other doctors and nurses. This was her team. They'd banded together to help and defend the office. They were going to do everything they could to help their old friend, and that's why they were doing their best to cheer her up.

"We're in the lobby," she said to the people just coming down the hall. "Mrs. Parnell wants to see you." The woman, who didn't recognize Mrs. Parnell, nodded and followed her down the hall through the lobby
