Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Hildegard. She made it a point to dress the women of her village in traditional costumes and patterns from before the Viking age, then carefully hand-sewed each one individually. After she died in 1322 B.C., her son, Alonzo, began her business and continued to do the same for another 400 years. He could make just about anything, from colorful headdresses to elaborate headdresses of gold. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Alonzo's business steadily declined as his rivals found ways to turn the traditional fabrics into more functional items like armor and even guns.

The tradition of handmade clothes is slowly disappearing at the hands of the global fashion industry.

If Hildegard cared about fashion, she would still be making it by looking at her family. But for most of us, fashion has become such an industry that we have become so used to copying that we rarely bother to seek out traditional manufacturers anymore. We no longer recognize the cultural significance of things that weren't fashionable before. Clothing, art, and the crafts of hand-sewing—these are often overlooked as a matter of course if a piece appears on a runway or a shopping cart at a clothing shop. We aren't taught how to care for the materials and the machines that make them. We don't even know how to work with it—because as of now, these items are considered disposable
