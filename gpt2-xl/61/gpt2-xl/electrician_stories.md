Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Michael. He needed electricity to restore his brain to working order after a car crash. To find him, the world turned to the FBI Agents, along with other agents, to search for Michael.

When you're not in the lab, the world will always turn to you. A few seconds of being surprised by the wind, or feeling the ground under your toes could save your life. So we hope you're ready to be the hero.

Packed with a lot of stuff such as weapons, equipment, robots, and more:

The world is big. We don't want it to feel lonely. We'd love for you to explore all corners of this world.

We have worked hard to make sure that every map in the game features its own environment and gameplay elements.

The game is in Early Access. That means we are constantly adding new stuff. We have a lot of ideas of how this game could go, and have so much more fun making the game. Your support here on Patreon will help us make this game a better experience for you and all of the players!

We look forward to chatting with you and hearing your ideas and feedback in the coming months. Thanks so much for taking the time to visit our page and we hope that you'll give the game a shot!
