Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mr. White. On occasion, he would go through a series of exercises and tell the students various secrets.


One day in the middle of his training sessions, a student brought the teacher a little book. White read the book aloud: "This is your life for today, you cannot make any mistakes here." However, when he said it this way, the student started to believe it.


"This is your life for today, you cannot make any mistakes here."


It was too great a burden for someone to bear. The student wanted to give back to White an object he had received from the previous dayâ€”a keyring with a key in it. White immediately thought up of a plan, and on this same day, he gave the student his key and instructions. The next day, the student was again given his key, and told to follow them in order, to unlock their lockboxes. The student took the keys, then returned to White and said, "Do you think, Mr. White, I can be smart enough to unlock my own lockbox?" To which White replied, "Yes, of course."


A lot of people have their own story or method as to how they overcame a tough situation. To each his own. This story is mine.
