Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Mary Rose Riney -- we would say, Mary. She's the only one among us who had the same name as her. Mary Rose is so pretty. She was a beautiful lady. She would appear in her red velvet dress, pink lace collared apron, her stockings and heels. She was a fine blonde, and her hair was red. The name Riney meant beauty in ancient Rome, so that's who she was. Then, one day, there was a man called Mr. Jones... The name was John, I mean, John, John, John. He had a kind of short hair and he wasn't so pale. He had a certain air about him. Mary has a face like a rose and a body like a ballet dancer's. They called her The Rose, and she was the most lovely of all the ladies! She had a very nice face and she had lovely shoulders and legs. She was about twenty years old. John was a lovely man... It was love at first sight. But when Mary and John started living together, then they began to fight. They fought constantly. Not just in bed, but on the street, and at play, and in the theatre and at home... And now, I want to say to all the young men out there. Get married. It will be much better than you ever thought. I was too young to be married when I was 20
