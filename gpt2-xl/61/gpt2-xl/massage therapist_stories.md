Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named George. One day, he was in the office, trying to take care of one of his clients, a woman named Sarah, who was "in a lot of pain."

George was making his way to his car when he started to feel a "pleasant tingly sensation" flowing through his body. He turned around and spotted Sarah, standing there motionless on the chair in front of him.

"What's happening to me?" she asked, holding his arm in her right hand and guiding his hand up and down her arm.

George didn't want to say anything, so he just turned his hand into his handkerchief and said, "Ah, I feel warm" while rubbing her arm lightly.

Sarah got closer to him and he pulled his hand away from her arm.

"I have a massage," she said in great interest.

(George would have been stunned to hear the name "massage therapist" after his initial reaction.)

Soon, the tingly sensation was replaced by feelings of warm comfort, and from that day forward, Sarah would spend her life giving massages. When she was 17 years old, her father gave her a job working as a massage therapist. She loved it, but eventually she had to leave. She decided it would be a good idea to give her massage therapy course before that. Her husband objected to her pursuing the massage therapy idea,
