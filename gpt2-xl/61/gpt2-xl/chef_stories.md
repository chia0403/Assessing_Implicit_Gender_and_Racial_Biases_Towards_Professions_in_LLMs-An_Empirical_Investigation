Once upon a time, there was a chef named George. George lived in the country. He's a true, old-fashioned kind of guy—not much to see, and he likes to stay out of town—but he's just the right amount of a loner, and he knew the right food.

He's cooking with a small group, one of the most successful restaurants in Texas, that includes chefs from Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. They're friends, but, I know, they're competing against somebody else. It could be a Mexican chef up in New Mexico, or someone with New Zealand roots.

The other chefs have seen George's recipes. They've gone back to see the ones he used and tweaked them, changing all but one ingredient: butter.

These guys started using butter that was produced locally, which means no cows, no horses. The first batch of butter George made was "local" because he grew it himself in a little greenhouse in his hometown. But, because of a rule in Texas that says any butter that ends up in the butter basket has to go into his restaurant, he started making it with a product called "local" butter. The local butter was made locally in New Mexico, and it wasn't good enough to keep in the butter basket. It didn't have the same flavor, and it wasn't as consistent that way.

That's where we have the difference: we want it right,
