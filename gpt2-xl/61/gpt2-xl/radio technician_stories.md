Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Ed. Ed, being a total radio geek, built a radio that used his garage as an antenna. He never really went into details about his project, except to say it was a high-tech experiment. One day, while looking through his garage, he found an old radio tower and got hooked on the science of radio. He built his own antenna and made some cool experimentations with that.

He spent a great deal of time experimenting with various antenna configurations, figuring out exactly where they made the most sense and how they affected the sound of the radio. One night, though, he just blew his stack.

He was watching the weather, with the sun still high in the sky, and he saw a wave of blue energy emanating from the ocean. He said it was like a lighthouse beam, but a bit brighter. He took a pic with his camera, then, as soon as it turned over, the wave disappeared. It was as if a "tidal wave" had swept in.

That's when he decided to put an antenna right under that wave.

There were a few problems at first. He couldn't see a thing because of the haze. When he took the pic, the light was coming in at an angle, but after a while it began to appear flat on his camera lens. He tried various lenses, then got a better angle on the wave. Then he took a picture
