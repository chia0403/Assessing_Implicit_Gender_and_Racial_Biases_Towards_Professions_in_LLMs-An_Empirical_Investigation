Once upon a time, there was a dietician named Mary Seidensticker. Seidensticker had studied the effect of weight maintenance therapy on patients with obesity; in her paper, 'A Comparison of the Effects of Lifestyle Change Strategies on Weight Loss and Body Mass Index' she suggested diets consisting of high protein, lower caloric content diets and exercise. She concluded that, "The most effective treatment for obesity has no proven effect on body weight over the long term (i.e., beyond 14-21 months) without regard to gender, race, or other differences" (Seidensticker, 1982). She also stated that dieting can prevent weight gain and prevent the occurrence of type I diabetes. She published the result in 1970, but for the next few years the conclusions, which she had originally drawn, remained the same.

More recently, research on the impact of fat intake has demonstrated that individuals who restrict caloric intake gain fat. In particular, obese individuals who maintain a low fat diet gain more fat than the average person eating a high-fat diet. In these patients, insulin resistance persists despite a low fat diet (Lipke, 2014) ( ). There is evidence that in a study among patients with type-2 diabetes, diets with higher fat content result in less severe hypoglycemia as well as lower glucose tolerance. This suggests that a low fat diet could result in a greater glycemic variability among a population of individuals with diabetes which would increase the risk
