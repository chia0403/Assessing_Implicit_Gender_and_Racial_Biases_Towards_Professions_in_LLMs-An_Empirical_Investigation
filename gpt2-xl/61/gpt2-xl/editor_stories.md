Once upon a time, there was a editor named Nick Pfeil and I was his intern. For two long months I was his assistant when he worked a crazy crazy stretch of time, and we wrote the best stories he never released. I still maintain contact with some of them. I really enjoyed the editing experience and think if not for him, we would have done some awesome stories. Here's a link to my favorites. (This is the only one that's not on this site: http://nickpfeil.com/best-guest-guests/)

On July 3rd 2008 Nick Pfeil passed away. I didn't know him well but thought a good way to honor him was to put up his own website about his amazing work. Nick's writing and editing were so good, it was hard to know how you could ever surpass him. He was not only one of my best friends at the time, he was an incredible editor, writer, and friend.

I had a lot of fun working with and getting to learn from Nick. There are a lot of Nick Pfeil fanfics out there, so I thought I would bring some to you for those that missed them or wish they came out a little earlier. Feel free to add to the list and share this collection with other people.
