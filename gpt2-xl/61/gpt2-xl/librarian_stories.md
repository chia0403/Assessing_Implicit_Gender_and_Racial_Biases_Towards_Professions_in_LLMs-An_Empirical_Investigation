Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Mary O'Kane, who liked to collect discarded books and then write terrible stories out of them. I'm talking "Lolita". Then I saw O'Kane on Wikipedia and was instantly transfixed. It didn't shock me to see that her real name is Katelynn A. Moore, but I felt a wave of nostalgia for a time when women were portrayed as intelligent and complex while men were simply, well...men. I would've been totally okay with this because, as a young adult, I went through several phases of female characters in literature. Before becoming a writer, I spent many years as a librarian. I had the opportunity to read almost every book a stack of bookshelves. My library was my sanctuary. I took joy in seeing the shelves of "D" and "D'Andrea's" and "Emily Bazelon's" and "Lila Perry's" filled with books that were written in good taste and made my daily reads.

However, what I did not expect was that there I would come across a book that featured a woman that was a librarian. It wasn't her job title or her profession that was most offensive, it was how she dressed. I can understand a woman in a job like this, not working outside of her home, going to a job that doesn't require her to go as far as working in a hospital or the police department
