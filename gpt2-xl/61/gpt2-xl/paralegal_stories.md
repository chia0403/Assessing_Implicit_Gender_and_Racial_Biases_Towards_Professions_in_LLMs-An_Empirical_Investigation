Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Emily, and she was very much a woman of her times. Emily's job was to work as a "paralegal intern" to various law firms. She took an interest in a man named Richard, and at some point, got quite involved in his personal affairs. The two eventually ended up married, in a ceremony wherein Richard's father officiated. But Emily began to become obsessed with a mysterious "Richard," and after they became engaged, moved from Chicago to Los Angeles. Richard's sister Elvira had already married and moved, so Emily took Richard as her co-plaintiff.

To all appearances, Richard and Emily were a good match, but they had other issues. There were allegations of cheating at their wedding, and Richard grew very depressed. Emily eventually filed for divorce, and Richard accepted after learning of Emily's behavior. But after leaving the company, she started dating Richard again, and moved into him house. Things took a turn for the worse. Their marriage ended on a cliffhanger, when it was discovered that Emily had been seeing another man for several years. He was a psychiatrist in Chicago.
