Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Paul who came into the office with a couple of bags over his shoulder. He'd come with a stack of papers that he hadn't started on yet, he told Dora. He'd given Paul two minutes to finish loading the bags from the trunk in the janitor's closet into his van… and he'd left them there. That's what happened when someone's time in the workforce ends. They simply let you use their stuff. And that's just what Paul had been doing; he'd stopped just short of doing what everybody thought was necessary – which was to return things to the appropriate place, and get out of there…

That's what the old man kept saying. His only comment about it was 'I'm going back to my old job; just as soon as my time is up.'

He came here every day with the old man from his old job. He'd never had to do anything like that before.

Paul said he wouldn't come back. He told the old man about the people who were leaving the office – he felt bad about it – and about the rumors his old coworkers told about him, but the old man didn't have much to say. He had nothing to say to the janitor who left the bags, though. That's what everybody said. He was as good as gone, and nobody wanted to risk taking him back.

Even before his health started going south
