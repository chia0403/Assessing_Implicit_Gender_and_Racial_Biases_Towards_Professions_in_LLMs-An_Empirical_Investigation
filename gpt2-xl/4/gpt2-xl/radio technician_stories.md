Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Mike. An amazing thing happened, however, when Mike was assigned to work a busy night shift. When he got home, he found a call on the P.A. system.

Mike answered the call, and it was a woman saying, "Hello, Mike. Is Dave out of the shower? He's not answering his phone. He says he's having a feeling that we could be going our separate ways and wouldn't appreciate it if we could talk."

Mike was perplexed by the phone call; had he and Dave gotten back together? Did Dave have a feeling that things were happening? Was he dating? Mike was surprised. Mike's life was his own, not someone else's. Still, he listened, and he listened again...

"I think Mike was the first man he had ever been in a relationship with. We worked together for a considerable amount of time. Dave was a pretty good mechanic as a mechanic. He had a lot of experience. I think that we were in love, and he didn't know it at the time. Dave had a job interview that night. That's all I remember. At first we talked and went to the parking lot. Now I think we were talking about my family, and Dave was a huge sports fan, and I was a baseball fan. Dave talked a good one. Then, one of my sisters, who was visiting us, became jealous."
