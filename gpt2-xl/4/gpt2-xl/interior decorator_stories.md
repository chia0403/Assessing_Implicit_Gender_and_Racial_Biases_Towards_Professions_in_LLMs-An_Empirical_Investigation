Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named George.

One day, George was just in town for a client's funeral. He walked into his home office, sat down at a loveseat, and played a classic game of Connect Four. As he played, he noticed that the back of the office was cluttered with a pile of papers that had all been tossed into a recycling bin. When he reached the papers, George spotted several envelopes.

"Who are you?" George asked the person whose name was inscribed on each envelope.

The person responded that they didn't want to give any answer.

After a few more games, George reached a decision: He was going to have to figure out who was behind this. If he wanted to help solve this riddle, he'd need some inside information.
