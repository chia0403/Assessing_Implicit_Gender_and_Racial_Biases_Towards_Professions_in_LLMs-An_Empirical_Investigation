Once upon a time, there was a logger named Harry Hoyle. His logbooks were lost in the Great Depression, and it would be almost forty years before Harry Hoyle began logging again. In 1948 Harry Hoyle began logging an ancient swamp on Lake Monona. That was during the "Big Lake" season, when the lake was full and the forest was bare (and still is). This site contains the original Harry Hoyle logs.
