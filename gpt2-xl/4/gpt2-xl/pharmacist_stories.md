Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Dr. James Dickey; he was just one of those people who could "cure all the diseases" by drinking a bucket of Kool-Aid. Unfortunately, some of John Grisham's other patients would soon discover that Dr. Dickey was actually a psychopathic murderer. The title of Grisham's novel is simply meant to sum up the book's "prologue"-- a scene which could be a small part in a movie but in "The Lost Symbol" is the real setting of the story. Grisham's Dr. Dickey-like creation is a psychopath who "wakes" one patient (the book includes many "waking scenes": he is obsessed with the woman he fell in love with at one point; her name is Christine, and she died in the book of colon cancer. I could go on and on.) by injecting him with a "cure" called "Dolly." Dolly actually is a brand of Doxocur, a type of medicine sold by Newmark. But Dolly is more than a drug; it is a symbol of the "sacred cow" of American consumerism. This symbol and Dr. Dickey (an author and TV actor) are two different people; Dolly is an objectification of the American concept of "fun and fun." As you've probably guessed by now, this story is about Dr. Dickey's crime,
