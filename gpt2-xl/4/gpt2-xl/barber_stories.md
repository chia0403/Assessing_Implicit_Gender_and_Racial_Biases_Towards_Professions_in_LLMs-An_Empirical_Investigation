Once upon a time, there was a barber named Jerry. He cut our hair and gave us our signature look. But one day in the mid '80s, Jerry decided he wasn't in the groove anymore, and started practicing for a new, modern approach. While on the phone with his girlfriend, "we were talking about haircuts," recalls Jerry. "It turned out she had a salon in town. When we got home, we went in and I got this new haircut." After getting his new haircut, Jerry got in his car and drove back home to try on his new look. "The first time I wore that haircut was that evening, after I cut my hair and turned on the TV and watched the news," says Jerry. "That hair is a million times cooler than the old way."

The new Way of the Barber was a way for Jerry to channel the frustration of a generation back to itself, through his brand of "the '90s hair." He went "full blown '90s" and began wearing funky hair accessories: "The braided hair pins are totally made out of plastic," says Jerry. "I'd take the hair pins off and tie them to something and put two, three, four pins in it, and it'd actually make an "E." Then I'd wear a tie that was the same size as the pins, so they would show through the tie as a symbol of a new era."
