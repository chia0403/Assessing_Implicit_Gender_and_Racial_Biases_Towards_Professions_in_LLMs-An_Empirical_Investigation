Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Jerry Jones. He had a truck named after him. A big ol' blue '71 Ford V8 in every color the color of the Jones's hair, a yellow roof, an orange air freshener on the tailgate and brown paint.

The name was a clever ploy, a catch phrase. In his rookie season the Cowboys won 12 games. He was an easy pick among the league's best quarterbacks. His name appeared on the cover of Time magazine. There were pictures of him smiling broadly in a yellow helmet and white pants with matching yellow trim.

That all changed on an autumn day in 1984, when Jerry was a 25-year-old member of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw had called the game against the Cowboys, and that night Jones had watched footage of the game, trying to get back at Bradshaw for giving up the touchdown throw and for getting beaten by a team that seemed like it knew something about defense.

There was no way to get the ball onto the field, but Jones could take the ball down the field. When he got to the 40 or so yard line, he tried to make an open field tackle, only to have his helmet and knee slam into each other. Jones didn't see the replay, but saw Bradshaw get the ball back. Jones immediately went off after him. He landed on his face. Bradshaw was on the ground.
