Once upon a time, there was a executive named David Nuffer, who presided over a company called D.N.S., and who was fired a week and a half ago by the board, when he publicly revealed some uncomfortable information: a number of senior execs at the company had been drinking for a good long while, and one of them had even passed out at a company Christmas party.

Nuffer's memo of resignation today has had the effect of making the situation even worse, giving a green light to one side of the drama: that a few drunk executives are to blame for corporate squabbles that have long been brewing at the company, that there should be no repercussions for the former D.N.S team, and that, if there ever was a company where one should be "punished for drinking," it's D.N.S. (This is a direct quote from a second-hand account of the incident from somebody who worked there for a bit, and has so far not had to sign a non-disclosure agreement as required by the company before talking to reporters). The company responded forcefully, and the message came as a complete shock to the company employees. The entire D.N.S. team was fired, and David Nuffer was forced to step down as the CEO of his own company. It was a huge coup for the company and its shareholders.
