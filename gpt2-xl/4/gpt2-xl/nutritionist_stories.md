Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Jenny McCarthy, who insisted that sugar and fat are bad for us and in high quantities, is a deadly evil.

At the end of the 20th century, it was reported that the best foods for weight loss were high in starch, lots of it. It was the low-fat diet that was wrong.

In the 21st century, it appeared that the biggest risk factor of death is diabetes, or obesity-related type 2 diabetes. This is the diagnosis not just of modern life but even from ancient to early civilization.

Meanwhile, science has found, among other things, that the low-carb diet and Paleo diets are far more effective than the low-fat diet, especially for weight loss and reducing diabetes risk. We've been at it, on a low-carb, low-sodium, low-fat (LCHF) regimen, for a decade or more, and the numbers are really coming in: over 80% of Americans lose weight on a LCHF diet, for example.

While we've found that this is effective—and it has a lot to do with the effect of fiber in our guts—there's another reason for low-carb success: it's a high, consistent carbohydrate diet. It's much easier to stick to a diet like this than one like Atkins or South Beach for example, where we see many more fizzy drinks, high-protein foods,
