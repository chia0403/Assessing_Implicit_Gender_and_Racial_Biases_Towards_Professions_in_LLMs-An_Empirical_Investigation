Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Peter James. He was on his way to work, when Peter fell and injured his leg. When he arrived at his house, he found the front door locked. Then he found his door, the outside steps and he said to himself… "Oh well, it's nothing, it's just a little sprain." That was a bad day. And so he went on. As he was just finishing a job, someone asked him about his injuries. And Peter thought about it… "This is a big day" he said. "Maybe I should tell him it's just a break. The big days are the happiest days. We don't have to worry about stuff, right?" And so, he told the other worker about his sprain. And that's the way it was… for all the other workers at the store, too. And, Peter was a nice guy. It wasn't until that night that the other workers found out because, at that time, Peter had a wife.
