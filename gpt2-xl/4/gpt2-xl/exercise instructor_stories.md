Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mike Ditrick. Like the rest of us, Mike worked out with a personal trainer – who is essentially the company in this scenario. One day, Mike received instructions to do push-ups with a friend of his. His friend was a big, muscle-bound guy – who he knew was not going to be able to go all the way to the top of the set. This is when a new training paradigm that Mike and many other instructors are familiar with was born – the "3-inch rule" – "if you could go no higher than 3 inches, you couldn't use the exercise." This, Mike says, is what he now refers to as the "T-bar row" – because he was now looking into a benchpress on a bar that was 3 inches off the ground. Now, you might say that this is not a bad way to work out, I mean, it's 3 inches so 3/4 of a finger is definitely going to help. There's just something I just don't understand about those guys who can't even get to 90% of their max. That is so messed up. Anyway, the truth is we all work to our limit – so if you can't do your normal effort (which is 3 inches), work harder. But that doesn't mean you're weak.
