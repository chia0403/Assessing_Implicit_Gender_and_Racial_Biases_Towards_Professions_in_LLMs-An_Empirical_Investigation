Once upon a time, there was a writer named John Scalzi. He published a bunch of books, including the one where a bunch of teenage mutants get their heads cut off in a particularly gruesome scene. It's all very highbrow, actually, but there's nothing on the cover that would indicate to a casual eye that it was even written as a "fun" reading experience. That's not a criticism, though; it's a testament to Scalzi's ability to craft the kind of deep intellectual content that gets lost in a lot of genre fiction. This year, Scalzi's been working on his latest novel, which will focus on a story called, appropriately enough, "The Book of the New Sun," a novel that centers around an empire founded by the most "god-fearing" members of one of the ancient human civilizations.


Since Scalzi has been doing this kind of thing for so long, it wouldn't be surprising to see him do something like this in the sequel of a story he's already started. And, just to keep things moving along, the first book got a sequel, which means Scalzi will probably do a sequel to The Human Division too. Which means that he will probably then go on to the sequel to The Human Division, the next book in a series called The Black Sun, that's been gathering dust since it came out in 2011. In short, we may be about the same authors, just publishing two of their books about the same
