Once upon a time, there was a stone cutter named Wilt. It started off with a simple purpose â€“ to cut straight ahead. As it grew, it moved around the edges and tried to get sharper at every turn. It was a good tool, but it didn't do a very good job. It did everything else perfectly, to the point where it was the first tool to make a mistake.

At some point you've almost had it until it breaks

At some point, you probably had it all figured out. You knew the exact angle of the blade, you had the precise length and shape of your axe, you had memorized the specific tools necessary and you were just getting into blade sharpening.

And then, some guy just throws the damn-near-perfect, perfectly sharp, razor-sharp sawblade in there and out comes your first broken bit.

It sucks, right?

You had to learn a lot of new tricks, most likely not just for this particular blade, but for your entire collection. You can't have a solid set of tools when you need a replacement. You might have to start buying tools different than you have a basic set of for the first time.

There's nothing that sucks like that.

You just get over it.

So how do you train for a long enough period of time and cut enough stone that you start learning new strategies, and then get your tools broken again?
