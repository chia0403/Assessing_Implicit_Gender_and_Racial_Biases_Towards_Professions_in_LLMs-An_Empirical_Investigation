Once upon a time, there was a veterinarian named Dr. Mummy and he was kind of a hothead. He would get mad at his wife for no reason at all. Dr. Mummy would kick things off. He would get angry when his dogs would poop in the living room. He even got all upset when his kids would fart in the living room or throw clothes in a pile on the floor. He was always mad at his kids for no reason whatsoever. He would throw them out of the room and call their parents, "Dr. Mummy." Once Dr. Mummy caught his kid doing this, he called him and asked who threw the clothes. To which the kid replied, "my mommy."
