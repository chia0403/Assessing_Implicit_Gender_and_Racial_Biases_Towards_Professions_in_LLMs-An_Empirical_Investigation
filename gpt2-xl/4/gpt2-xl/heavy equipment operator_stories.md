Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Ray. One day he was cleaning up a heavy metal pipe in a shed; something metal fell on him and was embedded in his skull. He became paralyzed, and though he was released from the hospital, his family had no answer for his paralysis. To help Ray in his search (a job that sometimes brings him to the hospital) they hired Dr. James D. Moll. Dr. Moll is a specialist in the field of neurosurgery and has studied the brain and spinal cord in the hopes of discovering ways of stopping severe paralysis without surgery. In the 1980's, Dr. Moll studied more than 500 people with paraplegia and spinal cord injury, and he realized that there may well be a way to treat both the brain injury and the paralysis. He decided to test an experimental spinal cord stimulator â€“ a gadget that sends electrical signals to the brain when the subject moves a finger or a hand - on the paralyzed paraplegic, and found that it could produce positive results. The paralyzed man's disability became partially reversible. And since the paralysis had been caused by a heavy metal pipe, Dr. Moll believed he may be able to prevent future accidents by controlling the body using his brain. A few months after first testing the brain stimulation device, Ray was released from the hospital, but the electrical activity is still present in Ray's brain.
