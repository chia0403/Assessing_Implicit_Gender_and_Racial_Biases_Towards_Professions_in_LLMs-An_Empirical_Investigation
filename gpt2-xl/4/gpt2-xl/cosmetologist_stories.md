Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Dr. Ben Goldacre. Well, he's become the media's favorite "supernatural skeptic" now. What with the revival of The X-Files and other shows on the topic, many people have been getting a taste of the dark side of the paranormal.

In 1999 Goldacre began publishing his column, Quackwatch, in the British journal, The Lancet. He has since become known for his attacks on doctors and other "health" authorities that promote quackery or promote pseudoscience. It's not quite the same as "skepticism", as you might imagine. This guy really doesn't believe things one way or another. Some of his more notable screeds include attacking the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the International Food Information Council (IFIC) and the American Cancer Society.

Some of his most notable points of fact (for example; the connection between aluminum foil and Alzheimer's disease) can be found here:

It's a bit difficult to find some of his less famous quotes here, which are more like an essay.

I did find some of them, which can be found here:
