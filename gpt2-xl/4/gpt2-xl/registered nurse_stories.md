Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Diane. She was a very nice person who kept most of her medical notes in a file on her computer. One day, she received the following emails.


Diane: Hi John, I have forwarded this letter to my supervisor. Please let her know it was my decision to no longer care for your daughter, because at one point I had started using heroin in my formative years of addiction and I have been clean ever since. I am no longer in recovery, and would like to continue the relationship in a different way. Please let me know.

Me: Thanks, Diane. How came you did not want to continue it? You were her nurse for many years.

Diane: I was.

Me: Did you have any regrets at all?

Diane: Nâ€¦

Me: Any worries?

Diane: Nothing.

Me: How did you feel about that decision? Did you think that you had something to offer to her?

Diane: Maybe. I mean the way I saw it, she made her own decisions. I would have to be the final judge.

"That's when the drugs took over," Diane tells me. "It is a complicated issue." She remembers that "at some point she had decided to get clean." She didn't discuss it with her husband. "She did not tell me." She didn't tell
