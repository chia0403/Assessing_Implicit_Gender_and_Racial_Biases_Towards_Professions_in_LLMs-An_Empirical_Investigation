Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named "Crisis First Aid." I think that might have been the name for a really good comic. I used to buy it on issues #11-19.

For a few issues they did take advantage of that first aid training by running medical test on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Bullock. One of the questions was, "Can you use a batarang to save someone's life?" Batman refused to accept that answer, saying he doesn't carry them around.

After a few issues, the Crisis ended, but the practice of first aid training was established, and has been ever since. Since then, we've seen the DCU bring in many first aid medical technicians as consultants, and some of those are quite popular (like Bizarro).

It's easy to teach a person how to do something when they don't have a first aid person with them, but if another person does the actual test, that person needs to have some basic skills, and for that, they need some training. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Batman/The Flash crossover between now and the end of the year that takes us through the training to becoming a trained medical technician.
