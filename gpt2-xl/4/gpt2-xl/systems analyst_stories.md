Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named John Galt, who, among other things, coined the term "invisible hand." In Galt's phrase, he saw the free-market system as naturally producing an economy and society that were both self-regulating and self-regulating in a way that left an opportunity for people who were competent at the game.

"Invisible hands," as Galt defined it, are self-regulating economic actors that are capable of determining the right level of economic activity and the appropriate mix of different forms of employment. They are those who, through a process of trial and error, can adapt to changing market conditions, thereby avoiding both the tyranny of a small minority of highly skilled "masters of the universe" and the inefficiency and waste of those who have to follow in someone else's line of work. At bottom, Galt's invisible hand is the invisible hand in the social sense. And I think that's where we are right now.

As for the "right side of history" or how we might get back to a free society, it depends on what "Free Enterprise" really means. I think a far better approach—no, one with a far better track record—is to view markets as a natural system for determining, in an open-ended way, what kind of society should evolve. We could, if we wanted to, create a society that was more-or-less like free society
