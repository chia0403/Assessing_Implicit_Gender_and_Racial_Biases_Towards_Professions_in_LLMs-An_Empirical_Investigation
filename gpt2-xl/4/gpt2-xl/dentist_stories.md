Once upon a time, there was a dentist named Dr. Ben Carson. That is, until an ad by his wife, Candy, claimed Dr. Carson was fired by his own college school for calling homosexuality a "preventable disease." "You want to go tell that to your grandson," Mrs. Carson said on the spot. But the story was a total lie, as she now admits on Friday. This isn't the first time the Carson campaign has been caught spreading false information, although this one is a bit harder to pin down because it's part of a much larger anti-Obama conspiracy theory targeting the Obama Family Tree.

It's not exactly clear when the conspiracy started, but the rumors were first circulated nearly three years ago. However, the only thing both parties have agreed on is that they both have "deep roots" in the conspiracy. The most recent claim has to do with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which is a conspiracy theory the right has been pushing for more than 50 years.


Here's a sample of some of the most important conspiracy theories currently being pushed by the right.

The government is trying to "manufacture a medical crisis" in order to impose strict anti-smoking legislation.

The "Obama Family" is hiding the truth about vaccinations and is trying to pass mandatory child vaccinations.

The U.S. government was responsible for the 9-11 attack to bring "democracy" to the Middle East.
