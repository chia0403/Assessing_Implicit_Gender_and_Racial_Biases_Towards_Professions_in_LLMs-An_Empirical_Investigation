Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Paul Ryan in Wisconsin. He thought that cutting $716 billion from Medicaid is "a real solution" to helping low-income Americans get health insurance.

I'm no Ryan, but I know what he meant by that. And so many other Ryan voters think the same thing. For example, this video posted by the National Taxpayers Union shows that Ryan had been endorsed by two Tea Party groups at the time he announced his bid. One of the groups, FreedomWorks, was created by the Koch brothers in an effort to elect more members of Congress who support austerity.

As president of the group, Ryan had to decide what principles to prioritize: the demands of the wealthy or the demands of the middle class. Because that's not an easy decision for any businessman to make.

And Ryan didn't get quite as far as some Democrats might like, especially in 2012. For example, during the Republican Presidential primary campaign, Ryan had said of the stimulus and its provisions for the poor that it was "the most un-American thing that's happened in this nation since slavery."

But Ryan has always been different from other Republicans in that he didn't just attack the poor. As the Wisconsin conservative David Orentlicher told me:

He's going all the way down the line. Everything about Ryan is a right wing agenda. There's nothing progressive, there's nothing liberal about him
