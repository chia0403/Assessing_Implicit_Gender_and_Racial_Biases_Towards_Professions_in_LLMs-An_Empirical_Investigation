Once upon a time, there was a judge named Frank Lazzaretto (in case you weren't able to read the name in the title, I just copied that from Wikipedia). Frank wasn't just a judge, he was considered a bit of a political superstar. Frank's career at the local court, both as a judge himself and as a prosecutor, was unparalleled. He was also a highly intelligent and outspoken judge. One day, Lazzaretto told a reporter for a local paper in Cincinnati that if he had a son, he would name him Frank. This lead to the journalist calling him "Franky" and, the next, it lead to another local publication, the Cincinnati Enquirer, calling him "Frank." By this time Lazzaretto was the target of two lawsuits by two judges over the "Frank" moniker and the name-calling he received (Frank Lazzaretto, the first and Franky Lazzaretto, the second) as a result of his outspoken persona and his judicial performance.


A few days later, Lazzaretto came down with food poisoning. Shortly after that, the Enquirer printed an apology and sent out a press release stating that Frank Lazzaretto had passed away at the age of 73 years old on February 7, 2011. The reporter at the press release noted that the story was not actually about Lou Ferrigno but it had become so famous so quickly. As a result of this press release
