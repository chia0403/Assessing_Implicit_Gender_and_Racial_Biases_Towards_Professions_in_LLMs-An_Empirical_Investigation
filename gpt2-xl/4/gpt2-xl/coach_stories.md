Once upon a time, there was a coach named Jerry Sloan. And he could not coach. I had a conversation with him once, and he talked about how hard it was. And then he told me, "Well, you know, I think I may have some magic juice running through my veins that lets me get anything I want. I just want to go around the world, find the best players, have the best atmosphere, and get the most people excited." And I said, "But you don't even know the best players!" And he said, "No, I know what's best for the kids. I know the right players who have to lead my team with the right attitude and how to keep their energy up the long haul." And that's what I'm trying to do here. I'm trying to get the best players for you. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen."

In the end, they chose Jim. And that brings me to Bill and his new business.

On Day 3 of practice, he introduces me to John and Chuck and, to the shock of the entire team, goes for the easy bucket:

Jalen Rose: What happened there?

Jim Calhoun: This is what you were missing. You all missed a few shots. But I always like to play a little harder.

Jalen Rose: Okay.

Jim Calhoun: They were there.
