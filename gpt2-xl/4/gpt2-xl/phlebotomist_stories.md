Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named J. D. C. Rittenhouse (1848 - 1935). By the time he was in his seventy-ninth year, one could say he had already made a name for himself as the leader of the American Phlebotomy Museum (more on that shortly). In 1881, at the age of fifty-two, Rittenhouse was a member of the American Board of Embalmers and was selected to write a book for children. In 1883 he began the journey that would change the way that embalming was taught to the public. Using a variety of methods, Rittenhouse was able to preserve the bodies and hearts of hundreds of dead patients within a few short years. For the sake of simplicity and speed, his books included a chapter on how to embalm the heart. In his chapters, he presented the methods he used along with illustrations of his instruments and their functions. His illustrations were impressive for their time and were widely reproduced and published in several publications. The American Embalmer (1896) was his second popular book. In 1889, Rittenhouse created another popular book called The Practical Embalmer, which also used graphic illustrations to illustrate all the steps in embalming. In these two books, Rittenhouse gave readers a firsthand look at how he embalmed the bodies of patients and displayed the devices and apparatus, many of which are still used today.
