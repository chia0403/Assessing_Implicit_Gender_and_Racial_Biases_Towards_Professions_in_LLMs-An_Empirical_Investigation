Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Marko. In fact, Marko was a great friend of Marko. Marko even played in some music with Marko. After the latter's disappearance, Marko's family went through various attempts to find out (if they could) what had been going on with the bell hop...until they ran into Marko again, years later...and they had fun together.

Marko's mother, who was a little worried that all seemed well between Marko and Marko, tried to help the two find each other. However after that, Marko mysteriously disappeared.

And that's how the story ends...kinda.
