Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Chris Arnade.

Today, he's a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He's a well-respected financial journalist, a respected commentator on equity markets, an authority on derivatives. He's not an investment adviser, and he doesn't work for a big company.

Chris Arnade was, however, a financial reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and he has a different name now. He goes by Michael Lewis, and in 2013, Arnade left The Journal to write for VICE Magazine.

In some ways, Arnade's journalistic experience has also helped him in the financial markets. During his financial reporting career, he's covered various markets extensively, including the U.S., Europe, Asia, and South America, and in 2015, he was named one of Canada's 50 business people under 50, a nod to his deep knowledge of finance and investments and his role shaping a generation.

The Financial Times named him one of its 25 most influential personalities of 2015, while The Economist named him one of the world's leading financial writers last year.
