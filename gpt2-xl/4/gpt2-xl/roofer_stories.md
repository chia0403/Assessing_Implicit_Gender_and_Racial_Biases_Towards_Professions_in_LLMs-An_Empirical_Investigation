Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Peter the Great. When it didn't rain enough to keep the roof clean, and the roof fell in, there were many men who were afraid to go outside, because they were worried the rain would wash away everything useful. Peter the Great, being the kind of a guy he was, asked an astrologer to predict for his home if that will happen or not, to which the astrologer told him that the roofing would fall in. If it did, everything in the house would be lost, including people. So, Peter used a different prediction, the one that always worked: He told the astrologer to come to his house and he can tell the weather. The astrologert was brought in, and the meteorologist told him where the rain was coming from (in the clouds near the sun), and the astrologer told Peter to prepare himself to live in a world of water and air. So he set up a series of rooms that would have to handle the water, so they would all have dry surfaces, where he would go to change his clothing. And, as the astrologer was getting to the house to see if it would rain, Peter took the astrologer's coat, threw it in the garbage and called in the meteorologist. They predicted a lot of rain, and the meteorologist was so excited that he sent the news to the press that there would literally be a flood.
