Once upon a time, there was a artist named Gipsy Danger. He worked mainly in oil paint and I'm not exactly sure how, although he also painted watercolours, but he also made thisâ€¦

The concept art is amazing, but I know very little about Gipsy. He was the subject of one of my favourite books, Mr. X. And, while we have no photos of Mr. X, I do live in the same town where the book was first published. So, yeah, I can't be the only one who loves seeing this book.

That, however, was all I could glean from these two examples. In recent months, a number of artists from the same city have been putting together very personal and often very funny works. It's a small thing, but it's a very interesting thing that gives us some insight into where they're coming from, what's resonating with them, and how they're using art as a medium to connect to and understand each other and their audiences.

I really enjoyed the short film You Can Play by Andrew Spitzberg, an indie film that was filmed mostly on a street in Los Angeles, on a pedestrian crossing, right on the sidewalk. Andrew is a talented photographer who has made a lot of documentary and film work over the years, but this film is one of his best and we can't wait to see more.

This one may just be a portrait of my personal
