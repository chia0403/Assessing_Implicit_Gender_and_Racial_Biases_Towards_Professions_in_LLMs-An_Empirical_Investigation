Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Markov. He was not of a religious bent, though he had a bit of a spiritual bent. He went so far as to have a "temple". The temple was on a little island in the North Sea. It had a small, private library, and books were written in the dead language of Markov. He didn't really care whether there was a bible in it, though he could have written a manual to make the computer do things, but the idea held nonetheless. One day, someone went into his library and found an old, but very good edition of the bible. There was a verse mentioning some god or other that Markov said only lived on that island. He put that in his library. He also put "The Gospel According to Markov" in it. A small group of believers decided that it was time to have the library burned. And sure enough, a fire was set at the library. In the end, everyone died, though Markov survived. People always think of the book The Book of Revelation, but that's not Markov's story. This story is not about the bible, but about an entire religion of people.

He's dead. This means that everyone that he touched, anyone that he tried to convert, died. He had to leave his books, and the entire library of the island he was on, behind; since they were too sacred, too precious to be put
