Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Lillian D. who was trying to make up for years of not getting any proper work. She did whatever she could to make herself seem worth something, and after years of working, and failing to make a name, she gave in to her urges. She bought a nice dress and went off to a local fancy dress shop. Her friend Jane wanted to go as well, so Lillian showed her the outfit she was getting. They walked in together.Jane: So that's a gaudy, overly big dress for you, how is it?Lillian: It's...it makes me feel very, very comfortable. I don't want to look like the typical housewife, Jane.Jane: I'm sorry, but that's not how people show that they are comfortable. That's how people are uncomfortable.Lillian: Jane...Jane: Now, Jane, I know what you mean about dresses. I just have a much bigger problem: I am a man.That's all I have to say about that. It was very nice of you. You were able to see me as a woman, a person, and to understand my situation. And it was very gracious of you to bring the dress up to my house. (Lillian pulls the dress over her head, and walks out. Jane's face immediately transforms to an expression of disgust on her entire body, as if they had walked in on some perverted couple
