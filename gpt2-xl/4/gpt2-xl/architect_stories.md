Once upon a time, there was a architect named Thomas Edison in a tiny cottage in the East Village who dreamed of controlling electricity with lasers. And he really, really wanted to. (You can read more about that in the article Edison: The Man With The Laser.)

The big problem was the expense. The cost of lasers and the costs of running the technology to its absolute limit were pretty much the same. Because they were powered by alternating current—a process that took power—and because they ran on electricity and ran in a room, it was difficult to scale them up to a larger building. To get the technology out there in a larger building, Edison used a process he dubbed "pulsating light". It sounded fancy, but it actually resulted in very expensive and unreliable light.

Here's how it worked.

In the early 1900s, if you were an electrical engineer, a pulse was a bunch of dots and dashes you sent into your crystal oscillator. It would cause the crystal to oscillate in time with your pulses. It took place in a space between two electrodes:

This led to Edison playing a game of chance with him to figure out how to make things more reliably. In effect, he used the very thing that would eventually doom him. What the pulses in the crystal did was actually slow down the vibrations of the crystal. The crystal got slow. And with the crystal being slow, it couldn't oscillate fast enough to light
