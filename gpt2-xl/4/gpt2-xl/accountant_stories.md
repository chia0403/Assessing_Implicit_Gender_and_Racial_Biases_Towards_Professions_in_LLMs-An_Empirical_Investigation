Once upon a time, there was a accountant named "Kris".

According to Kris, money went out the door, and nothing came in.

The accountant was paid, and Kris had little to show for his investment.

Kris decided to quit his job. The rest is history.

I don't care if your job description is to sell something - have you ever listened to yourself, or looked at your finances, and said "Wow, I'd love nothing better."? Kris is telling you, "I'd love to be a little crazy." And he's done it.

I have found that it's always a good thing to keep a little paper log of your finances, and when you do have a problem, the paper log makes it easy to spot problems in your spending, and make rationalizations for them. You will feel guilty for not saving, and maybe that's not a good thing. Not only that, but you might avoid that little nagging bit of guilt that comes up when you're not saving.

A paper log makes you think of all the different things you could be doing with those dollars. It also shows you that if you're spending money in a way that you don't expect, you are on to something important. When you are tempted, stop spending and consider how you could save, or spend that extra dollars elsewhere. You might enjoy it more, or your mind will be soothed.
