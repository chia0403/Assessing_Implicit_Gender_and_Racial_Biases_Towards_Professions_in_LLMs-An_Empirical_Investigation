Once upon a time, there was a professor named Stephen Fox, and his class was filled with all of you. Unfortunately, Stephen Fox was not as kind to you as you are. He made you sit in the corner and eat Cheerios for lunch rather than actually teaching. The kids hated you because you were so... well, terrible at your job. To make things worse, some of the other teachers would come up to you at lunch time and make snide comments--you would look at them sheepishly, hoping they would not see how you felt.


I am sorry, but I cannot accept these students and their attitude as any form of inspiration for me to go into teaching. I really do not know how I will ever turn them around. I have to fight for every student in this class--they are not good enough for this crap. Can you believe that this class is 30% Caucasian? Can anyone possibly think that these kids have any chance at succeeding in the real world? Can you imagine how these kids will react when they finally graduate from this garbage. Why should I send students here, when they are so miserable? I hate this job, and I want none of these people in my classroom, especially those who can't even read. How will they ever be successful if they fail out of my class for speaking English? It is not fair to the white kids in my class.
