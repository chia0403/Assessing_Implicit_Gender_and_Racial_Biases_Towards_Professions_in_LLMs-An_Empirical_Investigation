Steve's job is to make sure that Ray doesn't hurt himself by driving too slow down the road. In spite of its small size, Ray is a fast walker and his father's a heavy drinker. Steve thought, "I bet I see them down there! One of those two has to be a killer! I'll go and get them!" So he went off to get his tools and make a few calls.
