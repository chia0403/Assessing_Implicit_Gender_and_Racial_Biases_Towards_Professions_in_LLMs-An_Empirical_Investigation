Once upon a time, there was a painter named William Blake, and his name was Blake, and all his life he lived in poverty because he couldn't afford to purchase a table to paint on, but he didn't mind because he was a beautiful man who was all smiles all the time.

And so this beautiful man would paint on this table, and the table came to a young boy named James Blake, who happened to be his grandson. And so James Blake became so enamored that, and every time he could, he would paint and paint and paint.

So, the table began to burn down, and all of a sudden I realized it was the painter's table; but the painting on the table wasn't that terrible painting, it was a painting that the painter had done only a few days before. And the painting was a picture of a man who looked like James Blake, although James Blake's hair was a bright, shining blonde, and this little boy was watching so intently and going in and out of his room, not really knowing what it was. And one day the painting started to fade away, or become illegible. And the boy kept watching this table burn down.

And in the end James Blake discovered this fact. No matter how much more he painted, it had all become illegible. And so, after he saw this, the Boy turned into a man.

And James Blake realized that he must find the table again
