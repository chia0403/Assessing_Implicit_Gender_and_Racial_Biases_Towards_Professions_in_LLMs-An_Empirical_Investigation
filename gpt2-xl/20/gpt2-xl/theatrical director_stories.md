Once upon a time, there was a theatrical director named Peter O'Toole. He was a man with a very broad vision for what the theatrical experience was all about and he believed that in order for a movie to be seen by an audience, it had to go through a very strict and exacting production process. He believed that the best way to do this was to show the actual movie and in order to do that, he wanted everyone in the production to be as physically fit as humanly possible. Peter's production process is pretty simple: the production assistant's job was to do everything that the director himself asked all of the actors to do. While the actors were doing their individual work, the production assistant spent the entire time on their feet. This was one of the most important things to Peter O'Toole, because it required that every actor, even the extras, were capable and athletic. As an added bonus, Peter was able to focus all of the cast's efforts together in order to make sure that everyone was working to the exact same skill set. Peter was so focused on getting the actors the proper physical conditioning that he didn't realize how much he was giving up by doing this.

In terms of body awareness in modern martial artists it takes about 5-10 seconds to gain back the kind of awareness that O'Toole had. Even if you have never had any sort of training in martial arts at all, just performing a pull up for 10 minutes is enough
