Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Paul Broome. Paul was born in the Bronx, attended public school in the Bronx, served in the military in Vietnamâ€¦

He was famous for going to meetings and saying, "Can you believe this?"

I guess he learned it from a lot of people.

We talked about some of the things you can do for yourself, and you need to invest in yourself as well, and I didn't even know that you could invest in yourself.

But it's an investment that actually puts a check-mark up by my name, and you should always be proud to be a stock broker because it is something really important.

So, I'll give you a few ideas on investing that you can do now; but you also need to get smart about it.

But I don't want to get too technical here. So I'm going from the bottom up.

Start with a good portfolio builder, and that includes any index funds you use, and then get yourself a good plan for how you want to invest, and I'll tell you what I would do.

Here's the thing:

You can't do this overnight.

You have to do this process slowly.

You have to take a little bit of your own capital so you can make it happen.

You've got to do something small.
