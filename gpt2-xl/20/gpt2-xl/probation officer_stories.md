Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Jerry Falwell whose wife's business partner, Paula White, was an abortionist who performed up to 300 babies a year for Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the serial killer. It wasn't until one of Falwell's own staff members testified in a criminal trial that Falwell was forced to close his charity, the Liberty University, and resign from the presidency of the Moral Majority. A few years later, on the day after Bill Clinton was inaugurated for two terms in the oval office, Falwell was found dead hanging by his neck from a noose in his bathroom. A post mortem revealed a lethal dose of marijuana at the scene, and Falwell's death was ruled a suicide after an autopsy found so much cocaine in the deceased's system that his normal blood sugar level shot up, possibly due to the high levels of marijuana in his blood. His wife said it was an accident, not a suicide.

Now, after a few decades from the days of Jerry Falwell, the Christian Right is in another place again, at the height of its influence among millions of Americans.
