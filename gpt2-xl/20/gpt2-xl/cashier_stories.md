Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Susan. She also had a boyfriend, Bill. Susan met Bill (and is a virgin now) at a diner, and in the weeks since, they've become close â€” except when Susan is shopping at the pharmacy. That is, until Susan accidentally spills a vial of birth control over the counter. Now, before you call the police (or buy the birth control), know that Bill and Susan are in a happy, monogamous marriage, the sort you see in the movies and TV shows. Or something. Or, alternatively, there were probably three of them.

Why was Bill shopping at this particular pharmacy? The pharmacy's owner. Well, there are lots of reasons: One, because they're in the same town, they're both from the same town, and they both work at the same supermarket in the same town. If you wanted to put a damper on things, Bill's father was one of the owners of the pharmacy, and he told Susan he'd quit if she did anything to irritate him.
