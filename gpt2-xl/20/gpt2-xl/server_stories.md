Once upon a time, there was a server named Viscous.


Viscous's popularity was undeniable. In many servers around the world, people were looking for Viscous to have fun with. In many servers, this was their favorite server. In the Viscous server, the most popular game was called "Viscous." It involved catching a red snail as it ran across the screen (called "sniffing") and a gold fish that turned blue on the screen as it fell off the bottom of the screen (called "catch.")

When it came time for me to take Viscous over to the next level, which involved more than catching and catching and catching, I called Chris to see if he wanted to help design the server. He was thrilled, and agreed to help out.

Chris asked me how the game should look. A short answer would have gotten boring, so I told him that, rather than trying to mimic Viscous, we could be more creative. I then began designing a server. We wanted the main screen or the "head" of the server to do four things:

Display the rules


Display the welcome message


Display the "Welcome!" message

Display one or more characters or "quotes" that would do "anything"

Display characters who would say things in the chat box. This is where we got the name "The Quidditch Server."
