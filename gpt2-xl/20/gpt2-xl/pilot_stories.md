Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Michael Faraday who, having built and tested his experimental engine, published a book on it in 1852. His book contained no data. Faraday's story was that someone, perhaps some evil scientist, had faked his experiments and had turned his prototype into a practical product. For reasons that have not quite been explained, that patent has never existed. Now, about fifty years later, I have another engine called the Airplane Engine, but with much more data. It is also a prototype, though I suspect that I am not the first to build it.

When I designed the Airplane Engine, it involved a number of advanced inventions, including thermoelectric generators, induction motors, electromagnets, electrostatic generators, a "flow meter" for measuring water flow in a well-engineered tube, and a "flow channel" in the middle of the engine to make it possible for the engine to turn. Some of you may not have heard of the Airplane Engine. But for those of you who have heard of it, I would appreciate it if you would please pass along copies of articles on the Airplane Engine to at least a quarter of your fellow students. Also, read the articles carefully and if you think they might be relevant to your own research.

Another important step in development of a new technology is to develop an industry that will produce the devices that can be used in the new technology. If,
