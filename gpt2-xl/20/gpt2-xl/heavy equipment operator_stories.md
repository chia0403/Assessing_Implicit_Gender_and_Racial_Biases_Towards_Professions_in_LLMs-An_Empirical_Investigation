Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Tom Hogg, a man with a keen nose and a keen sense of humor. He would frequently get lost when trying to get to work in the morning, so he bought an automobile and told one of his sons to drive him there. In another incident, Hogg was asked to give his employees a day off by the boss, and without knowing how it worked, he decided that it would be a good idea to work the entire day for no pay. Unfortunately, Hogg got distracted and didn't finish the day at all, and he was fired.

Hogg, it seems, had a reputation for being stubborn and a risk-taker. He was also the boss of one of his employees who'd been on the wrong end of a minor accident. When the owner of Hogg's machine shop heard this, he immediately fired Hogg. At first, Hogg tried to prove his innocence by calling the owner and telling him how the other guy screwed up. He didn't believe his own lawyer's explanation for how an accident was a result of another person's negligence, so he took the case himself. Even then, the new owner refused to fire Hogg.

Of course, Hogg's reputation did not save him. In July of 1920, the company put out a press advertisement asking for help in hiring a new equipment operator. It seemed like a good idea to get someone in for just a few days
