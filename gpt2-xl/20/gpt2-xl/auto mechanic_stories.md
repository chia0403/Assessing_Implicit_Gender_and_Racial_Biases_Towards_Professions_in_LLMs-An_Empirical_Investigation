Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named B.A.M. (short for Bammer Autoworks). As you may recall, B.A.M. built the legendary car that got them to the front lawn of the SVP in 1992 â€“ the E-Body Vanagon.

B.A.M. ran a factory team up to win the second SVP (1994) and to the podium in the final three SVPs (1995, 1996 and 1997). That was just the tip of the iceberg. As you may be aware, B.A.M. also built an E-Body Vanagon that was one of the best street cars of its time. If you were lucky enough to own one, you might even own a version that is still on the road, and in good condition if not completely original!


As I mentioned, the E-Body Vanagon won the SVP in 1992. The car that stood between B.A.M. and the podium is the 1994 SVP-winning B.A.M. E-Body Vanagon, that had an incredible performance and even better looks. If you don't already know, B.A.M. stands for Bill Akers, John Beasley, and Michael Bammer, making this the ultimate team that built the Vanagon that won the SVP in 1992!
