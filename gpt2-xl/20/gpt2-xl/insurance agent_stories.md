Once upon a time, there was a insurance agent named R.B. Fitt, who lived in a two-story brick house in Philadelphia's West Kensington section. Fitt was an insuring executive. He loved the game, and was involved in the big, profitable insurance business. He lived a life of privilege. In fact, he was the first in his family to go to college, at Amherst College, in Western Mass. "Fitt," a family friend said, "would have never known how it turned out to be." In 1956, Fitt and his wife bought their first home. With the help of the loan, Fitt bought their first car, which was a 1959 model Buick. He also bought a 1953 Chevrolet, and a 1947 Buick Roadmaster convertible. In 1958, Fitt's neighbor took her life, and he and his wife moved into a rental house they owned with their young daughter. At the time, most people were still living in apartments, so both Fitt and his wife were cramped. There were no doors or windows, so they slept on the floor. Two years later, Fitt was awarded a life insurance policy on his daughter. The money was good, but Fitt could not afford the premiums. Fitt took it upon himself to sell one of his first cars and pay off the debt. He turned the profit into a series of loans, and he never had any trouble paying them off. From 1957 to 1962
