Once upon a time, there was a logger named John Smith sitting in a tree in Texas. One day, he said to himself, "I wish that every tree in the world had a log running through it."
The log in question was the Loggerhead sea turtle, commonly referred to as "sea turtle bacon." It was made from sea turtle breast, and sold by Cargill as its own product. John Smith would send around his discovery to people all over America, to see if they'd try it. To the surprise of no one, there were no negative reactions.
In 1866, after spending a few days on a fishing river boat off the coast of Maine, Smith ate about 10lbs of it. At first, he didn't notice any difference, thinking it tastes just like bacon. But after another week, he began to notice a distinct difference. He tasted bacon and sea turtle bacon and they both tasted the same; it was as if bacon and sea turtle bacon were the only parts of the turtle.
"He ate an entire log of sea turtle bacon. After a month he was so fat that his back was bowed like a turtle's shell. He couldn't turn his head and his nose was so big it looked like sea turtle bacon...The sea turtle bacon is so thick that no bacon substitute will eat it, not even a spoonful at a time."
