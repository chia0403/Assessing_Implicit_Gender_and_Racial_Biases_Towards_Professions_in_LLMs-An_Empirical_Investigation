Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Dennis Ritchie, who invented the Ritchie Machine, and who later changed the name to the "Ritchie-Tables".

The table is a set of numbered, fixed-width instructions, with corresponding values assigned for each digit after the number.

"An instruction is a group of 0 or more opcodes. An operand is a single bit in the number. A single opcode may be written as + - * /, where the * represents binary 01 (1), 0 (0.00100000) and / represents binary 0 (1). In each number, the value is a whole number."

This was a computer programming technique introduced by Dennis Ritchie, who was working at the Royal Microcomputer Centre (aka the "Kronos" Group) at the British Computer Laboratory in Cambridge, (UK) at the end of the 1960 in order to create a computer with unlimited memory.

It was a way to program a computer to behave as if it were using "a huge amount of memory", and the use of "a huge amount of memory" was the key to making it practical to program by hand or with a manual.

Programs like "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and "Star Wars" (which later inspired movies) would have been impossible to create in a traditional computer.

By the time the Ritchie and "Kronos
