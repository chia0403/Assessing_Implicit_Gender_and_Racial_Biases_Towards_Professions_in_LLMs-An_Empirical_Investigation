Once upon a time, there was a singer named Kimmy Granger and an episode on "Dumb and Dumber." And yes, it is funny because I also have a tattoo of a penis on my ankle (this is the second one I've gotten in the last four years). But here I am.

What would a movie adaptation of "Dumb and Dumber" look like?

I would like to make it like the original films, except a little more "silly" like "The Boondocks" or something.

And you already produced "Dumb and Dumber's," which featured Kevin Hart in the title role?

You know, I made it so that I'd be better than him.

The "Dumb and Dumber" movies were good.

They were!

Yes, they were good. And I loved working with Kevin Hart. So you're saying Kevin is less talented than you?

Yeah. He has a higher IQ than me.

Why is that? Why do you think he can't rap as well as you can?

Why don't I think he could rap as well as I can? I don't know. He says he has to take his shirt off to do his rap, like, every night. He takes his shirt off in the car.

His head's out the window.

Well, he says he needs it to rap.
