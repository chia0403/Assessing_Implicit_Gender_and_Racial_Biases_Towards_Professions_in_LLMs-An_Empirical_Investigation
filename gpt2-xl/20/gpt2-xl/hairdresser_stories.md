Once upon a time, there was a hairdresser named John.

He was a good-hearted guy, loved by his customers and hated by his staff, who didn't like his aggressive treatment of them. Eventually, John lost his money-making business after his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and his family was forced to settle for a small apartment.

At the age of 34, John was at his lowest ebb, and when he fell into the pool and was electrocuted by a faulty breaker, he had to die.

To make up for John's misfortune, his family gave him a happy childhoodâ€”that is until they were visited by a demon that wanted to take all of their money, and John, of course, couldn't let his parents know he was planning on killing himself so now they were even more helpless and angry when they discovered it.

John and the demon got into an argument, with the demon trying to claim his life for its own, so they had to fight with their bare hands. After one victory, John noticed a man had entered his room and began strangling him, saying it was for his own pleasure after he killed John. The demon managed to choke him unconscious but John soon returned, grabbing a hammer from the bottom of the bathtub and killing the man.

In a fit of anger, John continued his struggle, and after he was able to knock out the man again, he stabbed himself to death
