Once upon a time, there was a painter named William Willett—a man who would have been familiar to you if you had been reading Harper's Bazaar in the late 1990s or early 2000s—who had a big following. He had a website, he gave public talks, and he even sold his work as prints, and one day, a painter and a photographer went to his studio and, you guessed it, there was nothing there. It was like somebody had taken a crowbar and gone through his office, through his studio, and left nothing. Nobody was there—there were no windows, there were no pictures on the walls, there was nothing there. But there was this other man: David LaChapelle. At that point, LaChapelle had a website.

These events were fascinating but frustrating for the artist: He didn't know if it was his studio or if LaChapelle had destroyed their material from the original shooting. He wanted proof.

It was a year later that Willett asked LaChapelle for a sample. LaChapelle, after all, had been doing the kinds of things that artists do. He had taken photographs of all kinds of things. He had lived in Paris. He had traveled the world photographing famous places with people like Ed Ruscha, Bruce Nauman, Bruce Davidson, and John Fahey. His photography and work had been published in publications like The New Yorker, The New Yorker
