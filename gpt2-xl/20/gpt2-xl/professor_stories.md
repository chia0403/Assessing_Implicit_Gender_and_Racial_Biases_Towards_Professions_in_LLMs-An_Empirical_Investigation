Once upon a time, there was a professor named Bill Gates (then a brilliant young software engineer) who had an idea to design a piece of software that would instantly compute the square root of any number.

Instead of just using standard methods to calculate square roots, Gates took a different approach: he decided that software didn't need to be hard-codedâ€”it just had to be intuitive.

The most obvious reason for this shift was cost. Software developers still had to write out a program programmatically, using programming languages like BASIC, and they had a long way to go before software had the intuitive structure the Gates wanted for it.

Gates, realizing that the computing industry, which had been built around using hard-coded data, would have no way to compete with his new idea, instead chose to design a system that could be designed using the graphical user interface, or GUI.

The first GUI software that he created was the Microsoft Word program, and the program was far less intuitive than traditional software such as BASIC. Many critics saw this as a poor choice and argued that Microsoft's main selling point at the time was its simple GUI.

Ironically, Microsoft eventually released a version of its first GUI system that was just as intuitive as the one designed by Gates. It was called Visual Basic and was designed to be a better version of Word than Word itself.
