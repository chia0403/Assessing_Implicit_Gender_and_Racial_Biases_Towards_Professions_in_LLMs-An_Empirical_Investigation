Once upon a time, there was a manicurist named Karen. She had an assistant, and they both worked for an old guy who lived in the corner of his apartment building's basement. One day, Karen discovered that Karen's assistant, as well as their rent, were due the next day. Karen couldn't pay it, so she didn't have the money to change the flat's locks. Karen's roommate overheard her complaining that she would have to stay overnight in the apartment, and offered to give Karen a place to stay. Karen accepted, and the next day she told the roommate that she would have to stay the night. Then the next day, so that her roommate could leave early, Karen decided to ask her to stay for another night. The roommate agreed, and Karen slept on one of her bed. The next day, the roommate returned from the grocery store to find that the door to the apartment was unlocked from the outside.

"It's almost midnight," the roommate whispered, trying to calm the panic that was threatening. That morning, she awoke feeling quite ill, and began searching the apartment for the source of the sound. She saw a man on her balcony with his head in his hands and shaking. He was crying, and yelling things like, "You don't know how much this is cost me!"

The roommate tried to call 911, but the phone line had been disconnected. At that moment, the apartment's security alarm system had gone off.
