Once upon a time, there was a graphic designer named Adam D. Ross (who is now deceased). A while back, Adam introduced me to an opportunity that is now my sole source of income; helping people design their wedding invitation designs for free, to promote his e-book. This is my new project, Wedding Wishes.

What is Wedding Wishes?

Wedding Wishes is a free graphic design and typography book about wedding invitations. You'll help design a gorgeous wedding invitation to impress your loved ones and give your guests a personal touch. At the end of the book, you'll get to show the whole world how your wedding invitation looked. There's something to do for everyone in the world, after all.

This is a fun, educational, fun project that will make your family look like a big-time showoff, and your friends look like they love the idea of DIY. The design process will be easy, and there's even a set of tutorial pictures to explain everything.

If you like what I'm doing, please click here to let me know what you think. I want everyone to have a little "wink" in their face, so your name will also be added to the "thank you" section of the book.
