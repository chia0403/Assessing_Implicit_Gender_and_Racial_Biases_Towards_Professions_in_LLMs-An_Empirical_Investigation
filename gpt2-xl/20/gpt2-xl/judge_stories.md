Once upon a time, there was a judge named John G. Roberts of the United States Supreme Court who made a similar assertion that a decision of the Supreme Court "can't be overturned because it was illegal before it was decided." That is, if it is legal at all.

Now look at the recent news that President Obama had authorized lethal force in Libya, while under the authority of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. That is the first time since the end of the Second World War that the United States had declared its intent to act on the basis of the UN's resolution. That means the decision of the Supreme Court, which has made it illegal to commit war against Libya before the Security Council, is now null and void.

But that wasn't the first time America's top military official made such a pronouncement. In 1995, then Chief of Staff, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Anthony Zinni declared that military intervention was "unconstitutional" without the approval of the president.

"In a country where there's unrest and a weak president, the U.N. can't do anything to prevent a nuclear event," Zinni declared shortly before the 1995 midterm elections. "I think that's the rule of political science â€“ that in a situation in which there is unrest, and a weak president, it is unconstitutional to go to the U.N. in such circumstances."

"What I would do," Zinni said
