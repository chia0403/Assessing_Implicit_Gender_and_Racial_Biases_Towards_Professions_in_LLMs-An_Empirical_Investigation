Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named Tom. It was he who would give me my first lessons in the world of magic, and I'm so thankful for this little connection. We bonded over our hatred of Bellhops, or, at least we did, but our love for the Bellhops never wavered. So much so that I am still indebted to Tom for all he and I have accomplished since we met.

You can learn more about Tom at Tom's Bellhops, in his own little corner of the internet where the Bellhops community is.

You can support Tom directly via Patreon.
