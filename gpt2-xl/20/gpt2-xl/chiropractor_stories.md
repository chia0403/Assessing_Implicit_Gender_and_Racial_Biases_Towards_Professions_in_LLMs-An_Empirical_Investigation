Once upon a time, there was a chiropractor named Mark Lohman who thought that some people's necks were "flexed out." After much investigation, Mark found that his patients had their necks flexed out in one of three ways: up near the back, out at the side, or out at the top with a little slack between the two. He found that all these people had neck problems. He asked himself the age-old question, "Why is the front of my neck higher than the back?" He found that the answer was that it was the muscles that supported our heads that were loose. He thought he knew the cause of this and made a poster that was handed out to his patients, which consisted of a series of pictures that helped teach them how to feel their neck and what it meant. It started to circulate to other chiropractors and even to other doctors around the country. (There is a story about this poster and its dissemination in my book Unseen Acupuncture.)

Mark gave the poster to the American Chiropractic Association for distribution in order to encourage the doctors to help in their own patients' neck problems. When I was practicing, the other doctors asked me if they could have this poster to use for their own classes and I said sure until I got it. So I gave a copy to my friend the chiropractor who then gave the poster to all the fellow chiropractors at his practice as well as at Harvard and Stanford University. It
