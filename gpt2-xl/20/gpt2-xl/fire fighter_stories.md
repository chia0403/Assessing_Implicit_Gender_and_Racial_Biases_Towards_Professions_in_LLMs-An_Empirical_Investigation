Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Billy Bob. In his day, Billy Bob also rode a motorcycle. Unfortunately, one day he got knocked off his bike by a car. Nowadays he wears a helmet, and goes about his life as a firefighter in a fire department. Sometimes he comes across motorcycles. Sometimes, Billy Bob rides his motorcycle over to a motorcycle in the road so that he can pull someone from the motorcycle to safety. In this episode we learn a little bit more about Billy Bob and his life. The story tells of Billy Bob riding his bikes around towns taking care of fires. It was a tough life, and for many years Bob never lost his sense of adventure. Unfortunately, one day, Billy Bob had the worst case of road rage in his whole life. He raced his bike across town, knocking over a few people and a car. After this incident, Billy Bob became a one man army. This was a time when it was easier to go against the crowd, when you could be yourself. Billy Bob didn't have that much time to dwell on his past; he went out and got back in the saddle of his bike. Billy Bob soon picked up and moved to another neighborhood, where in less than a year, he had been riding motorcycles for 10 years. Then Billy Bob met a young woman named Bethany. They got married and had three children. Unfortunately, Bethany was killed in a car crash in 1975 when Billy Bob was 25 years old
