Once upon a time, there was a barber named Billy the Kid. He used a comb to trim his mustache, and his business flourished. Then one day, the owner of the barbershop, Mr. Nance, came on to him and cut off one side of his mustache, but kept the other side. Soon, others began coming to see Mr. Nance cut off their moustaches, and it soon went through the whole street, down to the river and to the taverns. But Billy was proud of his moustache, and gave the barbershop money to buy more moustaches. He kept the money for himself. One day Mr. Nance was sitting in the bar and listening to Billy's stories. Finally, he said, "My, you've got a great tale, Billy, don't you? I wonder if Mr. Nance has ever heard of a man named Frank."
