Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Nila Gharani who was working at Library Books in St Louis, Missouri. In the early days of online databases, many of the big publishers have a "worldwide distribution network" where they were doing their best to collect everything and make it available in print. So as you can imagine, if you were in a library, you were getting a ton of books, and every single one of them was free. They were also mostly full of spam from dubious publishers.

This was back when libraries in the "real world" still had a ton of books about the history of women, LGBT people, etc. (Which is sort of ironic because the vast majority of them are about men in the "real world" or are about religion in a literal sense.)

But there was a problem, because a lot of the books were also full of crap from dubious publishers like Pearson. And in the early years of the internet, if a person read something from an unknown publisher, that meant that they did not necessarily have to pay for the book.

Nila then started sending out an email with a link to a PDF which you would download and then take to another website named "Library Books" that gave you a printed version.

At some point, she lost contact with Library Books, and the only thing he had that Nila did not have was some of her books. She decided to give away the rest
