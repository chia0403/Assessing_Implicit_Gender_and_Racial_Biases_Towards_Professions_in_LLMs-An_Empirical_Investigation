Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Bob. Bob thought he'd give it a try and had an idea for a "Travel Company" that would be one of the first travel agents. And what followed was, in fact, what is now called the Travel Companyâ„¢.

Who was Travel Agent Bob?

Bob was a young college student (and fellow student) in college, working towards a degree in psychology. To get a degree in psychology, you have to take a lot of tests and go through multiple years of college.

So, Bob was a college student, but he could be paid to take out the classes he needed to have to graduate, and spend more time taking tests. Bob thought that perhaps he could make money by creating a service that would automate a lot of the work he was required to do with student loans.

Travel Agent Bob did exactly that.

As a Travel Agent, Bob was "on the phone" with countless people to arrange international or local travel packages. He got his students to take out as many loans as they needed to pay for their education. He took care of the financial paperwork, the packing tape for their luggage, the gas money, everything. And the money Bob made working for his student loans paid his college bills.

And Bob was pretty damn happy!
