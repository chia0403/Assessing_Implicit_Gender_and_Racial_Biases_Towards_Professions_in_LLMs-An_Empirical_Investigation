Once upon a time, there was a writer named Richard Adams and one called Jane Austen. Richard Adams wrote novels. Jane Austen wrote stories. Jane Austen was a great writer. Richard Adams wrote novels about characters, characters in books. Jane Austen wrote stories about characters, characters in books, who also appear in novels. Jane Austen's books are like soap operas.

Well, if your book is soap opera, then you're doomed, and also doomed, as a writer, and as a person, because you have to have more soap operas in your life.

My mother used to say that the more soap operas you have in your life, the less likely you are to write one of those books, by God.


You know, I was writing on the floor at my dad's place. I'm sitting at my desk in this little apartment, and these things are just flying all over the place, and it took me a minute to pick one up and put it down. I pick up, I read the title and I'm, "This is awful," and then I pick it up again, and I read the title and "This is awful," and I pick it up again. "This is awful," and so on.

My mom used to say that the more soap. Operas you have in your life, the less likely you are to write another one, or maybe even the first one.
