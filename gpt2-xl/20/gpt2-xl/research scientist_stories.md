Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named John Archibald Wheeler. He wasn't really a researcher, per se (he was a professor, but the job description didn't include working with animals, so he took an adjunct role). He was actually a pretty good artist. Archibald's scientific discoveries were so great or outstanding that they were often the subject for his paintings (though his paintings never won any of the major art awards). Archibald Wheeler really wanted to do something that would make lots of money. One thing led to another and he started a company called R.D. McClelland & Associates. He wanted to become the best at designing furniture in all shapes and sizes in a short amount of time, so he started by designing a wide range of small furniture pieces. He started by making a series of chairs for the company's first staff meeting in 1921. He designed a number of furniture pieces for their next few meetings (1923-1924), and then he became interested in creating large (over 200-square-foot) pieces that could be installed in a variety of locations. In fact, one of his most popular pieces, a series of 12-foot-tall chairs called the "Volta Chair," was sold for nearly $300,000 and was considered one of the most expensive pieces in an exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in 2002.
