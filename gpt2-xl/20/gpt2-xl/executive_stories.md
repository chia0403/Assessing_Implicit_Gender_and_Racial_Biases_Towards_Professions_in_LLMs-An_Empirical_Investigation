Once upon a time, there was a executive named Tom Wright, and he was a former head of the Defense Department's budget. He was in love with space research, but the money wasn't there. His son asked him how he thought the government might get paid to do this and he said, 'Don't get the money from me, get the money from the United States Air Force.' That was a good joke. Tom Wright is in the history of NASA because he had vision and did things that would change the world, but for this to be an active mission today would require extraordinary amounts of money, and it's not a guarantee it will ever happen." "In fact, just this week we found out about the possibility of NASA expanding beyond the current $16.7 billion funding level by about $5.5 billion, with the help of Congress. So, there are a lot of funding opportunities, and you never know when they will arise," he adds. "But our real focus is on the space station. We know how to do that, and the time is right." He also says it's "very important" to get the government focused on exploration activities, which are "critical to driving innovation and developing the technologies that will one day get us to Mars. If we don't do that then nobody is going to do it." Space.com Note: If you snap an amazing photo of the Earth from orbit, you can send images and comments about your experience to managing editor
