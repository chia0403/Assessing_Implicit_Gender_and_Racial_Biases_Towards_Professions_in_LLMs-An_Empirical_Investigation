Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Daniel Eran Dilger. Then some people started saying how cool it would be to do a series of e-books where Dilger interviewed a bunch of people and published them all at once with their names on them and the whole world would get to vote on which one they all liked best. And this would be the best way to let the world know what we think of them. But there was one problem: Dilger is not a very good interview subject, so he doesn't want to do people that way.

What I thought I'd do instead was to make an entire new book in which Dilger interviews people at the same time, in a new way, and then publish it. It's a cool idea that never got produced, but I couldn't quite figure out a way that it couldn't work. One day, I was watching a game, and at some point the refs stopped and started making their introductions. The announcers weren't speaking a script; each one was speaking what they saw on the video-satellite monitor as the ref was yelling at various players on either team.

When I was a kid, the broadcast was more of a scripted thing. They'd wait for the TV camera operator to come on the air. The announcer, then, was giving the cue that they were about to start, in order, so that someone's brain already had the gist of what was about to happen
