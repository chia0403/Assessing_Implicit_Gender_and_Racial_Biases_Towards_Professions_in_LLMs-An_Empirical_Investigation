Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Mary Jane Blanchard, who tried to get you to add some vegetables to your meal a little easier than you do on those Superbowl Sunday when there are lots of fried foods. It's not as easy as that, although she'll tell you that they're just as delicious, especially if you have a lot of them. So, in the spirit of healthy eating, we are making this healthy dinner quick and super simple.
