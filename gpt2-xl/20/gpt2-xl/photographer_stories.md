Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Jack White; with his studio on Sunset Boulevard he shot some of the highest paid celebrities (and had a photo of Elvis Presley that still hangs in his Los Angeles studio) and had an even higher opinion of their beauty. But when the studio was moved to Newport and Jack White retired from photography, he decided to take some photos himself with his camera.

Jack decided the best way to create his own photographic identity was to take pictures of himself.

Jack has now put thousands of his own photographs online for the world to view. Check out his photography portfolio here.
