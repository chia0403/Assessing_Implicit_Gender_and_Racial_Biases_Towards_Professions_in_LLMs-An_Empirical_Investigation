Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Frank Wills. He had come to believe in a principle of law that was new to him. The law of possession is inextricably and inseparably bound up with the law of due process of law and the law of human dignity. It is possible to say that the property of a lawyer in a case is forfeited to the state simply through the violation of a rule of the law, e.g., "the client is entitled to possession of the property only as long as such violation continues to be a continuing one." But this is only part of the truth. Possession is part of a whole, of a whole that includes the freedom of the client as well as that of the lawyer. If a lawyer, who is innocent or foolish, fails to show for a case before a judge, or after a trial, at all, and the case continues to go through a long waiting period, or if for years he fails to come back to his client, then there is a serious risk that the lawyer's title to the property will be forfeited or be lost, along with the client's. This risk arises, then, at an arbitrary moment when a lawyer, who has a good reputation in the community, comes to an unsatisfactory end. When I speak here of taking a client with ill-will, I do not mean like some sort of lawyer's contract, or like other contractual arrangements which the lawyer can unilaterally withdraw from
