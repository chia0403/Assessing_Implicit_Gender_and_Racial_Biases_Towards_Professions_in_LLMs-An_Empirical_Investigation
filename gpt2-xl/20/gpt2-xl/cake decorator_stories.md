Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named Gino, who decided to build a cake with a giant hole and then get the police to put him in the hole. He did this for several days until the police decided not to call the hole a crime because the hole was in a church, something that a normal person would be able to find a place to put his face. The police decided to do it anyway because they found it funny. Later, Gino and his buddy and cake-maker Joe went to New York, where Gino and Joe decided to build a giant cake with holes so they could shoot an air pistol at each other. Gino and Joe came to believe that there were no "good guys" or "bad guys" in the world. Gino was a devout Catholic, and he knew that Joe was trying to convert the rest of the population. A few months after Joe built that cake, he was shot in the face by a criminal. Gino and Joe went to New York and the cops called the shooting justified because he was trying to convert the rest of the country. Gino and Joe had never been in touch after that, so nobody knew how Joe survived his accident. Gino decided to build his cake in his living room. He had all of the cake layers cut out of old cake pans, and he started with 10 layers. When he was done he noticed that there was one more cake layer sitting around in a huge red jar.
