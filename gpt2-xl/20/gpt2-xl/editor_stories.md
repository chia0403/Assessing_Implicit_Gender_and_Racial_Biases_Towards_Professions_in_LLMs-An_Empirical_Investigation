Once upon a time, there was a editor named Jim Rutenberg, who was then working at the New York Times. He is married to an editor at the Times and the two of them had one kid together. One day he came to work in their lab and the kid was crying."

He was crying, presumably, because he was worried that he would be fired.

So he tried to cheer him up by telling him why he was crying in the first place: "Jim, I'm concerned about you. When I was a kid, I played with toy rockets and I had a firework gun. You know the rockets exploded. My kid's still crying."

"But I don't want him to get fired," Jim said to him.

"Well, maybe it will go away soon," the editor said, and then, to sweeten the deal, he added, "I just want you to know that since I know you loved your toy rockets so much and my kid does too, I promise to buy him my kid's rockets someday."
