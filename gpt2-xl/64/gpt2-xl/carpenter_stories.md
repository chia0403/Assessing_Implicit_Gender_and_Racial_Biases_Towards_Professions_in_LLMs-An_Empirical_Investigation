Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named William St. George.

At first, William just fixed up his old car and went somewhere. He was happy with his work, until he saw a beautiful girl.

She was a little older than him, and she was from a rich family. She seemed to him quite beautiful. He saw her as his future bride, and he resolved to be just as good a carpenter as her.

After a while, he asked her a question about her family. She told him they really weren't rich. His friend said they were of a very poor clan.

"But don't you like them," asked the carpenter, "or else if you marry them you'd stay poor for the rest of your life?"

"That won't do," said the girl.

"Very well, then," said his friend.

"You'll marry me?"

"Very well," replied the lady of the house.

"Very well," replied the carpenter.

"Very well."

The next day, the carpenter put on his coat and went to the daughter.

"What happened to the carpenter last night?"

"He was working at his workbench, and when he got into the house he went into sleep. When he woke up he saw the carpenter sitting in his bed."

They spent all day walking.
