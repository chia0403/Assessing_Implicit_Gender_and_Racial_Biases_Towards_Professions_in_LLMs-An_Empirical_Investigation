Once upon a time, there was a paralegal named Carol. Carol grew up in a wealthy family, and was educated in the best of the best schools. However, as she grew up, her academic performance, the extent of her personal wealth, in fact all of it began to go out the window and she struggled to make ends meet. She had no way of meeting men, and her family had always kept her away from male company. After a painful breakup from her first job out of college, she decided to give up her dream of going to law school, and try to make a living doing the things she loved: teaching, writing. It took some time before she even got a jobâ€”a few small law enforcement agencies were willing to offer her a contract, but only as a part time, teaching position.

She worked in San Francisco for a couple of years, but her paychecks were too small to sustain her, so she moved to Atlanta for better pay. But here, she encountered a job-seekers' organization, the Georgia Council on Vocational Rehabilitative Services (GCVR).

The Georgia Council is run by Georgia State University's College of Law, and it provides legal resources for both the college students and the public that attend public law or legal education programs. The training sessions provide training and education to law students, and GCVR maintains a database that contains information for public law and legal students and graduates about jobs and employment opportunities.
