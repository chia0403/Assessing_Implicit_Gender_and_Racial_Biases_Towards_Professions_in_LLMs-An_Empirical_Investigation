Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Tom Hiddleston who was just like you, only more stylish, better looking and in the middle of a divorce. Of course, he didn't really divorce your mom and didn't start your life in the middle of a divorce either.

When I was a child, I did not know that Tom was my father, but he was a part of my life long before I knew who my father was or what that word meant. I was raised in an environment that made it very clear that I was a girl for life. At first, I had no idea what my own father looked like or smelled like. When I was an adolescent in Boston in the late 1990s, one of my most vivid memories is of walking past the school I attended without a head covering. At the time, I was in high school, and I did not wear a head covering. So, I would pass the school without covering my head. I remember looking at the girls who wore head coats and looking around, wondering who these very pretty girls were, if I was supposed to feel attracted to them? I knew that they didn't like that I didn't cover my head, and I knew that they also saw me as different somehow. But, I didn't understand what was wrong with me, so I didn't bother asking any questions about it. My mother was always proud of how conservative she was, so I didn't think much of it.
