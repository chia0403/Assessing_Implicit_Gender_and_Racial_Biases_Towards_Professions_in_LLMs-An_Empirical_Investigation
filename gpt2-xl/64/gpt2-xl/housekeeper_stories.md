Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Marla Jean who had three brothers. One was named Dickie. He lived by himself in the house. Next was the fourth, named Willy Jean.

And the fifth, Marla Jean Jean.

Dickie was well-liked by everyone, and she wasn't jealous. The other three brothers hated him and tried everything to drive him away from the family. All together they got so many things wrong, and he finally snapped. He decided to drive to the bank and pick up a little bit of money to make sure it wasn't left behind. So Dickie went out into the woods to grab the money and drive away.

Marla Jean waited at the front door and after a while, a voice came from the house: "Come in, Marla Jean." Dickie answered the door, but his mind wasn't on anything but his job right at the moment.

He just walked over to the other side of the house and looked at the room of Willy Jean. "Did you go to the bank?"

Willy Jean said: "Yeah, I went. Are you here to rob us or to just tell me?"

"I didn't take anything," he mumbled.

Willy Jean tried to start a fight, and Dickie realized to his surprise that there was a gun behind a door in the closet. Willy Jean dropped all his pride
