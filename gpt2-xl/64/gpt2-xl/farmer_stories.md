Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Bill who had bought land in a distant land to live close to his family. Over the years the property had grown and his family expanded into the surrounding area. By the time the current owner came along and his family became too numerous for the farmhouse, Bill had become more and more bored with the monotony of the farming life and the idea of running his farm full-time. He was forced out of his home when it was damaged by fire and then his home burnt down along with the surrounding area. Bill had decided to move and begin a new life with friends and family at a new farm which he had purchased nearby. With the help of a loan from a woman he knew, Bill began the long, tedious but fun process of establishing a new life. A few years into the new life his wife divorced him due to infidelity and the other woman took over his farm. During the long and arduous process of setting up a new life, Bill noticed that a new creature constantly crossed the road and tried to eat his food. This new creature was much larger than his previous encounter and had a vicious gaze that seemed to have no limits. With no other options, Bill, with the help of a large bag of fertilizer, killed off his new visitor and tried to re-establish his farm lifestyle. Since then Bill has not had another new visitor to his farm and in general has not even known who the animal in question was. At
