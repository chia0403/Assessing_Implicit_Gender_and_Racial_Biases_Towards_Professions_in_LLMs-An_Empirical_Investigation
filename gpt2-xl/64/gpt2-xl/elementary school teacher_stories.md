Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Miss Alice Lee who had five kids: the sweet, bubbly Annie, the jolly, gregarious Charlie, the brave and thoughtful Will Smith, and the geeky, sweet, clever Liza. As the generations passed, Alice's youngest, Liza, left her husband and started a family of her own. She married the teacher and stayed single, never giving any of her kids up for adoption, not even her adorable, mischievous Liza. Well, now our favorite Liza, the one who became Mrs. Smith, is gone but Liza and Will are not alone. They're with a young man, his wife, and his three grown daughters. Together, they look upon a world that has changed dramatically since Liza's time. Now they make the living on a houseboat and try to do good as they know they can. Then the unexpected happens, one more change and they come face to face with old habits and a new vision of their future. Written by Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>
