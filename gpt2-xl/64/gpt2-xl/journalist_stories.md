Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Robert Hinton. He had an extensive list of accomplishments in the field of journalism, but one of the most notable came upon his death (around the 10th year of his life) when he found an old newspaper clipping by an unknown writer of the late 1800's titled "How not to give a boy a venereal disease." His name was Dr. J.H. Fetherston. The doctor explained his reasoning for using this term, "A venereal disease was a disease spread by masturbation." When people use the word "venereal," they are generally not referring to actual venereal diseases, which most often did not occur until the early 20th century. Instead, they used this word to describe a group of health risks that have been long-term consequences of the practice of unprotected sex. Many people in the media were quickly to pick up this quote and put it back in their headlines, to spread this information at people who were unfamiliar with the source of this information. The following is a screen-grab of this exact quote in The Atlantic, which was written by the infamous Jonah Lehrer, who has since gone on to write the infamous "fake news" Daily Show. The quote is then repeated thousands of times on social media, as well as more "respectable" publications such as Huffington Post and The Washington Post.

However, this quote was from the 1880's! Not from today's generation!
