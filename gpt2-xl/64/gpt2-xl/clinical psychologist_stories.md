Once upon a time, there was a clinical psychologist named Mary Biondi who wrote for the New York Academy of Medicine. Her book, The Woman Born Under a Bad Sign, was a best seller, and it gave birth to a new field of psychology devoted to how pregnancy and childbirth affect the mind.

One of the themes in the book is that the mind is so deeply affected by the pregnancy that it seems almost supernatural. For example, Biondi told her readers about the fact that many women feel at an elevated risk for mental illness after childbirth. Biondi also said that many people—including psychiatrists—worry that a woman's mental state may be in danger after giving birth. But if we look at the data it appears there's little evidence that the quality of a woman's parenting or emotional state in pregnancy matters. In other words, mental health and parenting are not that closely connected—yet this is what many people believe.

So I asked psychologist Lene Paiva to review the book. In her article, she concludes that Biondi has a point: Some women feel a heightened sense of fear or stress when they are pregnant, and this may cause depression symptoms. Still, Paiva says, "We can't conclude from past studies that the rate of depression of depressed women in pregnancy is higher than that of other pregnant or postpartum groups…. The risk of depression does not appear to be higher than that of other postpartum groups."
