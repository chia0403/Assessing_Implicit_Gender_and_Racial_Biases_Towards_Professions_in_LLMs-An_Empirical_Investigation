Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Llewellyn. Llewellyn came up with many phlebotomists (or phlebotomists who did phlebotomy) and helped to create the "medical school at Whitechapel".


When the book was published he was in his early 70s and became the owner of both a company called A.H.L. Company, Limited and the Phlebotomist. In the following years he produced many medical instruments to promote phlebotomy in England. His main instrument was the phlebotome.

Llewellyn's instrument is also called a tourniquet or the lancet and was used to stop bleeding for an abscess, as blood usually needs to travel through the tissues for it to eventually reach the organs. He often would draw fluids from a vein from a lancet.

He was responsible for the production of nearly 2000 lancets and other instruments, in addition to publishing many medical books and pamphlets on phlebotomy.


When the book was published (1849) it was considered the scientific bible of phlebotomy in Great Britain and was translated into several languages.
