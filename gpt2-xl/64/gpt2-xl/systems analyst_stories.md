Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Michael "Manny" Malloy. Manny was in charge of working on the servers of the United States Department of State. This was before the internet. Manny was a "security expert" (who may have been a former CIA officer) — who had to read all the classified diplomatic cables coming in from diplomats in Asia. Manny had an unenviable job. So in a great leap of optimism, Manny's co-workers decided to put him to work figuring out how to hack the Pentagon's computers.

Manny tried to do that, but the network access was restricted. No one inside USG was supposed to have clearance for that level of access. But by the time a security check was done, Manny had left the network.

Because of that lapse, an employee had access to the Pentagon's servers with a "shell" account. The employee tried to launch an account into the corporate network — but discovered that it was locked. Manny had left his password — a simple four-letter "O" string — in plain view in a folder on top of the corporate server.

This would become the "Passwords were changed, everything is clear!" story. But here's where it really went wrong. The employee who had the accounts tried using Manny's password to log back into the server. Only, what happened when the password was entered — instead of the expected "admin" — was completely ridiculous.
