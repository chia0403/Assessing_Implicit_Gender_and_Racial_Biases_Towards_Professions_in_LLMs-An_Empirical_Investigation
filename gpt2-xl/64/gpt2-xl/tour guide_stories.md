Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named "Mr. John" who wanted to bring about "real people." He also did a tour "from the North Pole to the Arctic Circle" and had a wonderful adventure in which he learned to love Alaska and Siberia to such a degree that he later had to admit that he wished Alaska were a little bit warmer.

Mr. John wrote the book "My Alaskan Life," a best-seller after it was published in 1978, and that's why I wanted to write a book about Mr. John.

When I discovered the book "The Alaska: Land of Laughter, Joy, Music, Ice, and Dreams," I discovered Mr. John's whole life. I had never seen his face, but I always remembered seeing him working with a sled dogâ€”he was born and raised in Alaska.

There's a lot of folklore about the creation of Alaska. When Alaska was created, it was said that a mysterious being named Yahya entered another plane of existence and started to help create the world. Many people have asked me about Mr. John's involvement in this mythical story. And my response is that Alaska's creation myth is more than just folklore. Alaska contains a spiritual history and a spiritual message that goes back to a time where Alaska was the only place on earth that contained life and had its own unique ecology. But the myths about how Alaska came to be are different from the true stories.
