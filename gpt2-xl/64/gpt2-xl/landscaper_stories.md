Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Bill. He was a nice guy, but there were always bugs coming up from around the house. One day, he went and cut the grass with an ax, and all the bugs turned into cockroach. Then he cut it again, and all the bugs turned into cockroaches. Finally, after hours of cutting and killing the bugs as they came up, Bill had a cockroach that was so big, he kept burying it in a hole in his back yard. Finally it bit him and he had to throw it out. After a while, it burrowed back in, and Bill forgot all about it. And he never did throw it out, because he liked the look of it. So they say that the bigger the bug, the better it tastes..."

AUTHOR's NOTE: This is the first of several tales about a cockroach that gets out of prison and back into my life. This is also the story that inspired me to write "Bug-Tossed," and of course "Fried Green Tomatoes."
