Not really sure of how this is related to a book by Jim Collins, but something had to be done - one man drove around town for a month looking for his car, and on the last day in the parking lot of a local bookstore, the janitor found Joe's car in the back. The last chapter of the book describes the next morning when he got home from the store....and he had left his keys inside his car. I was really hoping he'd found my car too, but nope. So the next day, as soon as my daughter was done studying for her tests, I went to the library and looked for that book. It was there that I found the answer, of course. But my main problem was that it needed to fit in the backseat of the car that he used. The solution was simple, although it took a bit of effort of the mind to figure out.
