Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Jack. The one-and-only Jack.

He would have never guessed, as a kid, that his story would one day be featured in Time magazine. But Jack got a call from Bob Clark, the creator of one of the defining sitcoms of the early "golden age" of television, The Mary Tyler Moore Show. After hearing about Jack's life and career, Clark invited the kid to lunch and to the cast and crew of Mary, Mary, Mary. It was a rare chance, and a treat for Jack, to share the stage with the creators of the biggest show on television.

Back when Jack was a young kid in a small Colorado town, his parents divorced. He wasn't very involved in the divorce or his mom's new husband. What Jack and his dad didn't know at the time was that the divorce, even though it had dragged on for almost a year, would be finalized in March of 1957 when Jack's mom got a divorce, too.

Jack moved in with his grandparents. His dad's job took a few days, and while Jack was at his grandma's house, his dad worked more nights and weekends.

It was around that time, when Jack got bored with his work, he started using cocaine every day to pass the time. The drug made him feel happy. "It made me feel like every damn day was perfect," Jack told the New Yorker
