Once upon a time, there was a librarian named Tiki, a girl with long dark hair and long red lips, red-painted cheeks, and bright red lips that were all the rage at the time, that was one of the most popular people in campus.[1]

On this particular day, she had just finished helping her friend Dora out, which was done in a way similar to a high school friend's help, like helping the neighbor with their housework. Tiki asked Dora how she got to see her like this and in a soft, gentle voice stated that her eyes were so red that they practically glowed. Dora, who was so impressed with them, said that she liked the color of her hair and her pink lips as well because they were all that she wanted to have. Tiki told Dora that she thought that if she grew her hair long enough it would eventually glisten like this and asked Dora, who thought it was funny, if it would glisten like this too. Tiki asked Dora if she wanted to see her blush all over and in a soft, sweet voice, told him that she had come to think of it as the 'glow-in-the-dark lipstick' as it was a nice change of pace for her. Dora, who had thought it was hilarious, laughed and said that if she couldn't laugh with him, she wouldn't smile, like it would just be gross
