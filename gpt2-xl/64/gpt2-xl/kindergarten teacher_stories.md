Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Maria in the Philippines who was given the honour of carrying a "baby" – one of her own infants. This woman chose to abandon the child to life in an orphanage, when it was discovered that she herself was a surrogate mother to eight infants. In 2009, a woman in India named Savita was given the honour of carrying her own baby for the same reason – to give it a life. When the woman discovered she was pregnant again, she returned the child to the hospital rather than letting it die and give its life to others.

However, these mothers may not even realise they have taken on a burden of having to bear another human life which they never chose, when they are presented with a family's or an institution's responsibility. In such cases, our moral duty is as if we were their parents – to be their carers in every possible way, not to be an extension of the institution that is responsible in this case to a human being's safety

If we fail to recognise such responsibilities when they occur in our day to day lives, in our personal relationships, we fail to ensure that no one will ever go through a similar experience. The reality is we fail to ensure justice for others and, more importantly, we fail to uphold the dignity of a human being. We need to change the behaviour of all those who we interact with into thinking differently about the importance of caring for children and children's lives.
