Once upon a time, there was a architect named David Mackenzie that designed a house with an outside garden, a large porch, and a small porch that would sit a short distance from the bedroom on the second floor. He had planned to have both sides of the house covered in a large white canvas, and a very large wooden door. This was a sort of outdoor "dining room" that was usually covered with a large green tarp, and would sit on top of the garden.

Mackenzie's wife was kind enough to sit in this large canvas room and watch her husband work. Unfortunately, Mackenzie's wife died in 1834 and when his children inherited her estate, everything was changed. They no longer had a white canvas room, yet they still needed a garden. As the little garden they had was already being used to grow vegetables and some herbs that were grown for medicinal purposes, none of them wanted to make the huge, complicated gardens that Mackenzie had originally planned.

It's important to note that Mackenzie was a very meticulous mind. He was a great designer who had a love and respect for materials. As such, he built the house himself using local quarry stones and locally sourced rocks. This allows much of what you can see in the house to be handmade. That said, Mackenzie designed and built most of the house himself and had a shop where he sold a variety of tools, tools of his own and other crafts. There's not much
