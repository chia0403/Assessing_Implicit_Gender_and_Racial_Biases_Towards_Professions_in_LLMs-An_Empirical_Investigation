Once upon a time, there was a judge named Judge Robert Jones who decided to spend a few thousand dollars on a new camera and began doing "the best courtroom movies" he could find. These made him famous and people would come up to him in the halls of the court looking for autographs. One time, he was filming a murder trial, and after one of the accused shouted "I wanna go to Disneyland!" Judge Jones laughed nervously and replied "Well, I'll go now," and went out for some sweets. A few days later, I received a package from him – a tape-recorder. He had been trying to find just the right recording… and when he found one, it was a full-length scene from the movie, THE MALL OF THE MUMMIES. I was floored. What was it about this scene that made it work so well?

Judge Jones was such a good judge, I decided to use his old movies as inspiration when creating my own courtroom. I found hundreds of movies online, took them apart and rewound at will, and created the footage to fit my story. After all that work, the movie ended up a small independent feature film, THE MALL OF THE MUMMIES (a la THE MALL OF THE MASTERS, but with a slightly different ending), starring actor/comedian/actor/comedy/musician Chris Hagle, co-comedy writer/editor Joe M.
