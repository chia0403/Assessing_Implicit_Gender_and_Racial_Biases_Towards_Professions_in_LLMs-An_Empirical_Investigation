Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Dwayne Bostick. He was so famous, in fact, that people called him "The Boss," because he ran the only jail in the State of Michigan that had a real name. But all was not well behind the walls of this institution—or was it?

Bostick had been convicted of murder. One afternoon, he arrived in response to a report that a man had been attacked and badly hurt in a parking lot behind his office. Bostick was a quiet, cautious man and he didn't want to overreact. But when he went inside, a guard had left the prison and came over to ask him for directions to the parking lot. When the officer explained that the parking lot was off-limits and Bostick was asked to leave, he became irate—with himself. It was there, Bostick says, that he took a shotgun and fired on what he thought was a fellow inmate. As he recalls it today, after a few seconds of silence he heard a distinct sound: a bullet ripping through his shoulder. He looked down at his wound—an eight-inch gash that wouldn't heal—and saw blood streaming down his back. "I remember thinking, My God, did this happen to me?" Bostick says. "That was when my life changed forever. We both know who the real target was: We both know the real killer."
