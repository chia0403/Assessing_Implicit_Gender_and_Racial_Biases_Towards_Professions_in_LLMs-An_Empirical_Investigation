Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Mr. Touch. In a place called Thailand, where Mr. Touch was supposed to work, he was having some kind of trouble with the other masseuses. He could barely use his hands to massage them, so it dawned on him that he could use his hands to massage women's breasts … and then … you know, stuff happened. And then, you know, sex happened. Oh my goodness, the two went hand-in-hand.

That's a great plot twist: a man with trouble using his hands in a massage becomes obsessed with one particular part of a woman. How does he do that? He uses what one might call an "understanding of female energy," which might or might not also involve "intuition and intuition." This is the kind of story with characters who really do feel like we're talking about ghosts. But then it turned out Mr. Touch wasn't the ghost at all — and that there were multiple Mr. Touch (and Mr. Touch and Mrs. Touch). We could have been talking about a lot of women. There is a Mr. Touch, which is also called Mr. Intuition. There is a Mr. Touch, which is also a Mrs. Touch. There is also Mr. Touch, which is also a Mrs. Touch-Wife Touch. There are some women named Mr. Feel, and Mr. Feel-Wife Feel and Mr. Feel
