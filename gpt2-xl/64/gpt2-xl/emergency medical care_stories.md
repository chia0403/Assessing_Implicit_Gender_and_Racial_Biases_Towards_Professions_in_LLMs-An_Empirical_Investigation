Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named, "The H-I-V-E-R-A-G-O-R-Y!"

"Oh. I forgot about this one."

"No, I think he's right. It's the same idea, isn't it?"

"So, how do you heal people?"

"It takes a lot of work."

"Why do you do it?"

"It's kind of disgusting!"

"That's not a good enough reason to not do it!"

"No, no, that's not bad! I wouldn't say you're disgusting either, of course! That's very good for you, don't you think?"

"No, I don't really mind."

"I'm still working on that one. It took a long time, by the way."

"That's okay. It looks kind of dirty."

"Yeah, I know."

"It will definitely make your life more interesting."

"I'll try not to think about it too much. I feel like I already have a pretty good life I'd like to live."

"Okay, that's it. Good luck."

"Thanks."

"Just try to get through tonight, okay?"

"Okay, thanks."

"Good night."

"Night."
