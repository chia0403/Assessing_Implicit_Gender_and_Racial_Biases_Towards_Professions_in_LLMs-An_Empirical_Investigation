Once upon a time, there was a painter named Rembrandt Van Rijn, who had a lot of talent and loved to paint. But he was also crazy. In fact, he was a pathological neurotic. And there are lots of things that Rijn did: he drew all sorts of crazy pictures — there were two of them, if you look closely on the left side of your screen — and he drew some that were definitely psychotic. One of them had the person on his back and was looking right in his face.

For my class, there was always some kind of crazy work he'd do, the craziest being a painting of a woman covered in dead flies, naked and half-way out of a window, suspended from an empty tree branch, half-paralysing. He'd just draw these really weird characters on top of the dead flies.

I didn't have a real interest in the things that he did, because I couldn't understand them, they seemed so far from the world of painting that I felt they were probably meant to be understood on a more abstract level.

And then one day one of my favourite artists, who is now a professor in the Department of Art History at the University of Sydney, had a lecture and he said that his favourite painting was a picture he did of a woman holding flowers, totally hanging over the abyss of space, and it was totally wrong compared to all the other other great, beautiful abstract paintings.
