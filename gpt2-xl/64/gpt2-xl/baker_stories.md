Once upon a time, there was a baker named P. (not his real name, he has since changed his name). Once upon a time, P put a bunch of crumbs of bread in a pan with butter and water. He then left the pan on the stove and the bread, with the lid on, heated up. When the bread was warmed up, he took the pan out of the stove and then took it apart and put it away in a drawer.


After some time, P found this drawer on his walk to and from work and opened the drawer. He pulled out two loaves which were warm and smelling of butter and he ate them with a spoon.


As he was eating the bread, he looked into the oven and saw butter being added on to the bread to help it reach the golden brown that it needs to be.


P finished both loaves, took the lid off of the oven, looked again at the loaf inside and then put the pan back together and put the oven back in place. He then put the lid back on the drawer and put away the pan.


Years later, P, after seeing a TV documentary on food preservation, decided to put a shelf in his oven for storing preserved food (presumably for future use).


As he placed the shelf in the center, a shelf broke off and fell in onto the bread, killing the bread and all the moisture in the butter.
