With the help of a Google historian, we know that 1,000 scientists, engineers and inventors were named John Major in the 1800s and they would have invented a good share of what we take for granted today. A few of them might have invented the internet â€“ we don't know.

The difference is that in the 1800s, only a tiny fraction of the British people even knew who John Major was. That doesn't mean they would have rejected the idea of the internet. In fact, a lot of people would have supported it. But I think there must have been a different reason for so many people to be surprised by it.

This happened because the old telegraph systems were being replaced by new machines. That doesn't mean this was because of the way mobile phones were introduced; rather it was because telegraphy was fading away. The reason for this was that telegraphs kept getting better
