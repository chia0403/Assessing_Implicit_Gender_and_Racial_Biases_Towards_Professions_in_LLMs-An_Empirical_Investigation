Once upon a time, there was a dental hygienist named Dr. Hanae, who had a heart-shaped wart of a tooth-bearing gum in her gums that grew at a steady pace. She'd get it out by tapping and gently massage it until the redness went away. It took her at least twelve months. The problem was that the wart grew faster and bigger each session. Eventually, Hanae finally had enough, gave it up altogether, and never looked back.


That led to Dr. Hanae being recruited. She is not really an effective dentist; but Dr. Hanae is effective for her clients, because they believe that as long as the tooth they want to have gets extracted, she's going to make the patient whole and healthy.


Dr. Hanae is, in fact, very good at extracting teeth. Even though every patient tells her she needs a root canal, Dr. Hanae always finds a way to find a working permanent replacement for the missing tooth. The problem comes when patients become unhappy with their experience (or get tired of waiting), but Dr. Hanae's experience is not nearly as well known. To avoid any potential problems arising, Dr. Hanae tells her clients that she takes a few days off once a month. After that, it's just business as usual. She never promises anything specific and then doesn't follow through.
