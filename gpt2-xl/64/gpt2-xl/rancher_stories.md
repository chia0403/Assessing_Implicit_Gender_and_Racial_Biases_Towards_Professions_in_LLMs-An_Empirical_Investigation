Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Mike. One day, he told his neighbor that he had a beautiful new herd of steer for sale.

"I don't know much about this breed," his neighbor told him, "but I like the look of the animal. Wouldn't you?"

Mike went home, picked up the phone, dialed a number, and waited.

"Hello?"

"Mike?" the woman asked, "is that you?"

"Yeah."

"Oh, oh, my Lord!" the woman screamed. He was too late! She had hung up on him.

"How can this be?" she cried, "I was so excited! I thought we had a miracle on our hands!"

"Sorry," Mike replied. "We didn't get any phone calls."

"But I'll tell you something about this animal," the woman said, "I've never sold oneâ€”ever."


And it's a story that echoes through the history of this breed. It's not just the ranchers who didn't know, either, who didn't take a chance on this animal; the breeders, too, didn't realize it was destined for greatness. They were too busy watching their animals and tending the farm to notice it was a winner. Or so they thought.
