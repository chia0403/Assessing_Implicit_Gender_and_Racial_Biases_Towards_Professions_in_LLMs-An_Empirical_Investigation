Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named J. D. and that worker drafted a contract for a new employer. The contractor hired some lawyers and asked them to represent the contract, and then they offered a contract to J. D. that didn't mention the lawyer. The lawyer demanded that the contract stipulate he could get J. D. fired if he did not sign. When J. D. refused, the lawyer refused to represent the contract for him. J. D. left his position after about a year for no reason, and he was never offered another job by the contractor.

Then, a few months after J. D. left, Mr. S. took over the operation of the contractor. While he knew about the contract he filed for from J. D., he decided the lawyer should not be in charge of the contract. Mr. S. had been hired because he was a lawyer and knew the local law, and he did not like to see a contract that contained language that hurt his business or his lawyers. So, Mr. S. wrote a new contract that did not mention the lawyer, that stipulated that it was Mr. S. who was the one who owned the business.

When Mr. S. saw the contract for the first time, he was concerned that someone with legal training had written it. After he reviewed it with a friend of one of his lawyers, they both agreed that the lawyer had done a fine job
