Once upon a time, there was a guard named Bob Dorough. Bob Dorough didn't like guns and had been asked by his employer to look through their stock with an eye to cutting costs. If you are a regular reader, you know that I've been trying to get to the bottom of that (and to no avail) — or perhaps there is some story to the tale; I don't know. But the point is that when you hire your first employee, your biggest fear should always be, "How do I get him or her to stay?" And here was Bob, fresh off the boat, in his first training center (the YMCA, of course) and he wanted to know how — what — he was supposed to do. The answer was, "Just be nice."

"Nice" sounds a bit odd coming from someone who's been a guard for a long time, which is what Bob was. There'd been years in there, where every day was a struggle. Not the fighting sort of challenge, but the challenge to get through the day with an average of only two weeks leave (from 40 hours a week on, of course).

Anyway, Bob's next challenge was to get people to work together for the common good. And for some reason, some people don't like to work together for the common good. And, yes, it's a bit like being a pastor. He didn't want to have to be the one standing over
