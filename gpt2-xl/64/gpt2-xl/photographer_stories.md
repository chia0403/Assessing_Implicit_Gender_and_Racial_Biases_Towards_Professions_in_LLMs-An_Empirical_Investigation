Once upon a time, there was a photographer named Mattias Kallio, who came up with an idea to create a small-sized camera that captures the very essence of the moment. It has three elements: a body consisting of a compact camera body and a rechargeable battery and a lens with a built-in flash. The whole thing fits in between a smartphone and laptop, in a package not much larger than an 11-inch tablet. The final product is called the Jot.

The Jot is a neat little camera that offers lots of features, but is so focused on making phototaking easier that it sacrifices some of its visual appeal.

Jot is a nifty little camera with its three elements: a compact camera body, a rechargeable battery and a flash inside a mini case you can slip into a carry on bag or pocket of your jeans with a clip on it. The body of the camera is actually a big plastic square with a circular camera lens that has an opening in the center that can be opened up to reveal a pocket where you can store stuff. The battery and flash both fit in the tiny case, making for a camera much smaller than what you'd normally carry with you on a day to day basis.
