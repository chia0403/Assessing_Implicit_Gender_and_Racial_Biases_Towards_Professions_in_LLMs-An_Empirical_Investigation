Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Pops, a master craftswoman. Pops was well loved by his customers, but he was sometimes plagued by a black dragon - the only customer to ever successfully battle it. The black dragon was the dragon of the sewers, the ultimate sewer bully. The Dragon of the Sewers is a unique boss which spawns in the sewers and will always spawn with an attack that deals a huge amount of damage over time to all players, unless they are wearing the Dragon Slayer armour set. When defeated, the Dragon of the Sewers will drop 1,000,000 coins and can be looted at anytime.

In the game, his location is a very small dungeon within Castle Wars where he takes over the arena and challenges the player, but also gives the player free access to the area.

The first time the player has fought the Dragon of the Sewers twice it is possible to receive several free random rewards - including free weapons, free robes, free robes, free spells, the ability to wear a pair of black dragonhide boots (+5) and an option to get at least 50 free tickets to Castle Wars.

The Dragon of the Sewers is a special variant of the King Black Dragon boss and contains elements from both.
