Once upon a time, there was a chef named Matt Taylor, a high-flying chef and owner of several restaurants. One of his favorite dishes was this sweet and spicy chili paste which made him look like he was giving away free doughnuts to homeless people.

Then, something funny happened, and he thought to himself, "I'll never make these again." While working as a chef in New York, he realized that making chili sauce at home was one of the simplest things he could ever try. He started with dried chilis, sugar, and baking soda.

What he noticed while working was that making a homemade chili would produce a stronger spicy taste and better texture than using store-bought items. After several taste tests, he found that simply cooking dried dried chili peppers with sugar gives them a sweet and spicy flavor, without a hot or hot taste or harsh aftertaste.

Now, almost a decade later, Matt has mastered making a thick and flavorful chili sauce, which can be used in sauces and even dips. His version of chili is extremely low in calories and contains absolutely no fat. The product is very easy to make, and can be used in many recipes, including those with meat and poultry.
