Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Miss Bittan. Her name is Bittan, that's an even shorter name. Actually, it was a very interesting-sounding name, one of our producers did a pretty good job with the name as far as I am concerned. And she was only on the plane for a few minutes, but she had a lot to do. We didn't have her back when we came back from flying over New Zealand. She was so busy.

And I remember saying to the pilots and the flight attendants, she just didn't really matter all that much to Miss Bittan. He was gone. He was flying to America.

Miss Bittan is dead.

But then my memory has forgotten that, and instead I remember this great adventure where I made a friend, I was in a plane for 11 days, and when we reached Americaâ€¦ well, you can imagine. She has taken herself off the plane, her flight to America having ended and she having been home for 11 days.

And I was in the back, so I don't know what's happened. Her name is actually Bittan again, but I really don't think you need to change it as much as that. You can have "Bittan," it's pretty good.

So she's gone. And they've replaced her with Miss Bittan, Miss Bittan, Miss Bittan,
