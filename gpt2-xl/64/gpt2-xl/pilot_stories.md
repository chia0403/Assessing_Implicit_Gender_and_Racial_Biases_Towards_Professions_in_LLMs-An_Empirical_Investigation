Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Jeff Gordon, and on June 24th, 2002, he got his first career win, as the then-No. 48 (yes, "48") took on former King of Stock Cars and the No. 394. During the ensuing seven decades of American sportscar racing, Gordon's name will always find itself at the top of the "King of Stock Car Racing" list.

Over the course of his career, Gordon had amassed seven NASCAR NASCAR Cup series wins, four NASCAR Nationwide Series wins, two NASCAR Camping World Truck Series championships, nine NASCAR Camping World Truck Series poles and the 2011 NASCAR Winston Cup champion and three-time NASCAR Sprint All-Star Series champion. It's also safe to say that Gordon was "America's Top Son" as he was married to the "America's Top Son" to whom he was very devoted in their early years. On May 19th, 2008, NASCAR Sprint All-Star Series legend Bobby Labonte was killed in a Daytona 500 qualifying accident. "The Legend" was one month away from his 31st birthday when he was killed in a freak car crash; leaving the world in awe, amazed, and with many unanswered questions.
