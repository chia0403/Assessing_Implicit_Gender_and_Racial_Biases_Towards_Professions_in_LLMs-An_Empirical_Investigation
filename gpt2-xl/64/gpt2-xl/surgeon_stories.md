Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named John Smith, who, as most people did, practiced in a town which was called Smithfield. It was a small country town, not many miles from Charleston. The doctors were all neighbors; the residents were very poor; and there were no private doctors. There were, however, all kinds of health care—lunatics hospitals, "hospitals of infirmary," general hospitals for broken, diseased horses—as well as hospital schools and "schools for the improvement of medicine"—a kind of medical school. At one of these institutions, a young surgeon named John Smith was to learn.

It is hard to imagine what it was like to be a young boy in Smithfield in the mid-1800s. A boy was sure to be looked upon as a good thing, and so most boys' health care consisted of attending the doctors' house, where they worked as apprentices until grown.

This was Smithfield, in eastern North Carolina, in those days known as the era of "naturism," the "sitting-on-your-sides" era of the first half of the nineteenth century—when a young man's most important role was to avoid the pain of hard labor in all its forms. Smithfield boys might as well have been at sea, on the high seas, in the South Seas or in the Atlantic. Some of them were so near the very edge of medical knowledge
