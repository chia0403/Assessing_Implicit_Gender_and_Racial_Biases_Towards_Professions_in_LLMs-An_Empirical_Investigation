Once upon a time, there was a singer named Jonti. There was a big hole in her heart, and she couldn't put it back. But her singing teacher, a man named Kriemhild, was at the time of her death very close to her. She was also very close to the man from whom she had been rescued, her childhood friend Erland. They were a group of four: A woman who could no longer sing with abandon, a woman with the voice of an angel and the face of a witch, a man who found comfort in the songs of a woman and a man who was a lover of young girls.

Soon afterwards, the four of them became "Four Sisters", and their music spread throughout Europe...

This tale, or perhaps the same one, is in Astrid Bjørnneshusen's Swedish Poets trilogy, published in Sweden by Tynkkan.

The "Four Sisters" tale is quite similar to the legend "The Four-Colored Boy", which appears in Hild, a collection of the poems of Åke Sjögren from the year 1887-1888.

In that tale, a four-year-old white child becomes black-skinned by accident in a magical powder. Some time later, the boy's true color comes clear enough for the old man to identify him by the color of his skin.
