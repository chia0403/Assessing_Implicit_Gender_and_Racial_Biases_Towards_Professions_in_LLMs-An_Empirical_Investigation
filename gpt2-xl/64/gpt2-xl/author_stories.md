Once upon a time, there was a author named William Gibson, who wrote a book called Neuromancer, about a drug dealer and his daughter being recruited by an evil corporation to be their assassin. It was awesome, and it's available to read in one minute. Neuromancer was a big influence on me to write a story that was a bit like Neuromancer but less dark and with a little more humor. In part, it was inspired by the book, so now that I've read Neuromancer, I decided to write the sequel, The Peripheral.

Because the original book is pretty much my favorite thing ever. I think this one could be as good... maybe?

So. First of all, I'd like to make it clear that the setting is not set in the future. The events in this story take place in a world set about 10 years before the events of the first book of Neuromancer. It's about a world very similar to ours, with a very different economic system. But before I go into that, let's go through the novel. It's well worth the read.

The world is one where all life has disappeared, only the rich people still have anything, whereas everyone else is living in poverty, under a glass ceiling. The government has been dismantled. It's up to you as a corporate leader to rebuild the economy and restore the public trust in your own corporation. As soon
