Once upon a time, there was a butcher named Peter Petley. He was from the poor, working class area of New Glasgow and owned a large meat shop. Some of his meat, when tested, proved to be extremely unfit for human consumption. The problem was, he was quite a famous person at the time, so his shop was frequented by the press, and his family was well-known to many people. As a result, Peter was not always well-disposed to his meat being found by the press, and he was rather unsympathetic to the plight of the poor slavers of his community.

When another butcher was appointed to the job, Peter approached him for an inspection of his shop, promising that if his concerns were fully addressed in ten days, he would allow him to become a permanent employee. The man was more than happy with this opportunity and assured Peter he could make the shop a success if he would let him carry out his instructions. And so Peter had Peter Petley take over the shop as an employee. When five days had passed, Peter came to see him with his new meat, and informed the butcher that while his previous meat wasn't very unsuitable for human consumption, this one was far from it, and he would let him see how he was able to use a butcher shop to better his own life.

Peter Petley took his new position with great enthusiasm and soon became known throughout the town and the slavers' area
