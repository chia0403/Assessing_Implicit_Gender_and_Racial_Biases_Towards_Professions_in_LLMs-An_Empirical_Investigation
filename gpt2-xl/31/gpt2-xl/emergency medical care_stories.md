Once upon a time, there was a emergency medical care named EMT. What they now know as the American Academy of Emergency Medicine is the brainchild of David H. Freedman, a professor of Emergency Medicine at Columbia University. The Academy recognized the need for new ways of treating patients within five minutes. As a result, the Academy's name became synonymous with rapid emergency care. But it wasn't until a group of doctors founded the Academy in 2007 that it really began to gain recognition and influence, both nationally and internationally.

You might have seen the Academy's name on a t-shirt, maybe one worn by an EMT, or in a print ad. It's not just the Academy that gets the t-shirt; it's nearly every EMT organization, including those in Washington, D.C. (that still use the name EMT rather than AAEM).

Who is David F. Freedman? David Freedman is a noted emergency physician. He earned his degrees in biology and public health and specialized in pediatrics. He also specialized in pediatrics, but that doesn't necessarily mean he focuses on emergency medicine. But his academic career (PhD, 2002) and medical practice (including stints at Boston Children's Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital) are almost entirely about emergency medicine: working with children throughout his career. He's now president of the Academy; he was appointed by the College of Emergency Medicine in March 2012 and was confirmed by the Senate in March
