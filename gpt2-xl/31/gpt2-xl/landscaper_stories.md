Once upon a time, there was a landscaper named Frank who was called upon to take care of some trees. But whenever he saw some children go by, he was very busy.

One day while he was out of his shop, a little boy named Barney made a discovery in his heart.

He discovered that there was something called good grief.

He found it in the fact that Barney was the best gardener.

So he thought he would try a little bit of gardening himself one day.

Every couple of days, after school, he would get up late, eat his sandwich, and sneak a look at his garden.

He spent hours in that dirt, planting trees and putting flowerpots in the beds.

Even when no one was about, he would watch the rain come down and say a silent prayer that every flower would stay in its place.

He had been given a little bit of good grief for something he had done.

But if you take down the tree and plant a new one, the old one will remain there and grow to its full height.

You need another little bit of good grief when you want to take some tree down.

You are able to take down what you want to take down only temporarily.

But when you have done that, it will come right back.

It will grow and become bigger and stronger this time. It is called growth.
