Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Dr. John Weinstock. He was the star of several popular health movies - most notably, "The New Diet Revolution" where he and some other scientists tried to explain the rise and fall of American obesity by comparing diet to the weather.

Weinstock told his audiences that if you wanted to lose weight, you had to eat less of whatever it was that was making you fat. That meant less vegetables, less meat, less grain products, less sugar, less oils and more fruits and vegetables. All of the food groups - whole grains, meats, vegetables and fruits - should be reduced to the bare minimum.

It was a very interesting and compelling message, and I took it upon myself to implement it. I eliminated wheat, dairy and legumes and increased the protein, fat, and fiber I ate. I also removed one food group -- pasta -- that I now feel absolutely no pleasure or cravings for. All food groups disappeared, and in their place I began to eat the best food I could find on a vegan diet.

And lo and behold â€¦ the weight came off. I could hardly believe it. I can't remember the last time I ate anything that was more filling, tastier, more nutritious, or better for me than I'm eating today.

This experiment is almost a miracle. It demonstrates that it all works - it's no coincidence that people lost weight who ate like this
