Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Dr. Jennifer Paski who had the unfortunate reputation of working with wealthy businessmen on a regular basis and also treating women with sexual abuse issues that had not already been addressed by police. If you've been victimized by Paski, it's time you knew. Now there are a number of websites where you can learn these terrible things about her and others of her ilk. You'll read about the horrors of her business practices that have left clients in the lurch. You'll read about her sadistic tendencies that have driven some clients to suicide and one man to commit suicide on her premises, as well as her involvement in child exploitation and her treatment of teenage minors as her clients. You'll learn about the other victims and people who have been injured and injured others during her business deals and her unprofessional treatment of her clients. It's time to end this evil. This is a story about one woman's life and work. It's also a story about how she was able to take advantage of everyone. It's about how she could use her money and her position to sexually blackmail and abuse those in her employ. It's about the number of people who suffered terribly at her hands and how little justice was done to her. It's about how those of us who have been abused and harmed by other women's companies still think victims should be treated with deference and consideration. This is also about the victims who were involved in her abuse
