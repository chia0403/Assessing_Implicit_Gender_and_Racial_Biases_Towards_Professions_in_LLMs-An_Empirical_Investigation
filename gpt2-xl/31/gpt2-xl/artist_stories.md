Once upon a time, there was a artist named Bob Dylan.

Dylan, born in 1942, was a huge success early on. Born with the name Allen Toussaint, Dylan moved around while growing up in Oklahoma. His family moved to Oregon in 1955. When Dylan was 14, the family moved to Los Angeles. Dylan began his acting career at 14, but eventually went on to attend high school in New York. At 23, he received his GED and became a professional musician. During the 1970s, Dylan toured and made music videos. He later married Rosemary Clooney and had a son named Henry.

Dylan released his first set of full-length professional recordings at the age of 26. They came to be known as The Basement Tapes. It's estimated there may have been 100,000 copies issued, and they were the first popular recording by a rock and roll band to use a 12-inch LP. The tapes began being sold by the hundreds.

The recordings were eventually released on a double-side CD, and these were the ones that made Dylan and his then six-month old new band The Band a success during the 1972 recording session.

What were the main influences you had on Dylan after moving from Oklahoma to Los Angeles?

My parents were both small town people and the country. Both of them were Southern. My parents' backgrounds were rural and small towns and they'd moved west on Long Island.
