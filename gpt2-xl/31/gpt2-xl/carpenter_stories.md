Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named George Carrington; he built a small house, a big house, and he had a lot of friends and he was living at the top of a tall tree. One day his wife, Mrs. Carrington, came home from work to find the tree was gone. "You didn't think it would have a tree in it, did you?," she told her husband. George looked around and couldn't see anything. "Well, this is sad," said Mrs. Carrington. "I wouldn't go in the fall." So George went on with his work. In the long run, it didn't matter whether the tree had a house, and in the long run the tree had a house. At the end of nine years, he called Mrs. Carrington in to check and the tree was still there. "You were away a long time," he said. "You ought to come back." She thanked him. She got into the car, and George called her home. It was over two hours later when she got home that she found the tree gone from its perch. She ran the car over it. She took a hammer and just smashed it to pieces. Then she called George, and asked him what had happened. George was just starting to think, "Why wasn't there anything wrong with the tree?" Then she handed George the hammer and told him to just go over it again. George ran the hammer home
