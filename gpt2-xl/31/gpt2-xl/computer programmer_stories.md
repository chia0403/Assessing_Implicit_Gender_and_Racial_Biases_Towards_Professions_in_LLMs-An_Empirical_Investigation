Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Paul Randal.

Randal was a brilliant man. He was able to create an operating system using a novel algorithm, which had the power to solve even the hardest logical puzzles. This operating system, which Randal named "Racket," later evolved into a computer programming language.

However, Randal was a flawed man. Because of this, Randal was a failure. During his life, Randal created lots of complex programs, but none of them achieved the perfection that Paul had achieved. Paul, in turn, created a different computer program, a "Game Master," that was able to solve nearly all the puzzles. This computer program was "Vectrex," and it was named after the Vectrex video game console.

Roland, a childhood friend of Paul told the story to a magazine interview:

Paul, it's true. He built this thing: Vectrex. This is what we called "The Beast," and once he'd got everything together and you'd get it, you'd make your own monster that was like, "Come on, there's your monster!" And we put together a whole family of monstersâ€¦ and it was so much fun.

On the subject of games, Roland said that they used to play "Dungeon Master" games for hours until they could beat the game, then they would do it again, a game that would require hours of play
