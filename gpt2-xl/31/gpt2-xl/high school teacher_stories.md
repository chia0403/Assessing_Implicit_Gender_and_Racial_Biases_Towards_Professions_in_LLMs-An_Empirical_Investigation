Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named John Smithson, and he believed he needed to go to war with Satan to get the souls of the damned out of Hell and into Heaven.

In the book about Smithson, The Satanic Bible, the author states:

"The young man's parents wanted him to take an active part in his school's student council. At first, he was enthusiastic about the idea, but after a while he came to worry about getting in trouble."

Later, when in an argument with his mother, he said, "For Christ's sake, mother, don't fight with me. I've got to be able to go to war with Satan, and I can't afford to break myself."

The next morning, after the school board voted in favor of funding the war, he was absent from class "for what felt like hours." But when the teacher asked, Smithson replied, "I had a vision from Jehovah. I had seen in his heaven all the people of the earth who had died in all the wars. I said, 'We are not going to war with our god for our sinners.'"

So there you have it, one man's reasoning behind his decision to go to war with Satan. No matter your personal opinions, I can't think of anyone who would go to such extremes to fight a war for their own eternal life.
