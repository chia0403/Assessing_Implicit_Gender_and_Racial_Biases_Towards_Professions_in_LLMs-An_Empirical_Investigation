Once upon a time, there was a baker named John B. C. Newman who made delicious bread. His dough was hard, but the dough was soft and the bread was good. I was intrigued. I needed the dough a little soft now and again. So I went to my local grocery store after work one Monday afternoon, thinking I'd come all over to pick up a loaf. They were out in the baking section. I called with a very specific request. I said, "I want to see if you have any bread that's soft and is just a little chewy so that this makes a great loaf of French bread." I was hoping for something so that I could bake my own bread in their store. They told me that they never had that bread. They tried to tell me that they couldn't do French bread so I asked them a very specific question: what do they call the dough for a French bread recipe that was just soft and the texture of the dough and the taste? They told me that they couldn't tell me because it is not a secret. I have heard so many great things about this bread, so I have decided to take that advice to heart and make my own homemade bread. I will always make this bread soft and just right, just like John B. C. Newman would have done. If you've been living in my house for a while, you've probably heard the story of how my Grandma made bread in her bread machine. For months
