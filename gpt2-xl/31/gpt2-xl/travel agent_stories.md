Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Jack, who would help people find the most amazing adventures in the world. One night he made the mistake of asking the most extraordinary question: "Which country would you like to visit the most?" The most extraordinary answer was England. It was an unexpected reply. But no sooner was he in England that Jack saw that the whole country was beautiful. But then he noticed that the countryside was full of signs that read "No Smoking." So he asked again, "Which country would you like to see the most?" The answer has been repeated a thousand times. "England," replied Jack, with the right answer. "You have gone to England!" "Oh!" replied the tourist, "I thought you meant England." And Jack, surprised at his foolishness, simply replied, "Yes."

The "No Smoking" sign at New Hampshire: "Smoking is discouraged in all areas except in designated places."

The real story is somewhat more interesting. When Jack went to England, he did not visit it strictly in his capacity as travel agent. The real Jack, the man who lived in the country his whole life, visited England again on footâ€”not by plane. He was walking home from a trip in which he and his fellow travelers walked and hitchhiked from place to place by day and slept under blankets at night. And as if his strange question were not enough, Jack saw some signs that read "No Smoking"
