Once upon a time, there was a tour guide named Charlie. A bit arrogant, a bit too ambitious, but with a sharp wit and an encyclopedic knowledge of the city that made him one of the more popular locals. Charlie wasn't exactly a very nice guy, but he was also not a complete jerk. He'd make his share of mistakes, but as long as he tried – and he always tried – he was always very polite and professional when they weren't at the Tour de France, or on live television.

Today that guide is none other than the legendary, one and only Bernard Hinault and the truth is, most of the things he said were perfectly professional. Most.

From Bernard's Twitter account:

I'm not an expert on history. It's simply my job as a bike rider and coach. I'm a cycling fan in general, but the Tour is unique in that it has been the most important race for many years already. For most of the 20th century, you had to be a champion to get any recognition. Not any more, I think. With the French team management becoming more and more professional, and the race being bigger, there are a lot more opportunities for riders of good talents.

We could now say there is no difference between the stars, it's all the same for them all. You have to have good talent and it doesn't matter if you're a local or a Parisian.
