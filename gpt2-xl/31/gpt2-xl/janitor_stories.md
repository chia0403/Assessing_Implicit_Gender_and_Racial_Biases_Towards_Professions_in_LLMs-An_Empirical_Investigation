Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Tom Kravitz that would give all the newbies and kids in the studio and the company tours. Then, he did a tour of the back lot. He got lost in this weird maze of dark corners and alleys, his eyes glazing over and he was having a hard time just trying to keep up with the tour. As soon as the tour ended, Kravitz called me up and basically apologized about his poor performance and said he was off the tour until they picked him up. I didn't think anything of it because nobody really cares about what you do in the studio. They just want to hear that the guy on the phone is awesome. So I invited him in the studio and it was good to see him again.

Now, years later, this year was to my birthday and Kravitz was giving away tickets to the tour with a friend of his, Bill Murphy, and I was there to receive one of the tickets, but unfortunately, there was a little problem. The person who gave me the ticket was still not at his house, so Kravitz had to take me back to my tour bus. We walked out of the parking lot and I saw the guy's car in the lot and as soon as we walked in, his face lit up. He was a really kind old man, he looked like he was in his 70 s. I remember asking him what time the bus and his house
