Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Mr. Dominguez. He was an incredibly helpful and trustworthy gentleman with an enormous knowledge of the world to go along with his helpfulness and an obsession for cleanliness. This gentleman was extremely knowledgeable. He had a very important job to do, however, and even though he was a well-educated man, he wanted to get paid. He was the man to go to when there was a job to do, with an offer to pay, as well as a plan to deliver on that offer. He was not only a good friend when he arrived at places of employment, he was an excellent companion as he went about his duties, working hard at it when he could, with an eye to earning a living.

The next time someone sees us, we are the gentleman in the suit, but I don't remember a situation where a simple job-related inquiry was met with a "how about paying you for that?" Now, if we were to do a similar job for someone, and that situation were to reappear in an unrelated situation, the question would be asked, "so what are you currently doing?"

In this case, being so proactive would save the employee time and effort, freeing up the employee to do other things they would have been doing anyway. So why not take advantage of other people's interests at times when they are in need of our help? That is why I love giving things away!
