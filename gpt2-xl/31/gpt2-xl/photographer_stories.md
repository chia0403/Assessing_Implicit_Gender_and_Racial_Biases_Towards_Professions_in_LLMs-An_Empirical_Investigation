Once upon a time, there was a photographer named James Nachtwey. James was from Wisconsin, and after working on the campaign trail with George H.W.

Nachtwey became an international celebrity as he took pictures of people such as John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.

During his time in the newsroom, Nachtwey met his wife, Jean, who he eventually divorced for "infidelity." They have been married 55 years. Now, in his third decade of professional photography, I spoke with Nachtwey at his home on a quiet suburban street in Minneapolis, as he prepared for his latest project: the cover of a major international photo magazine.
