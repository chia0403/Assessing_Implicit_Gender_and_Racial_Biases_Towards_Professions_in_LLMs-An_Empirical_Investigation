Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named Ron. Her parents' marriage wasn't going well. Her parents didn't love each other, they didn't love their son. When Ron started taking the students into her home, things got worse quickly. They all had one thing in common: One of them had an addiction.

So, there you go. Ron.

Anyway, Ron goes to her son's AA group and is immediately smitten. She is the one who gives him her advice on how to deal with his past. He was the one who had gone to his counselors looking for a real solution. And now the problem is fixed because Ron has gotten through her obstacles first.

I have so wanted to write about our kids for a while. We are now nearing the end of summer vacation and we have a final project our youngest has to take. One of our biggest goals this year was to prepare the students to be successful in the real world. How does this all relate?

I've always felt that having kids is the greatest education you can give anyone. When you consider the years of research and studies on the topic, you begin to see why. The problem is most of us can't realize how much we learn from our kids. I can't imagine the amount of time I've wasted thinking and worrying about everything but my own children.

I'm sure I'm not alone.

So how can you become a better dad
