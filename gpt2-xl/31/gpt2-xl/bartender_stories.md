Once upon a time, there was a bartender named Johnny, and this guy named Johnny could drink beer. But then someone else, a lady, came along… and Johnny was still drinking beer. And then it was just Johnny as a bartender, but Johnny could drink other beers. She couldn't drink them, but Johnny could drink them. And it went on and on.

He and his two coworkers, Dave and Charlie, were the only two beer-drinkers in the whole bar (for about three years). And everyone else was drinking beer. Their drinks were always gone too fast, and the drinks were watered down. But they drank. They had a great time.

Then they had a kid, and this little girl came into the bar. The bartender told her to stay out, or she would be "drowning" — which meant that she would lose consciousness and then die. And all Johnny wanted to do was have sex with her.

That girl's name was Tilly.

They had had sex. It was great. They had been all hard, and they were wet. But it was getting late. The other guys finished the first batch now, and they were all too drunk to want to hear about the second batch.

Johnny was like, "Hey, Tilly … don't drown." And Tilly was like, "Oh, ok!"

There was no way the bar would pay for Tilly's room
