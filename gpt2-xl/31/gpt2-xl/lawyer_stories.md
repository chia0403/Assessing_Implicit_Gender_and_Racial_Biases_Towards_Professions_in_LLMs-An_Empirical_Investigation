Once upon a time, there was a lawyer named Steven Pardo who got drunk and tried to kill a woman. (Pardo's lawyer says that wasn't true.) When the police questioned him, Pardo had an almost inexplicable knack for recalling his crimes as he was happening. So they asked him a series of questions. The first one was: "Did you have any reason or desire to injure the victim?"

"No, I never had any reason or desire to hit her. I never intended to hurt anybody because I never intended to kill anybody," Pardo recalled in a TV interview, under condition that we print his actual words. "I knew if I hit her, they were going to come to get me." (They did.)

Pardo's criminal lawyer, James LeCarr√©, was on the stand last week. The question was, Did you ever think about hurting the victim in the first place?

Pardo said, "The answer is no. No, I really don't think it crosses my mind to hurt anyone, and I don't know why I can't or wouldn't do it."

I think I'd have to agree with that, to some extent. But it's important to underscore Pardo's statement at the very beginning of the program. "My goal has always been not to kill. My goal has always been to not kill."

Pardo has never killed anyone; he has repeatedly stopped his criminal career
