Once upon a time, there was a highway worker named Frank McCourt, who was killed in an off-duty car crash."

It's not unusual for the NFL to include "off-duty incident" alongside off-duty deaths, something the league can now call a "non-playing player incident". McCourt was still a safety in the league, though.

"What it gets back to as an example here is, again, this is an off-duty incident," Priefer said. "He was still an employee of the NFL."

The league is hoping this is a non-issue, as the NFL Players Association is already trying to have off-duty incidents ruled as non-retaliation.

"We think that people have the flexibility to call it whatever they want," said Mara, "whether it's a non-playing incidents or a family incident or something like that. Our perspective is that that should be determined within a workplace setting... but certainly the player has to feel secure that it's okay to call that."

In the meantime, fans may soon be calling for a change to the current wording: "unintentional on-field death."
