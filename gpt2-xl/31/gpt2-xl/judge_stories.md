Once upon a time, there was a judge named Mike Jacobs... A person who had no problem with someone giving away free money without asking the buyer to wait five minutes or something like that. A judge who was an expert lawyer and had a huge legal staff. That man was a jerk, alright, but he was in an office with many other jerkish people, so he must have been reasonable. The judge on your trial for not paying $2.25 doesn't have so much credibility because there are almost NO reasonable people on the jury.If any other kind of trial happened, the judge would be called a jerk. But "the good judge" has nothing to do with the situation, in fact the two of you are probably the only reasonable people in the entire universe.But Mike Jacobs, an esteemed judge... He's just the jerk in a place of total insanity. Now that he's lost his job, he has more "freedom" to be an asshole than a normal person would be trusted with. It's bad enough being at a crappy job but he doesn't even get to take good vacations.I know that you are going to be very angry when I give you the money right now, because I was VERY angry when I was robbed years ago, but if that is the least you can do right now, THANK YOU.
