Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Alice. One day, when she got a note telling her she could take a new class with a small group of the teachers, Alice asked the question on the tip of everybody's tongue:

"So... what does that class do?"

Not one of the teachers had a clue.

"So, what do all of the kids learn?"

After a moment's thought, Alice answered, with the same enthusiasm and confidence to which she had taken so long to answer her own question: "We work together in a school."

Alice then proceeded to share with the other teachers exactly what that class does. With smiles on their faces, they were just as eager to learn as Alice had been.

"We help each other, be open to each other and trust each other". Her vision had not changed one iota, but her words had.

"We all help one another and we all trust one another."

"All of us have to make sacrifices to make sure we can be here working together to be the best we can be, learning, helping others".

"We all have to sacrifice to make sure we will be here in retirement, not being a burden". "All, of us, with the love, support and encouragement from many of you around the world."

"Thank you!" - Alice

The world got it - we're a community
