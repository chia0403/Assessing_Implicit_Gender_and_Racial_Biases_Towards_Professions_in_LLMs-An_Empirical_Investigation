Once upon a time, there was a school psychologist named John Kelsall who was one of the first people in Canada to study the effects of prolonged restraint [in the US]. He was very interested in how people reacted to being forcibly restrained. And what he found was that most people behaved a little bit better when they were restrained, in terms of coping with the discomfort that was going on. But when the restraints were removed, and the person was free, there was a huge difference. A big difference.
