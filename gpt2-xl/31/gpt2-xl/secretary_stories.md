Once upon a time, there was a secretary named Jane O'Leary who was the wife of a successful Wall Street banker. Her husband wanted to get her out of the house and she just did not want to leave, and she had a real problem. She didn't want to give up the way in which she felt comfortable in her marriage, but she really had to. And she went in and she decided that the best thing she could do was to get rid of her wife, because Jane was really unpleasant to be around. Jane was this very competent woman who wasn't making her husband happy, and it made no difference to her. She took away her wife and then went about her own life. One of the things that attracted me to the novel was the fact that the husband had decided he was going to get a divorce because, having gotten rid of the wife, he still had to make sure that, if the wife got better or worse, he put in more effort into her. He got used to working with someone who is just a different kind of human being, and when he found that they were even happier and more accomplished, he would have to make changes elsewhere.
