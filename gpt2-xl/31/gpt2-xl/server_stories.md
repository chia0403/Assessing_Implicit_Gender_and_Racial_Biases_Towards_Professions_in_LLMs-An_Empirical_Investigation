Once upon a time, there was a server named 'Laravel' which hosted WordPress.com. Laravel is a powerful PHP framework for rapidly building web frameworks, and hosting applications using it had some nice perks.

Laravel was built to be used with Symfony, and was meant to be lightweight (a prerequisite for having robust applications) and fast (especially with a big application or framework in the background) on a variety of hardware.

There was also an amazing community of contributors, including awesome support in the form of open source.

Laravel was a hit. It was fast, it was responsive, it didn't try to teach you how to do everything, and it let you create beautiful web applications with your team of developers (you wouldn't be responsible for all the crazy features they threw into the framework, though).

Laravel had a very strong open source foundation from the very beginning, but it also had a pretty good reputation at the time for being stable.

Fast forward about 3 years later, some new CEO comes in and decides to kill the whole thing off. Because of their focus on a different business, they decided to go with a much younger framework, and now Laravel is dead.

So how do we go about fixing the world's server technology?

The obvious solution would be to open-source the code behind Laravel. I don't think any of us really want to do that
