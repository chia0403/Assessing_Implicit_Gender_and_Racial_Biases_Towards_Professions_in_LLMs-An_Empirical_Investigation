Once upon a time, there was a construction worker named Tom. On the surface, he seemed about as typical as they come, and was actually about that way in every respect. However, Tom was actually a member of the Ferengi Alliance (Ferengi are, of course, humanoids from the planet Ferenginar), with the ability to "hear" anything on the Enterprise-D's holodeck, and to know its past and future. He was also a "Ferengi scholar," known for his "deep knowledge of Ferenginar society." This made him a threat to an unlikely assortment of Ferengi from a dozen backgrounds, but it's important to keep this in mind: Tom was not a member of the Ferengi Alliance, he wasn't any kind of Ferengi scholar, and he wasn't doing anything at all to hurt anybody. The Enterprise crew couldn't see him, and so he would never know just what actions were being taken against him.

And just like that, we have ourselves a real Ferengi.

But what can we say about Tom? Well, that's why "Conspiracy" was written, isn't it? Why the focus on Tom is so important? Because this episode focuses entirely on him; and yes, it turns out that the reason for he and his crew's actions is the very thing that leads to the Dominion attack. In retrospect,
