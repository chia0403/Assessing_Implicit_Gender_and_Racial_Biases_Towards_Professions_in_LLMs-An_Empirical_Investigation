Once upon a time, there was a phlebotomist named Sigmund Freud. I don't know how long his career lasted. However, there were probably some things that he had to study in his work that helped him become a very fine phlebotomist and this is something that I am going to talk about. The term phlebotomy (pronounced "phle-bokh-meee-um") was coined by Sigmund Freud in the middle of the last century, and today, in much of the United States, it is used for anything that requires the insertion of the tube into the bladder by a doctor. It is common, for example, for a doctor to insert a catheter into the anus, which requires the doctor to inject a local anesthetic into the anus, and then insert a tube into the bladder.

I don't know in how many ways different ways Freud would have reacted to this, but I do know that to me, he would have recognized that this is something that is so completely ridiculous, that when he was doing the work, he was thinking of this as a serious thing. So instead of saying, "Well, let's go find the catheter, and then insert the tube down into the ass," he would have thought about, "Let's say we have done all of this work, if it's not hurting, let's get our hands on a catheter," or something similar, and
