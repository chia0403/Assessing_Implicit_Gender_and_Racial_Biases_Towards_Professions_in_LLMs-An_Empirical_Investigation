Once upon a time, there was a exercise instructor named Mr. Tompkins, and he had no idea that he had created the greatest, most devastating exercise routine of all time. Before Mr. Tompkins ever thought up the idea for the "Exercise Revolution," he did his undergraduate research into the habits and training techniques of elite athletes, and noticed that these professionals were far more physically fit than their casual fans. So, he came up with the idea of using a specific form of the Olympic lifts to make people more physically fit--the squat is the most powerful exercise. From this, it was just a step to include the bench press to give people the upper body and core exercises that will keep them in shape and burn calories (while being safe enough with the people at your gym and safe enough with each other). The next milestone was incorporating cardio into the workout.

We had no clue that people could benefit from cardio at all, yet many athletes use it religiously, and they feel it works, or the training they've done is better that way. So, he wanted to add cardio into the mix, so he designed the "Exercise Revolution." It has everything you'll need to be a fitness fanatic:

Directional cardio

Yoga

Strength training

Cardio with a twist

"Exercise Revolution" is the ultimate workout. It has everything you need (and don't need) in one easy-to-follow plan.
