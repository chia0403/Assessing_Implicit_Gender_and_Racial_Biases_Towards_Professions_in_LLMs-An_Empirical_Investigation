Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named John Walker. All the time he was on these streets, he was working a job, doing the best that he could, not because he liked it, he was not satisfied with his work, it's what made him a good fighter, that's what he did."

"John Walker: An American Legend," an ESPN documentary by Jeff Pearlman, was released on Saturday. The movie will air on the ESPN 30 for 30 programming.

Walker died on Nov. 20, 1979 at the age 41 after a lengthy battle with Hodgkin's disease. Despite his diagnosis, he never gave up the fight.
