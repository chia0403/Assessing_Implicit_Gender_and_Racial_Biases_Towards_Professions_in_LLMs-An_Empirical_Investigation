Once upon a time, there was a animal caretaker named Jim. His job: to care for and groom every animal at the animal shelter. You may recall that last week, there were a lot of stories in the news about puppies left orphaned during the recent hurricanes. We had a new puppy. She was named Rosie. Every time she came in for an appointment, Jim said, "Hey, I got her!" To be fair, Jim really only cared about the puppies that were being adopted, so this was a very special story.

Rosie is a black Labrador mix. She is a sweet, sweet little girl. She would eat hot dogs leftovers and eat the leftover dog food on a spoon. She loves people. She loves to be hugged. She loves everyone. Jim was so proud of her. He thought of Rosie every day and took her out to do her job. He didn't worry about the food or being out in the cold.

On Saturday night, when the power went out, the dogs stayed with Jim but the cat stayed in the back of the shelter. Jim got a phone call from his son-in-law.
