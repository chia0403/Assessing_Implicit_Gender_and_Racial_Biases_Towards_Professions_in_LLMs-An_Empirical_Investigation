Once upon a time, there was a logger named Rube Goldberg. He was a master at manipulating logic chains and making abstractions from them.

This is Rube Goldberg, circa 1944.

From the beginning, I see the problem, he sees the problem. "Oh, nothing big, Rube is nothing big." He starts building a tower, and we watch him as he climbs the wall. He gets to the top, and it's huge, and there's nothing there. Then he puts a lever on the top, and something moves down the side of the tower. He puts another lever down. He takes the top off, and the door swings open. There's no sign of the lever â€“ the thing didn't work. A bit of effort later, and he's back up again, in a different tower. What goes up, must come down."

Rube could, if he wanted to, make hundreds of little gates on the sides of his tower, which in effect would slide a button. Each time the button was pushed, the door opened.

After some study, I came up with an ingenious solution: one thing that always happens to the button is that when it is pushed, a lever slides backward. This lever lets you know which way to make the gates. Simple!

Now that we have that working well, we can build more complex logic gates. The basic logic gate is the AND gate. If everything is true then
