Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Mike.

Mike met the Princess, a mysterious teenage girl who was in need of more than just a ride home from a festival. Mike had also been working for some time as a mechanic for the princess.

Before that night, they both wanted to be a trucker like everyone they knew. But soon, Mike became jealous as he began to fall more and more in love with the princess.

Soon the princess had her sights set on something else. Just as she was beginning to settle into her new job, she got a job offer from the Prince.

As the journey continues, the two heroes get acquainted in their own way, the first time sharing a ride as well as a couple of heated arguments.
