Once upon a time, there was a journalist named Steve Riddle who published a number of science fiction and fantasy articles under a pseudonym, including one on an alien from the Galactic Federation and one called The Star of India. These articles have been republished across the Internet with the consent of the author's estate, and some of the characters have been modified: Riddle no longer wears a bowler hat and a trenchcoat, for example; although he does retain this distinctive appearance in several of his remaining articles.

What Riddle wrote about was an ordinary-looking, average-sized, round-faced alien from the planet Ganymede ("Ganymede is the Earth, in the sky, the planet Jupiter with the rings on its side"). The Star of India ("The Star of India is a type of satellite in orbit between Jupiter, and Saturn, and the fifth to be discovered in the last several centuries") was a little more exotic, but very much human in appearance. Riddle described "Ganymede," whose location is unknown, as having a light-reflecting surface, "with an interior containing numerous rooms." Riddle's Star of India is equipped with telephones and a computer -- like Riddle, the Star of India was an intelligent object.
