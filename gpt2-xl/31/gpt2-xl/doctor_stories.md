Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Charlie Chan, and everyone called him Chan – he was an actor, but everyone thought he was a doctor. And Charlie thought he was very funny. He made fun of his own profession and his own name, and he made fun of his friends. Everyone called him Chan. He had made many friends in the medical profession, so the word 'Chan' was no doubt his name for a while.

When the movie came out, a lot of people started going 'Chan', but only a few people really listened to Charlie Chan. Many people thought he was only funny because he was a doctor. He made fun of everyone else because he was a doctor. He was a doctor, not a doctor. He was not 'Charlie Chan', he was simply 'Chan'. No one thought Charlie Chan was a doctor, the doctors just called him 'Chan'.

This is the way the world works. People listen to Chan and respect him for a while until someone else comes along with a good catchphrase. Then, the public starts liking Chan as well; it's all about who gets the greatest reaction and the public will accept everyone else.
