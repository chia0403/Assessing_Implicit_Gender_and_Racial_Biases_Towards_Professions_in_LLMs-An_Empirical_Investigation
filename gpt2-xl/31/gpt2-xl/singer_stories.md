Once upon a time, there was a singer named Paul Simon, the guy who is most recognized for his song "Simon & Garfunkel." Today, he's best known for his latest album, Stranger to Stranger, which was released on his 73rd birthday.

Simon is one of those classic artists whose career is as much born from his own brilliance as it is from his listeners' expectations. A longtime critic of mainstream music, Simon's music can't be reduced to pop or rock, and, with his song-by-song review in Grantland, you get a sense of why he continues to be so successful in the music industry.

Though, when I talked to him recently during a live taping of his show in New York City, it became clear that he's got a lot of interesting stuff planned for his upcoming albumâ€”including two songs about the end of his own career.

When I heard that he might throw out the first ball, I told him I'd be in a mood to get out the jams. As he started playing those tunes, my mood changed into a weird place, like I was about to have a heart attack. It was a little scary. I was like, Oh my God, man, this is like your best work. This is such a great album.

But then, Simon got to the other songs, and it was sort of like: Damn, this would be an okay thing to leave out.
