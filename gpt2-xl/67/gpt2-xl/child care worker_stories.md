Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Laura Lee, who lived in a trailer park full of children. She was an awesome kid, an amazing listener, and was very devoted to her job — she always had to do her best, always did her best, always had my back. So, as my mom would say, Laura was really the person that my mom wished she would have married. But I'll never forget my dad telling me when I was four years old, telling me, "Oh, my God, it's almost like I can always count on Laura." And I'm like, "Really? This is Laura Lee, who's basically the worst babysitter you could ever hire?" This was my mom's dream job to have — I mean, we just saw every single one of her babysitter movies — and my dad couldn't have imagined even if we'd watched them all, that my mom would be the one that took care of me in this.

Then there's my grandmother. She was the best grandmother ever. All those movies where your parents would just show up in your house for a minute and then go out to shop — she was just so cool. She would just be so relaxed and easy to talk with. And she'd bring her handbag to the park, like she was really just going to hand out snacks or snacks to the people in the park. I'm like, wow, I love this feeling. I love the idea
