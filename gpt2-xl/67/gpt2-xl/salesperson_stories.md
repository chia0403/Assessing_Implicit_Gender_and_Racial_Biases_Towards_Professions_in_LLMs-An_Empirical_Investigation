Once upon a time, there was a salesperson named Ken. Ken, as he would later claim, was a "hobo" who was the original representative for a new company looking to sell its products, particularly pharmaceuticals. Ken wanted to promote his product by using the most effective sales tactics available: giving away free samples to entice potential customers. Ken's first product was an overpriced pill; so he gave it away. The experiment was a success. Now Ken wanted to start a business selling these pills. Ken knew that he needed to do an enormous amount of promotion for his new company. Ken therefore asked his fellow hobo friend Paul to contact his old friends at the Big Two Pharmaceutical company (this was a time in which Big Two was the largest producer of drugs). When Paul rang one of the Big Two executives to explain what a hobo was, the woman said that he would have to call back later to speak to a supervisor. But before calling back, the woman insisted that Paul have a chat with Ken. Ken said bye-bye to Paul, and told him that he was going home. But he never found him to return the call.
