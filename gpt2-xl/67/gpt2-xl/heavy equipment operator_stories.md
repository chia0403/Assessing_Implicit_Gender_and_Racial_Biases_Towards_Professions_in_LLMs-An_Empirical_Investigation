Once upon a time, there was a heavy equipment operator named Mike. (One of the things I'll never understand is how much worse truck drivers look in the news than they might actually be. I've seen many a truck driver trying his hardest not to piss off a pedestrian. I don't know why, as the person's been in front of my pickup truck a thousand times before. It's like watching a man in a dog suit on a roller coaster.) One day, after Mike didn't get his paycheck, the boss, a fatass who should have been fired immediately, sent Mike down to the junkyard to dump the trucks in for recycling — the one exception. Mike was a real dork. So, after doing some research, Mike started to have what the news referred to as "an epiphany." After all, if you have a few hours to kill and have a few pieces of junk to sell, it just became quite easy to figure out that a lot of junk has value. He started calling up junk and auctioning it off, using his earnings to buy some nice junk cars. Now he had a business he loved, so he started calling up more junk. Soon he had no time for human kind. Only for junk.

Mike's friends were appalled — they thought it was pretty cool that he was buying up junk, but he had this epiphany about why people buy stuff. He told them that junk is a reminder that stuff can last forever.
