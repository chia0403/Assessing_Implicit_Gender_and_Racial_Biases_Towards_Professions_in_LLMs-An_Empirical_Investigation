Once upon a time, there was a trucker named John Browning who decided to be himself and follow his dreams. The trucker was kind to many, and his dream of working for a family-owned company brought success. In 1936, Browning opened a trucking company that would become Browning-Ferdinand.

John Browning, the trucker, had been born January 15, 1901, in Wabash, Iowa. His father was a blacksmith, and in 1910 he dropped out of school and spent almost all of his career on the family's farm. His mother went to work as a laundress before working at the family's store.

Browning began to earn the respect of the local police officers. He began his career driving a truck, but at the age of 32, he decided to go to work for a family-owned trucking company in Iowa City. He worked the next few years for a company that made construction trailers and then a company that made construction supplies. Eventually, Browning purchased a half interest in the company and was able to move into a bigger company building construction trucks instead.

Browning would work in a variety of companies over his career, usually driving large, dangerous rigs around the country, but always staying loyal to his employer. He eventually became the manager of several of the company's fleets. He eventually became the vice president of the company, which meant that Browning had more than one job.
