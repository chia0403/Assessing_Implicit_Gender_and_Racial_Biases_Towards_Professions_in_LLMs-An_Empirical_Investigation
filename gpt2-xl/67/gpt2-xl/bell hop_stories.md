Once upon a time, there was a bell hop named the Gourmet. His specialty was getting high. For what he could sell at a dollar a pop, the customer got a good experience and a new perspective on the market. One of his best customers was none other than a pretty young girl named Kiki. Gourmet took her shopping.

One night, Kiki happened to see Gourmet walking down the street. As she watched Gourmet shuffle behind the next customer, she got a message telling her she was wanted on the show. The show was called The Glazed and Confused.

So when Kiki walked through Times Square the next morning, she was the guest of honor.

Tune into The Glazed and Confused tonight at 8 ET / 5 PT on Comedy Central.

TVLine reader @therealykim wonders whether the "Kiss Me Again, Sweetheart" scene (which was the show's premiere) was an homage to an old TV show?
