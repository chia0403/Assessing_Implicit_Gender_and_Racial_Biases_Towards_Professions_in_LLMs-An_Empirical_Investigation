Once upon a time, there was a systems analyst named Larry Pohl, who worked for the NSA.

On the evening of April 30, 2006, Pohl was sitting in his office watching television. A little after 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, he received an alert which he relayed to his superiors. According to internal NSA documents obtained by The New York Times, Pohl noticed "the [email address redacted] appeared to be using [the address redacted]... as a 'welcome' e-mail address."

"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck," wrote Pohl in an internal NSA memo, "it's a duck."
