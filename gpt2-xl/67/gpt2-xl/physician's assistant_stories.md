Once upon a time, there was a physician's assistant named Ahab.  Ahab used to say to me, "Sylvester, you are the only one who truly understands the medical profession."  I tried to tell him how he was wrong, and even though he was wrong, he didn't agree.  All I heard him say was, "How can I possibly understand that?"  But no matter how much he argued, he couldn't change what had been established.  The medical profession was never going to go back to the way it was before, and Ahab simply never understood that.  For that, he paid with his life.  And with that, the medical profession has been reduced to just another business where physicians like Ahab stand in the way of patients getting what they need.
