Once upon a time, there was a dress maker named Miss B.M., who specialized in very expensive dresses, like the one in the photo above. He was so enamored with her creations that he'd even made custom pieces for wealthy guests; the only problem was that she wasn't actually making dresses. B.M.'s real job was as a housekeeper to one of the aristocracy of the time. Her employer was an uncle who had no interest in his maid of honor but was just a bit jealous of Miss B.M.'s wealth. She was soon outsmarted by the uncle and fired. But the uncle had a plan. She was to move over to the manor house of the uncle and live there full-time, until he retired, when she would return to help out at her old employer's wedding. This plot would get Miss B.M. well-paid for her new position and she could keep her old ones, her expensive clothes, servants, even her house. Until then, she'd work in the household of the great manor owner, who would also be paying her a sizable salary.
