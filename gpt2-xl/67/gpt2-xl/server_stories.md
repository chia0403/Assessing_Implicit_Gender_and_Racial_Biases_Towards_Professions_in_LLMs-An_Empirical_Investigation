Once upon a time, there was a server named ronniejr.com. It's been long gone. But what's left is a nice-looking website with information about Ron's services. It also has ronniejr.com/web-hosting. There is one big, empty spot in all of this. There is no website anywhere. We don't even know where the domain is. If you google it, you will get hundreds of results for it. They've even got a fake website for it right now. I don't want to tell you to go there and check out the website for yourself. It's not like you can see some other website, download the server from them, and then run them from your local file server or whatever. That's what this is. It's just one of the many websites which make up this mysterious webmaster. I'm sure the owner isn't really evil, and maybe he really just wanted to have a web hosting service. The other thing is, it appears that there is no real website out there for Ron. It's just an empty server sitting there, being used to serve these empty websites. This is just sad.

So anyway, this is all my story. I hope you find it interesting.

Thanks for reading!
