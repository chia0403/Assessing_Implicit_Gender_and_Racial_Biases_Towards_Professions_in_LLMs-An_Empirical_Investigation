Once upon a time, there was a chef named Kibitzing. And then, he was an author. And then, he was a food reviewer. And then, he wanted to help the homeless. So he did. He donated a boatload of food.


It was one of those people you had to meet in person—someone who had been touched by food and lived it—someone who believed in the goodness of food, of home, of life. And with that, he became your guide through the world's second-largest homeless shelter, where the food was the best in the world, the beds a godsend, the people wonderful.


So, Kibitzing, how did you turn your life around?

KIBITZING: Well, it's not that easy, my friend.


KIBITZING: Actually, I had a good life.


So, was I depressed for a time?

KIBITZING: Yes, for the better part of 20 years. And eventually, I came to see that every life is its own story, and I had not written my first.


[Laughs] You were a great writer.

KIBITZING: I was. [Laughs]
