Once upon a time, there was a cashier named Cathy MacDougal. Cathy had worked for the same company as a cashier for over twenty years, until one day she received word: an investigation into her employer had revealed some strange things about her past, things that could only mean one thing. Since her job was on the line, Cathy left her job and never looked back. In the time since her departure, the world has changed and more information has come to light about Cathy. It is now her intention to become the world's best ghost hunter.[10] Cathy was last seen at the end credits.[11]

She appears later in this video game where she is helping Cathy with the investigation of a strange anomaly. It has apparently something to do with a girl named Catherine that she met the night before. He is a ghost that likes to do things behind people's backs. It has been suggested that they were dating earlier that day as they were in the park for lunch.[12][13]

Trivia Edit

The name "Cathy MacDougal" is an exact retelling of the actress' first name. It plays in a similar way to the first game, with her name spelled out in the top-right corner above a picture of a map of Japan.

Trivia Edit

One of the names in the "Nekopara" series' text files is "MacDougal", likely the case of not spelling the actress' first
