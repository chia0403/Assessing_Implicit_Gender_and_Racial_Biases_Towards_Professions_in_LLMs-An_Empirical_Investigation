Once upon a time, there was a income tax preparer named Mark Twain. (This may seem like an unlikely candidate for the top taxonomy of taxonomists, but it was once thought so.)

The taxman asked Twain, who lived on his farm at Brattleboro, Vermont, whether he paid an income tax. He answered that he did not, because paying income tax was unfair, which of course was not true at all. At the time, the taxman then proceeded to go from "no income tax" to "yes, he did" to "yes, he does".

Twain was an avowed socialist, whose pamphlets had called for a new income-tax with a graduated tax rate; his taxes were much higher than the average person's. As it happened, this particular income had a top rate of zero. It is not clear if Twain was asked whether he paid income tax and whether it was specifically about his marginal tax rate. In a letter addressed to a friend's wife in 1904, written months after paying his first income tax, but long before he had been employed full time as a tax preparer, Twain wrote:

"In the years 1854 to 1860—the first years of my own practice—I paid no tax. In that early period, I considered it unfair to ask of anybody that which he would not be willing to pay for himself."

Twain's tax advice remains interesting for what it says about
