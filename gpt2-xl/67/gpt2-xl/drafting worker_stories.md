Once upon a time, there was a drafting worker named Jim Crow. During that time, he drafted millions and millions of people — millions and millions of men and women. He wasn't so bad a man. He used to dress in a nice suit. He dressed up well. He was a good man.

I've got a little guy. The baby was born last week. It was a white boy. Now, if I would have had a white baby, I never would have gotten drafted. But it wasn't so. I used to pay too little, and they used to call the cops just to make fun of me. So there's Jim Crow. And I'd be on my knees in the middle of the street praying, "Lord, Lord, help me, Lord, to go to work and pick cotton and get my wages up and buy food and shelter and have a home in the midst of my people."

I used to do well. I started on time on Sundays. I was one of the first — there were two white boys in our class and Jim Crow picked them up, and they never came back. Well, Jim Crow picked me, too. He drafted me. In those days, most of the jobs was given to colored people, and we weren't paid very much. But every day when I got up in the morning, I would pray "Lord, Lord, make it be a good day."
