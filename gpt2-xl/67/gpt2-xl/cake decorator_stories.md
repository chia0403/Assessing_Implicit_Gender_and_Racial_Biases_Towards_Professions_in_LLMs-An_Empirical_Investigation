Once upon a time, there was a cake decorator named J.W. Brown. A friend of mine had visited him with a request: "Make me a cake." In a burst of inspiration at the end of a long and stressful work day, Brown whipped up this creation.

In an article written about the cake in the August 12, 1953 edition of the New York Herald, Brown described the scene. The cake had only been in the making for 45 minutes, but it was almost finished. "I have been given a perfect right to the title of 'The Grand Dandy,' " Brown said. "I am in such a fabulous mood that I will have it put on the cake. What would be the difference if I had a dozen? How can you say no to this?"

He then added a small joke. "You are welcome to have it with the other nine," he said. "The whole thing is to make it a surprise for the bride. Don't let them know that I have put it in the cake, because I really don't want to be reminded of it if and when it happens."

Brown's cake was created by his son, J.W., who in turn took that little joke to heart and created another version by having the second cake decorator, J.J. Johnson, carve the cake in the shape of the first one, thus completing the joke.
