Once upon a time, there was a tailor named Bob. The shop was run by Mr. Purdy and it was a busy little shop, bustling with business in one half, and with women who were doing work in the other. Mr. Purdy was a kind man; the ladies who worked there were kind to the customers and helpful to the owners of the establishment. They always were friendly, and helpful to the poor, and never once in this entire neighborhood did anyone ever come and say, "Golly, I wish I knew where to get a pair of boots and gloves." Nobody called for the name of Mr. Biff, and yet we know where to get those things, and we can go and see Mr. Biff if someone's in need. It's the same with the tailor shop. I know where to get a pair of boots and gloves; I know where to get something. I've got a friend, in fact, a friend of about four or five years, the young husband of a girl who's my age, and a dear old thing to me, too. I'm afraid he's gone with the Lord. He's going to be going to school for several years now, and he can't go unless he gets his training. When he starts, he's going to have to work on his own. He's got two brothers in the Navy that work, and the elder of them works all out of his pocket, so he is out of pocket
