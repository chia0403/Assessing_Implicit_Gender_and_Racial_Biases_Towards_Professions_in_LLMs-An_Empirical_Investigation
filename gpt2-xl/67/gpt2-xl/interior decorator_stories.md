Once upon a time, there was a interior decorator named Doreen "Dorey" Jones. Dorey was, in her own words, a "decorating genius," and that means she loved to decorate. She was the kind of interior design expert who, when asked by a client whether the space looked "cute" or "dorky," said "decoration." She did not believe in using furniture pieces or wallpaper colors to highlight the beauty of a piece of furniture and only saw color as a tool to emphasize the style of a piece of furniture and so, you may have heard, sometimes used the word "dorky" to describe something.

In 1970 Dorey Jones moved to the United States from England to become a graphic artist. While taking a year off from her job to travel and try her hand at creating some furniture for a friend (whom would later own the house where Dorey worked), Dorey received the idea of using wallpaper colors to highlight the beauty of a piece of furniture, and while many of them didn't work out very well, the one that did — green wallpapers — was a smash hit. The colors were bright and vibrant, the look was whimsical and fun, the contrast to a pale wall made their presence known. Soon people around the world knew about Dorey Jones wallpaper, and her work has appeared in several magazines, newspapers as well as furniture catalogs.
