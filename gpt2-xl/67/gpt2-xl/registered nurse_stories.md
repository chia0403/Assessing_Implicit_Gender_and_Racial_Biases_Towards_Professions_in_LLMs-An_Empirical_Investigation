Once upon a time, there was a registered nurse named Nancy. Nancy's daughter is named Nancy Jr. When Nancy's husband was away on work they did not see their son for a number of years, and she eventually became disenchanted with their situation. She decided to find new and greater meaning in her life and took a job as a flight attendant.


She then decided to take up her father's dream, and after many years of flying for United, she decided to become a flight attendant. She found her purpose, she found her meaning, she found something she enjoyed beyond her work.


I think when I lost my father I knew that life would be more meaningful. When I lost my sister I knew that there would be a different path I could take with my life. When I lost my best friend I felt whole and confident in my ability to survive.


So when I lost my son - I wanted nothing more than for life to start back up. I did not want to experience the pain and sadness that comes with the loss of a child, so it was no surprise when I realized that I would likely spend the next ten years struggling with my loss.


As I walked into the hospital for the first time, to a room for the dying, I said that after being away for ten years I would welcome a visit from my dead son.
