Once upon a time, there was a writer named Jack Kerouac who had something called the "great American novel", which is one that truly "captures it all". His work was a revelation to anyone who really understood what writing was all about. For a good long while, these gems of literary genius could sometimes be found in the back of my bookcases (in case you're wondering, I also have a copy of On the Road somewhere), although I don't think they'd ever find their way to my bookcases today.

However, I have a newer discovery of my own that may well have a lot more literary merit than anything I have on my bookcases. And, I have a lot more of it. It's called "The Adventures of Riddick", and the only caveat is that it wasn't published until 2009, so the reviews don't all be able to come to my door in the same order they do in the novel. I'll let you take the guesswork and guess whether or not there might be a bit of an edge to "The Adventures of Riddick" as opposed to the novel in the first half, or in the case of our young heroine (the eponymous "Riddick") just a little bit.

Before the trailer for "Riddick" even came out, it had already been nominated for an Academy Award as one of the Best Movies of the Year. It's one of those ideas that you think
