Once upon a time, there was a physical therapist named Richard G. Anderson. His name was on the license plate of an SUV that stopped by the office of the hospital where I worked.


He saw me on a regular basis and asked my permission to photograph me in the shower. It was after this conversation that I realized that it was impossible to avoid the mirror.

In a way, it was like the mirror is there with you. It tells you whatever you need to know about yourself by showing you yourself.

That was probably the first time I truly considered how I would feel when the mirror said that I was the most beautiful patient there, and the most intelligent, and the most motivated. Perhaps it was that one time when the mirror showed me to be the most patient, the most obedient, and the most cheerful. Perhaps it was that time when the mirror told me that I had no friends.

And then there's my first encounter with Richard Anderson.

My doctor at that time, Dr. George Johnson, was a nice old man who had recently retired to become a chiropractor.

I'd never worked in a hospital before, so it would be a big world to introduce me to something completely different. So my doctor offered me a visit to a spa. She suggested that I visit the Saks Fifth Avenue salon, which was one of Dr. Johnson's favorite places to dine.
