Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named Walter. He came down to our neighborhood with a load of wood and he wanted to make a treehouse from which to harvest the trees he chopped.

Walter's wife, Lucy, was not satisfied with the size. So, the couple created a ladder to lower the building when it was being constructed.

The ladder eventually fell into the forest and a beautiful tree, which was the home's original tree, grew on top of it. Now, it's called the Tree House.
