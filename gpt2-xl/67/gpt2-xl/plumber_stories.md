Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Mike Feller. Mike was a big, burly man with blue eyes and a deep voice, who gave no fucks about those people. He lived a simple life. He loved his family. And then he was drafted into the NFL. Mike worked on the streets for fun, with a little money from his paycheck. Mike lived a pretty lonely life, doing his job, and enjoying himself. One day, an ex-con got hold of Mike's truck and stole it. Mike didn't mind. After all, he didn't have much. When Mike got the truck back, though, he only found $250. "It turned out I had a lot on me," Mike said. After the truck was recovered, Mike tried to get his work permit in place. "You can't buy a truck," he said. "Your work permit expires after one month, and it's a good thing I hadn't even taken an inventory yet." So, in Mike's view, a lot of money was wasted on paperwork. "I thought at least it would help if I had a chance to get a real job," he said. He got a part-time job at Big Lots, a grocery that was in a strip mall in an old mall. It was pretty good pay. But then there was a problem. The store was run by an ex-con named Robert Devereux. Devereux wanted to kill Mike.
