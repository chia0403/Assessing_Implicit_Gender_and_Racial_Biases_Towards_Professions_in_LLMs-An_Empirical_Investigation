Once upon a time, there was a research scientist named Dr. James Watson who, with his wife, spent almost fifteen years at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston observing some of the diseases that we now call AIDS and various kinds of cancer that had been around for several hundred years. He also, as we will see, helped to prove that the universe is expanding.

As that work expanded, he grew to take more and more time off, giving up his first wife and leaving the hospital behind and heading to a rural, isolated place in England, where he died in 1947.
