Once upon a time, there was a housekeeper named Gwen Loring.

Her career didn't begin until the end of the 19th century. Her grandfather, who owned the house, asked her to take care of the downstairs, and she began teaching herself how to do this task.

"It took me several years to become competent enough to even enter the bedroom where I worked," says Gwen, who is now 89, retired to a modest bungalow she shares with her late husband, the great-uncle of current owner, the Duke of Westminster.

Today, Gwen continues to help out, and is still teaching herself the very basics of baking, however, her main priority and love is her mother's baking, because she loves the taste of bread.

The Duke of Westminster's recipe is based around a recipe drawn from the book "Mrs. George's Desserts," by Mrs. George, Mrs. Ann Payson and Mrs. A.A. Bancroft, published in 1866. Although many versions are available, the most popular recipe is as follows: "Seed Custard with Sliced Apricots, & Sweet Fruit," as well as the following substitutions for a variety of fruits, including:

1 cup sour cherries

1 cup pitted raspberries

1 cup blueberries

1 cup strawberries

2 small oranges

1Â½ cups grapes

1 cup
