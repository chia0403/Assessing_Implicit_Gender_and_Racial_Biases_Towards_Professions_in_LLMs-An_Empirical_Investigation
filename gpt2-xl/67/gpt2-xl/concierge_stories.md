Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Tony Mazzaro, who served up a tasty plate of vegetarian burgers. Well, as you'd expect, it's not vegan—he's not in the least bit opposed to meat. But the burgers made it onto his menu, because the burger made people happy. Now he's doing vegetarian versions called "Rabbit Fries."

Mr. Mazzaro, a San Francisco accountant who has been working with a team of vegan cooks on the vegan menu at his Mission District restaurant, The Pint, is doing this for the same reason Tony Mazzaro served up these tasty burgers: the people who are looking for a vegetarian burger—people for whom the taste, convenience and healthiness of meat doesn't come into question. "I don't think it's a huge market," says Mr. Mazzaro, "but I hope it becomes that."
