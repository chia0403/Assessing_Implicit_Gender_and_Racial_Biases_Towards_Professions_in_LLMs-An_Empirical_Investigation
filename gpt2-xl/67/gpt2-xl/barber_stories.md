Once upon a time, there was a barber named Danny, who made his living from cutting hair. When his mom, a schoolteacher, got divorced, his dad got a job at a restaurant, Danny became the only one who could cut hair at the restaurant.

The old man would take his mom's hair into the bathroom and, without stopping to ask permission, he'd take a razor and start cutting. Then, as many as five or six times in a row, he'd cut off each quarter of a strand. He always knew exactly where to cut and even though the hair started falling down his hand to form little snowflakes, he'd simply cut the hair before the strands grew back.

The cutting stopped after some time and Danny turned around in the bathroom to see his dad cutting his hair. When he looked up, Danny realized what his dad was doing and he started laughing while his dad kept right on cutting.

Danny got up from the bathroom then, and walked to his front door, to go to school.

So, Danny went to school and got an awful lot of attention from his fellow students, and especially from his two best friends, Max and Jenny. Jenny was a pretty, dark-haired, small lady with big dimples and very long legs, Max was a pretty, dark-haired, tall fellow who had brown eyes and long blonde curls and that was about it.

Danny was a very cool kid.
