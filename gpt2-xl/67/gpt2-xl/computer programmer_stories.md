Once upon a time, there was a computer programmer named Robert Aumann. Bob had decided that computers would be used to solve difficult mathematical problems, not to play chess. This approach proved immensely popular.

Bob also came up with a practical trick for computing the value of his computations. For all the computational power of a computer, it is not possible to assign an exact number to its total work. Bob came up with a way to calculate the exact number of operations a computer must perform in solving a problem. At the time, no such calculation existed and therefore Bob's trick was called the "Aumann conjecture."

The "Aumann conjecture" gave rise to an extraordinary problem. A computer could solve a problem more efficiently than a human brain could achieve the equivalent result. To put the Aumann conjecture in human terms, it's amazing to think that we can know how many operations a computer must perform in solving a task. But Bob had never thought that human brains were capable of solving problems that complex by themselves, as a computer.

Many researchers were interested in the Aumann conjecture and therefore the computation problem. They started asking questions that seemed to point to an answer. They knew that if the algorithm used by computers could be shown to be accurate in producing all the results that a brain would produce, then Aumann's conjecture would automatically apply to computers as well. This seemed to give a strong argument that the Aumann conjecture applied to computers.
