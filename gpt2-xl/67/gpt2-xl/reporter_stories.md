Once upon a time, there was a reporter named Mary Tyler Moore who looked like a boy at age 40.

When Moore was 20, the director of the National Security Agency said he once heard the story from President George Herbert Walker Bush.

"It was about two months after the 9/11 attack and a woman was brought in who said she had been in Texas and had read about a person that she thought looked like Mary Tyler Moore," said Moore at an event in Los Angeles this week, according to a video of it posted by ABC news.

"I had no idea who she was talking about," said the director of the agency, Gen. Michael Hayden.

"She said that she thought this was her friend, who had become a teenager in Texas, and she believed that they were on Texas time and the terrorist attack had actually taken place there. And so, I had kind of stopped the woman and asked him, 'Do you think this is a legitimate story?' and he said, 'No, but it's a fascinating story,'" said Hayden.

So, did Moore say, 'Yeah, this is me?'

"I don't recall the exact words, but, yeah, I can't say we didn't take a lot of notes," Moore told a reporter.

At the time she was 23 and married. She would go on to write 30 books about her life, including "Gigli" and the bestseller
