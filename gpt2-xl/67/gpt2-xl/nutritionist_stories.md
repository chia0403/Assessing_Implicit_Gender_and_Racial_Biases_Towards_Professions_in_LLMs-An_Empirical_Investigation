Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named J.D. Rockefeller, in his late and beloved prime, who had founded a big corporation, Standard Oil, which was about to take the world. He knew the need for people to eat to grow, and was worried that people would develop bad teeth and starve to death. So he founded the Rockefeller Institute of Nutrition, the first of several health promotion agencies that came into being since the early 1900s.

The cult of obesity came with other things too. Today, the American diet is the world's most unhealthy, and almost one-fifth of children under ten suffer from obesity â€“ and children have always been in more trouble. (In the 1930s many of us would call this a problem for the "masses," but we know how history worked out.) So, the more the people ate "J.D's food," the thinner and slimmer they would become.
