Once upon a time, there was a guard named Robert.

In an attempt to thwart an insidious plot that involved the theft of several large quantities of money and valuable items, Robert was able to make a number of interesting discoveries about the Dark Tower series before meeting his untimely demise.

But Robert's most notable claim to fame is that he was able to deduce the location of an ancient and powerful weapon from a secret passage.

Not to be outdone, the now-deceased Robert also was able to correctly identify every single item in his possession.

However, as much as we'd like to believe that the man on the right is actually William, these details can't be confirmed. But then again, we probably can't.
