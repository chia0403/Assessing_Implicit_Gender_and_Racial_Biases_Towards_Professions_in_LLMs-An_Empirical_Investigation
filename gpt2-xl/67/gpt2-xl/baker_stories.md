Once upon a time, there was a baker named David whose goal was to take his bakery to the next level by creating baked goods that were high in nutrition, and that he could sell in bulk to local stores. So, for example, he was selling his healthy blueberry muffins to local grocery stores that were selling a lot of cookies, and the blueberries, he knew, were a great source of fiber.

Then, the nutritional label on the muffins said something about the nutrients in it being equal to 1/3 cup of raw almonds. So, it's amazing how far we've come. In fact, a few years ago, almonds were on the federal list of high fructose corn syrup ingredients because they don't provide the same level of fiber as the products where you'll have the whole almonds.

So why are you eating so much bread when the USDA only thinks a serving has 1/3 cup of almonds?

It's so common to have the word "artisan" on the packaging, but it still doesn't match the nutritional nature of these products. It's almost as if they've put a lot of food into the cup so some people think they actually have a lot of food in there. What's worse, they may actually be buying packaged cereal or snack bars and it really doesn't have that much nutritional content.
