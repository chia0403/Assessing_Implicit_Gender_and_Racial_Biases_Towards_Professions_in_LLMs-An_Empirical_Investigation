Once upon a time, there was a receptionist named Susan, and she always gave the same speech to every job interview:

Well, you see, I've got to tell you, as I told you this morning, Susan, I hate to say it, but I'm hiring. So, in order to ensure that I can hire only the most qualified, most qualified applicant, I'm closing the office for an indefinite period of time until next Thursday. I do this not so much to punish you, but rather to keep the town safe from the evils of "The New Yuppy". The yuppies are not as great as they once thought they were. They are dangerous. The yuppy is an emotional, emotional person, and when they find themselves under such intense scrutiny they can become dangerous. Now, to the yuppies of this town, I wish you luck finding the right person. But do not worry about me. I, too, shall move my headquarters. Goodbye for now.

Susan would later be promoted at the company and was, at one point, referred to as the "head receptionist" â€“ the equivalent, in today's climate, of head of "human resources."

As long as HR departments exist, companies will continue to be challenged by that very basic question: "How do I keep my staff from coming to harm?"
