Once upon a time, there was a painter named Baudelaire - a true master of the macabre.

There was an infamous party. The guests were a misfit gang of outcasts; they were called "The Dreamers". The party was a jubilant celebration for their recent victory against the fascist dictator - and to be brutally honest, they got a little carried away.

And then, as they indulged in much wine and drugged-up debauchery and the dreams took over, they discovered that the whole world they had seen from their own little corner of an unspoken network, the network of Baudelaire's dreams...

...was just a dream!

No, really! After a few more dreams of this kind, they turned up the volume on their drugs - and their world was revealed as nothing more than a series of surreal hallucinations and the dreams of a crazy man. They realised this with a degree of pride - Baudelaire was dead, after all.

In Baudelaire's case - no wonder he was so famous, but in the eyes of his fellows, he was only an "outsider". It is in a kind of "reality-shock" of these early hallucinations that the world we know starts to appear.

But the world that we know is not just a hallucination! There is a hidden reality behind the images - and it is being played out in our everyday lives
