Once upon a time, there was a cook named Paul Simon.


I'm going to introduce you to Paul Simon right now:


Paul Simon is a guy who sings.


Paul Simon has written some pretty famous songs, including "You're Gonna Find Out."


Paul Simon also went by the name, "Jimmy James." Here's an excerpt from the song he wrote, "It Can't Happen Here," which pretty much describes what a Trump presidency would be like:


Jimmy James was in his twenties when he was born on October 4, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York. He has called himself "the only white guy that's doing well."


We are going to take a break until 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT. We'll be back live right after the break to answer all your questions! If you have additional burning Trump-administration questions, shoot them over to @MaddowPolitics -- but don't ask for their personal info.


See you then!
