Once upon a time, there was a bookkeeper named Mr. Biddle and his beloved dog, who kept a housekeeper, Mrs. Biddle, at her office in the city. Now that we've come to a new century and everything is different, it's no wonder Mr. Biddle has decided to go on a bender without his beloved dog.

One morning, Mr. John (Biddle) is awakened by his alarm clock, which has been set to go off at 5:30 a.m. Fortunately, Mrs. Biddle has been slacking off and is a little late for work (if she even knows she has any work to do). As Mr. Biddle gets to work, he comes across a young man standing by the window, looking out at the beautiful setting sun. Mr. Biddle is not too pleased to see this, and he goes up to the young man to find out why he has been so hush-hush about his presence. "I don't know," the young man says. "I was just looking out the window." At this point, Mr. Biddle's curiosity gets the better of him and he decides to investigate. If he can't do anything about this, well, then he can at least be on his way to the drug store. Bask in your own glory boys, don't get high on the job.
