Once upon a time, there was a radio technician named Mark, who was assigned to work with an all-female radio station. Mark had some issues with this, and one day, he went to the bathroom to sort out an issue between him and another male employee. When Mark returned, the other male employee claimed that Mark had done something unprofessional because he had masturbated in front of him. Mark told us what he had done, and why â€“ that he had had an erection the entire time and was really embarrassed. He explained that, after doing this a couple times, he was afraid that he would get it in his pants anytime he was around another male in the office.

Later, Mark's manager (we will not use his name) called him in, and said he would let Mark have a break, because a male coworker had also masturbated in front of him! Mark left the station that day, and never returned. We later found out that the other male coworker had a "fitness problem," had not worked since the incident, and had been let go that same day.

This is another situation where a listener/reader brought forth a specific case to point out "some of the inconsistencies between how the world has been depicted to us, and how the world really is."
