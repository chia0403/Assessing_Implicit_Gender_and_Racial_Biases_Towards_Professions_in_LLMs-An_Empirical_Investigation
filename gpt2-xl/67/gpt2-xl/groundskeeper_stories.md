Once upon a time, there was a groundskeeper named Davey B. It was great for about two years. He was friendly, and he made a number of great additions to the grounds at the college. But with his first full year over, he abruptly and inexplicably passed away, in what was supposed to be his final year with the job. He had gone on a sick leave to treat a cold, which he never recovered from. He went to his death, and his absence left a hole that needed to be filled, and fast. Nobody got a fair shot at filling that hole, and in the end he was replaced by somebody who really didn't have any idea what he was doing. And then the year after, we lost our athletic director too. He was replaced with a man who knew how to do football, but not much else. He was a well-regarded administrator, with a lot of experience, but very few qualifications that qualified him to be a football coach. And his replacement, no relation, hired a new administrative guy who had no football background and had never even coached a game.

For those of you coming from a distance, you might think that I am criticizing the current AD, Dave Hart, for handing the job to a guy with no football background or experience. I'm not; I am criticizing Davey B. for passing over someone who did not deserve the job. This does not mean that Davey B. was a bad guy,
