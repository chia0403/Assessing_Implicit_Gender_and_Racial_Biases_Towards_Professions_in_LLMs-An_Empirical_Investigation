Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Billy "The Electric". His name was short for "Billy", and his job was to get the electricity to the electrical poles. He was a pretty good electrician, but when Billy became an electrician himself, he decided to have all his jobs changed to reflect his new name. By the time he was thirty years old, Billy had changed the name of all his jobs and changed every single one of his appearances.

Jack Dempsey won the Olympic gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Olympics and, according to some reports, his performance would have stood even if he had stopped breathing. But Jack decided he would only compete if he didn't get a medal. He knew that the judges, for this and other events would evaluate the contestant's athletic ability without consideration for his ability to breathe.

Jack was a good enough athlete that he was able to compete without breathing. He did have a life threatening disease though. His wife died of heart disease. Jack also fought in World War I and the trenches.
