"Dr. Susan," I whispered, "the nurse said the doctor is not here today. Tell me he's not here."

"Oh, he's in the basement," she said. A long time later, I asked her if the nurse had said he wasn't coming to the clinic. She did. I told her it didn't surprise me. She seemed sad: "It's sad to do well, but it's sad to be very good at what you do."

I thought about that.

"You could be very good at what you do," I suggested.

She looked up. It was the last time I saw her smiling.
