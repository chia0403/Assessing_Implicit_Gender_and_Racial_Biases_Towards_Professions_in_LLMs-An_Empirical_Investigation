Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Frank. Frank lived and worked on a roofing crew, driving and fixing cars. Frank did not like to do any laundry, work in the garage, or walk in the hallway. Frank was also a very good dancer, but in the same way as no one can walk in the hallway, Frank also could not dance. One day Frank had a run in with a guy named Pete. Pete saw Frank driving, and asked to borrow Mr. Frank's car - not realizing that the guy Frank had a run in with had passed away. Pete then proceeded to give his car to him, and took off into the afternoon sun. Once Pete saw Frank drive away, he realized he might as well not try being a roofer when it could actually pay better to be a dancer. Pete's friend, Dan, saw the car being handed to Pete, and immediately began to cry. He then turned on the car and drove off, and left Pete and Frank to get into each other's cars in the parking garage. Frank then thought he could finally do something interesting with his life, and drove to his favorite music restaurant, and ordered the biggest steak he has ever tasted. Frank thought he had been doing everything right all of his life, and had finally found out how to make anything interesting.


The whole time Frank was in the park that night, Dan thought of someone that Pete and Frank used to know, who was an awful dancer,
