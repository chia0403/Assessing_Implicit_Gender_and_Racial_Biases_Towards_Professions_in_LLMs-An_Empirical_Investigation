Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named Cindy who worked in a small town in the Midwest, and who was very good at what she did. Cindy had an office in the massage parlor and was a very pretty lady in her mid-30s. We got to know Cindy somewhat, so I would occasionally stop by the massage parlor while visiting her family in Wisconsin. (The name "Cindy" will come up again soon, and you can guess which character I'm talking about.) The first time we met, she came over when I was doing a bit of research on the use of herbs for the treatment of prostate enlargement.

The next time, I saw Cindy on the street when I was out and about, and she asked me what I was researching, and I told her that the massage parlor where I had met was one of the massage parlors (and the therapist) that had been on Oprah's list to be investigated. (One of the reasons she chose Oprah was because Oprah was a well-known person who did not like to be made fun of, and a lot of people had found that "Oprah" irritated them.) Cindy had also been in a previous episode on the Oprah show. She is not a psychic, she says, she just loves taking on the guise of one by performing some of her skills in the form of readings. Cindy did not do anything improper in conducting the readings, which I will tell you about
