Once upon a time, there was a fire fighter named Ed "Doc" Brown. In the novelization of "Back to the Future II", Doc is actually an American businessman named Henry Louis Gates.

One of Doctor Sontag's poems was published in 1971 called "The Great Wave." The poem was inspired by a woman's struggle to keep her apartment during the great wave, and her attempt to put out a flaming garbage can on the steps of her apartment building.

Edith Wharton was married to Thomas Edison for 25 years, and even wrote a book entitled "The Lady as Seen by Edison." The last line of the book, says, "Edison made me" (the woman the poem is on in the book is the mother of Edison's daughter Helen of Troy). At the age of 55, Edith Wharton committed suicide.

In 1984, a group of young adults who were fans of the movie "Back to the Future II" formed the "Time Travelers Society," and eventually a documentary on the trip they took to 2015, has been released.

The movie "Back to the Future Part II" was filmed as a musical. However, the movie was not able to be made as a musical due to the success of "Back to the Future Part I".

In "The Dark Knight" there's an advertisement for a fictional magazine "Back to the Future" with a picture of John Wayne.
