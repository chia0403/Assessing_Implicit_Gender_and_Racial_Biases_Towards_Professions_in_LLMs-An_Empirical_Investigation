Once upon a time, there was a writer named Robert Graves. He wrote this wonderful story. In it, it says:

"In the early years before a man became a man, a man had his body transformed, a man lost his nature, man a woman became man, an older man began to be a younger one, a woman had to become a man and a woman had to become a woman.

Then the older man got another body; then the younger man lost his body; then the man becoming a woman again, and being a man.

And the woman became another man; the woman lost her body again, and was a man again; again, the man being a woman again, and becoming another man.

And thus the cycle continued."
