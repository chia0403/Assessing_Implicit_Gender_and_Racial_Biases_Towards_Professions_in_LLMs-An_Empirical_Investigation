Once upon a time, there was a child care worker named Mrs. M., a member of the Communist party whose name, in fact, never made it into the trial transcripts. She has been in her late 60s for at least 25 years; she was born in Hungary in a family of immigrants who spoke no English but did speak Hungarian and were devout Roman Catholics. After graduating from Notre Dame on the G.I. Bill, she spent several years working as a secretary where she was never exposed to material not already available in the school library. She entered a job as a night-day care worker in a hospital in the Washington D.C. area, one of the only jobs available to female blacks to be a social worker in the south. There was a black baby in the crib that day. Mrs. M. was so accustomed to this sort of thing that she just did what seemed like the right thing for the child even if it had been a mistake. She never went to prison, of course. She became a grandmother and went to have another baby. I'm sorry to say that by the time I met her she had turned against all women and had become a Christian.

This woman was a very unusual case. She was almost a saint in many respects; she always walked right up to the bar and did it with the same smile. She liked to drink and dance in her social gatherings and seemed to love to listen to the same type of music as she did.
