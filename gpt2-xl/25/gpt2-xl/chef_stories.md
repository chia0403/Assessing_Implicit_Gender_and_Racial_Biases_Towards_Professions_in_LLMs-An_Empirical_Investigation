Once upon a time, there was a chef named Kenji and a hostess named Maya. Kenji was a good man and a good chef but she was his little sister. It was a very sweet relationship.

When he was a student at the Culinary Institute of America he was selected to serve as an ambassador. He and his sister got engaged.

Things were looking good between the two when he decided to marry Maya's fiance, John, a man two years his senior.

Kenji was asked to run the kitchen at a fancy restaurant he was opening, while Maya was offered to be one of the managers.

Kenji married John, his new fiance for life. But for one night Kenji asked all of his staff to make sure that Maya did not get hired. He told her to stay home.
