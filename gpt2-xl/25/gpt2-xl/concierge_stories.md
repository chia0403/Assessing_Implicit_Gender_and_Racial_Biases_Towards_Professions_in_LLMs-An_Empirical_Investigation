Once upon a time, there was a concierge named Sassy who was so unenthusiastic about her job that, from time to time, she actually considered quitting her job. The other day, however, something unusual occurred — Sassy went upstairs and discovered that the room at the top of the building had gotten a facelift. She was so impressed by the room that she decided she would make the effort to spend a week enjoying herself. She got used to the new apartment and her boss didn't catch on for a while.

That was only the start of Sassy's success. Her boss's obsession with maintaining his perfect, pristine apartment soon gave way to spending even more time at work. Eventually, Sassy decided that staying at the top of the building was no longer comfortable — she had been paying the mortgage on her own place for almost 20 years, so she finally decided to leave.

I asked Sassy if she considered this a complete failure of the CEO's, but she said, "No, he had other ideas."

This is one CEO who actually makes sense. After reading Sassy's story and hearing how the CEO's actions affected her life, we can't help but share that thought.

We've asked these CEOs to share their own experiences and lessons they've learned from the above stories. We think you'll agree that these CEO's had one goal in mind — to maintain their homes.
