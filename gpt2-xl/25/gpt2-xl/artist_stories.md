Once upon a time, there was a artist named William Burroughs, who lived the life of a recluse—no friends other than cats, and no family other than his beloved pet cat. The artist developed an addiction to alcohol, which he used to get away from the pressures of adulthood (and, of course, the pressures of publishing and artistic success).

What began as an obsession turned into a lifestyle. He lived mostly on the wild side, drinking, doing drugs, buying and smoking lots of weed, and basically living like a savage animal, until he, unfortunately, succumbed to some illness.

In Burroughs' final years, he began a process of self-discovery and healing which he called "the long boring drug-fame and drug-recovery period". He went into semi-retirement, and for 12 years never really did any drugs.

That's when Burroughs' friends started sending him a lot of drugs. One particular drug, which he called "Polaroid", became the first drug Burroughs tried to quit.
