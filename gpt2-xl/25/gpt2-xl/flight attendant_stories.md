Once upon a time, there was a flight attendant named Mary Todd Lincoln. Not only was this lady an amazing flight attendant, but the lady herself was one of the more entertaining presidents we've seen in recent memory, and there are still some people that can't get enough of her. If you want to make the argument that she made some questionable decisions, you have your point, but her story is really about what it was to grow up during a time in America where she had so much freedom, despite the fact that she was a slave, but was so grateful for the opportunity to fly a plane, that she made sure every bit of freedom she could was used. Now, back to our president and his wife, a famous couple, whose marriage is now said to be a matter of public discussion. Let's just say that a lot of people thought this whole thing was some kind of fraud, until they were proven wrong, of course. Oh, wait, I think that's what's really happening, is a little bit of both, in that the two sides of this coin, the political types, and socialites have been fighting for about two and a half years over this guy. Now, if I'm wrong here...


This one doesn't mean anything right now, and it might not even mean anything at all down the line. I was pretty shocked when I found out this. But there are some pretty big names that have come forward claiming their own part of the Lincoln family
