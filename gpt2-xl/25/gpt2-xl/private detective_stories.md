Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Richard Stawicki, who made a career out of exposing the shady dealings of people like the "Lord of the Fries". But all good detective work is made possible by money. And Stawicki isn't exactly in the business of making a fortune, but his past is about to throw his life into chaos. A series of brutal murders and the trial of a serial killer have left Stawicki and his partner, Inspector Bob Krantz, on the run in the most dangerous city in the world. Their destination: New York, the epicenter of the criminal underworld. But in order to put an end to the bloodshed, they will have to find the one man with the power to save them: the elusive James "Buster" Bluth! All that, along with a mystery from a rich personal history. One that can only be brought to life by the power of puppets. And yes, all of it is happening in front of our very eyes... Welcome to the world of Muppets Takeover!
