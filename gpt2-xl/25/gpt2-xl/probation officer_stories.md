Once upon a time, there was a probation officer named Bill McReynolds who wrote to the then governor of Montana: "[T]here are only two legal drugs in the state, and marijuana's popularity and demand is growing at the expense of those other substances."

As a former officer, I can only assume that Bill was familiar with "bud," "dope," and "pot," and had heard a lot of horror stories about Colorado's weed – stories that the governor was likely only too happy to make up to woo rural voters to his cause.

The two drug-specific charges filed against Bill and his son, a misdemeanor and a felony, are a clear attempt at voter intimidation.

But, in spite of the governor's desperate efforts, Montana's weed still has the legal support it was given in 2011 – when voters re-approved Amendment 64.

A recent amendment passed by the Montana Legislature also says that marijuana isn't actually illegal in the state. Rather, the state says it merely regulates it. So long as state government doesn't actively prohibit the plant, that was all that was needed.

But I doubt the Montana Legislature will ever be inclined to give up their weed-friendly status, and the people of Montana remain resolute.

Montana is still a pot-free zone.
