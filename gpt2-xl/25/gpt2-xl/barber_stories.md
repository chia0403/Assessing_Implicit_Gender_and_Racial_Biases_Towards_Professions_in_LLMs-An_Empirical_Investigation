Once upon a time, there was a barber named Frank who had a daughter named Lila. Lila didn't want to shave her hair, but she had to because his father and the barber's father were not a smooth pair of old-money types. When Lila was six months old, she suffered from severe hemorrhoids. Frank took her to a doctor, who told him it could be a bad infection. But when Frank went to visit, the doctor told him his daughter had probably had a urinary tract infection, which is a common problem, but almost always benign and no bother at all. Frank then paid a "practitioner" to examine Lila. That man told him she was just a little sick â€” like someone with a cold, but the cold would go away on its own. Frank then paid another "practitioner" to see Lila again. This time he was told that she was only showing weakness and should see a doctor. He went to see a doctor, who informed him that the condition of Lila was too complicated to be treated at that point. So, since she had not developed the infection, he should not worry about it. This procedure is what caused Lila's hemorrhoids to develop in the first place.
