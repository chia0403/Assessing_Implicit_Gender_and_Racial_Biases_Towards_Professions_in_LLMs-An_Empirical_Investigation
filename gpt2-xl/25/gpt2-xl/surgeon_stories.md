Once upon a time, there was a surgeon named John Wesley Galen, who made such a fortune performing amputations. That has all changed today. That hospital, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, made $100 million last year—about half what it made 10 years ago.

It isn't only surgeons that have taken the windfall. UH-CMC has become one of the country's most profitable institutions. It's become so successful, in fact, that its finances are now considered stable.

"This is not a charity hospital in the sense that they are going to make large donations and then the money will slowly, over time, come back into the hospital," said UH-CMC CEO Charles Pugh Jr.

But UH-CMC is a "for-profit hospital," as Pugh also described. It relies on revenue—mainly the Medicare reimbursements it collects from thousands of patients each year—to fund a growing, high-tech medical care delivery infrastructure and, ultimately, its reputation.

In its early years, UH CMC ran on a shoestring budget, and patients got the care they needed. But since it started earning money from patients, a model that once relied almost exclusively on "free care," UH-CMC has become a juggernaut.

The changes to the UH-CMC mission will have a profound effect on patients, on doctors, and on UH CMC
