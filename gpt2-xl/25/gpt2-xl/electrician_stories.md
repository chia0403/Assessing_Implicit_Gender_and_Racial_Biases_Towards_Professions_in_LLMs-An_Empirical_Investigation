Once upon a time, there was a electrician named Peter. One day, Pete went to work and his boss asked him for some service, or something… The following exchange took place:

Boss: I want you to wire the outlet here. (The outlet is in the wall, behind a sheet of firewood.)

Peter: Okay.

Boss: What do you call the wire you want to use?

Peter: Wire.

Boss: (He reaches for some type of wire and turns it on.) Oh, that's not what I thought… Ahh, just to be sure… (The wire is used for wiring a door, an electric fan, a lamp, a bed, a toilet, a furnace, etc.)

Peter: I… yes.

The boss: How much do you get paid per hour?

Peter: Five-eight.

Boss: (He tries charging five-eight, saying that he must have been wrong.)

Peter: What are you talking about? You said five-eight.

(I'm sorry for the smallness of this article!)

But what if I said you might be wrong to disagree with me? Would the boss or me have to admit
