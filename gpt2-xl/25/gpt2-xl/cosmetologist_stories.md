Once upon a time, there was a cosmetologist named Jenny who worked in an upscale salon with an expensive line. As an introvert and introverted woman, Jenny's job forced her to be involved with men. As per her own character arc, Jenny started to realize that her job brought her pain. While Jenny still loved her job and she valued her professional reputation and she worked hard, she often felt lonely.

As a result, Jenny started her own beauty treatment shop (she also owns a nail salon). To compensate for the pain from her day job, Jenny launched her own therapy service. So, when she goes out and makes "the most people smile", she feels happy and validated. Yet, Jenny still cares about men and loves them. How? We'll explore this in part 2!
