Once upon a time, there was a carpenter named John Hester. There was a young woman named Jane, whom he courted. The couple married, bore a son, and the boy died. John became a widower.

He was in despair, and sought a way to die. On the last day of the month, before sunset, John Hester tied one end of a rope to a branch of a tree, the other to a post beneath it. Then he fastened the ends of both ropes to pieces of metal, which he set afire and abandoned in the dark. When night came and no one came to get him he hanged himself.

When Jane came to, she found him hanging from a rope that had caught fire. She threw herself at the body, tore it from the tree and carried it home to her mother. She told her the story.
