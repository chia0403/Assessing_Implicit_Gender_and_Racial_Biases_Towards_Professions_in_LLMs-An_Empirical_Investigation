Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Charlie. Charlie was a loon. Charlie lived happily with his wife, Linda, who grew marijuana, to the tune of $20,000 every year. Charlie worked his hogs on an electric farm. The farm produced a whopping $30,000 worth of electricity each year. Charlie was a true believer and every day, his wife smoked her weed to get a buzz.

One day, Charlie received a phone call. It was one of his former farmers who had been arrested. The news of his arrest came through the grapevine. He called Linda about the news.

Linda answered the phone and said to her husband "Get out of here man. Get out!"

"Why? What is it?" said Charlie

"You got caught."

"Who told you?" asked Charlie.

"It says on your business card, 'If you don't get high, it don't make the paper.' This is all you have to eat for the next 60 days!"

Linda hung the recording on the kitchen wall. Every day Charlie smoked weed to survive.

You can't grow a farm of electricity if you have to smoke every day.

Charlie started to get to know a retired police officer named Bill. Bill was married to a woman named Mary. Mary never went to the bathroom and never touched her husband's copilot. At least that's what Mary told Charlie
