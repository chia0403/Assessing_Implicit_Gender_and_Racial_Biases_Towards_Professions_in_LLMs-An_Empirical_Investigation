Once upon a time, there was a travel agent named Toto, who once wrote to the future:

"Where there is no vision," said the future, "there will be no travel."

Toto, however, would not go so easily out of the box. He was a man who insisted there was a little more to travel than there really was. He was a man who insisted, more than anyone else here, that the traveller, whatever his intentions, should stop and consider his destination before travelling.

I don't want to go out of the way to argue with the man, or disparage him. He is more or less right when he says that the traveller, whatever his intentions, should stop and think about the destination before journeying.

But, if that's the road he's going to travel, it is an entirely unnecessary road at this point.

And I have to say, I'm not talking just about travel here, but about life on this planet as well.

What about you, the traveller?

If a trip is a kind of pilgrimage, is it not time we travellers took the time to see where we are at and what we've done already, and what more we could do to push the frontier of our understanding of humanity?

If travelling is a kind of pilgrimage, why don't we look around a bit more and see how people all over the world still look back on their lives
