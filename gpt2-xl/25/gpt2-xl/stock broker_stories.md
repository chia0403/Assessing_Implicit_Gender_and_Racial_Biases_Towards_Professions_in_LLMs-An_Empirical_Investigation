Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Joe who sold stock in Berkshire Hathaway with a margin call.

It was a very exciting day for investors. Buffett was on the line, and asked Joe how much money he was making right now. Joe said this:

"I'm in the red, but I just don't sell."

That's a classic example of a very bullish hedge versus a bearish hedge. The bearish option gives investors an upside call signal that makes them more likely and better able to trade in the markets.

If you buy an option that gives you a positive call signal on a stock, you get to do what the bookies do: bet on the upside. And one day you might even double it. It's a good, common thing to do.

One of the biggest things about investing in options is that they make your bet on outcomes a lot easier. And the downside comes from the opposite side of the market.

If you bought a $25 million call option on Microsoft, you know your $25 million is going up, right? But you still don't know how much the stock is going to rise or fall.

The difference between buying the bearish option and buying the long call option can be huge. And you can't predict them the same way you can predict the future outcome of the stock.
