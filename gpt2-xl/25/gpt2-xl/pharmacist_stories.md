Once upon a time, there was a pharmacist named Andrew Wakefield. It was in 2006 that Dr. Wakefield published a paper implicating a whole bunch of the world's healthiest people in a giant conspiracy in a small school in the suburbs of the city of London called Royal Free Hospital. The paper claimed they were all, among other things, full of anti-vaccination beliefs, and would be affected by various medical drugs—including ones with an ingredient called thimerosal, which doesn't actually exist. (The whole thing had to be retracted after it was exposed as a huge failure—but that was a long time ago, and Dr. Wakefield has since moved on with his life.) The problem was, Wakefield had little formal training, and his data were shaky. He made one big mistake—he tried to measure the MMR vaccination rate in the children of doctors and politicians. That is not likely to be an accurate way to get at the vaccination rate of an entire population. But Dr. Wakefield got away with it. It was a story, and it was the subject of one of the biggest scoops in British journalism. For that, he received the prestigious Andrew Wakefield Career Award from the British Medical Association.

Dr. Wakefield's paper was a mess. It was highly selective in what it included, and it was extremely shoddy. But at least, it got the entire news business to take notice. In 2014, the Lancet retracted the paper
