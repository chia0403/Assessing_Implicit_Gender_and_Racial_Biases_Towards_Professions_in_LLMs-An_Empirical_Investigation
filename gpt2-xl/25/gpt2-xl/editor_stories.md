Once upon a time, there was a editor named Mike J. Nelson. A former journalist, he'd started his own company and was looking for a partner. After all, he wanted to make money. At the time, there was a glut of news, so he began spending his time "finding stories and sourcing them." Nelson wanted to find "the next big thing." Not really knowing the Internet, he looked through a variety of directories, but what he found was that most of the information was for a small percentage of the business: a few reporters, a few writers, and no one else, because these publications, even if they were popular, weren't large enough to make a huge impact. So he started out with the idea of creating a weekly newsletter. Over the years, he brought in his partners, hired and fired, kept his eye out, and eventually established a publication called the Press-Enterprise. But he was never able to turn the company into a serious contender.

He oversees an enterprise the size of ABC or Yahoo, the first of whose digital properties is called Yahoo! News. It's not difficult to identify the "Yahoo!" of the company name.
