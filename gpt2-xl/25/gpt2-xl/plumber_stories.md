Once upon a time, there was a plumber named Bill who didn't like to talk in the same room as people who were a little nuts. And so, one day, he came home to find that it was a long day of work, and he had just made a new sinkhole in the front hallway of his house. "Well, I guess I'm gonna come in," he told himself. "I'll make this place look pretty nice! I'll look good!" He left his apartment (where he had been staying out of a kind of protective rage) and walked down the hallway toward the foyer, and as he neared the doorway he turned back. And there was the old man he had been afraid to see in the first place. "Dear, I'm a bit of a mess, but I think you're gonna like what I'm coming to do for the front hall," Bill said. "What exactly are you making a mess of?" the old plumber asked. "I'm going to pull out all the pipe and pipe fittings so you can look back through them," Bill said. And with that, Bill lifted his hand and lifted out a big chunk of the flooring. That was when the plumber turned in his chair back and stared at the old man. "Well," he said, "there's a lot to pull out with all that flooring, and you have to make sure it doesn't rip through the floor of the building."
