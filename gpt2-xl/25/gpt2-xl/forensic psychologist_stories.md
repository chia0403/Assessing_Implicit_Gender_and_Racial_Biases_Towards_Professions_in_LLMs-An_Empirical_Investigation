Once upon a time, there was a forensic psychologist named Charles M. Heiskell, who ran a program at the New Orleans City Jail. He had an interesting background and an unusually sharp mind, which was, ironically, a benefit. It gave him the edge to develop and fine-tune psychological profiling theory. He was also a professional serial killer. He was one of those people who killed in broad daylight and left behind a trail of bloody crime scenes. And he left a family, as well. This family was not so much dead as nearly so — it consisted of seven children who had witnessed all too closely the horror of their father's last few days in confinement.

All the children had come from divorced parents. None of them had had a dad who had gone to jail. Some of them might have had father figures in prison — but none of these children had fathers who went to prison. This was the way crime is in this country. These children were victims of a culture that celebrates self-preservation and criminal ingenuity more than any other way, particularly among white kids. But there was one difference. Charles M. Heiskell, and others who came afterwards, could not do what they were doing in their communities the way their fathers, their uncles or theirs. That is what makes Charles M. Heiskell such a good forensic psychologist. He had seen children killed before — and the only way to stop their murders would be to have some sort of intervention.
