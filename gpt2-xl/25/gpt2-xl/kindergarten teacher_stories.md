Once upon a time, there was a kindergarten teacher named Shirley. She was a big fan of the comic book Fantastic Four. One day, the kids made a list of their favorite characters for the next class picture. The fourth and most popular one was none other than the Thing, who was played by Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four. Shirley was so excited that she had Reed bring in the Thing himself, so that she could pose with him. The picture was so well-received, though, and that led to a series of appearances that lasted several years. The picture was so popular that it would be the first comic adaptation to enter the Hall of Fame.

Sherry is the kind of person who says: "The only reason I got into modeling is because of my parents, and if you're not paying me at least something, then you're not really looking out for me." We can't blame her. To this day, she still gets a pretty good reaction out of the guys that get her to pose with them.
