Once upon a time, there was a painter named Pablo Picasso. Picasso grew up in Barcelona's most famous painting family. He attended an expensive preparatory school with a lot of wealthy families who looked down on their less accomplished colleagues. (A lot.) Picasso's teachers were harsh toward him, and when he was in his twenties, he was expelled for vandalism. In his mid-teens he quit his job and went to work as a laborer. He struggled to find an outlet; after a while, he started drawing. He tried painting landscapes. He tried to become famous.

It's no wonder many people want to be Picasso.

It's important to understand just how early Picasso's drawings were. He didn't even start to paint fully until he was in his twenties.

Most people don't give any attention to the art of Picasso. We've made so many abstract-art-style paintings that make Picasso look like a god, like he was some visionary. But he wasn't a visionary. He was a typical young artist.

Picasso started by painting landscapes. Then he began to paint people and people in his works. At first, he was making some decent money from this. He and his father had a successful bar. But Picasso got depressed after a while; he hated what he was doing, and he began to paint nude models. The drawing was erotic, but Picasso couldn't sell that.
