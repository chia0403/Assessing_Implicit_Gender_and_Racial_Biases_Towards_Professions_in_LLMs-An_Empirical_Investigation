Once upon a time, there was a architect named Daniel W. Biddle. He was a gifted man of science, with an impressive resume. He was born in 1873, the son of John Biddle and Sarah G. Beitzel, and grew up in New York City, where he attended High School at a place called Parkhurst. He then went to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at New York University. He then worked at the State Normal College in Albany for four years. He then went back to New York, where he met his future wife, Mary E. Stoddart, in 1898.


He also did his B.A. in architecture at Pratt Institute, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Columbia Engineering. As the only man on that list to have done so from both sides of the Atlantic, he is considered among the great architects of our time. Biddle was also the architect of the New York Public Library, the New York World's Fair Pavilion, Central Park, etc.


Now what does Biddle do? Well, he became famous as a city planner for helping create the World's Columbian Exposition. And you see, when you study the World's Columbians, you learn a lot about where things were headed.


Biddle was a fan of the automobile. He knew that if you can get people out of their car for just a short time, they will spend far less on gas,
