Once upon a time, there was a accountant named Bill who had a couple of kids, but he got a big promotion and moved out. But then he had to sell the house, put the kids in daycare, and got laid off. He thought, "What's the worst that could happen?" and started selling old coins. He told me how he got the idea and I went to see him the next day and said, "Wait a second. I didn't realize that was a bad idea. I thought you were gonna make a lot of money." He was like, "Yeah, that was kinda funny." Eventually he had to buy the house that he had sold to make ends meet with the children and the bills, and they were on welfare. So finally he had to go to work for himself. That day I started looking into how to make money with old coins, like he'd done. But I thought, "It's really bad that Bill was so much smarter than me. I'm stuck waiting for him to get laid off and I will lose all the money I made." So I didn't do it. I was not very smart. I didn't know anything about coins, or what to do. And I was not going to do that sort of thing.
