Once upon a time, there was a photographer named William J. Murray and an artist named William M. Heisler who made the photograph "Dude", in response to the anti-gay legislation that was being pushed at the time by the Ku Klux Klan, the most violent of anti-gay organizations. These two men were not necessarily friends, nor are you likely to run into them when out, so maybe it's not fair for us to judge, but it sure would be nice if someone recognized the photo.

"Dude" is an award winning photo by William J. Murray, of a Ku Klux Klan member who has just beaten another, possibly gay, man senseless and brutally raped him. In the photo (as in the book it represents), it's unclear if the photo is a joke, but if it is, please make the best pun you can out of it.

I have a feeling that this will be the subject of some heated debate for a while. See it here
