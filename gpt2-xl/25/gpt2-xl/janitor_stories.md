Once upon a time, there was a janitor named Bob who worked at this shop. One day, when Bob was just a little kid, he decided, "Hey, I like to be a big hero. I'm a superhero!" But then his parents called in the neighbors for protection.

Now, instead of chasing people with his shield, Bob was playing with his friends. But instead of going after the villains, he was making fun of them. And then a bully in the lunchroom gave him a shove and Bob fell down — hard. Now he could not stand again, and his friends were embarrassed.

The janitor went home, but when it was time to pick up his garbage for the day, Bob refused to pick it up. He said he did not want to be a hero anymore. His family went to the police — and, in a big blow to the janitor's pride, they found out that he had been telling lies.

However, the cops kept insisting that Bob was going to take part in a "superhero story." So the family and neighbors came to the realization that Bob had been lying.

Bob could not stand up again and his friends tried to discourage him. They thought maybe, they said, he could stand a little longer and not fall.

But when they saw the real Bob trying to stand up, the bully lost it. He hit him with a punch, sent the boy tumbling down the stairs
