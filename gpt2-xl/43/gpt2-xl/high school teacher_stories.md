Once upon a time, there was a high school teacher named Mr. Jones, who loved football, especially in cold weather. So Mr. Jones used his influence in the community to form a high school football league, which eventually produced some of the top players in the area. One was Larry, whose brother was also named Larry and like him went on to play for the team.


The other players on the team were called the "Joneses." Mr. Jones' son, Larry Junior, was on the team and he had an especially hard time with losing. When his team lost another football game, Mr. Junior started to get very upset. That is when his father got the idea to call in a miracle. This is what he said: "You remember that girl from the bakery in town? She was so sweet. She came in one day and said to me: 'Hey, I've lost my job. Can you pay me to do a miracle?' I told her about the plan and she agreed to do it." "Well," the Miracle Man added, "all Larry Junior had to do was to say the words: 'Lord forgive my enemies, and save me from my enemies.' With this he called up all of the other Joneses and said: 'Go ahead, boys. Do your part.' After a few seconds he said: 'Well, the plan was successful. And to think, I never thought of this before, but we've already won the championship.'
