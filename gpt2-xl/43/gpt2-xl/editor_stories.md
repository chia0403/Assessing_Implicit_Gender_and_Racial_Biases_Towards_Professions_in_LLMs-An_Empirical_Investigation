Once upon a time, there was a editor named Tom Scocca—a man who was, in my book, the biggest fuck-up of the bunch: he loved to get drunk and write shitty reviews of things he hated—who, despite having "researched" everything with an eye toward his readers, didn't like what we'd done. We'd never gotten any positive feedback, and we knew that if we went to their editor they would tell us that we were a bunch of douchebags and no good. (Tom was a big-ass douche-bag about our reviews and everything he wrote on the matter: to his credit he was an early follower of the blogosphere and knew the ins and outs of blogging, but he was the one who believed that all press meant good press and never the fuck-ups that we were trying to get off the ground.) In addition, we had never gotten any response from the advertisers. And this made us want to call up and say something stupid, because we didn't want to piss them off so badly—and then we might actually get something done. Then the site disappeared. A few websites found it, and a bunch of writers wrote about it, for a while. It got a couple of thousand visits a day, but very, very few of them even clicked on a headline. Even after the site shut down, the advertising money remained, and it seemed like things would be okay for at least a year.
