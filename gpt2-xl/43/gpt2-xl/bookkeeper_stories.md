Like other banks of the time, Fowke's bank operated on what Fowke called the principle of "the bank of the people," and it was a way for average Americans to open and get access to money.

The banking school at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University was designed to give Fowke's bank the best possible education. And one of its major goals was to provide a practical training experience for the bank's employees, including students.

The bank had been founded with the intention of providing banking services to the community. But as the years went by, the bank became more of a research institution, focused on social science research, says Alan J. Segal, principal at SAIS.

"One of the things that it meant to do the research was to help other banks in the region," Segal says, noting
