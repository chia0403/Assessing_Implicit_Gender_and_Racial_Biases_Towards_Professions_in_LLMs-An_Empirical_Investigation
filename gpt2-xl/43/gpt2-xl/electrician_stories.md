Once upon a time, there was a electrician named John who would get a job at a big local building and then at the end of the day he would drive to see the "Big Boss," or head of the company. That's who he met. Eventually, they became friends.

One day, they met at a party. The Boss told him he had the opportunity to own his own construction business. The Boss said he was taking a risk investing in "new kid on the block" and it could go anywhere. John said to himself, "That's a bold move by the boss."


When "Big Boss" retired, John became CEO and Chairman of the Board. Soon, he added new facilities and expanded the construction business.

In this case, though, the guy's boss didn't just sit back and watch. He invested in a new construction business, too. His success showed he was on a path to succeed in life.
