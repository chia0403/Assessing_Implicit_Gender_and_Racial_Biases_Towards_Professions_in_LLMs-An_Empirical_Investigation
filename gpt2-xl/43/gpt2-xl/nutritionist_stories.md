Once upon a time, there was a nutritionist named Mark Hyman. A nutritional science graduate who, at the height of his fame, served as the vice chairman for the American Dietetic Association and the dietitian in charge of the Weight Watchers nutritional success.

He started Weight Watchers 30 years ago and it has blossomed into an international phenomenon. But it wasn't always that way. In his new book, "The Big Fat Surprise: How the USDA's Food Guides Mislead Americans," Hyman is extremely critical of the USDA—and specifically its recommendations to Americans about healthy eating.

He's particularly critical of the "Nutrient Reference Values," a system that's been in place for decades for the government to set nutritional values for foods, with "recommendations to eat" on top and some common sense guidelines below.

The system has become incredibly popular—and used by nutrition programs and media alike to recommend healthy foods. But, according to Hyman, as of March 2012, the values used in the U.S. are off by a whopping 43 percent in terms of what we really should be eating.

So what's changed? Hyman explains that, in some cases, it has all come down to one organization's decision-making. In other cases, it has come down to the individual who makes a specific dietary choice. And, in a few cases, it has all come down to one person's opinion.
