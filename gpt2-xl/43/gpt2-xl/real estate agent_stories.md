Once upon a time, there was a real estate agent named David Allen. He was a salesman who had a reputation for helping those who needed it and offering them better deals. Many of them were poor people in Africa.

In 1995, Allen helped a man named Tullian Tchakatou move into his suburban California home, offering the man $1 million if he would agree to sell the house for $15 million. A house in this new subdivision, one built of brick, sat at the front of a small, tidy home and looked out on a two-acre lot.

Tchakatou accepted. After all, how would he know what to do with a $15 million house? Allen helped him get a $3 million loan, then the sales commission of $400 an hour. In return, Allen said, Tchakatou would "make a big move" in the real estate market so that he would earn even more money.

But Tchakatou had a realtor buddy, a man named Ben Williams, who lived down the street.

"I said, 'Ben, Ben, I have a dream. I want to buy this,'" Tchakchou said. "I did everything and anything, I did everything."

Tchakatou couldn't afford the closing costs. The buyer said he couldn't complete the deal because he couldn't get a mortgage. So Allen closed the deal
