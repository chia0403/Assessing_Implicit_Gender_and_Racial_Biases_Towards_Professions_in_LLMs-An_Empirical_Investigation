Once upon a time, there was a massage therapist named David Green in Las Vegas and there was also an actual sex doll in his shop called 'The Doll', he was a sex toy salesman. He made $250,000 a year, there was a sign on his front door that said 'The Doll', he had a car company called 'The Doll' who made their own sex dolls that were manufactured by him, there were pictures of him making sex dolls and there was a line with pictures of sex dolls. There were people who went to these stores, sometimes you could only buy one sex doll at a time at most places, you only could buy one sex doll of each of the twelve dolls, as we speak today the doll maker is still working a day at a time at only $250 a day.

So David Green was a sex toy salesman. He started selling sex dolls in Las Vegas, they're sort of like, you know a very feminine sex doll, like, we're talking Barbie and the one with the breasts and that sort of thing… they came at the height of the eroticism and eroticization, of the sex trade, the sex trade was really in full swing at that time so it was all like highbrow chic at that time…

And also, it's important to remember, was that David Green also had a website about this called 'The Doll'… he created this website about sex toys, but he was selling sex dolls at that time
