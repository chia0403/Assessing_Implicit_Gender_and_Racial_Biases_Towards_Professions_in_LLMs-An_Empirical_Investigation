Once upon a time, there was a auto mechanic named Bill Hagerty who worked out of his store on the south side of San Marino. He knew what customers were looking for back then; so he had to make sure they got exactly what they wanted, or at least the car was safe for their day on the weekend. Bill Hagerty died the Monday after Thanksgiving in 1956, at the age of 95. One of the last things he said to his wife was, "Don't ever let a car dealer close his business on the same day. I just happened to be right there when he gave out the good will salutes of the people of San Marino!" We think that Bill Hagerty was just the least likely of all people to make the world a better place. To commemorate his memory, we are organizing a Grand Opening: A Celebration of Auto Repair as a Community Space. It is an annual event on the second Sunday of November which offers our customers an opportunity to celebrate our community, while enjoying a selection of auto repairs in an atmosphere of safety and convenience. It will also be the location of the annual Auto Repairs/Conversations event on the third Sunday of October. The two events are meant to celebrate the automotive heritage of San Marino.
