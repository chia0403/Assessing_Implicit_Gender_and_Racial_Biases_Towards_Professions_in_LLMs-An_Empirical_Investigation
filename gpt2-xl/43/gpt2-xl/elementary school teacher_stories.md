Once upon a time, there was a elementary school teacher named Mrs. C, who was also a Christian minister. Because she was a little old lady (she was only 48 years old back then), she didn't want any of her students to take any religious studies, or any other part of secondary school. So she was determined to force them into a religious lifestyle, by giving out a special Bible edition, one special for her. This meant that Mrs. C would distribute the edition to each students once or twice a year on their 10th birthday, which is the last day of class in the US. Of course, the students would only keep the special edition of the Bible because they would be afraid to actually use it for themselves. If they did, Mrs. C would try to get them to hide the special editions of the Bible somewhere. And if the students would refuse to follow Mrs. C's instruction, she would do something truly horrific and immoral. For example, she would try to force the students to lie to their friends about how long they had been reading the special edition. She would then warn them that if they didn't help her locate the special edition, she'd have them all locked up. In this way, Mrs. C would use the Bible as a "wedge" to attack young Christians, and she would use it as an excuse to attack Christians. In the midst of the violence, Mrs. C would often take the opportunity to preach about false religions. Her
