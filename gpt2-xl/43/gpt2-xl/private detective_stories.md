Once upon a time, there was a private detective named Jack, who had a great deal of fun. He, like other detectives of his age, liked to write down every detail of the case. Unfortunately, he also started recording the people who would come up to him, so you know what it's like that people stop you as you walk down the street every morning. Jack would walk past some store called the Lighthouse and watch as a young woman named Amy would come up to him. One day she said she wanted to see him. Jack told her it was time, that he would meet her there. Amy left. Jack came back in a short while and said that Amy had just gone back out, so he went back out to meet her again. This time, that was the last time he'd see her. Jack went to a pub. At first, he had no idea what was going on, but then he saw a man named Bob there...the only other person there besides you.

So, Jack has your number. Now, here's what happens next.

What happens when your friend wants to meet up with you is that there is a certain amount of information that needs to be gathered about where you've been, who you've seen, and what you think happened. If you've got a very good friend, you may even talk to your friend before they pick you up! With a poor friend, you probably won't even let them come close--
