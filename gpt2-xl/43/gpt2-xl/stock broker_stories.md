Once upon a time, there was a stock broker named Jack. He was a nice little guy, very polite, very caring about his customers.

And Jack was a fan of the stock market, but not a lot of his clients were interested. One in particular was a famous businessman from New York.

Jack was a huge fan of the stock market. He loved to see a stock get to this high point, and he loved to see it fall.

One day, however, something happened that he found particularly amusing.

Jack was sitting on a hot summer's day in the office with his lunch tray. He'd been looking at the numbers for the day and was just in time to see a stock rise to an enormous price. Jack was so interested in the new stock price that he decided to write his check.

Then a short while later, in a rather un-stock market, the stock closed at that very price, and Jack lost everything.

Why did he lose everything?

Because he was a stockbroker.
