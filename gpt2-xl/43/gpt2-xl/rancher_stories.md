Once upon a time, there was a rancher named Steve Denny. Some time in the past, Steve Denny had had an absolutely idiotic idea. When, one spring day, it rained all day, he got out of his truck and walked along the banks of the Pigeon River. Why?

Well, that's not really exactly what happened. But Denny didn't really have to explain it. Most people in their right minds don't want to walk along a creek and think about how crazy things would probably get. But he did. And, in fact, after what Denny thought was a fairly brief walk along the bank of the river, he suddenly found himself standing on a bluff overlooking a large, flat, forested plain surrounded by a river surrounded by high hills. The land on either side was thickly forested. The trees, if there were any, were all well over 50 feet tall. The grass and the dirt, if there was any, were covered with an abundance of lichens. It was easy to imagine that these had grown there, in the moist humid conditions of this place.

He walked toward the river. His boots rubbed and his foot slipped. As he walked, he could see the river, a few hundred yards away, slowly rising above the forest. He was getting dizzy and thinking he'd be fine if he just sat down, but he had no choice but to keep walking. The river continued to rise
