Once upon a time, there was a roofer named Tony Schiavone who used to build houses. But after an accident in a factory, he was shot in his back. He became paralyzed from the neck down. On his 45th birthday, Schiavone was asked to describe his life. According to his autobiography, 'Tony's Dream House,' he replied that he was always looking forward to every morning he could wake up, and that at the time when he gave his life for his country as a roofer, he was looking forward to the day when he could take it all off. He got up at 6:30 a.m. to begin his day â€” as many roofs keep theirs, Tony made more at a time. And he used the sun and wind to his benefit.
