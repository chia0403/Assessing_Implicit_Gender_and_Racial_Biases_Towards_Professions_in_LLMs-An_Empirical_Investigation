Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Paul Smith, who thought that the best way to save time on the airplane was by having passengers stand up. He didn't have much success because, while other airlines offered standing-room only tickets, American did not. He spent a great deal of time traveling around the country advocating for standing-room seating, and a few years later persuaded the airline to offer standing class, as well as an option to purchase extra leg room. When the airline finally agreed, a number of passengers protested. They argued that if everyone stood up, there would be less room for those at the back of the airplane, that sitting at the back was more comfortable, and that having so many people sitting next to one another in a cramped airplane was downright dangerous. American was finally forced to change its seat arrangements, with some passengers still objecting, and it still had to pay a fine for discriminating against seated passengers by offering them leg room on every flight. (The airline has since eliminated leg room for all flight crew and on its coach service).

So why doesn't everyone have standing on the entire commercial flight to see the Northern Lights? Probably because it's not as glamorous as flying to the north pole, but there are several advantages to enjoying the beautiful northern Lights from an airplane, especially if you live on top of the Earth or somewhere in the polar regions. First and foremost, it's quick. As you can see in this photo, a round-trip
