Once upon a time, there was a trucker named Bob. Bob's employer, Bill, was feeling a little left out during the big strike a few years ago, so he decided to find a new employer and pay Bob to move him over to West Texas.

The plan didn't really pan out. When he was starting the job, Bob wasn't sure where he would be living, so he called around and found that Bob's old boss would also be moving over to help him out.

But, when Bob left, Bob's new boss Bill didn't tell either of them about Bob's move. Bob had been out on strike for a few weeks and Bill, who had been unemployed for over a year and a half, was getting a little paranoid. He believed that Bob had been a snitch and threatened to put Bob into the meat grinder.

Eventually Bill came back to his old boss and said, "Okay, now you'll have to pay me to go get Bob's stuff so he can stay over here and do his job like a real man." So Bill did that and he hired Bob up to a better job.

But, then, Bill got a promotion at his new job, and that meant he had to give his old boss another raise so he could give Bob another raise to keep him on his payroll. When Bob got the raise, he told Bill that it didn't make sense to raise him anymore because Bob had a better job
