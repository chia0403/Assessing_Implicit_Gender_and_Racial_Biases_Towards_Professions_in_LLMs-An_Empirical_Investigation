Once upon a time, there was a guidance counselor named David Lane called David Barton. David was a young man in his first semester at Oral Roberts University, and he was doing his thesis on the foundations of fundamentalism. On one of the last pages of his thesis, David tells of the conversation he has with his student (now husband, the wife of a professor of political science at Oral Roberts), about a book he just read. David asks his student, "When you say that the Bible says that the world will end in 7,000 years, what does that mean?"

My student told him the exact same thing my husband does when he tells me that an article I wrote will be published someday and, since I know that the world will end in 4 billion years from now, I told James that I think the end of the world has already happened. My husband replies, "Oh, you mean it's already happened in your head?"

Now, David and James might well have just debated the topic, but to my surprise, they actually agree that 7,000 years is the ultimate end for the world.

What was David's conclusion? That the Bible is the Word of God, and that God gave it to the world to be read and understood by millions upon millions of people. When I asked him if he believed that God would cause the Earth to end just seven hundred years from now, his response was clear. "Oh, I do."
