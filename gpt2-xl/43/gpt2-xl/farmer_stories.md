Once upon a time, there was a farmer named George (Bob) Smith. He lived on a small, sandy plot called Waddell, an hour east of Chicago. He lived by the water, farmed his acreage, and loved his animals, and his horses, and his chickens, and his goats--and, above all, he loved his mule. The word for this animal in English is "duck." Bob's mule, however, was a different animal. Bob's mule was a white stallion. It is very difficult to get a sense of the story of George Smith simply by reading the title of this book, because so little of it is told with any sense of immediacy, and with any immediacy that is even possible to a modern reader. This fact suggests--a few readers may not want to know this at all--that the book is a bit of an afterthought on the part of its author, Frank Gaffney, who has become involved with the more interesting causes and issues of the day and had better things to do with his considerable free time. (After all, how many good ideas do we have today? What was most threatening to our well-being forty years ago and is now practically irrelevant? What is the most exciting new idea that many people have, yet no one takes on? All of these, we are told by the author, are important for a free society and a free society must protect itself from them.)
