Once upon a time, there was a logger named "H.R.H.", who was also a former teacher at a local school of science. He had a special set of binoculars that he used to watch the birds that inhabited his village. One day, while watching a bird eating seedpods as birds traditionally did, H.R.H. suddenly knew that bird had the most striking plumage in the locality and was in possession of, as it were, an "army". He became fascinated by the bird, became a little jealous of it and later on, he became its rival, chasing it to the limit of its endurance, until, in time, the bird was finally killed by H.R.H., who made it a trophy of his own. However, what he didn't realise, was that the birds which he had been able to see so clearly had not been killed by him, but had been killed by other birds.
